Code, \u00a7 187) with a special circumstance (Pen. Code, \u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(17)), and robbery (Pen. Code, \u00a7 211). He was sentenced to a term of life in state prison without the possibility of parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b1403-11\">In this appeal he claims that the admission of the preliminary hearing testimony of a prosecution witness following the prosecutor\u2019s refusal to grant the witness immunity at trial constituted prosecutorial misconduct and resulted in a denial of his rights to confrontation and due process. He argues that the prosecutor committed additional acts of misconduct by relying on inadmissible evidence of his silence to prove guilt in violation of his privilege against self-incrimination. He also objects to the trial court\u2019s instruction on unjoined perpetrators.</p>\n<p id=\"b1403-12\">We conclude that the prosecutor did not deny defendant the right of confrontation by refusing to grant immunity to a witness who testified at the preliminary hearing but was subsequently charged with murder. We conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s reference in closing argument to defendant\u2019s postarrest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1540\">*1540</page-number>silence in discussions with a friend was misconduct, but was not prejudicial to the defense. We find that no other prosecutorial misconduct was committed, and defendant\u2019s trial counsel did not afford him inadequate representation. No instructional error occurred. We therefore affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1404-4\">STATEMENT OF FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1404-5\">The victim, Jacque Smith, was killed around 1:00 p.m. on August 22, 2005, at 12th Street and Maine Avenue in the Coronado Santa Fe area of Richmond. He suffered eight gunshot wounds, along with multiple fractures and abrasions \u201call over his body.\u201d His injuries were consistent with \u201cbeing run over\u201d and \u201cdragged along\u201d the pavement by a car, shot, and \u201cpistol-whipped.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1404-6\">The primary testimony that implicated defendant in the murder of Smith came from Torry Buchanan, who, according to at least one account, had been involved for months in an intimate relationship with the victim. Shira Dennis, a close friend of the victim, testified that Smith was openly bisexual, but Buchanan was not, and \u201cdidn\u2019t want anybody to know\u201d of his sexual relationship with the victim. According to Dennis, Smith and Buchanan lived together briefly in an apartment in Benicia, and acted as \u201cboyfriend and boyfriend.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1404-7\">Not long before the murder, however, Smith became \u201cupset\u201d with Buchanan and did not trust him after his money and some items, including a television, were appropriated and \u201ctaken out of the house.\u201d Dennis testified that Smith was \u201ctired of Buchanan stealing from him,\u201d and was in the process of breaking off their relationship. Smith recently moved to Stockton, and Dennis believed that he did not want Buchanan to know the location of his new residence. Smith was also fearful of Buchanan. Before the murder Smith received a message from someone who warned him Buchanan intended to rob and kill him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1404-8\">At defendant\u2019s preliminary hearing, Buchanan testified after receiving use immunity from the prosecution. This testimony was later presented at defendant\u2019s trial. In Buchanan\u2019s preliminary hearing testimony, he denied that he had sexual relations with Smith. In fact, Buchanan acknowledged that he warned the victim he would \u201cbeat his ass\u201d if Smith \u201ckept telling people\u201d they had a \u201chomosexual relationship.\u201d Buchanan testified that he maintained a friendship with Smith to \u201cplay him\u201d and \u201cget as much\u201d as he could from the victim. According to Buchanan, Smith bought him clothes and gave him money, and on one occasion provided him with bail in the amount of $45,000 to obtain his release from jail. Smith subsequently threatened to rescind the bond he had posted, which caused Buchanan concern that his bail would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1541\">*1541</page-number>revoked. Buchanan further acknowledged that shortly before Smith\u2019s death, the decedent accused Buchanan of \u201cstealing money from him.\u201d Buchanan denied that he stole money from Smith, but Smith no longer trusted him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1405-5\">Buchanan testified that two days before the murder occurred, defendant, whom he had known for a couple of years, approached him with a plan to rob Smith. Defendant said he \u201cneeded some money\u201d and \u201cwanted to rob\u201d Smith, who he knew would be in Buchanan\u2019s company. Buchanan said \u201call right,\u201d and they exchanged cell phone numbers to remain in contact to set up the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b1405-6\">About 9:00 on the morning of the murder, Smith drove his navy blue Cadillac to pick up Buchanan in Rodeo. After they stopped for food in Hercules, Buchanan began to drive. He drove the car to Oakland where they \u201cpurchased some weed.\u201d Buchanan used Smith\u2019s cell phone to call defendant to report to him that they were on the way to 12th Street in Richmond. During one call defendant told Buchanan that he had a gun.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Buchanan ultimately drove the victim\u2019s Cadillac to Richmond, where he parked as arranged with defendant at 12th Street and Florida Avenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1405-7\">Defendant approached the car with a gun in his hand and ordered Buchanan to drive around the comer to 13th Street and Maine Avenue. Buchanan did so, and parked the car in a lot near the residence of his friend Brenda. Defendant then struck Smith several times with his fist. Buchanan told Smith to call his mother to arrange for her to give him some money so defendant \u201cwouldn\u2019t harm\u201d him. Buchanan heard Smith, on the phone with his mother exclaim, \u201c \u2018Torry trying to rob me.\u2019 \u201d Buchanan yelled to defendant not to kill Smith. After defendant struck Smith, the victim jumped from the car with the cell phone in his hand and \u201cstarted running\u201d away. Defendant chased after Smith as Buchanan left the car and went to Brenda\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b1405-8\">From inside Brenda\u2019s house Buchanan heard the sound of five or six gunshots coming from Marina Way. He asked Brenda to \u201csee what happened.\u201d She went outside for about five minutes, then returned to the house and said that \u201csomebody got killed outside.\u201d Buchanan went back outside and observed defendant as he was walking \u201cback towards the car.\u201d He threw defendant the keys to the Cadillac, then returned to Brenda\u2019s house to ask her to call a cab for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1405-9\">Buchanan insisted that he did not want Smith killed, although he admitted that he willingly participated in the robbery. He also testified that defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1542\">*1542</page-number>did not mention to him that he planned to kill Smith. Buchanan did not realize that defendant intended to kill Smith until the victim ran from the car and defendant chased after him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1406-4\">When questioned after the murder, Buchanan lied to the police and claimed that he also had been a victim of the robbery of Smith. Buchanan identified defendant from a photo lineup as the man who robbed and killed Smith. He referred to defendant by the \u201cmoniker of Twin or Twig.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1406-5\">After Buchanan spoke with the police, he talked to defendant on the telephone. Defendant asked \u201cwhy the police came to his house.\u201d Buchanan replied that he had been questioned by the police. Defendant said that he \u201cwas going to surrender himself to the police.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1406-6\">Buchanan acknowledged that he lied in his interviews with the police to protect himself, but claimed that his preliminary hearing testimony was truthful. Before the preliminary hearing, Buchanan was subpoenaed to testify by an investigator for the district attorney\u2019s office. Buchanan expressed to the investigator that he \u201cwas afraid,\u201d and at his request was placed in a hotel room for his safety. He briefly absconded to Nevada, but voluntarily agreed to return to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b1406-7\">Buchanan was not charged with any crimes related to the murder of Smith before the preliminary hearing, and insisted that he has never been \u201cpromised anything\u201d in exchange for his testimony. After the preliminary hearing but before defendant\u2019s trial, Buchanan was charged with felony murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1406-8\">Smith\u2019s mother, Joanne Fountaine, corroborated some of Buchanan\u2019s testimony. She was aware that her son was acquainted with Buchanan. Fountaine had heard Buchanan\u2019s voice over the telephone, and seen his photograph when a bail bondsman visited her house \u201clooking for him.\u201d The day before the murder, she also heard Smith tell Buchanan, \u201c \u2018You better give me my money. I want my money.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1406-9\">On the day of the murder, Fountaine loaned Smith her cell phone. Around 1:00 p.m., Smith called her on the cell phone, crying, and \u201csaid, \u2018Momma, they killing me and beating me.\u2019 \u201d She heard an unidentified voice, not Buchanan\u2019s, order Smith to have his mother bring money. The same voice, which Fountaine identified only as \u201cBlack\u201d and \u201cyoung,\u201d said, \u201c \u2018I\u2019m gonna kill your ass,\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018I\u2019m gonna kill this motherfucker.\u2019 \u201d She also recognized Buchanan\u2019s voice exclaim, \u201c \u2018Korey, don\u2019t kill him\u2019 \u201d a couple of times, before the other man yelled, \u201c \u2018This guy\u2019s gonna run.\u2019 \u201d Fountaine was \u201cpositive\u201d that <em>Buchanan </em>used the name \u201cKorey\u201d to refer to the man beating the victim, although in an interview with an investigator she stated that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1543\">*1543</page-number>heard <em>Smith </em>mention the name \u201cTorry\u201d on the phone. Fountaine then heard \u201ca lot of rattling\u201d sounds, like Smith \u201cwas trying to run away,\u201d before the phone was thrown or dropped.</p>\n<p id=\"b1407-5\">Fountaine immediately called the police, then \u201cwent looking\u201d for Smith\u2019s blue Cadillac. She found her son\u2019s car near a school at the comer of 9th Street and Maine Avenue. The car had \u201cblood all over the driver\u2019s side\u201d and on the wheels.</p>\n<p id=\"b1407-6\">Smith\u2019s body was located on the curb at the comer of 13th Street and Maine Avenue. \u201cLots of blood\u201d was found nearby, and \u201ca tire track\u201d was detected across the body, as though Smith had been mn over by a vehicle. The \u201cblood-stained tread marks\u201d on the asphalt where Smith\u2019s body was found were consistent with the pattern of the Cadillac tires. Expended .44-caliber shell casings were discovered close to the victim and in his clothing. Numerous fingerprints were taken from the Cadillac, but none belonging to defendant were identified.</p>\n<p id=\"b1407-7\">Witnesses who were present near the scene of the murder heard or observed some of the incident, but none of them identified any of the principals. Juan Tmjillo, Wanda Parker, and Crystal DeVaughn were in a house on 13th Street and Maine Avenue the day of the murder.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> They heard screaming outside that sounded like a frightened woman pleading \u201cstop\u201d or \u201clet me go,\u201d and a \u201cmale voice\u201d that sounded angry. A few seconds later a Black person with \u201cdreads\u201d was chased by another, heavier Black person, then numerous gunshots fired in quick succession were heard. The \u201cperson who had the dreads\u201d was then seen lying in the street, twitching, before a blue Cadillac ran over his body and \u201ckept going.\u201d Tmjillo also told the police that he observed a \u201cBlack male,\u201d around \u201c5 foot 9,\u201d walk along Maine Avenue and toss car keys to another person.</p>\n<p id=\"b1407-8\">Raymonde Magnier, who lived on the comer of 13th Street and Maine Avenue, heard shots outside her house. She looked through a window and observed \u201csomething down on the ground,\u201d which was \u201ccovered up,\u201d and a man walking past her house with a \u201cgun in his hand.\u201d He was a \u201cBlack man,\u201d about five feet 10 inches tall, medium build, around 25 years old, wearing dark clothes. She did not identify defendant as the man with the gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b1407-9\">Robert Jones, a landscape contractor \u201cworking at 15th and Florida that day,\u201d observed the shooting from three blocks away. He described the shooter as Black, 18 to 20 years old, with hair that was perhaps two and a half inches <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1544\">*1544</page-number>long and may have been braided, wearing a hooded sweatshirt. The shooter was standing with his arm extended, about five feet from the victim, who was sitting on the ground. The shooter was angry and walked around in a circle after he repeatedly shot the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1408-4\">Brenda Murry lived at her grandmother\u2019s apartment on Marina Way near 13th Street and Maine Avenue when the shooting occurred. Buchanan was a family friend who came to the back door of Murry\u2019s residence on the day of the shooting, and mentioned that he was meeting her cousin there.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> About two or three minutes later, gunshots were fired nearby, followed by police cars \u201cflying down the street.\u201d Murry walked outside a minute or two later. Buchanan asked to use her phone and stayed in the apartment. Murry was only outside for \u201ca couple of seconds\u201d before she returned to the apartment. Buchanan was still inside, on the phone. Buchanan made a total of 23 calls on Murry\u2019s cell phone between 1:03 and 1:24 p.m., the last one to a taxicab company. He then left the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1408-5\">Considerable evidence of cell phone use on the day of the shooting was presented, much of it from Philip Venable, a \u201chigh tech investigator\u201d with the Contra Costa County Sheriff\u2019s Office, who qualified as an expert in cell phone records and call origins. Venable analyzed the records of calls made and received on the day of the murder for cell phones that belonged to defendant, the victim\u2014who had Joanne Fountaine\u2019s phone the day of the murder\u2014and Brenda Murry\u2014whose phone was used by Buchanan. Multiple calls between Buchanan, using Fountaine\u2019s phone in the victim\u2019s possession, and defendant, initiated from both parties, began at 11:52 a.m., with a call from Buchanan in Oakland to defendant in Richmond, followed by a call from defendant to Buchanan one minute later. The calls between the two phones continued thereafter, and culminated in a call from Buchanan to defendant at 12:56 p.m., just before the murder occurred, during which a voice mail message was left. Some of the calls did not go through, others resulted in conversations or voice mail messages that lasted up to nearly three minutes. As time passed, the locations of the two phones, as revealed by the cell sites or towers where the calls originated, grew increasingly close, until the last call was registered \u201cat the same cell site\u201d on Harbour Way in Richmond, which indicated that the two phones were then in very close proximity to each other and to the scene of the murder. At 12:59 p.m., the victim\u2019s phone called Fountaine\u2019s home phone from the same cell site for a duration of just over one minute. Thereafter, no calls were registered between defendant\u2019s phone and the victim\u2019s phone.</p>\n<p id=\"b1408-6\">Of the numerous calls made by Buchanan on Murry\u2019s phone immediately following the murder, seven attempted calls of two seconds or less in duration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1545\">*1545</page-number>were made to defendant\u2019s phone between 1:03 and 1:20 p.m. A connected call of very brief duration was made from defendant\u2019s phone to Murry\u2019s phone at 1:26 p.m. A total of 85 calls were made to the victim\u2019s cell phone after the murder from nearby cell phone sites, but none were answered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1409-5\">Testimony was also received from witnesses who were with defendant on the day of the murder. His girlfriend, Jessica Stitts, recalled that defendant was \u201cvery withdrawn\u201d that day due to the death of a friend. Stitts drove defendant in her car to Fairfield, then to the south side of Richmond. Defendant directed her to drive to 9th Street in Richmond, near the location where the victim\u2019s vehicle was found. She stopped the car, whereupon defendant got out of her car and \u201cinto another car\u201d that \u201cnever moved,\u201d and talked to a friend. Stitts testified that defendant was out of her car for 10 to 15 minutes, although she \u201cwasn\u2019t even paying attention.\u201d He then returned and they drove back to Fairfield.</p>\n<p id=\"b1409-6\">Maritza Vande Voorde, a counselor at Contra Costa College, testified that defendant had a counseling appointment with her around 2:00 p.m. the day of the murder. He missed the appointment, so Voorde called defendant, and he subsequently returned her call. Defendant sounded \u201cupset,\u201d and mentioned that a \u201cfriend of his was shot and killed\u201d the day before.</p>\n<p id=\"b1409-7\">Don Heidary was \u201cvery close\u201d with defendant and his twin brother Karey since they were five years old. He regarded his relationship with defendant as similar to a godparent or uncle. In the days after the murder, Heidary learned that the police were looking for defendant in connection with the crime. Defendant said he had \u201cnothing to hide,\u201d so Heidary advised him to \u201cgo to the police.\u201d Heidary and defendant\u2019s brother Karey then facilitated defendant\u2019s \u201csurrender\u201d to the police on the afternoon of August 25, 2005.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Defendant did not say anything to Heidary about the murder of Smith.</p>\n<p id=\"b1409-8\">Heidary also testified that in numerous recorded telephone conversations during defendant\u2019s incarceration, they discussed some of the details of the case\u2014particularly the nature of the evidence, the prosecution\u2019s witnesses, and defendant\u2019s relationship with Buchanan\u2014but defendant did not refer to the murder or the calls that came to his cell phone from Buchanan. Investigator Daryl Jackson, an investigating officer in the case, interviewed Heidary and reviewed the numerous recorded phone conversations between him and defendant that took place following defendant\u2019s arrest. Heidary disclosed to Jackson that defendant \u201cnever told him of any relationship\u201d with Buchanan, and did not give \u201can explanation\u201d for the cell phone contacts with him on the day of the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1410-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1546\">*1546</page-number>Paul Gaines considered the victim his \u201ccousin,\u201d and was close to him. After the murder of Smith, Gaines was briefly incarcerated for a domestic violence charge that was subsequently dismissed. While he was in jail, he was in the same module with defendant and they were often in contact. On one occasion, in the context of a discussion of the consequences of crimes and incarceration, defendant stated, \u201cI wish I never did what I did to be in here,\u201d and expressed that he was sorry. Defendant also mentioned that he \u201calways kept\u201d a handgun with him in his neighborhood, and had chased someone down in a park with his gun. While Gaines was incarcerated, he was not aware that defendant was associated with Smith\u2019s murder. When Gaines told defendant and other inmates the story of Smith\u2019s murder, however, and mentioned his name, defendant got a strange look on his face and thereafter no longer had any contact with Gaines during their joint incarceration. Gaines learned that defendant was accused of Smith\u2019s murder only after he was released. He then told his cousin Shira Dennis that \u201che was in custody with the guy\u201d who killed Smith.</p>\n<p id=\"b1410-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1410-5\">I. <em>The Admission of Torry Buchanan\u2019s Preliminary Hearing Testimony.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1410-6\">Defendant argues that the trial court abridged his confrontation rights by admitting Buchanan\u2019s preliminary hearing testimony at trial. After Buchanan gave his testimony at the preliminary hearing, the prosecution decided to charge him with the robbery and murder of Smith. The use immunity granted to Buchanan at the preliminary hearing was withdrawn, and he asserted his Fifth Amendment privilege not to testify at trial. Over objection by the defense, the trial court then found that Buchanan was an unavailable witness and admitted his preliminary hearing testimony, which was read to the jury. Defendant complains that the procedure whereby the prosecution granted a witness and codefendant use immunity to procure preliminary hearing testimony, then revoked the immunity to make the witness unavailable at trial, denied him the \u201cright to cross-examine his co-defendant before his jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1410-7\">We begin our analysis with recognition of an unassailable constitutional premise: \u201c \u2018[T]he right of confrontation and cross-examination is an essential and fundamental requirement for the kind of fair trial which is this country\u2019s constitutional goal. Indeed, ... to deprive an accused of the right to cross-examine the witnesses against him is a denial of the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of due process of law.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Brown </em>(2003) 31 Cal.4th 518, 538 [3 Cal.Rptr.3d 145, 73 P.3d 1137].) The \u201cright of confrontation is not absolute, however [citations], \u2018and may, in appropriate cases, bow to accommodate other legitimate interests in the criminal trial process.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Alvarado v. Superior Court </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 1121, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1547\">*1547</page-number>1138-1139 [99 Cal.Rptr.2d 149, 5 P.3d 203]; see also <em>People v. Stritzinger </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 505, 515 [194 Cal.Rptr. 431, 668 P.2d 738]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Harris </em>(1985) 165 Cal.App.3d 1246, 1257 [212 Cal.Rptr. 216].) In particular, the right of confrontation \u201cdoes not preclude the prosecution from proving its case through the prior testimony of a witness who is unavailable at trial, so long as the defendant had the right and the opportunity to cross-examine the witness during the earlier proceeding at which the witness gave this testimony.\u201d <em>(People v. Cudjo </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 585, 618 [25 Cal.Rptr.2d 390, 863 P.2d 635].) \u201c \u2018If a witness is unavailable at trial and has testified at a previous judicial proceeding against the same defendant and was subject to cross-examination by that defendant, the previous testimony may be admitted at trial.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People v. Seijas </em>(2005) 36 Cal.4th 291, 303 [30 Cal.Rptr.3d 493, 114 P.3d 742].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1411-5\">Also indisputable is the principle that a witness, upon proper assertion of the privilege against self-incrimination, is unavailable as a witness at trial. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Duarte </em>(2000) 24 Cal.4th 603, 609-610 [101 Cal.Rptr.2d 701, 12 P.3d 1110].) \u201cEvidence Code section 240, subdivision (a) defines unavailable witnesses as any of five types of witnesses. A witness who is exempted from testifying on the ground of privilege is defined as one type.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>(People v. Williams </em>(2008) 43 Cal.4th 584, 625 [75 Cal.Rptr.3d 691, 181 P.3d 1035].) \u201cA witness who successfully asserts the privilege against self-incrimination is unavailable to testify for these purposes.\u201d <em>(People v. Seijas, supra, </em>36 Cal.4th 291, 303.) Here, Buchanan successfully asserted the privilege at trial. The fact that he did not assert the privilege at the preliminary hearing did not foreclose him from doing so at trial. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 303; <em>People v. Malone </em>(1988) 47 Cal.3d 1, 23 [252 Cal.Rptr. 525, 762 P.2d 1249].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1411-6\">We recognize that \u201c \u2018[t]o be found unavailable on this ground, a witness must not only intend to assert the privilege, but also be entitled to assert it.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Seijas, supra, </em>36 Cal.4th 291, 303.) The witness in the case before us had been charged with murder before trial, and his use immunity had been revoked by the prosecutor. The trial court correctly concluded that Buchanan \u201creasonably apprehended danger if he testified.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 306.) Also indisputable is that Buchanan asserted he would refuse to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1548\">*1548</page-number>testify as to any matter to which he had testified at the preliminary examination. <em>(People v. Farmer </em>(1983) 145 Cal.App.3d 948, 951 [193 Cal.Rptr. 788].) We find, as did the trial court, that Buchanan was entitled to assert the privilege, and defendant does not suggest otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b1412-4\">More difficult issues related to admissibility of Buchanan\u2019s preliminary hearing testimony remain: whether defendant had an adequate opportunity to cross-examine Buchanan at the preliminary hearing; and whether the prosecutor acted improperly by procuring the unavailability of the witness. The facts pertinent to the witness\u2019s assertion of the privilege are essentially undisputed, so we independently review the trial court\u2019s ruling that declared the witness unavailable. <em>(People v. Seijas, supra, </em>36 Cal.4th 291, 303.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1412-5\">A. <em>Defendant\u2019s Opportunity to Cross-examine the Witness.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1412-6\">Defendant objects that he was not given an \u201cadequate opportunity to cross-examine\u201d Buchanan at the preliminary hearing. Under the recognized exception to the rule that a criminal defendant has the right to confront the witnesses against him (U.S. Const., 6th Amend.; Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 15), the testimonial statements of witnesses absent from trial may be \u201c \u2018admitted only where the declarant is unavailable, and only where the defendant has had a prior opportunity to cross-examine.\u2019 [Citations.] Evidence Code section 1291 codifies this traditional exception. [Citation.] When the requirements of Evidence Code section 1291 are met, \u2018admitting former testimony in evidence does not violate a defendant\u2019s right of confrontation under the federal Constitution. [Citations.]\u2019 [Citation.] [f] Evidence Code section 1291, subdivision (a)(2), provides that former testimony is not rendered inadmissible as hearsay if the declarant is \u2018unavailable as a witness,\u2019 and \u2018[t]he party against whom the former testimony is offered was a party to the action or proceeding in which the testimony was given and had the right and opportunity to cross-examine the declarant with an interest and motive similar to that which he has at the hearing.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v.

Seijas, supra, </em>36 Cal.4th 291, 303.) Here, the preliminary hearing and trial proceedings were of the \u201csame type, i.e., criminal, the trial strategy (discredit the witness and claim innocence) was the same; the potential penalty (incarceration) was the same; and the issue and parties were the same.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gonzales, supra, </em>131 Cal.App.4th 767, 775; see also <em>People v. Samayoa </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 795, 850-851 [64 Cal.Rptr.2d 400, 938 P.2d 2].) Our review of Buchanan\u2019s preliminary hearing testimony also reveals that defense counsel undertook a thorough and effective cross-examination of the witness. Buchanan\u2019s numerous prior fabrications, his motives to falsify, and his own potential culpability for the murder, were comprehensively explored at the preliminary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1413-6\">Defendant nevertheless complains that several factors demonstrate the inadequacy of his opportunity to cross-examine Buchanan at the preliminary hearing. First, he points out that the cell phone records so consequential to the prosecution\u2019s effort to substantiate Buchanan\u2019s version of the murder were not available to the defense until after the preliminary hearing. He maintains that without prior discovery of the cell phone records his counsel \u201cwas unable to investigate them before the preliminary examination,\u201d and therefore could not properly cross-examine Buchanan on a matter \u201cwhich constituted almost the sole arguable corroboration of Buchanan\u2019s testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1413-7\">We are not convinced that the cross-examination of Buchanan by the defense at the preliminary hearing was compromised by the lack of prior access to cell phone records. \u201c \u2018[A] defendant\u2019s interest and motive at a second proceeding is not dissimilar to his interest at a first proceeding within the meaning of Evidence Code section 1291, subdivision (a)(2), simply because events occurring after the first proceeding might have led counsel to alter the nature and scope of cross-examination of the witness in certain particulars.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Valencia </em>(2008) 43 Cal.4th 268, 293-294 [74 Cal.Rptr.3d 605, 180 P.3d 351].) At the preliminary hearing the defense was aware that the victim\u2019s cell phone was found in the car after the murder, and on cross-examination defense counsel probed Buchanan\u2019s testimony that he used the victim\u2019s cell phone to contact defendant. Thus, the defense had a reason and at least the opportunity to elicit testimony from Buchanan about the extent of his cell phone conversations with defendant at the preliminary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1550\">*1550</page-number>hearing. We also do not think any cross-examination of Buchanan on the subject of cell phone records by the defense at trial would have resulted in a more successful challenge to the reliability of his testimony.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (See <em>People v. Wilson, supra, </em>36 Cal.4th 309, 345-346.) \u201c \u2018As long as defendant was given the opportunity for effective cross-examination, the statutory requirements were satisfied; the admissibility of this evidence did not depend on whether defendant availed himself fully of that opportunity.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Smith </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 581, 611-612 [134 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 68 P.3d 302].) Further, at trial the defense had the cell phone records, and managed to engage in cross-examination and argument as to their import in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-4\">We also disagree with defendant\u2019s assertion that cross-examination of the witness at trial was necessary to bring out \u201cwhether Buchanan was expecting or being given any benefits in his own case in exchange for his testimony.\u201d The defense had the opportunity to cross-examine Buchanan at the preliminary hearing about any advantage he expected to receive from his testimony at that proceeding. When circumstances changed at trial the defense fully explored the matter of any promise of leniency through the cross-examination of officers at trial. By that stage of the proceedings the prosecution elected not to grant Buchanan immunity, and thus had no reason to offer him leniency. Nothing in the record suggests any sort of preexisting arrangement, either explicit or implicit, between Buchanan and the prosecution. Additionally, defendant does not allude to any evidence of favors offered the witness by the government. Cross-examination of Buchanan at trial about his cooperation with law enforcement would not have significantly altered the jury\u2019s view of his credibility. (See <em>People v. Wilson, supra, </em>36 Cal.4th 309, 345.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-5\">Nor are we receptive to defendant\u2019s claim that \u201cthe jury should have been able to observe Buchanan\u2019s demeanor\u201d at trial, particularly in light of his fabrications to the police and denial of a \u201cgay relationship\u201d with the victim. Live testimony of a witness, which grants the trier of fact an opportunity to observe demeanor, is always preferable to former testimony, but no more so in the present case just because the witness may have falsely denied complicity in the crime or had some form of intimate relationship with the victim. The preference for face-to-face cross-examination at trial has been found to be outweighed by recognized competing interests that warrant dispensing with the right of confrontation under circumstances where the defense had the opportunity to cross-examine the witness at the previous hearing with an interest and motive similar to that which he has at the subsequent hearing. <em>(Ohio v. Roberts </em>(1980) 448 U.S. 56, 63 [65 L.Ed.2d 597, 100 S.Ct. 2531]; <em>People v. Sandoval </em>(2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 1425, 1434 [105 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1551\">*1551</page-number>Cal.Rptr.2d 504].) \u201c[I]t is settled that the preference for live testimony gives way when the witness properly invokes the privilege against self-incrimination and a prior appropriate opportunity for cross-examination existed.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Williams, supra, </em>43 Cal.4th 584, 623; see also <em>People v. Reed </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 217, 225-226 [52 Cal.Rptr.2d 106, 914 P.2d 184].) The inability of the jury to view Buchanan\u2019s demeanor at trial did not negate his status as an unavailable witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1415-5\">B. <em>The Refusal of the Prosecution to Grant the Witness Immunity.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1415-6\">We move to defendant\u2019s contention that the prosecutor committed misconduct by failing to grant Buchanan immunity at trial, and the trial court therefore erred by finding that he was an unavailable witness. He relies on Evidence Code section 240, subdivision (b), to argue that where the unavailability of a witness is procured by the proponent for the purpose of preventing the witness from testifying, the witness is not unavailable. The definitions of an unavailable witness specified in subdivision (a) of Evidence Code section 240, are expressly subject to an exception \u201cprovided in subdivision (b).\u201d Subdivision (b) of Evidence Code section 240 (section 240), provides: \u201cA declarant is not unavailable as a witness if the exemption, preclusion, disqualification, death, inability, or absence of the declarant was brought about by the procurement or wrongdoing of the proponent of his or her statement for the purpose of preventing the declarant from attending or testifying.\u201d Defendant claims that the \u201cprosecutor\u2019s acts of granting, and then withdrawing, immunity\u201d to Buchanan constituted \u201cwrongdoing\u201d that \u201cprocured\u201d the unavailability of the witness. He asserts that the evidence shows the prosecutor \u201cintentionally\u201d withheld immunity from the witness \u201csimply for the purpose of keeping Buchanan unavailable, so he could read Buchanan\u2019s former testimony to the jury. This testimony establishes the purpose prong in [section] 240(b), namely, that the prosecutor withdrew the immunity grant in order to prevent Buchanan from testifying\u201d at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1415-7\">Our inquiry proceeds from the established premise that neither the prosecution nor the trial court was obligated to confer immunity upon Buchanan at trial. The courts have \u201crecognized that the power to confer immunity is granted by statute to the executive, that is, to the prosecution (see [Pen. Code,] \u00a7 1324), and have questioned whether a trial court possesses inherent authority to grant such immunity.\u201d <em>(People v. Stewart </em>(2004) 33 Cal.4th 425, 468 [15 Cal.Rptr.3d 656, 93 P.3d 271].) In fact, the California Supreme Court has definitively declared: \u201cThe grant of immunity is an executive function, and prosecutors are not under a general obligation to provide immunity to witnesses in order to assist a defendant. [Citations.] Similarly, we have expressed reservations concerning claims that trial courts possess inherent authority to grant immunity [citation], and even assuming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1552\">*1552</page-number>the court possesses such authority, it has been recognized only when the defense has made a showing that a <em>defense </em>witness should be afforded immunity in order to provide clearly exculpatory testimony.\u201d <em>(People v. Williams, supra, </em>43 Cal.4th 584, 622-623.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-4\">The federal due process test, which essentially mirrors the California standard delineated in section 240, subdivision (b), also recognizes the \u201c \u2018exclusive authority and absolute discretion\u2019 \u201d vested in the prosecution to grant immunity to a witness, and intrudes upon that discretion only where the prosecution violates the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial by refusing to grant use immunity to a witness whose testimony would have been relevant \u201c \u2018with the deliberate intention of distorting the fact-finding process.\u2019 \u201d <em>(U.S. v. Straub </em>(9th Cir. 2008) 538 F.3d 1147, 1156, italics omitted; see also <em>Williams v. Woodford </em>(9th Cir. 2004) 384 F.3d 567, 600; <em>Woods v. Adams </em>(C.D.Cal. 2009) 631 F.Supp.2d 1261, 1279-1280.) <em>Intentional </em>distortion of the factfinding process requires government action that amounts \u201cto something akin to prosecutorial misconduct.\u201d <em>(U.S. v. Straub, supra, </em>at p. 1157.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-5\">We therefore focus on the prosecutor\u2019s motives for withholding immunity from Buchanan. In so doing, we do not find that the unavailability of the witness was procured by the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct for the wrongful purpose of preventing his testimony at trial. To establish a violation of his confrontation rights through misconduct by the prosecutor that resulted in the deprivation of testimony of a witness, the defendant must establish three elements: first, prosecutorial misconduct that was entirely unnecessary to the proper performance of the prosecutor\u2019s duties and was of such a nature as to transform a defense witness willing to testify into one unwilling to testify; second, the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct was a substantial cause in depriving the defendant of the witness\u2019s testimony; and third, the testimony defendant was unable to present was material to his defense. <em>(People v. Lucas </em>(1995) 12 Cal.4th 415, 457 [48 Cal.Rptr.2d 525, 907 P.2d 373]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Woods </em>(2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 929, 936 [16 Cal.Rptr.3d 174].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-6\">The record before us demonstrates only that the prosecutor elected not to grant Buchanan immunity in the aftermath of his distinctly incriminating testimony at the preliminary hearing. In response to argument by the defense that Buchanan was not unavailable, the prosecutor merely expressed that he was not required to grant the witness immunity and did not intend to do so. Nothing in the record indicates that the prosecutor acted for the improper purpose of intentionally rendering Buchanan an unavailable witness at trial. And in fact, other legitimate reasons are explicable for the prosecutor\u2019s decision to decline to extend Buchanan\u2019s use immunity to testimony at trial. No charges were pending against Buchanan when he testified at the preliminary hearing, and he had previously given false statements to the police that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1553\">*1553</page-number>did not implicate him in the murder.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In light of Buchanan\u2019s conflicting versions of the incident and the lack of any testimony from him before the preliminary hearing, a grant of immunity at that point in the proceedings was at least understandable to obtain some testimony from him. Once Buchanan\u2019s testimony at the preliminary hearing firmly established his own guilt as well as that of defendant, the prosecutor may have justifiably concluded that the witness was no longer a worthy candidate for a grant of immunity. He was then charged with the robbery and murder before defendant\u2019s trial. A reasonable person simply cannot argue that after the testimony at the preliminary hearing, the prosecutor was precluded from charging Buchanan, or, alternatively, awarding him use immunity at trial. Denial of a grant of immunity or leniency to Buchanan in exchange for his testimony at trial was not \u201cwholly unnecessary to the proper performance\u201d of the prosecutor\u2019s duties, but rather was an appropriate tactical decision and exercise of executive discretion. <em>(People v. Woods, supra, </em>120 Cal.App.4th 929, 937-938.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-5\">Also, the record here is devoid of any evidence suggesting to us in any way that threats, intimidation or coercion was exerted upon Buchanan by the prosecution that precluded him from making a free and voluntary choice not to testify. (See <em>Woods v. Adams, supra, </em>631 F.Supp.2d 1261, 1281-1282; <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Straub </em>(6th Cir. 2005) 430 F.3d 281, 287.) The prosecution did not intentionally distort the factfinding process by taking affirmative steps to prevent Buchanan from testifying or grant immunity to other witnesses while denying immunity to him.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>(U.S. v. Whitehead </em>(9th Cir. 2000) 200 F.3d 634, 640, cert. den. <em>sub nom. Whitehead v. United States </em>(2000) 531 U.S. 885 [148 L.Ed.2d 141, 121 S.Ct. 202].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-6\">In the absence of any evidence before us of the prosecutor\u2019s improper motive or other misconduct that resulted in Buchanan\u2019s assertion of his privilege against self-incrimination, we cannot conclude that the prosecutor acted with the specific objective of preventing the witness from testifying within the meaning of section 240, subdivision (b). Nor did the admission of Buchanan\u2019s prior testimony violate defendant\u2019s rights to confrontation and due process. <em>(People v. Woods, supra, </em>120 Cal.App.4th 929, 938-939.) Therefore, Buchanan was an unavailable witness and his preliminary hearing testimony was properly admitted at trial without any statutory or constitutional violation. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Smith, supra, </em>30 Cal.4th 581, 612.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1554\">*1554</page-number>II. <em>The Admission of Evidence That Defendant Failed to Explain the Telephone Contacts with Buchanan.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1418-4\">Defendant also argues that evidence of his \u201cpost-arrest silence\u201d was admitted without objection by his counsel. <em>(Doyle v. Ohio </em>(1976) 426 U.S. 610 [49 L.Ed.2d 91, 96 S.Ct. 2240] <em>(Doyle).) </em>The evidence challenged by defendant is testimony from investigator Daryl Jackson, who interviewed Don Heidary. Jackson also listened to the more than 100 recorded telephone conversations between defendant and Heidary after defendant was arrested. Jackson testified that he discussed with Heidary the incriminating cell phone records of calls between defendant and Buchanan. Heidary stated to Jackson that defendant \u201cnever had an explanation\u201d for the cell phone contacts with Buchanan on the day of the murder, and \u201cnever told him of any relationship\u201d with Buchanan. Jackson asked Heidary about defendant\u2019s relationship and phone contacts with Buchanan to determine if he \u201chad an innocent explanation for some of the facts in this case,\u201d but defendant \u201cnever gave [Heidary] that information.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Defendant claims that the inquiry into his postarrest silence was improper, and his attorney provided ineffective assistance by failing to object to investigator Jackson\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-5\">Defendant forfeited any challenge to the admission of the evidence by failing to object at trial, so we proceed to his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>(People v. Huggins </em>(2006) 38 Cal.4th 175, 198 [41 Cal.Rptr.3d 593, 131 P.3d 995]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hughes </em>(2002) 27 Cal.4th 287, 332 [116 Cal.Rptr.2d 401, 39 P.3d 432].) \u201cThe standards for ineffective assistance of counsel claims are well established. \u2018We presume that counsel rendered adequate assistance and exercised reasonable professional judgment in making significant trial decisions.\u2019 [Citation.] To establish a meritorious claim of ineffective assistance, defendant \u2018must establish either: (1) As a result of counsel\u2019s performance, the prosecution\u2019s case was not subjected to meaningful adversarial testing, in which case there is a presumption that the result is unreliable and prejudice need not be affirmatively shown [citations] or (2) counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness under prevailing professional norms, and there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors and/or omissions, the trial would have resulted in a more favorable outcome.

The mere fact that defendant\u2019s silence was exhibited to a private party rather than in response to police questioning does not necessarily preclude a constitutional violation. \u201c[E]ven outside the context of custodial interrogations, silence remains constitutionally protected if it appears to be an assertion of the right to remain silent.\u201d <em>(People v. Jennings </em>(2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 459, 473, fn. 2 [5 Cal.Rptr.3d 243].) Rather, we must examine \u201cthe circumstances surrounding defendant\u2019s <em>post-Miranda </em>silence. <em>Doyle </em>need not apply to defendant\u2019s silence invoked by a private party absent a showing that such conduct was an assertion of his rights to silence and counsel. [Citation.] On the other hand, when the evidence demonstrates that defendant\u2019s silence in front of a private party results primarily from the conscious exercise of his constitutional rights, then <em>Doyle </em>should apply.\u201d <em>(Eshelman, supra, 225 </em>Cal.App.3d 1513, 1520; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Delgado </em>(1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1837, 1842, fn. 2 [13 Cal.Rptr.2d 703].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-5\">The distinction is demonstrated by two cases. In <em>Eshelman, supra, 225 </em>Cal.App.3d 1513, 1520, after the defendant was released on bail he refused to respond to his girlfriend\u2019s questions, in part expressly because his attorney told him not to speak to the witness before the trial. The court concluded that the defendant\u2019s silence exhibited his \u201creliance on his constitutional rights to silence and counsel,\u201d and thus <em>Doyle </em>error occurred. <em>(Eshelman, supra, </em>at p. 1521.) Importantly, the defendant in <em>Eshelman </em>expressly advised his girlfriend that he could not discuss the case based on legal advice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-6\">In contrast, in <em>People v. Medina </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 870, 889 [274 Cal.Rptr. 849, 799 P.2d 1282], not long \u201cafter defendant\u2019s arrest, his sister . . . visited him in jail,\u201d and asked, \u201c \u2018why did you have to shoot those three poor boys?\u2019 Defendant initially made no response,\u201d but \u201clater indicated he did not wish to talk about the matter.\u201d The \u201crecord failfed] to show that defendant was given <em>Miranda </em>warnings prior to his conversation with his sister.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 890.) The court concluded that \u201cin the context of the present case, where defendant was engaged in conversation with his own sister, it was not unreasonable to permit the jury to draw an adverse inference from his silence in response to her inquiry as to why he shot the victims, [f] The record does not suggest that defendant believed his conversation with his sister was being monitored, or that his silence was intended as an invocation of any constitutional right.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1557\">*1557</page-number><em>(Ibid.) </em>The court added: \u201cWe are not here concerned with, and do not address, the situation in which an in-custody, <em>Mirandized, </em>suspect is confronted with an accusatory statement in circumstances where he may be presumed to suspect the monitoring of his conversation.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 891.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-5\">Without an objection by defense counsel to the admission of investigator Jackson\u2019s testimony, the record in the present case is a bit ambiguous. In contrast to <em>Eshelman, </em>no evidence was adduced that directly reflects upon defendant\u2019s motivation for declining to discuss the case with Heidary. Nothing indicates that in his conversations with Heidary defendant expressed his intent to invoke his constitutional rights, as did the defendant in <em>Eshelman. </em>Heidary and investigator Jackson both merely testified that defendant did not mention any facts related to the case, and specifically did not offer any explanation of his relationship or cell phone contacts with Buchanan. Apparently, these were not topics of conversation. However, the perspective of the conversations suggests that defendant may have at least been aware of his right to silence. He was speaking with Heidary while he was incarcerated, and during their conversations institutional warnings were repeated that \u201ceverything you say here is being recorded.\u201d Although Heidary could not recall if defendant\u2019s attorney advised him \u201cnever to discuss the facts\u201d of the murder, he acknowledged \u201cthat very well could have happened\u201d because he had not \u201cdone that.\u201d While defendant did not adduce explicit evidence that his silence was induced by his counsel\u2019s advice, as did the defendant in <em>Eshelman, </em>the context of defendant\u2019s recorded phone conversations with Heidary are indicative of an exercise of his constitutional rights to silence and counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-6\">Assuming that defendant\u2019s failure to discuss the facts of the case with Heidary was an assertion of his right to remain silent, we must determine if <em>Doyle </em>error was committed. \u201cAn assessment of whether the prosecutor made inappropriate use of defendant\u2019s postarrest silence requires consideration of the context of the prosecutor\u2019s inquiry or argument.\u201d <em>(People v. Champion, supra, </em>134 Cal.App.4th 1440, 1448.) Defendant did not make any statements to the police or testify at trial, so investigator Jackson\u2019s testimony was not offered for impeachment purposes. \u201cBut the principles of <em>Doyle </em>apply even if a defendant does not take the stand in his own defense thereby subjecting himself to potential impeachment. A defendant is entitled to rely on the assurance when he is 'Miranda-ized\u2019 that his silence will not be used against him. The <em>Miranda </em>warnings are deemed to have induced the silence.\u201d <em>(U.S. v. Fambro </em>(5th Cir. 2008) 526 F.3d 836, 841, fns. omitted.) The United States Supreme Court has \u201c \u2018consistently explained <em>Doyle </em>as a case where the government had induced silence by implicitly assuring the defendant that his silence would not be used against him.\u2019 <em>Fletcher v. Weir, </em>455 U. S. 603, 606 [71 L.Ed.2d 490, 102 S.Ct. 1309] (1982) <em>(per curiam). </em>The <em>Miranda </em>warnings had, after all, specifically given the defendant both the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1558\">*1558</page-number>option of speaking and the option of remaining silent\u2014and had then gone on to say that if he chose the former option what he said could be used against him. It is possible to believe that this contained an implicit promise that his choice of the option of silence would <em>not </em>be used against him.\u201d <em>(Portuondo </em>v. <em>Agard </em>(2000) 529 U.S. 61, 74-75 [146 L.Ed.2d 47, 120 S.Ct. 1119].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-4\">The evidence of defendant\u2019s silence during conversations with his friend Heidary was offered to demonstrate that defendant did not discuss an innocent explanation for the incriminating evidence of the cell phone records\u2014or, for that matter, any other facts related to the case\u2014under circumstances in which he may have been expected to do so. During closing argument, the prosecutor mentioned that defendant\u2019s discussions of the case with Heidary, particularly \u201cwhen the preliminary hearing was going on,\u201d presented him the \u201copportunity to explain the evidence\u201d to his \u201cdear friend.\u201d The prosecutor then argued that if the jury found defendant\u2019s \u201c[s]ilence in the face of that\u201d indicated a \u201cconsciousness of guilt,\u201d \u201cit\u2019s something you can consider.\u201d The prosecutor added: \u201cIn the face of an accusation, silence or lies or feigned unawareness can show a consciousness of guilt, [as] it does in this case.\u201d Also, investigator Jackson\u2019s testimony was not presented in an effort to rebut other statements made by defendant or any claim that he was not given the opportunity to explain his failure to discuss the matter. (Cf. <em>U.S. v. Ross </em>(9th Cir. 2005) 149 Fed.Appx. 670, 673; <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Scribner </em>(N.D.Cal. 2008) 619 F.Supp.2d 823, 844; <em>People v. Champion, supra, </em>134 Cal.App.4th 1440, 1451-1452.) Rather, with the investigator\u2019s testimony the prosecutor on his own initiative urged the jury to draw an adverse inference of guilt from defendant\u2019s postarrest silence.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> By drawing attention to the fact that defendant never explained the phone calls to Buchanan or mentioned the other facts of the case to Heidary, the prosecutor violated the precepts of <em>Doyle. </em>(See <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Whitehead, supra, </em>200 F.3d 634, 639; <em>U.S. v. Lopez </em>(9th Cir. 2007) 500 F.3d 840, 845.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-5\">We turn our focus to an examination of the prejudicial impact of the admission of evidence in violation of <em>Doyle, </em>and the prosecutor\u2019s associated misconduct by arguing that defendant\u2019s silence exhibited consciousness of guilt. The test of prejudice is the standard enunciated in <em>Chapman v. California </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 18, 24 [17 L.Ed.2d 705, 87 S.Ct. 824]: we must reverse the judgment unless beyond a reasonable doubt the error complained of did not contribute to the verdict. <em>(U.S. v. Williams </em>(9th Cir. 2006) 435 F.3d 1148, 1163; <em>People </em>v. <em>Waldie </em>(2009) 173 Cal.App.4th 358, 366 [92 Cal.Rptr.3d 688] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1559\">*1559</page-number>(Waldie); <em>People v. Champion, supra, </em>134 Cal.App.4th 1440, 1453.) \u201c \u2018When deciding whether a prosecutor\u2019s reference to a defendant\u2019s post-arrest silence was prejudicial, this court will consider the extent of comments made by the witness, whether an inference of guilt from silence was stressed to the jury, and the extent of other evidence suggesting defendant\u2019s guilt.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(U.S. v. Lopez, supra, </em>500 F.3d 840, 845.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-5\">Testimony and argument that defendant did not mention the facts of the case to Heidary had negligible probative value at best. The admission of investigator Jackson\u2019s testimony that briefly recounted his interviews with Heidary was even less significant, as it was merely cumulative to the much more comprehensive testimony on the same subject by Heidary.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The United States Supreme Court has observed that \u201cIn most circumstances silence is so ambiguous that it is of little probative force.\u201d <em>(United States v. Hale </em>(1975) 422 U.S. 171, 176 [45 L.Ed.2d 99, 95 S.Ct. 2133]; see also <em>Doyle, supra, </em>426 U.S. 610, 617 [silence is often \u201cinsolubly ambiguous\u201d].) \u201c[T]here may be several explanations for the silence that are consistent with an exculpatory explanation or the silence may be nothing more than the arrestee\u2019s exercise of his or her <em>Miranda </em>rights . . . .\u201d <em>(People v. Sutton </em>(1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 795, 799-800 [23 Cal.Rptr.2d 632].) In the present case, investigator Jackson\u2019s testimony was especially vague and unpersuasive as a form of adoptive admission or consciousness of guilt. Defendant was not confronted with any specific accusations or inquiries. Heidary did not ask defendant about the facts of the murder at all. He testified that in his conversations with defendant, they simply did not \u201cbring it up.\u201d We are not evaluating evidence that the jury was likely to consider as incriminating silence in the face of an accusation. Instead, the testimony was that defendant never discussed the case in a setting where his conversations were recorded, and at a time after his attorney advised him \u201cnot to talk about the facts.\u201d No perceptible probative value may be attributed to defendant\u2019s silence where he was not asked about any facts of the case or was otherwise placed in a position where his silence manifested an implied admission of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-6\">The trial court\u2019s instructions did not exacerbate the effect of the error. Quite the opposite is true. The jury was not directed to draw an inference of guilt from defendant\u2019s <em>silence. (People v. Medina, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d 870, 890-891.) The consciousness of guilt instruction advised the jury: <em>\u201cIf </em>you find that before this trial the defendant made a <em>willfully false </em>or <em>deliberately misleading statement </em>concerning the crimes for which he is now being tried, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1560\">*1560</page-number>you may consider that statement as a' circumstance tending to prove a consciousness of guilt.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> (Italics added.) The court also ameliorated the impact of the evidence and misconduct with an instruction that defendant had a constitutional right \u201cnot to be compelled to testify,\u201d and the jury must draw no inference of guilt from his silence to diminish the prosecution\u2019s burden to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt without his testimony. Thus, reliance by the jury on the instructions to consider defendant\u2019s silence for any purpose was extremely unlikely.</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-4\">While the prosecutor committed misconduct by asserting to the jury that defendant\u2019s \u201c[sjilence in the face\u201d of discussions with Heidary could be considered as evidence of guilt, the focus of the prosecutor\u2019s argument of consciousness of guilt was upon defendant\u2019s silence <em>before </em>his arrest, both when speaking to \u201cfamily and friends,\u201d and \u201cin the face of an accusation\u201d from a police officer. The prosecutor further stated that he was not \u201crelying\u201d on defendant\u2019s silence to establish the \u201cwhole case.\u201d The court also gave an instruction that statements made by attorneys during trial are not evidence, and must be disregarded to the extent they conflict with the instructions on the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-5\">Finally, the evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt was formidable, and was not based in the least on his failure to provide an innocent explanation of the charged crimes to Heidary. Identity of the murderer was the only seriously contested issue in the case. Buchanan\u2019s testimony, although inconsistent with his prior statements and laced with confusion, at least convincingly identified defendant as the perpetrator of the murder. Buchanan\u2019s account of the murder, when corroborated with the cell phone records, the physical evidence of the murder scene which indicated that the manner in which the murder occurred matched his description, and to a lesser extent the testimony of other witnesses\u2014particularly the victim\u2019s mother\u2014was credible to establish identity. The defense did not claim an innocent explanation for the cell phone calls to Buchanan. Instead, the defense challenged the credibility of the prosecution\u2019s cell phone record evidence with expert testimony in opposition that sought to dispute the accuracy of the records. Therefore, testimony that defendant failed to explain the cell phone calls did not contradict or damage his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-6\">In view of the argument, instructions, and the totality of the evidence, we conclude that beyond a reasonable doubt the admission of evidence of defendant\u2019s silence and the prosecutor\u2019s improper reference to it in closing argument did not influence the jury verdict. (See <em>U.S. v. Lopez, supra, </em>500 F.3d 840, 846; <em>People v. Delgado </em>(2010) 181 Cal.App.4th 839, 853 [104 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1561\">*1561</page-number>Cal.Rptr.3d 495]; <em>Waldie, supra, </em>173 Cal.App.4th 358, 367.) Therefore, the error was harmless, and we find no prejudicial incompetence of counsel. <em>(People v.
