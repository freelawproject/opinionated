In the published portion of this opinion, we reject defendant\u2019s contention that his constitutional right to confront witnesses, as defined in <em>Crawford v. Washington </em>(2004) 541 U.S. 36 [158 L.Ed.2d 177, 124 S.Ct. 1354] <em>(Crawford), </em>was violated by the admission of the victim\u2019s out-of-court statement identifying defendant as the perpetrator. We hold the victim\u2019s brief informal statement, made on the night of the shooting in an ambulance when the victim was close to death, was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1457\">*1457</page-number>testimonial. Hence, admission of the statement did not contravene defendant\u2019s rights under <em>Crawford.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1321-5\">In the unpublished portion of this opinion, we address defendant\u2019s other assertions of error, including erroneous admission of uncharged misconduct and bad character evidence; a violation of the Doyle<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> rule precluding reference to post-Miranda<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> silence; closing argument references to facts not in evidence; and inadequate cross-examination of a key prosecution witness. We find no reversible error, and accordingly affirm the judgment and deny the habeas corpus petition.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1321-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-7\">About 10:00 p.m. on February 2, 2004, Anthony Marquez was shot in the stomach while he was standing at the bottom of a driveway. After he was shot, Marquez ran to the door of Joanna Oyler\u2019s apartment and collapsed. In a recorded interview with the police on February 19, 2004, Oyler identified defendant and another man (Edward Gordin) as being in a car in the driveway at the time of the shooting. Defendant and Gordin were arrested and charged with premeditated attempted murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-8\">When interviewed by the police, Gordin initially denied involvement in the shooting, telling the police that the \u201cword ... on the street\u201d was that defendant and another man were responsible for the shooting. After the police described facts linking Gordin to the crime, Gordin admitted he was the driver of the car and stated defendant was the shooter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-9\">A police officer who arrived at the scene in response to a 911 call testified he found Marquez lying on the ground in front of an apartment. When the officer asked Marquez what happened, Marquez stated he had been shot. Marquez said he had been standing outside at the entrance to the property when a car pulled up and he was shot. When the officer asked who shot him, Marquez told the officer he was shot by \u201can unknown subject from that vehicle.\u201d A firefighter who accompanied Marquez in the ambulance on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1458\">*1458</page-number>way to the hospital testified that when he asked Marquez who shot him, Marquez responded \u201cJohn Paul\u201d (i.e., defendant).</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-5\">On the eve of trial, Gordin pleaded guilty to attempted murder (without premeditation) and then testified on behalf of the prosecution. Gordin testified he had met defendant \u201con the streets\u201d a couple of weeks before the shooting. Gordin, along with defendant, Marquez, and other people, would \u201chang around\u201d at Oyler\u2019s home to use methamphetamine. Gordin had known Marquez since they were young boys, and their fathers were good friends.</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-6\">Gordin testified that on the night of the shooting, he was at Oyler\u2019s apartment with several other people, and defendant was at the next-door duplex. A stolen Honda was parked at Oyler\u2019s residence. Defendant came to Oyler\u2019s apartment and asked for a ride. Gordin agreed to give him a ride; they got inside the Honda with Gordin in the driver\u2019s seat and defendant in the passenger\u2019s seat. Gordin drove to the bottom of the driveway and stopped, with the car facing the street.</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-7\">While Gordin was waiting for a car to pass before driving onto the street, defendant asked \u201cwho\u2019s that?\u201d Gordin glanced over to the passenger side and saw a shadow of someone walking towards the car, but he could not see who it was because it was dark. Gordin noticed that defendant was \u201cdigging around\u201d in his pockets for something. Gordin turned back and focused his attention on the car coming down the street, and then he heard a gunshot. Gordin saw defendant bring his arm back in through the open car window, and saw that he was holding a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-8\">After shooting the gun, defendant stated, \u201c \u2018I got that fool.\u2019 \u201d Gordin asked \u201c \u2018Who?,\u2019 \u201d and defendant stated \u201cAnthony\u201d (i.e., Marquez). Gordin, feeling angry and panicked, stated \u201c \u2018What the fuck?\u2019 \u201d and rapidly drove off. Defendant responded, \u201c \u2018Sorry, dog, I had to do what I had to do.\u2019 \u201d Gordin wanted to get away from defendant; he drove several blocks away from the scene and then left defendant in the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-9\">Gordin testified he felt angry when defendant told him it was Marquez, because Marquez had never done anything to Gordin and Gordin and Marquez had always been friends. Gordin knew that the people he \u201chung around\u201d with on the streets were saying Marquez was a snitch who had talked to the police about people doing crimes, but Gordin did not believe it. Gordin testified that if you are a snitch, people want to kill you, and the only reason he could think of for defendant to shoot Marquez was because defendant thought Marquez was a snitch.</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1459\">*1459</page-number>Gordin testified he was afraid because he understood that he was now labeled as a snitch and would have a difficult time in prison because of this. He stated defendant\u2019s sister had threatened to \u201cdo something to\u201d his sisters if he \u201csnitched\u201d on defendant, and his family was trying to move to a different location.</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-5\">Oyler testified during the prosecution\u2019s case, but denied or claimed not to remember essentially all of the matters she told the police that implicated Gordin and defendant in the shooting. Accordingly, the prosecutor was allowed to play a recording of her interview with the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-6\">In that interview, Oyler stated that at the time of the shooting she had known Gordin about four to six months and he was her friend, whereas she had known defendant only about two months. Just before the shooting, Oyler was standing inside the screen door of her home smoking a cigarette. She saw Gordin and defendant in a Honda car in the driveway by her house; Gordin was driving and defendant was in the front passenger seat. They drove down the driveway and stopped the car by the street. Oyler then heard a gunshot. Marquez ran to her door, holding his stomach and screaming that he had been shot and to call 911. Oyler heard the Honda speed away. She called 911.</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-7\">Oyler told the police that from her front door she could not fully see the area in the front of the property. Further, she did not see Marquez until he was running towards her apartment after being shot. She also told the police that she thought that at the time of the shooting Marquez was \u201cwalking this way[,] towards [defendant] to the passenger seat,\u201d and so she \u201cguess[ed]\u201d defendant was the shooter. She heard that the shooting occurred because Marquez was a snitch. Oyler stated that she had seen defendant with a gun, apparently on the night of the shooting.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> She did not see Gordin with a gun the night of the shooting, although she saw him with a gun after the shooting (about one week before the police interview).</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-8\">When the police told Oyler that Gordin had been bragging that he was the shooter and asked if Gordin had told her this, Oyler responded yes. Oyler stated that Gordin had told her \u201che had the gun and he shot\u201d Marquez because Marquez was a snitch. Oyler opined that Gordin was saying this because he was afraid; he wanted people to think he was \u201ctough\u201d; and he thought that if he put \u201cthis reputation out there that he\u2019s such a bad ass\u201d then people would leave him alone and be afraid of him. Oyler told the police that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1460\">*1460</page-number>people got shot for \u201ctelling on people\u201d and she did not want to testify. She stated she was not afraid of Gordin and Gordin would not shoot anyone, but she was afraid of defendant because she did not really know him and she heard \u201cbad things\u201d about him and that he would \u201ctake you out in a second.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-5\">A knife was found in the driveway where the shooting occurred, and a knife sheath was found in Marquez\u2019s possession. The officer who found the knife in the driveway testified the knife would have been closer to the driver\u2019s side than the passenger side of a vehicle that was facing the street to exit the driveway. The police assessed that because of a heavy rain that started shortly after the shooting, physical evidence (such as blood) that might have assisted the investigation of the crime was washed away.</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-6\">In addition to evidence concerning the shooting, the prosecutor introduced several items of uncharged misconduct committed by defendant, including (1) defendant\u2019s threat to kill his girlfriend\u2019s family if his girlfriend\u2019s stepfather reported him to the police for beating the girlfriend; (2) defendant\u2019s high-speed evasion of the police when the police responded to a disturbance report at the hotel where his girlfriend\u2019s family was staying; and (3) defendant\u2019s assault on an inmate (Willie Pullins) when defendant was in a holding cell several years after the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-7\">The jury found defendant guilty of attempted premeditated murder with a personal gun discharge finding. For the attempted murder conviction, he was sentenced to life with the possibility of parole. He also received a determinate term of 20 years for the personal gun discharge enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-9\">I. <em>Admission of Victim\u2019s Hearsay Identification of Defendant</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1324-10\">Defendant asserts the victim\u2019s hearsay statement that he shot the victim should not have been admitted into evidence. He contends: (1) the statement is testimonial and hence its admission violates his federal constitutional right of confrontation as defined in <em>Crawford, </em>and (2) the statement cannot be characterized as a spontaneous statement admissible under California\u2019s hearsay exceptions. We reject these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-11\">A. <em>Pretrial Hearing on Admissibility</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1324-12\">Before trial, the prosecutor told the court that the victim would likely not be testifying, explaining: \u201c[Djespite our best efforts to find and secure his availability, I don\u2019t think the victim in this case will be made available to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1461\">*1461</page-number>testify.\u201d The prosecutor moved to allow into evidence the victim\u2019s hearsay statement made in the ambulance that he was shot by \u201cJohn Paul.\u201d The prosecutor argued the statement did not violate the defendant\u2019s right to confront witnesses under <em>Crawford </em>because the statement was nontestimonial, and the statement was admissible under the spontaneous statement exception to the hearsay rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-5\">At a hearing to determine the admissibility of the victim\u2019s statement, the prosecutor presented the testimony of a police officer (Mark Smith) who spoke with the victim at the scene of the shooting, and the testimony of firefighter Bradley Witt who spoke with the victim in the ambulance. Smith testified that when he arrived at the scene about 10:00 p.m. in response to a 911 call, Marquez was lying on the ground by the front door of a duplex. Marquez was holding a bloody towel to his abdomen. Smith spoke to Marquez for about one or two minutes. Marquez was \u201cvery low key and quiet\u201d when he was talking. Marquez told Smith he had been shot \u201cout front\u201d on the street, and the assailant was in a vehicle and used a \u201clarge handgun.\u201d When Smith asked Marquez who shot him, Marquez told Smith that \u201can unknown subject shot him.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> When Smith asked Marquez to describe the shooter and to describe the car, Marquez did not respond to either question. Smith did not ask Marquez any more questions because he felt he was not going to get any more information from Marquez at that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-6\">The prosecutor asked Smith if he was concerned about whether the shooter might be near the area at that time. Smith responded, \u201cYes, that\u2019s always a concern.\u201d After speaking with Marquez, Smith started examining the crime scene to determine exactly where the shooting occurred so the area could be contained. Smith testified that he did not obtain information about the identity of the shooter until later that night.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1325-7\">Firefighter Witt testified that when he arrived at the scene of the shooting, he assisted the ambulance crew with placing Marquez on a backboard and into the ambulance. Witt stated that it typically takes about six to 10 minutes to accomplish this task. Witt accompanied the paramedic in the back of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1462\">*1462</page-number>ambulance and during the ride to the hospital assisted with monitoring Marquez\u2019s vital signs and providing him oxygen. About midway through the 15- to 20-minute ride to the hospital, Witt asked Marquez, \u201c \u2018Who shot you?\u2019 \u201d Marquez responded, \u201cJohn Paul.\u201d The answer stood out in Witt\u2019s mind because John Paul is the name of a famous pope and Witt is Catholic. Witt testified that while in the ambulance Marquez was in critical condition; he was fading \u201cin and out of consciousness\u201d; he was having difficulty breathing; and he was bloated and having severe abdominal pain. The police had not asked Witt to question Marquez, but he asked Marquez who shot him because he was concerned that Marquez was going to die. Witt acknowledged that the question had no relevance to Marquez\u2019s medical condition. Witt did not ask Marquez any additional questions because they were busy treating him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-5\">Witt stayed at the hospital for a while, and arrived back at the fire station about 12:30 a.m. He testified he called the police department \u201cright when [he] got back\u201d to the station and provided the name given by Marquez.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> He thought this was \u201cgood information\u201d for the police to know, and he called when it was \u201cfresh ... in [his] head.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1326-6\">With respect to the <em>Crawford </em>right of confrontation, the prosecutor asserted the victim\u2019s statement to Witt identifying the shooter was nontestimonial because Witt was not a law enforcement agent charged with investigation of crime, and there was no structured questioning akin to a police interview. With respect to California\u2019s hearsay rules, the prosecutor argued the statement to Witt was a spontaneous statement \u201cbecause it was made under the stress of the event.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-7\">Objecting to admission of the statement to Witt, defendant asserted the statement was testimonial because Witt was not obtaining information about Marquez\u2019s physical condition but rather was acting as an agent of the police to obtain information about the suspect.' Further, defendant argued the statement to Witt was not spontaneous because Marquez had time to reflect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1463\">*1463</page-number>before making the statement, as shown by the fact that he had earlier stated to Officer Smith at the scene that an \u201cunknown subject\u201d shot him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-5\">The trial court ruled the statement to Witt was nontestimonial because of the circumstances under which it occurred. Further, the court ruled the statement was admissible as a spontaneous statement because Marquez had been shot in the stomach, he was still in a state of shock, and he did not have \u201ctime to process the information.\u201d The court reasoned that given Marquez\u2019s critical condition, he would not be \u201ctrying to figure out. . . who should I pin this on.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-6\">B. Crawford <em>Right of Confrontation</em></p>\n<p id=\"AVF\">1. <em>Governing Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1327-7\">The Sixth Amendment of the federal Constitution provides that a defendant has the right to confront the witnesses against him. In <em>Crawford, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that admission of a \u201ctestimonial\u201d hearsay statement by a declarant who does not appear for cross-examination at trial violates the confrontation clause unless the witness is unavailable to testify at trial and the defendant had a prior opportunity to cross-examine the witness. <em>(Crawford, supra, </em>541 U.S. at pp. 59, 68.) This rule applies even if the statement is otherwise admissible under a hearsay exception. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 50-51, 56 &amp; fn. 7.) However, the confrontation clause does not bar admission of hearsay statements that are not testimonial. <em>(Davis v. Washington </em>(2006) 547 U.S. 813, 823-826 [165 L.Ed.2d 224, 126 S.Ct. 2266] <em>(Davis).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1327-8\">Relevant to the parameters of testimonial statements to which the confrontation clause applies, <em>Crawford </em>explained: \u201c[T]he Confrontation Clause . . . applies to \u2018witnesses\u2019 against the accused\u2014in other words, those who \u2018bear testimony.\u2019 . . . \u2018Testimony,\u2019 in turn, is typically \u2018[a] solemn declaration or affirmation made for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact.\u2019 [Citation.] An accuser who makes a formal statement to government officers bears testimony in a sense that a person who makes a casual remark to an acquaintance does not.\u201d <em>(Crawford, supra, </em>541 U.S. at p. 51, second bracket in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-9\">However, not all statements to government officers are testimonial. In <em>Davis, </em>the court formulated the following test to distinguish nontestimonial from testimonial statements made to law enforcement officials: \u201cStatements are nontestimonial when made in the course of police interrogation under circumstances objectively indicating that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency. They are testimonial when the circumstances objectively indicate that there is no such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1464\">*1464</page-number>ongoing emergency, and that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.\u201d <em>(Davis, supra, </em>547 U.S. at p. 822.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-5\">The <em>Davis </em>court reasoned that statements to government officials that are \u201csolely directed at establishing the facts of a past crime, in order to identify (or provide evidence to convict) the perpetrator\u201d satisfy the definition of a testimonial statement because they are a solemn declaration or affirmation made for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact. <em>(Davis, supra, </em>547 U.S. at p. 826.) Further, a witness\u2019s description of past events to an investigating officer may be testimonial regardless of whether the statements were reduced to a writing signed by the declarant or merely embedded in the memory or notes of the officer. <em>(Ibid.) Davis </em>acknowledged that \u201cformality is indeed essential to testimonial utterance,\u201d but stated the requisite formality and solemnity exist when a witness describes past events to an officer, because deliberate falsehoods to officers constitute a criminal offense. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 826-827, 830, fn. 5.) <em>Davis </em>also observed that even when statements were made without any detailed interrogation (i.e., volunteered statements or answers to open-ended questions), this does not automatically make them nontestimonial. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 822, fn. 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-6\">Under these principles, statements made to a 911 operator describing events as they are actually happening are not testimonial if their purpose was to provide the police with information necessary to resolve a present emergency and they were made in an environment that was not tranquil or safe. <em>(Davis, supra, </em>547 U.S. at pp. 827-828.) In this circumstance, the 911 caller\u2019s statements are not \u201c \u2018a weaker substitute for live testimony\u2019 at trial\u201d because \u201c[n]o \u2018witness\u2019 goes into court to proclaim an emergency and seek help.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 828; see <em>People v. Cage </em>(2007) 40 Cal.4th 965, 984 [56 Cal.Rptr.3d 789, 155 P.3d 205] [testimonial statements are statements that are \u201cout-of-court analogs, in purpose and form, of the testimony given by witnesses at trial\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-7\">Similarly, statements in response to police inquiries at the crime scene are not testimonial if the inquiries were designed to ascertain whether there was an ongoing threat to the safety of the victim, the officers, or the public. (See <em>Davis, supra, </em>547 U.S. at pp. 829, 831-832; <em>People v. Romero </em>(2008) 44 Cal.4th 386, 422 [79 Cal.Rptr.3d 334, 187 P.3d 56].) For example, questioning a victim to identify a perpetrator for purposes of immediate apprehension of the perpetrator for safety reasons does not yield a testimonial statement. <em>(People v. Romero, supra, </em>at p. 422 [statements \u201care nontestimonial if the primary purpose is to deal with a contemporaneous emergency such as assessing the situation, dealing with threats, or apprehending a perpetrator\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1465\">*1465</page-number>In <em>Romero, </em>the court concluded a victim\u2019s statements to the police at the crime scene were nontestimonial under circumstances where the agitated victim described an assault that had just occurred, and a few minutes later identified the perpetrators whom the police found hiding nearby. <em>(People v. Romero, supra, </em>44 Cal.4th at pp. 421-422.) <em>Romero </em>reasoned the \u201cstatements provided the police with information necessary for them to assess and deal with the situation, including taking steps to evaluate potential threats to others by the perpetrators, and to apprehend the perpetrators. . . . The primary purpose of the police in asking [the victim] to identify whether the detained individuals were the perpetrators, an identification made within five minutes of the arrival of the police, was to determine whether the perpetrators had been apprehended and the emergency situation had ended or whether the perpetrators were still at large so as to pose an immediate threat.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 422.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-5\">In contrast, statements that are initially nontestimonial may evolve into testimonial statements if the immediate danger has ended and the questioning continues to elicit details about what happened. (See <em>Davis, supra, </em>547 U.S. at pp. 817, 828-829 [following initial nontestimonial statements, 911 caller\u2019s statements may have become testimonial once the caller reported that the assailant (her former boyfriend) had driven away and the operator \u201cproceeded to pose a battery of questions\u201d].) Likewise, statements are testimonial if they are in response to police interrogation that occurs after the emergency has been resolved and where there is no immediate need to identify or apprehend a perpetrator. (See <em>Davis, supra, </em>547 U.S. at pp. 829-830.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-6\">For example, the <em>Davis </em>court found statements made to an officer responding to a report of a domestic disturbance were testimonial because there were no signs of a current disturbance; the wife stated she was fine; the wife made statements incriminating her husband only during a second conversation when she was interviewed in a room separate from her husband and sometime after the events she described were over; and the officer had the wife write out an affidavit to establish what had occurred previously. <em>(Davis, supra, </em>547 U.S. at pp. 829-832.) The court reasoned that during the second conversation the officer was not seeking information about \u201c \u2018what is happening\u2019 \u201d but rather about \u201c \u2018what happened\u2019 \u201d; the victim was not making a \u201ccry for help\u201d and was not providing information to enable the officers \u201cimmediately to end a threatening situation\u201d; and the sole purpose of the interrogation was to investigate a possible crime. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 830-832.) <em>Davis </em>concluded the statements are \u201can obvious substitute for live testimony, because they do precisely <em>what a witness does </em>on direct examination . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 830.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1466\">*1466</page-number>Similarly, in <em>Cage, </em>the Cahfomia Supreme Court concluded a victim\u2019s statement to an officer at a hospital waiting room was testimonial under circumstances where the officer had earlier been to the scene of the crime and observed evidence that could suggest the defendant (the victim\u2019s mother) had committed an assault; the victim had been transported to the hospital and was awaiting treatment in the emergency room; and the officer asked the victim to describe what had happened between the victim and the defendant. <em>(People v. Cage, supra, </em>40 Cal.4th at pp. 984-985.) The <em>Cage </em>court reasoned that by the time the officer spoke with the victim the incident had been over for more than an hour; the assailant and the victim were geographically separated; and the victim was \u201cin no danger of further violence as to which contemporaneous police intervention might be required.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 985.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-5\"><em>Cage </em>concluded the officer\u2019s \u201cclear purpose in coming to speak to [the victim] at this juncture was not to deal with a <em>present emergency, </em>but to obtain a fresh account of <em>past events involving defendant </em>as part of an inquiry into possible criminal activity.\u201d <em>(People v. Cage, supra, </em>40 Cal.4th at p. 985.) Rejecting an argument that the officer was determining whether further immediate police action might be necessary to apprehend a perpetrator, the court noted the officer did not try to obtain emergency information from the victim when he saw him near the crime scene even though the victim was coherent; at the hospital the officer questioned the victim in a manner that assumed the defendant was the suspect; and there was no indication the officer followed up with what the victim told him by initiating emergency action. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 985-986, fn. 15.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-6\">On appeal, we independently review whether a statement was testimonial so as to implicate the constitutional right of confrontation. <em>(People v. Johnson </em>(2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 1467, 1478 [59 Cal.Rptr.3d 405].) We evaluate the primary purpose for which the statement was given and taken under an objective standard, \u201cconsidering all the circumstances that might reasonably bear on the intent of the participants in the conversation.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cage, supra, </em>40 Cal.4th at p. 984.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-7\">2. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1330-8\">Although firefighter Witt was not a police officer, we agree with defendant that he could be an agent of the police for purposes of securing a testimonial statement. (See <em>People v. Cage, supra, </em>40 Cal.4th at p. 987 [court evaluated whether medical doctor was \u201cacting in conjunction with law enforcement\u201d and making inquiries with an \u201cevidence-gathering aim\u201d]; <em>People v. Vargas </em>(2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 647, 660 [100 Cal.Rptr.3d 578] [government officers for <em>Crawford </em>purposes include those acting \u201c \u2018in an agency relationship with law enforcement\u2019 \u201d]; see also <em>Davis, supra, </em>547 U.S. at p. 823, fn. 2 [court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1467\">*1467</page-number>assumed, without deciding, that 911 operators can obtain testimonial statements because they may \u201cbe agents of law enforcement when they conduct interrogations of 911 callers\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-5\">However, we conclude Marquez\u2019s statement in the ambulance to Witt was not testimonial. When Marquez made the statement, he was severely injured from a gunshot wound to the stomach, he was lying in an ambulance en route to the hospital, and he appeared to be on the verge of death. These circumstances lack the solemnity and formality associated with a testimonial statement and are far different from, for example, the scenario in <em>Davis </em>where the officer separated the wife from her husband and had her write out an affidavit describing the incident. Although the victim in <em>Cage </em>was questioned by the police while awaiting treatment at the emergency room, there is no indication the victim (who had been cut with glass) was in jeopardy of dying. Given Marquez\u2019s physical condition and the brevity of his response, it is unlikely that a reasonable person would construe his statement as a solemn declaration that could lead to criminal charges if it was deliberately fabricated. Further, a statement consisting of two words in response to a single question, made by a declarant lying close to death in an ambulance, cannot be characterized as an \u201cout-of-court analog[]\u201d of the testimony given by an alert witness while sitting in court. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cage, supra, </em>40 Cal.4th at p. 984.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-6\">The circumstances also show that at the time of Witt\u2019s inquiry, the shooting had just recently occurred and the shooter was still unidentified and at large.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Although Marquez was no longer in immediate danger from the shooter, there was still a possibility that the unidentified shooter could pose an immediate threat to other persons. This is not a case involving a domestic disturbance (as discussed in <em>Davis </em>and <em>Cage), where the assailant was identified </em>and the geographic separation of the victim and the assailant would suggest the immediate threat of danger to both the victim and the public was over. Witt\u2019s inquiry about the identity of the shooter was a basic question that was crucial to an evaluation by the police whether there was an ongoing danger to the public. Consistent with this immediacy, Witt communicated the information he acquired to the police that same night, once he had finished his medically related duties and had arrived back at the fire station. Witt\u2019s inquiry (in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1468\">*1468</page-number>role as an agent of the police) addressed this concern and was relevant to assist the police in determining whether the at-large perpetrator posed an immediate risk to others.</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-5\">The fact that Witt\u2019s inquiry also served to benefit the police in their investigation of the case does not alone render the victim\u2019s statement testimonial. The test under <em>Crawford </em>is whether the <em>primary purpose </em>of the interrogation is to establish facts to be used against the perpetrator. The mere fact that the question might also be expected to ultimately yield evidence against the accused at trial does not transform nontestimonial circumstances into evidence-gathering questioning. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Cage, supra, </em>40 Cal.4th at p. 984, fn. 14 [the fact that a reasonable person could conceive that an out-of-court statement identifying a perpetrator might later become criminal evidence does not alone establish the statement as testimonial]; <em>People v. Romero, supra, </em>44 Cal.4th at p. 422 [\u201cstatements are not testimonial simply because they might reasonably be used in a later criminal trial\u201d]; compare <em>Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts </em>(2009) 557 U.S. _ [174 L.Ed.2d 314, 129 S.Ct. 2527, 2532] [lab analyst certificates attesting that substance seized from defendant was cocaine are testimonial because the certificates were made under circumstances indicating they would be available for later use at trial and they were for the sole purpose of providing evidence against the defendant].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-8\">In sum, the circumstances here involve an unidentified shooter loose in the community, a single question requesting information relevant to immediate public safety, a two-word response by a victim while he was being rushed to the hospital with a potentially fatal injury, and transmittal of the victim\u2019s statement to the police that same night. The highly informal circumstances and brevity of the inquiry concerning a basic question of identity on the night of the incident reflect a response to an immediate situation rather than an investigative purpose. The trial court properly ruled the statement to Witt was nontestimonial, and hence its admission did not violate <em>Crawford.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1332-9\">C. <em>Spontaneous </em>Statement*</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-10\">II.-VI. <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1333-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1469\">*1469</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-5\">The judgment is affirmed and the petition for writ of habeas corpus is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-6\">Huffman, Acting P.

Further, the testimony presented at trial reflects that Officer Smith arrived at the shooting scene about 10:12 p.m.; firefighter Witt spent about eight minutes with Marquez at the scene; and Marquez was removed from the scene sometime before 10:47 p.m.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1332-12\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 1453.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
