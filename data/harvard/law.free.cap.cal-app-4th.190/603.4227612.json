J.</author>\n<p id=\"A0c\">In the proceeding to dissolve the marriage between Linda A. Boblitt and Steven B. Boblitt,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the family court judge considered Linda\u2019s claims that Steven had committed acts of domestic violence against her before and during the marriage (and during the dissolution proceeding) in determining whether to award Linda spousal support. (See Fam. Code, \u00a7 4320, subd. (i).) Subsequently, in this tort action for damages based on Steven\u2019s alleged domestic violence against Linda (see Civ. Code, \u00a7 1708.6 [recognizing tort of domestic violence]), the trial court concluded Steven was entitled to judgment on the pleadings because the judgment in the dissolution proceeding (which was then on appeal) precluded Linda from further litigating the domestic violence issues under the doctrines of res judicata (claim preclusion) and collateral estoppel (issue preclusion).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>We conclude the trial court erred in granting Steven\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings for two reasons. First, a judgment that is on appeal is not final for purposes of applying the doctrines of claim and issue preclusion. Second, a request for spousal support in a marital dissolution proceeding is not based on the same primary right as a tort action based on domestic violence and therefore a party is not necessarily precluded from seeking damages for alleged acts of domestic violence and also asking a family law court to consider those same acts of domestic violence in awarding spousal support.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">Because this tort action for domestic violence was not precluded by the judgment in the dissolution proceeding, we will reverse the judgment in this action and remand the case with instructions to the trial court to deny Steven\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">We take the following facts from Linda\u2019s first amended complaint and from documents in the dissolution proceeding that are subject to judicial notice.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (See Evid. Code, \u00a7 452, subd. (d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">Linda and Steven began cohabiting in February 1983. His verbal abuse of her began that day. It later escalated to physical abuse. In December 1984, he broke her jaw. His physical and verbal abuse of her continued off and on for the next 23 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">Meanwhile, in December 1989, the parties married. Eventually, Linda filed for dissolution of the marriage in January 2004. Even after that, however, Steven continued to verbally harass and physically abuse her, up through January 28, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-9\">In January 2007, Linda filed a statement of issues in the dissolution proceeding in which she described in some detail Steven\u2019s \u201clong history of physical and emotional abuse\u201d of her and asserted that her injuries from the abuse, both physical and psychological, had impaired her ability to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-10\">Just three days later, Linda commenced this action by filing a complaint for damages against Steven, alleging a cause of action for domestic violence and assault and battery, a cause of action for breach of fiduciary obligations, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>causes of action for negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress. In March 2008, Linda filed her first amended complaint in the action; it contained the same causes of action as the original complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">In April 2008, a judgment on reserved issues was entered in the dissolution proceeding. In the statement of decision supporting that judgment, the family court judge (Judge James Mize) stated that \u201c[i]n ordering spousal support\u201d he had \u201cconsidered all of the circumstances set forth in Family Code [section] 4320,\u201d which include \u201c[documented evidence of any history of domestic violence, as defined in Section 6211, between the parties, including, but not limited to, consideration of emotional distress resulting from domestic violence perpetrated against the supported party by the supporting party, and consideration of any history of violence against the supporting party by the supported party.\u201d (Fam. Code, \u00a7 4320, subd. (i).)</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">Judge Mize also included a separate section in the statement of decision entitled \u201cDOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND CREDIBILITY OF THE PARTIES,\u201d in which he described that \u201c[o]ne of the principal questions at trial for the Court was the determination of whether there had been domestic violence and whether descriptions of domestic violence were truthful.\u201d The judge asserted that Linda \u201cwas permitted to testify as to every allegation of domestic violence up to the date of trial,\u201d which occurred in July 2007. It is not clear, however, whether, or to what extent, Judge Mize found domestic violence. He stated that some of Linda\u2019s \u201callegations of physical domestic violence . . . were simply not credible.\u201d In particular, he concluded that Linda\u2019s \u201callegations that she was sexually assaulted by [Steven] are simply unbelievable.\u201d But he also noted that Steven\u2019s \u201cbehavior during the marriage and post-separation could be described as intimidating\u201d and that Steven \u201cdid and said some things that he should not be proud of or that were not appropriate.\u201d The judge explained that, to the extent Steven\u2019s behavior interfered with Linda\u2019s business, he was remedying that behavior \u201cby making a spousal support award for [Linda] in the amount of $2,000.00 for eight months,\u201d with the reduction to zero at the end of that period conditioned on the parties having no contact with each other in the interim. Judge Mize asserted that Linda had \u201crequested repayment for past medical bills, future medical bills, counseling and alleged pain and suffering,\u201d but he found \u201c[n]o award to [Linda] other than the support ordered here is appropriate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">In July 2008, after an unsuccessful new trial motion, Linda appealed the judgment in the dissolution proceeding.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>In late November or early December 2008, Steven moved for judgment on the pleadings in this action, asserting that \u201ceach and every claim (cause of action) alleged in the Amended Complaint w[as] or could have been tried in the [dissolution proceeding,] thus barring relitigation of the claims herein.\u201d As to the allegations of physical and verbal abuse, Steven asserted that the court in the dissolution proceeding \u201cconsidered] domestic violence in the context of seeking relief by way of spousal support.\u201d He also noted that the court in the dissolution proceeding had rejected Linda\u2019s request for \u201crepayment for past medical bills, future medical bills, counseling and alleged pain and suffering.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">In opposing the motion, Linda argued that the judgment in the dissolution proceeding was \u201cnot a final judgment ... on the merits,\u201d noting that the judgment was on appeal. She also argued her domestic violence cause of action was \u201cnot tried in the dissolution action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">The trial court (Judge Michael Virga) granted Steven\u2019s motion without leave to amend \u201con the grounds of res judicata or collateral estoppel,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> concluding Linda either raised, or could have raised, all of her claims against Steven in the dissolution proceeding. From the resulting judgment of dismissal, Linda timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">On appeal, Linda contends the trial court erred in granting Steven\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings because the judgment in the dissolution proceeding was not final and \u201c[t]he dissolution proceeding did not encompass [Linda\u2019s] spousal abuse injury claims.\u201d We agree on both points.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">\n<em>Waiver</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">First, however, we pause to address Steven\u2019s claim that Linda \u201chas waived all of the arguments now presented to this Court as a result of not raising them before the trial court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">Steven acknowledges that Linda asserted in her papers in the trial court that the judgment in the dissolution proceeding was not final, but he claims she provided \u201cno analysis as to why this might be important [and] no citation to any case that describes what a final judgment is.\u201d As to Linda\u2019s other argument, Steven contends it \u201cappears nowhere in the underlying law suit. It simply cannot be found.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b613-10\">To the extent Steven complains that Linda raised one of her arguments in the trial court but did not support it with analysis or citation to authority, a similar complaint could be levied at Steven in this court, because while he asserts waiver based on Linda\u2019s alleged failure to raise in the trial court the arguments she now makes, he does not cite any case or other authority regarding the doctrine of waiver or supporting his assertion that a finding of waiver would be appropriate here. These omissions would justify us treating Steven\u2019s waiver argument as waived because \u201c \u2018[e]very brief should contain a legal argument with citation of authorities on the points made. If none is furnished on a particular point, the court may treat it as waived, and pass it without consideration.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Stanley </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 764, 793 [42 Cal.Rptr.2d 543, 897 P.2d 481].) \u201c \u2018Contentions supported neither by argument nor by citation of authority are deemed to be without foundation, and to have been abandoned.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Estate of Randall </em>(1924) 194 Cal. 725, 728-729 [230 P. 445].)</p>\n<p id=\"b613-11\">Despite the foregoing, we elect to consider all of the arguments before us, and doing so we find no merit in Steven\u2019s waiver argument. \u201c[E]ven assuming the arguments [Linda now makes] were not tendered in the trial court, they present questions of law that do not turn on disputed facts . . . ,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>and we may thus consider them. <em>(Brunius v. Parrish </em>(2005) <em>132 </em>Cal.App.4th 838, 849-850 [34 Cal.Rptr.3d 55].)</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">II, III<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">\n<em>The Dissolution Proceeding Did Not Encompass Linda\u2019s Cause of Action for Domestic Violence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">Rather than rely on the lack of finality of the dissolution proceeding alone to reverse the judgment of dismissal\u2014given that the judgment in that proceeding may soon be final and this issue could arise again\u2014we also address Linda\u2019s second argument, which is that the dissolution proceeding did not encompass her domestic abuse claims against Steven. Again, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">\u201c \u2018Res judicata\u2019 describes the preclusive effect of a final judgment on the merits. Res judicata, or claim preclusion, prevents relitigation of the same cause of action in a second suit between the same parties or parties in privity with them. Collateral estoppel, or issue preclusion, \u2018precludes relitigation of issues argued and decided in prior proceedings.\u2019 [Citation.] Under the doctrine of res judicata, if a plaintiff prevails in an action, the cause is merged into the judgment and may not be asserted in a subsequent lawsuit; a judgment for the defendant serves as a bar to further litigation of the same cause of action.\u201d <em>(Mycogen Corp. </em>v. <em>Monsanto Co. </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 888, 896-897 [123 Cal.Rptr.2d 432, 51 P.3d 297], fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b614-10\">\u201cFor purposes of res judicata, California applies the primary right theory to define cause of action as: (1) a primary right possessed by the plaintiff, (2) a corresponding duty imposed upon the defendant, and (3) a wrong done by the defendant which is a breach of such primary right and duty. [Citations.] Thus, a single cause of action is based on the harm suffered, rather than on the particular legal theory asserted or relief sought by the plaintiff.\u201d <em>(Balasubramanian </em>v. <em>San Diego Community College Dist. </em>(2000) 80 Cal.App.4th 977, 991 [95 Cal.Rptr.2d 837].)</p>\n<p id=\"b614-11\">In the trial court, Steven argued that Linda\u2019s cause of action for domestic violence was premised on the breach of her primary right \u201cto be free from domestic violence, assault and battery,\u201d and \u201cthis primary right ha[d] already <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>been litigated\u201d in the dissolution proceeding. According to Steven, \u201cIt is of no moment what new or different legal theories or relief are sought. The \u2018primary right\u2019 is the same in both actions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">We have found little California case law that is helpful on the question of the claim preclusive effect of a judgment in a marital dissolution proceeding in a later tort action, but <em>Nicholson v. Fazeli </em>(2003) 113 Cal.App.4th 1091 [6 Cal.Rptr.3d 881] turns out to rest on reasoning that is persuasive here.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">In <em>Nicholson, </em>the appellate court confronted (among other things) whether a \u201cwife\u2019s malicious prosecution action [was] precluded by the family court\u2019s prior ruling on her motion for attorney\u2019s fees and costs\u201d in her marital dissolution proceeding. <em>(Nicholson v. Fazeli, supra, </em>113 Cal.App.4th at p. 1094.) The husband\u2019s trust had been joined as a party in the dissolution proceeding, and the wife had \u201cfiled a complaint against the Trust. . . seeking declaratory relief and imposition of a constructive trust\u201d relating to certain property. <em>(Ibid.) </em>A \u201ccourt order temporarily partially removed [the husband] as trustee of the Trust and replaced him with his sons ... as trustees ad litem for the sole purpose of defending the Trust against [the wife]\u2019s complaint. . . . [An] attorney for [the sons] filed a cross-complaint in the dissolution action against [the wife] and [the husband] seeking possession of [various property] alleged to be Trust property in [the wife]\u2019s possession.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Ultimately, \u201cthe Trust voluntarily dismissed its cross-complaint without prejudice.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1095.) The wife then \u201cfiled a motion in the dissolution action seeking attorney\u2019s fees and costs under Family Code sections 271 and 2030 from [the husband and his sons] and the Trust,\u201d \u201casserting] that [the husband and his sons], the Trust and [the attorney] had filed and prosecuted a frivolous cross-complaint out of spite.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201c[T]he judge in the dissolution action awarded [the wife] $50,000 in attorney\u2019s fees and costs under Family Code sections 271 and 2030 against [the husband] and the Trust. The judge denied her request that [the sons] should be ordered to pay her fees and costs . . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">The wife then \u201cfiled a malicious prosecution action against [the husband], [his sons] and [the attorney],\u201d \u201calleging] that the cross-complaint filed by [the attorney] on behalf of [the sons] against her and [the husband] had been procured by [the husband] and that they lacked probable cause for their allegations in the cross-complaint.\u201d <em>(Nicholson v. Fazeli, supra, </em>113 Cal.App.4th at p. 1095.) The trial court ultimately granted the defendants\u2019 motion for judgment on the pleadings without leave to amend. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1096.)</p>\n<p id=\"b616-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>On the wife\u2019s appeal, the appellate court ultimately turned to the defendants\u2019 \u201cclaim that the res judicata effect of the family court\u2019s ruling on [the wifej\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees and costs in the family law proceedings preclude[d] her from bringing an action for malicious prosecution.\u201d <em>(Nicholson v. Fazeli, supra, </em>113 Cal.App.4th at p. 1096.) Noting the \u201cprimary right\u201d theory used in California to define a cause of action, the appellate court concluded as follows: \u201cClearly the primary right intended to be vindicated by Family Code sections 271 and 2030 is the right of a party to a family law proceeding to an adequate opportunity to litigate, notwithstanding a disparity in the parties\u2019 income and assets. Indeed, [the wife] brought her motion while the dissolution action was still ongoing, and her need to litigate the dissolution issues continued to require her to pay for attorney\u2019s fees and costs. A malicious prosecution action, on the other hand, is brought to vindicate one\u2019s right to be free from malicious and unmeritorious litigation. The corresponding duties are also distinct. A party to a dissolution action has a duty, under Family Code section 2030, to provide funds for the party\u2019s adversary\u2019s litigation costs where the adversary\u2019s need and party\u2019s means justify such a provision. The duty imposed by Family Code section 271 requires a party to a dissolution action to be cooperative and work toward settlement of the litigation on pain of being required to share the party\u2019s adversary\u2019s litigation costs. The duty involved in a malicious prosecution action, on the other hand, is the obligation to refrain from maintaining a malicious and unmerited lawsuit, [f] As both the primary rights and corresponding duties are different, [the wife]\u2019s malicious prosecution action was not barred by the claim preclusion aspect of res judicata.\u201d <em>(Nicholson </em>v. <em>Fazeli, supra, </em>113 Cal.App.4th at p. 1102.)</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">We find a similar reasoning persuasive here. A tort action like the present one is based on \u201cthe primary right to be free from personal injury\u201d (no matter how many different tort theories may be alleged). <em>(Sawyer </em>v. <em>First City Financial Corp. </em>(1981) 124 Cal.App.3d 390, 399 [177 Cal.Rptr. 398].) \u201cIt is clearly established that \u2018. . . there is but one cause of action for one personal injury [which is incurred] by reason of one wrongful act.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Slater v. Blackwood </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 791, 795 [126 Cal.Rptr. 225, 543 P.2d 593].) There is no sound basis, however, for concluding that a claim for spousal support in a marital dissolution proceeding is also based on \u201cthe primary right to be free from personal injury,\u201d even if one of the circumstances the family court considers in adjudicating that claim is domestic violence between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">The Family Code recognizes that a person has a right to spousal support from his or her former spouse under certain circumstances. Specifically, subdivision (a) of Family Code section 4330 provides that \u201c[i]n a judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>of dissolution of marriage or legal separation of the parties, the court may order a party to pay for the support of the other party an amount, for a period of time, that the court determines is just and reasonable, based on the standard of living established during the marriage, taking into consideration the circumstances as provided in Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 4320).\u201d One of the many circumstances set forth in Family Code section 4320 is \u201c[djocumented evidence of any history of domestic violence . . . between the parties.\u201d (Fam. Code, \u00a7 4320, subd. (i).)</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">In our view, this provision, which requires a family court to consider evidence of domestic violence in determining whether an award of spousal support is appropriate, and if so, how much support is just and reasonable, does not seek to vindicate the primary right to be free from personal injury, as a tort action for domestic violence does. Rather, subdivision (i) of Family Code section 4320 is just one of many provisions that exist to vindicate the primary right of a party in a marital dissolution (or legal separation) proceeding to obtain spousal support from the other party if the circumstances justify such support.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">Because the same primary right does not underlie a request for spousal support in a marital dissolution proceeding and a tort action for damages, the doctrine of claim preclusion does not preclude a person from offering evidence of domestic violence in connection with a request for spousal support in a dissolution proceeding, then suing for damages for domestic violence, or vice versa. Accordingly, a judgment in a dissolution proceeding where claims of domestic violence were (or could have been) litigated with relation to a claim for spousal support does not preclude a later tort action for domestic violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">This conclusion is not altered by the fact that in the dissolution proceeding Linda may have (as Judge Mize stated) \u201crequested repayment for past medical bills, fiiture medical bills, counseling and alleged pain and suffering,\u201d which Judge Mize declined to award her. \u201cGiven finite family law jurisdiction, a tort action claiming damages cannot be joined with or pleaded in a dissolution proceeding.\u201d <em>(Sosnick v. Sosnick </em>(1999) 71 Cal.App.4th 1335, 1339 [84 Cal.Rptr.2d 700].) Thus, Judge Mize had no power in the dissolution proceeding to award Linda damages for her \u201cpast medical bills, future medical bills, counseling and alleged pain and suffering,\u201d even if she did request them. And because Judge Mize had no power to award damages, his refiisal to do so has no preclusive effect. (See <em>In re Keck </em>(1946) 75 Cal.App.2d 846, 849-850 [171 P.2d 933] [where the trial court \u201chad no jurisdiction of the subject matter in the first proceeding,\u201d \u201cit could not validly adjudicate any fact other than its lack of jurisdiction . . . and the attempted adjudication of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>the merits . . . was void .... It cannot, therefore, be res judicata of any issue in the second action.\u201d (citations omitted)].)</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">Of course, a judgment in a dissolution proceeding where claims of domestic violence were, in fact, litigated still may have preclusive effect under the doctrine of <em>issue </em>preclusion, which \u201c \u2018precludes relitigation of issues argued and decided in prior proceedings\u2019 \u201d <em>(Mycogen Corp. v. Monsanto Co., supra, </em>28 Cal.4th at p. 896), even if it does not have preclusive effect under the doctrine of <em>claim </em>preclusion. But here, the doctrine of issue preclusion did not justify judgment on the pleadings in favor of Steven. If there had been a final judgment in the dissolution proceeding when Steven moved for judgment on the pleadings, and if Steven had shown that all of the allegations of domestic violence on which Linda\u2019s current tort action is based were, in fact, litigated and decided against her in the dissolution proceeding, leaving nothing new for decision in this case, then it might have been proper to grant his motion. As it was, however, there <em>was </em>no final judgment in the dissolution proceeding when Steven moved for judgment on the pleadings. Moreover, Steven did not carry his burden (see <em>Vella v. Hudgins </em>(1977) 20 Cal.3d 251, 257 [142 Cal.Rptr. 414, 572 P.2d 28]) of showing that the parties litigated in the dissolution proceeding all of the allegations of domestic violence Linda seeks to raise in this case, or that Judge Mize resolved all of those allegations against her. Without the actual evidence introduced in the dissolution proceeding, which Steven did not put before the trial court or this court, Judge Mize\u2019s statement that Linda \u201cwas permitted to testify as to every allegation of domestic violence up to the date of trial\u201d in July 2007 does not establish which incidents of domestic violence actually were litigated in the dissolution proceeding. Further, Judge Mize\u2019s statement of decision was not specific on whether he found domestic violence, or which alleged incidents of domestic violence he found were not proven because Linda was \u201cnot credible,\u201d as Judge Mize referred only generally to \u201c[o]ther allegations of physical domestic violence.\u201d Under these circumstances, the doctrine of issue preclusion cannot support the judgment on the pleadings in favor of Steven.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">Because the judgment in the dissolution proceeding did not preclude Linda from pursuing her tort action for domestic violence against Steven (or her cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress, to the extent that cause of action was based on the same allegations as the domestic violence cause of action), the trial court erred in granting Steven\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">The judgment of dismissal is reversed, and the case is remanded to the trial court with directions to vacate the order granting the motion for judgment on the pleadings and enter a new order denying that motion. Linda shall recover her costs on appeal. (Cal.

Superior Court </em>(2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 689, 692 [50 Cal.Rptr.3d 684].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b611-8\"> On our own motion, we take judicial notice of Linda\u2019s appeal in the dissolution proceeding <em>(In re Marriage of Boblitt </em>(Oct. 15, 2010, C059747) [nonpub. opn.]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b612-7\"> In moving for judgment on the pleadings, Steven argued with respect to Linda\u2019s cause of action for breach of fiduciary obligations that Linda was seeking \u201crelief based upon orders, facts, and the judgment from the [dissolution proceeding].\u201d In granting Steven\u2019s motion, the trial court observed that \u201cthe same facts [involved in Linda\u2019s cause of action for breach of fiduciary obligations] were argued in the [dissolution] action\u201d and \u201cJudge Mize addressed all these issues in his Statement of Decision and judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">On appeal, Linda offers no argument relating to the trial court\u2019s ruling on her cause of action for breach of fiduciary obligations. Accordingly, our decision does not address that cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">Linda\u2019s cause of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress was coextensive with her cause of action for breach of fiduciary obligations because it was based on \u201ceconomic actions [Steven allegedly took] during the course of the parties\u2019 dissolution proceeding, many of which [we]re identified in the [cause of action for breach of fiduciary obligations].\u201d In turn, Linda\u2019s cause of action for intentional infliction of emotion distress was coextensive with her cause of action for domestic violence and assault and battery because it was based on \u201c[t]he intentional actions of [Steven]\u201d that were alleged in the other causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-10\">Because Linda offers no argument on appeal specifically relating to her cause of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress and because that cause of action was based on the same allegations as her cause of action for breach of fiduciary obligations, which we do not address, we also do not address the cause of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-11\">As for Linda\u2019s cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress, to the extent that cause of action was premised on the same allegations as her cause of action for domestic violence, our discussion regarding the latter cause of action applies with equal force to the former.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b612-12\"> Mistakenly, the court ruled it was \u201csustaining]\u201d Steven\u2019s \u201cdemurrer.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b614-12\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 603.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
