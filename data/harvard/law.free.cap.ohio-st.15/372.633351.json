I respectfully solicit the attention of the court to this case, as it is directly in point, and decides this case, even in the strongest view the defendants can ask it shall be viewed; as in the case referred to, thero was no <em>legal </em>execution in the hands of the sheriff when he took the bond l\u2019eciting it, which the defendants claim to have been the case hero.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b316-8\">\u201c If A. and B. enter into a bond, by reason of duress, to A., B. can not avoid this obligation by reason of such duress.\u201d 2 Bao.

This and the case in 5 Littoll were cases on prison-bounds bonds, where the *arrest was illegal; and in those cases the bonds were avoided by statutes against ease and favor in those states.

Robinson was arrested was irregular and void, consequently the arrest was illegal, which illegal arrest constitutes the duress pleaded. Now, if the duress, which was the legal consequence of those ^matters and things set forth in the pleas, is not a defense, it follows, I say, that the pleas themselves are not a defense; or, if the duress is not a defense, that which constitutes the duress can not be. The parts can not be greater than the whole; and proof that the writ on which the arrest was made was void on its face, would not sustain the plea of duress.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b317-8\">As to the joint plea of all the defendants, it is contended that the recital of the writ in the condition of the bond estops the defendants from denying the validity of the writ. If the writ was void, it was not a writ; but the condition admits the issuing of the writ, which presupposes it was a valid writ.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b317-9\">\u201cThe recital of an execution in a prison-bounds bond, precludes the party from denying there was such execution; so the recital in such bond, that A.

If the recital of the writ bo conclusive of its legal existence, such writ can not bo denied as a matter of. fact or of law. *\u201c The defendant\u2019s bond reciting an acquittal, estops him from denying it, by the common law, and the estoppel may be sot up by demurrer.\u201d Gumond <em>v. </em>The People, 1 Hill, 346.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-6\">\u201c Upon a <em>scire facias </em>against bail, they can not deny the arrest of their principal.

Most of the cases to which I have referred, woro on demurrer. See 1 Chit. PL; Salk. 370; 2 Litt. 310; Pirtle\u2019s Dig. 370.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-12\">Even as to Lewis Robinson, the defense here set up can nob be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>sustained, it is conceded, unless the sheriff who executed *the writ was a trespasser at that time. Could an action of trespass have boon sustained by Lewis Robinson against the sheriff for arresting him .on the writ set forth in the bond? The writ, on its face, showed it to have been issued by a court of competent jurisdiction over the person and subject matter (this is shown by the pleadings), and was, therefore, when executed, when the bond was taken, and when this suit was brought, a justification to the officer. A sheriff is certainly not responsible for the errors which a superior court may decide an inferior has committed. In this case, the writ was not quashed, and the order of the court directing it to issue, not reversed until after this case was appealed by defendants. Suppose a writ, regular on its face, issue on a judgment afterward decided to be void or erroneous, or even without any judgment, it is certainly the duty of the officer to execute that writ, and it will bo a justification to him of his proceedings under it. The subsequent reversal of the judgment, or the quashing of the writ, will not make him a trespasser by relation. If the writ in this case, when it was executed, was a justification to the shei'iff, as wo say it was, there was, then, no trespass committed by him, consequently no duress. The subsequent reversal of the order directing it to issue, and quashing the writ, could not render that a trespass which was not so when done, nor could it affect the bond or heal the broach of the condition thereof, which had been made and sued for before such reversal or quashing. For these reasons, also, the last and joint plea is bad, independent of the doctrine of . duress and estoppel, for which I have contended.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b320-6\">Our statute in relation to imprisonment for debt is similar to, if not a transcript of the New York statute; and there it has been decided, \u201c that an order to hold to bail need not be indorsed on the writ \u2014 it is sufficient that it exist.\u201d Carter <em>v. </em>Drake, 10 Wend. The writ, then, on its face was good. It recited the order of court. If so, the officer was not a trespasser.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A1l3\">*\u201c Trespass will not lie against an officer for executing process regular on its face.\u201d Luddington <em>v. </em>Peck, 2 Conn. 700.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b320-8\">\u201c It is the duty of an officer to execute all process in his hands, which appear, on their face, to have been issued by competent authority and with regularity.\u201d Watson <em>v. </em>Watson, 9 Conn. 140.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b320-9\">\u201cA ministerial officer is protected in the execution of process from a court of limited or general jurisdiction, although such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>court has not, in fact, jurisdiction in the case, provided such process, on its face, shows the court had jurisdiction of the subject matter, and the officer was not apprised to the contrary.\u201d Savascool <em>v. </em>Boughton, 5 Wend. 170.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b321-5\">\u201c It is the duty of a sheriff to levy an execution, regular on its face.\u201d Parmelee <em>v. </em>Hitchcock, 12 Wend. 96.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b321-6\">\u201cA ministerial officer, who executes the process of a court having jurisdiction of the subject matter, and the power to issuo process, is protected in the execution thereof, if the process be regular on its face, and apparently within the jurisdiction of the court.\u201d Parker <em>v. </em>Walrod, 16 Wend. 514.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b321-7\">Erroneous process is a justification to a sheriff for imprisoning the defendant under it \u2014 for the sheriff is not the judge of the legality of it.

They had all the benefit of the bond, after obtaining which, they seek to avoid it by comjfiaining of the arrest as illegal. If it was illegal, why ratify and confirm it by giving the bond, when the most speedy and certain remedy of <em>habeas corpus </em>was open to them. The defense made to this bond, I therefore say, can not be sustained, either upon the principles of law or justice; and we ask judgment thereon for the amount of debt, interest, and costs of the original judgment.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AOQ\">*C.

That <em>nil debet </em>is a good plea in an action of debt on prison-bounds bond \u2014 the right of action not arising directly out of the bond, but springing from the escape of the debtor charged in execution \u2014 is shown by the following authorities: Minton <em>v. </em>Woodworth and Ferris, 11 Johns. 475, which is a decision upon the precise point. The case of Lamboon <em>v. </em>Bowen, Tap. 290, shows that the same rule obtains in the practice of Ohio.

The bond must be in a sum \u2014 neither more nor less \u2014 but precisely <em>double the </em>sum for which the party charged in execution stands committed. Section 2 of the \u201cact regulating prison bounds \u201d (Swan\u2019s Stat. 735), declares that the \u201cbond shall be in double the sum for which the prisoner stands committed.\u201d The strict rigor with which these bonds, which are the outer walls of an enlarged prison, are regarded by this court, is shown by the case of Lytle <em>v. </em>Davis, 2 Ohio, 277, which holds the bond void, where it recites only that the debtor \u201c was arrested and in custody,\u201d upon execution, and does not state, in the precise language of the statute, that the debtor was \u201cimprisoned.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b322-9\">The cases from Massachusetts reports, cited by plaintiff\u2019s coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>sel to sustain the bond, expressly declare that it is void as a statutory bond ; but hold that it may bo treated as a common-law instrument, and presented in that aspect, sustain a recovery. See also Whitehead <em>v. </em>Tarnum, 14 Pick. 523. Now, the plaintiff does not sue as upon a common-law instrument; his declaration counts as upon a statutory bond, and seeks a recovery upon it in that character alone. The demurrer, therefore, as to the third and fourths plea of the sureties, is not well taken.</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b323-5\">3. The fifth and eighth joint pleas of the two defendants, Aaron and Isaac Robinson, depend upon the question whether a <em>ca. sa., </em>issued without a compliance with the preliminary *requisitions of the \u201c act to abolish imprisonment for debt,\u201d is void, or voidable only. If void, then the arrest and imprisonment of the other defendant, Lewis Robinson, the principal in the bond, was illegal, and the bond exacted from him and his sureties to obtain his discharge, was void \u2014 void as to him, by reason of the duress that extorted it; and if void as to him, void also as to his sureties, whose liability is not in chief, but incidental only to that of their principal. <em>&gt;</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b323-6\">Section 1 of the \u201cact to abolish imprisonment for debt,\u201d is as follows : \u201c That no person shall be arrested, or imprisoned, on any mesne, or final writ or process, issuing out of any court of law or equity, in any suit, action, or proceeding, instituted for the recovery of any debt due on any contract, promise, or agreement, or for the recovery of damages ior the non-performance of any contract, promise, or agreement, or for the recovery of damages in any action of trespass, or on any judgment or decree founded upon any such contract, promise, or agreement, or damages for the nonperformance thereof, or on any judgment in (an) action of trespass, or for consequential damages, except in cases hereinafter specified.\u201d Swan\u2019s Stat. 646.</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b323-7\">Section 3 provides for the issuing of <em>capias ad respondendum </em>upon the affidavit of the creditor, his authorized agent, or attorney, charging the' existence of any one or more of the five causes of arrest therein enumerated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b323-8\">Section 4 provides, that \u201c on any judgment or decree, the court, when in session, or any judge thereof in vacation, may order a <em>ca. sa. </em>to be issued against the judgment debtor on the application of the judgment creditor, or his lawful attorney, if such court or judge shall be satisfied, by the affidavit of such applicant and such other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>testimony as he shall present, of t.he existence of either of the following particulars.\u201d And then follows an enumeration of the five causes of arrest, one or more of which must be charged in the affidavit of the judgment creditor, and established by that and other testimony to the satisfaction of tho court or judge, to warrant the order awarding the <em>ca. sa. </em>*Swan\u2019s Stat. 641. The amendatory act of March 16, 1839, gives \u201c three additional causes of arrest to those mentioned in the act to which it is an amendment.\u201d Swan\u2019s Stat. 649. The legal effect of the two statutes, taken together, is now the same as if tho three additional causes were inserted in sections 4 and 5 of the original act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b324-6\">The <em>ca. sa. </em>upon which the defendant, Lewis Robinson, the principal, was arrested and imprisoned, and to procure whose enlargement the bond in suit was given, was issued upon the affidavit of\u2019the plaintiff alone, <em>without any. other testimony. </em>Por this reason, it is contended that the bond is void, there being no such compliance with the statute as to authorize the issuing of a <em>ca. sa.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b324-7\">In the case of Griswold <em>v. </em>Sedgwick et al., 6 Cowen, 456, it is decided that if process, on the face of it, does not authorize the arrest, then it is irregular and void, and can afford no justification to any of tho parties concerned in the issuing or execution of it. In such case, it is not necessary that the process should be set aside before an action can be sustained, nor is it material out of what jurisdiction it purports to have been issued.</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b324-8\">The class of cases which frequently test writs as to whether they be void, or only voidable, are actions against sheriffs or other officers, for escapes, or neglect to execute process. If the writ be voidable only, then the pfficer is not liable,' as it is a protection to him until set aside; and, if afterward set aside, can not prejudice him for acts done under it, although otherwise as to the party suing it out.</p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b324-9\">If, however, the writ be void, the officer is not bound to execute it; for a writ void on its face is no protection to him, and he is liable, as a trespasser, for attempting to execute it. The case of Phelps <em>v. </em>Barton, 13 Wendell, 68, was an action against tho sheriff for an escape of one arrested upon a <em>ca. sa. </em>The question in the case was, whether the writ was authorized by the non-imprisonment act of New York (identical in its provisions with our present statute) , and the court held that it was not, and that, therefore, the sheriff was *not liable \u2014 the writ, of course, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>being held to bo absolutely void.

The defendant, however, was never arrested under the writ; but upon being informed that the writ had been taken out against him, voluntarily gave bail bond. Lord Kenyon, C. J.: \u201cIf the defendant had been actually under arrest at the time, his consent to give a bail bond would not have been binding on him, because it might be considered as given under duress; but here he voluntarily gave the bail bond, and on that ground only my opinion is founded.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b325-7\">The case of Aikins <em>v. </em>Richardson, 15 Vt. 500, is a case, in principle, perfectly analogous to the one now before the court. It was a <em>scire facias </em>against the defendant, as bail, for one Ithiel Richardson, on two writs of attachment. The defendant pleaded that the original actions were founded on contracts made and entered into after January 1, *1839; and that the plaintiff did not, at the time of praying out his writs of attachment, file with the authority issuing the writ, an affidavit stating that he had good reason to believe that the said Ithiel S.

Replication, that the plaintiff did file such affidavit, concluding to the country.</p>\n<p data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b325-8\">On the trial, the plaintiff offered in evidence an affidavit made by him, and filed with the justice Who issued the writ, of which affidavit the part relied on by the plaintiff as sustaining the issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>is as follows: \u201c That, ia <em>my belief, </em>Ifchiel S.

There being no other testimony, the jury, by the direction of the court, returned a verdict for defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b326-4\">After verdict, the plaintiff moved the court to render judgment for him, <em>non obstante veredicto; </em>whieh motion was overruled, and judgment rendered by the court for the defendant.

Assuming, then, that a writ issued against the express prohibition of the statute is void, it follows that the sixth plea, setting up that the <em>ca. sa. </em>did <em>not recite or show </em>any order made by the court, or any judge, upon affidavit and other testimony authorizing the issuing of the writ, must bo sustained; for it is a general rule that a writ of execution, to support itself, must show that state of things which authorizes its issuing. Hence, when a <em>ca. sa. </em>went out, as of course, all that it was necessary to recite in the writ was the recovery of the judgment. That recital, however, was essential. Without it, the writ was void on its face. Now, since something more than a judgment recovered is required before the writ can issue, it must show a compliance with all these additional requisitions, or it is void on its face. These prerequisites are now made, by law, just as essential to the validity of the writ as the recovery of the judgment itself. The one can no more be dispensed with than the other.</p>\n<p data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b326-10\">The case of Carter <em>v. </em>Drake, 10 Wend. 619, referred to by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>plaintiff\u2019s counsel, has no application to tho case now before the court. It was <em>not </em>a writ issued under the statute. It was a <em>capias ad respondendum </em>\u2014 not final process; and the suit being an action on the case for seduction, there was an application, according to the English and New York practice, wholly independent of the non-imprisonment act, for an order to hold the defendant to bail on mesne process. That it was not an application under the statute is clear, for the statute does not require a judge\u2019s order to hold to bail on a <em>capias ad respondendum. </em>It issues upon affidavit alone. But even in that case hear what the court say \u2014 Savage, C. J.: \u201c It is usual and proper to indorse the order to hold to bail on the capias, but it is not indispensable that it should be so indorsed. It may be in a separate paper, and provided the authority exists, <em>and is in possession of the officer or under his </em>control, the defendant is properly held to bail, whether it be indorsed on the writ or not.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b327-5\">*A writ of <em>capias ad </em>satisfaciendum, therefore, not reciting the proper order founded upon the affidavit and other testimony, as required by the statute, being void, the sixth plea is sustained.</p>\n<p data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b327-6\">5. The seventh plea of the sureties and the third plea of tho , principal, set up, that the principal was imprisoned by the plaintiff, until, by the force and duress of imprisonment, he and his sureties made and delivered the writing set forth in the declaration.</p>\n<p data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b327-7\">The duress of the principal, avoiding the bond, as to him, also avoids it as to his sureties, whose liability is not in chief, but incidental only, arising out of and dependent upon that of their principal. Without a liability of principal, there can not, <em>ex vi </em>termini, be a liability of surety.</p>\n<p data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b327-8\">We are aware there are contradictory decisions on this point, but the reason why it has never been held, that the surety could not, under such circumstances, avail himself of the duress of his principal in discharge of the bond, was, that it imported a consideration, and he was estopped from averring a want of consideration. But, in Ohio, this reason no longer exists, and tho defense may, therefore, well be made.</p>\n<p data-order=\"102\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b327-9\">And so, too, in the other states, the rigid rules of the common law, on the subject of consideration, are giving way, and hence the recent and better American authorities permit the surety to set up the duress of the principal. The case of Fisher <em>v. </em>Shat-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>tuck et al., 17 Pick. 252, is directly in point. It was an action of debt on a bond given by the defendants \u2014 the one as principal, the other as surety \u2014 upon the complaint of the plaintiff, made undei the bastardy act. The defendants pleaded: 1. <em>Won est factum </em>2. Duress of the <em>principal; </em>to which the plaintiff replied, and the defendants demurred generally. The demuri\u2019er to the replication raised the question as to the sufficiency of the plea of duress. The counsel claimed that the dui\u2019ess of the principal did not discharge the surety, and referred, the court to the case of Huscombe <em>v. </em>Standing, Cro. Jac., and to Bacon\u2019s Abr., the same authorities *relied upon by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, in the case now before the coui't. Shaw, C. J., delivering the opinion of the court, says (p. 253), that, \u201cupon consideration, the opinion of the court is, that the plea of duress is a good bar for <em>both defendants.\u201d </em>And again (p. 254), \u201c The order requiring the party to give bond, was void; the order to hold the defendant in custody until he gave bond, was erroneous and void; and therefore the bond was given under duress.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b328-5\">So, also, the case of Whitefield <em>v. </em>Longfellow et al., 13 Maine, 146, was an action of debt, on a bond, executed by Longfellow as principal, and the other defendants as sureties, conditioned to pay the lying-in charges, etc., under the bastardy act. The genex\u2019al issue was pleaded and joined, and a brief statement (a substitute, under the statute of Maine, for a special plea), was filed, alleging that the bond was obtained from Longfellow by duress of imprisonment and threats of the same. The judge who tried the case having refused to instruct the jury as asked for by the defendant, and there being a verdict for the plaintiff, the defendant excepted. Weston, C. J., says (p. 150), that if Longfellow \u201cdid not execute the bond in suit freely, but, through fear of unlawful imprisonment, he acted under the influence of such moral compulsion as constitutes duress.\u201d The exceptions were sustained and a new trial awarded, that the question, whether Longfellow did act freely or under fear of unlawful imprisonment, might be distinctly presented to a jux'y for determination.</p>\n<p data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b328-6\">The case of Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Canada, 13 Pick. 86, was a <em>scire faoias </em>against bail in a recognizance, alleging a forfeiture, by reason of the avoidance of the principal.

In delivering the opinion of the court, Spencer, J., after referring to the case of Huscombe <em>v. </em>Standing, in Croko James (already mentioned as the only English case relied upon by the present plaintiff), says: \u201cAs a general principle it can not be controverted, that if a bond \u25a0 be obtained from A. and B., by duress against A., B. can not plead the duress against A. to invalidate the bond, as against him. This, however, is applicable to cases depending on common-law principles, and where there is no statutory provision interposed. Sheriffs can take no bond, or other security, in matters .relating to the execution of their offices, but only to themselves, and by the name of their office, with such conditions as the law prescribes; and any obligation taken by a sheriff in other form, by color of his office, is declared void. 1 N. R. L. 423, 424. And the act relative to gaol liberties (1 N. R. L. 427), making it the duty of sheriffs to let prisoners, on civil process, go at large within the limits of the liberties, on giving security, is a mere modification and extension of the former act. Perhaps, as the bond here taken was *in the terms prescribed by the act, it can not be said to be void, as being taken <em>colore officii. </em>But the taking the bond was unlawful, and the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>dition itself was void. Lawrence could not remain a true and faithful prisoner, upon executions on which the sheriff had no right or power to detain him. The bond had no more validity than if the sheriff had taken it without any execution in his hands against Lawrence. A condition that a man shall not plow his land, or go out of his house, being in restraint of a common right, is void. Bac. Abr. Oblig. E, 3.

It was so held in the case of Cordis v. Sager, 14 Maine, 477, already cited. The truth is, the doctrine of estoppel has its appropriate application only to deeds that are well executed. It has no application to deeds, the execution of which is illegal or void ; for to apply it to such cases would be to bind a party by a void act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"111\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b330-6\">At any rate, in so far as the recitals relate to the consideration upon which the bond is founded, the statute submitting the consideration to inquiry overrides the rule, and rids us of this odious thing of estoppel, which, as shutting out the truth, is disfavored of law. In this state, the artificial rule yields to legislative enactment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"112\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b330-7\">But, independent of statutory aid, it has been expressly decided that a prison-bounds bond, reciting a <em>ca. sa. </em>when the arrest was, in fact, under <em>&amp; fieri </em>facias, shall not estop the obligor from showing the fact, as against the sheriff or his assignee, and thus avoiding the bond.

The last plea \u2014 being the joint plea of all the defendants \u2014 sets up that the <em>ca. sa. </em>has, since the appeal of this cause to the Supreme Court, been set aside and quashed, and also that the order allowing the same has been set aside, rescinded, and vacated, by an order of the Supremo Court, duly made in the premises, which is still in full force and unrevorsed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"118\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b331-9\">The matters contained in this plea are a complete bar to the action, as well for the sureties as the principal. For, although a <em>ca. sa., </em>voidable for irregularity \u2014 not void \u2014 is, before it is set aside, a protection to the party suing it out, as well as to the officer executing the process, yet, when afterward set aside, it ceases to protect the party for any acts done under it *while in force. Tho case, then, stands precisely as if no such erroneous process had ever existed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"119\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b331-10\">The law is well stated in the opinion of the court in Chapman <em>v. </em>Dyctt et al., 11 Wend. 31, which was an action of trespass, for false imprisonment, against a party who had sued out a <em>ca. sa. </em>against the plaintiff, and caused him to be arrested. The writ being voidable, not void, was afterward set aside. Savage, C. J., after stating that voidable process always protects an officer in acts done, while it is in force, although subsequently set aside, says: <em>\u201c </em>It is true, as contended by the defendants, that when the arrest was made, no trespass was, in fact, committed; but the doctrine of trespass by relation is as well settled as any in the law, at least since the Six Carpenters\u2019 case. When the <em>ca. sa. </em>was set aside for irregularity, it ceased to be a justification to the parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>guilty of the irregularity; as to them it is void, and as if it had never existed. The arrest, therefore, by relation, became void and without authority, and the action of trespass was the proper action.\u201d Judgment for the plaintiff. So in Coddrington <em>v. </em>Lloyd, 8 Adol. &amp; Ellis, 467; 35 Eng. C. L., which was also trespass for an assault and false imprisonment, under a voidable <em>ca. sa., </em>sued out by the defendant against the plaintiff, under which the defendant'was arrested, and which was afterward set aside. The action was against both the party and the attorney who issued the writ.</p>\n<p data-order=\"120\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b332-5\">Lord Denman, C. J., says: \u201c The plaintiff here was arrested on a writ, which was afterward declared by the court irregular. It was, therefore, as if there had been none.\u201d So also Patterson, J.: \u201c The action <em>lies </em>against the party, because the process, when set aside, is as if it had never existed, and if the party can not justify under it, neither can the attorney.\u201d The plaintiff had judgment against both defendants. See also Hayden <em>v. </em>Shed, 11 Mass. 300; per Jackson, J., Luddington <em>v. </em>Peck, 2 Conn. 700; Barker <em>v. </em>Braham, 3 Wils. 368; the Six Carpenters\u2019 case, 8 Coke, 293.</p>\n<p data-order=\"121\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AldD\">*The quashing of the writ, and annulling of the order awarding it, left the plaintiff, therefore, without any authority whatever to sustain the arrest and imprisonment of the principal defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"122\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b332-8\">Again, it was not necessary that the defendants should have set up the quashing of the process and rescinding of the order, to avail themselves of the defense that the writ was void. The authorities already cited show that when the writ is set aside, the parties stand as if it had never been issued. The order setting aside by relation, extends back to the issuing of the writ. It enables the defendants to show what the law now adjudges to have been the true character of the writ when issued. It removes the obstacle in the way of showing that the writ was absolutely void. It is matter of evidence only. The rule is settled, that m all cases where the act done, after plea pleaded or suit brought, extends back by relation to a period prior to the commencement of the suit; it is not necessary to plead it <em>puis darrein continuance. </em>Jackson <em>v. </em>McCall, 3 Cow. 75, is directly to the point. The defendant offered in evidence two sheriff\u2019s deeds, for lands sold before the commencement of the suit, both of them, however, ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>ecuted and delivered after is3ue joined in the case. The plaintiff objected that the deeds were inadmissible, except under a plea <em>puis darrein continuance. </em>Curia, per Sutherland, <em>J.: </em>\u201c Admitting that, by relation, the deeds are to be considered as having been-given at the time of the sale, does that dispense with the necessity of pleading the fact of delivery, according to its truth, <em>puis darrein continuance? </em>I am of opinion that it does. The defense relied on was the title acquired under the sheriff\u2019s sale. When did that title vest in the defendant, is the point of inquiry. If before the commencement of the suit, it was available under the general issue; if after issue joined, it should have been pleaded <em>puis darrein </em>continuance, and the date, or time of delivery of the evidences of title, is perfectly immaterial. The legal effect and operation of such delivery is the matter of defense, and not the instrument *itself. The legal effect of the delivery, then, in this case, having been to vest the title in the defendant by relation, as of October 2, 1818, the matter of defense did not arise subsequent to the joining of the issue, and need not be pleaded <em>puis darrein continuance. </em>1 am of opinion, therefore, that the judge erred in rejecting the sheriff\u2019s deeds on that ground.\u201d Under the principle here laid down, the legal effect and operation of setting aside the writ and order, is the matter of defense, and not the order setting aside. A plea <em>puis darrein continuance </em>is not therefore essential to. enable the defendants to avail themselves of what is now in law and truth, that the writ was void at the time of the arrest and imprisonment, and therefore void when the bond in suit was executed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"123\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b333-5\">The last plea is not, in form, a plea <em>puis darrein continuance. </em>That it is not such in substance, the case just cited clearly shows. It stands upon the record, then, as an ordinary case of an additional plea, filed by leave of the court, setting up matter of defense arising before suit brought.</p>\n<p data-order=\"124\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b333-6\">Nothing but a plea strictly <em>puis darrein </em>continuance, both in form and substance, operates as a waiver. Even this rule is not without its exceptions, as shown by Rayner et al. <em>v. </em>Dyett, 2 Wend. 300.</p>\n<p data-order=\"125\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b333-7\">The defendants, therefore, insist upon all their pleas, and claim to shelter themselves from a recovery under any one of them which, in the opinion of the court, may be found sufficient.</p>\n<p data-order=\"126\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b333-8\">I submit to the court that the demurrer is; in no respect, well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>taken, and therefore ask judgment upon it in favor of all the defendants.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"127\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b315-11\">The law of Massachusetts as to the amount, etc., of the prison-bounds bond,\u2019is as ours. Vide 14 Pickering, 523.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"128\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b334-5\">Hitchcock, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AsL\">A variety of questions are presented by the pleadings in this case ; more, in fact, than what seem to the court necessary for the disposition of the case. The action is upon what it usually denominated a prison-bounds bond. Previous to the enactment of the law to abolish imprisonment for debt, it was at the election of the judgment creditor to ^proceed against the property of his creditor by writ of <em>ft. fa., </em>or against the body of his debtor by writ of <em>ca. sa. </em>But, since the enactment of that law, judgments can not be enforced by <em>ca. sa., </em>except in certain specified cases; and an examination of the cases specified will show, that it is only where a debtor attempts to defraud his creditors, can he be arrested and imprisoned. This law is one favorable to the personal liberty of the citizen, and should be liberally construed to effect that object. By this law no process, cither mesne or final, can issue against the body of a defendant, except in pursuance of an order previously made by the court, or a judge of the court, from which the process is issued. If it be issued without such order, it is void as to all persons interested, except the officer to whom it is directed, and voidable as to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">By the last plea filed in this case, it appears that the <em>ca. sa. </em>in virtue of which Lewis Robinson was arrested and imprisoned, had been set aside and quashed, and that the order allowing the\u201d same has been set aside, rescinded, and vacated by an order of this court. True, this was done subsequent to the appeal of the ease now under consideration; and strictly speaking, the plea embodying these facts should have been one <em>puis darrein continuance. </em>But the partiess seem to have treated it as if properly filed; and it is met by a demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">The question submitted to the court is, whether these facts constitute a legal bar to the plaintiff\u2019s action ? They show that the plaintiff has, without authority of law, caused Lewis Robinson to be imprisoned, and to procure his discharge, he, together with his sureties, were induced to execute the bond now in suit. The <em>ca. sa. </em>has been quashed, and so far as the plaintiff is concerned, the case is as if none had been issued. The order in pursuance of which it was issued, has been vacated. It is the same as if no order had been made. Where a debtor is legally imprisoned, he can not he en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>titled to the privilege of the prison bounds until ho has given bond to the creditor, according to the provisions of tho statute; and if in such *case he escapes, the bond is forfeited. But where a debtor is imprisoned by procurement of his creditor, acting without the authority of law, and to procure his enlargement executes such bond, it seems to the court that such bond must bo held to be void. The facts set forth in this plea show that the imprisonment was illegal, and if so, the bond given to procure the enlargement of the prisoner can not be enforced, either against him or his sureties. In tho opinion of the court, this last plea is a good bar to the plaintiff\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">We might stop here, but it may be well to consider for a moment tho other pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">The first plea demurred to, is the plea of <em>nil debet. </em>Is this a good plea to an action of debt upon a bond like the one now in suit? We think it is. In debt, where a specialty is the foundation of the action, <em>nil debet </em>is not a good plea. But where the deed is only the inducement to the action, and extrinsic matters of fact the foundation, as in the present case, or on appeal bonds and such like, then <em>nil debet </em>is a proper plea. 11 Johns. 472.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">The third plea is, that the bond was taken for too small a sum; and the fourth, that the sum was too great.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">It seems to the court, that neither of these pleas can avail the defendants. True, the statute requires that the penalty of the bond shall be double the amount of tho debt for which the prisoner is imprisoned. But it is not void if a little more or less. If more, nothing can be recovered for a breach of the condition beyond the debt. If loss, it certainly can do the obligors no harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">The fifth plea is, that no order was made by the court, or any judge thereof, upon affidavit of the plaintiff, etc., authorizing the issuing of a <em>ca. sa., </em>etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-10\">It seems to be admitted by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, that if the <em>ca. sa. </em>was void, then the imprisonment was illegal, and the bond of course void; but it is supposed that the process is not void, unless the officer would be a trespasser in executing it. Wo understand the rule, so far as the officer is concerned, *to be this: If the process is tmid upon its face, the officer commits a trespass if he executes it; but if upon its face it is good, he will be protected, although the process may be avoided by extrinsic circumstances. But this case is not one in which the officer is concerned. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>It is the plaintiff in the execution who is prosecuting this suit. So far as he is concerned, the process may be void, although being good upon its face, it would protect the officer. This plea shows that the plaintiff caused a <em>ca. sa. </em>to be issued without any previous order of the court, which order is indispensably neessary. It was issued by his procurement, not only without law, but in violation of positive law. The act was, on his part, an illegal act, and for an arrest made under it he would be chargeable with trespass. An arrest was made. So far as the plaintiff is concerned, it was illegal ; and to procure the enlargement of the prisoner, the bond in suit was executed. Under these circumstances, the plaintiff can not avail himself of the bond thus illegally procured.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">The next plea in order is, that the <em>ca. sa. </em>did not recite or set forth any order made by the court, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">Such recital is not necessary. Before a <em>ca. sa. </em>can be issued, proof must be made to the court or judge, by the affidavit of the plaintiff, and by other evidence, that the case is within the exceptions in the statute; whereupon an order is made for the issuing of the writ. This does not, however, constitute any part of the writ; nor need it be recited therein, nor indorsed thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">The eighth plea is, that the <em>ca. sa. </em>was issued under an order made by the court, solely upon the affidavit of the plaintiff, without any other testimony, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">It has frequently been decided by this court upon the circuit, that a <em>ca sa., </em>so issued, was void as to all persons, except the officer to whom directed. It was so held in this case, when the order of the court of common pleas was before it on <em>certiorari. </em>If this is .a correct construction of the law, a <em>ca sa. </em>*so issued, would not protect a judgment creditor when sued in trespass; nor can such creditor avail himself of a \u201c prison-bounds bond,\u2019\u2019 given to procure the enlargement of a prisoner arrested under such process.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">The seventh plea is a plea of duress.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-10\">It is admitted by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, that this plea, as filed by the principal in the bond, is good ; but it is insisted, that although the principal may avail himself of this defense, yet that his sureties can not \u2014 that they will not be permitted to plead the duress of their principal; and many authorities are cited to sustain this position. Upon this point, however, the authorities are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>contradictory; and it seems to us that those opposed to this principle are most consistent with reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">The tenth plea sets forth, in substance, that although the order for the <em>oa. sa. </em>was based upon the affidavit of the plaintiff, that the said Lewis was about to remove his body out of the jurisdiction of the court, whereas, in fact, the said Lewis was not about so to remove his body.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">The object of this plea is, to put in issue the question of fact, whether the said Lewis was about to remove. The defendants can not avail themselves of this defense. True, the order for a <em>oa. sa. </em>is procured upon an <em>ex farte </em>application of a plaintiff or his attorney ; yet when once procured, it is so far conclusive that it can not be collaterally impeached.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">Upon full consideration, the court are of opinion that the demurrer is well taken to the third, fourth, sixth and tenth pleas; and the first, fifth, seventh, eighth, and last pleas are sufficient in law to bar the plaintiff\u2019s action.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
