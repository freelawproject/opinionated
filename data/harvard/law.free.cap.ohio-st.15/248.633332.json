In the common picas, the plaintiffs in error were declared against by the defendant in error, plaintiff in the court below, for breaking %md entering the close of the defendant in error, on November 1, 1842, with' a <em>continuando, </em>and with force and arms, in the township of Hopewell, etc., tearing down, breaking to pieces, damaging, demolishing, and destroying divers, to wit, two, abutments of a mill-dam of the defendant in error, erected by him across a watercourse called Jonathan\u2019s creek, for the purpose of supplying a certain saw-mill with water, etc., of the value of fifty dollars, etc. This is the first count.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b210-9\">The declaration contains a second count in trespass, for destroying one abutment of a certain mill-dam, the property of the defendant in error, of the value of fifty dollars, etc., without any averment, in express terms, <em>of the breach of the close.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b210-10\">The plaintiff in error plead : The general issue to both counts, <em>liberum tenementum, </em>and that the said abutment, so demolished, was upon the freehold of the plaintiffs in error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b210-11\">The replication now assigns the <em>locus in quo </em>especially, and avers that the plaintiff in error, for a valuable consideration, a part of which was paid, agreed to permit the defendant in error to abut a mill-dam upon his land, and in pursuance of this agreement, and with the consent of the plaintiff in error, he entered and erected the abutment on the land of the plaintiff in error, and that plaintiff in error afterward broke and entered the close on which the abutment was so erected with his consent, and demolished it, etc. This replication was demurred to, and the demurrer overruled; and thereupon the defendant rejoined, averring the contract set up in the replication was by parol, without-any note or memorandum in writing, and therefore void under the statute for the prevention of frauds and perjuries.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b211-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>To this rejoinder the defendant in error demurred.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b211-5\">The court of common pleas sustained the demurrer to the rejoinder, which disposed of this special issue; and the cause was submitted to a jury in the common pleas, at the November term, 1845, on the general issue of .not guilty, by all the plaintiffs in error, and verdict and judgment for the defendant in error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b211-6\">*A bill of exceptions was taken during the trial, from which it appears that the defendant in error gavo to the jury evidence tending to show that the defendant in error had constructed the abutments, mentioned in the pleadings, on the soil and freehold of one of the plaintiffs in error, Elisha Wilson, by the parol license and consent of the said Elisha, given for a consideration agreed upon between the parties, and that the said abutment had been maintained from September 4, 1838, until the time of the alleged trespass, when, the plaintiff in error, E. Wilson, with the other plaintiffs in error, by his. orders, destroyed the same ; and the evidence being closed, the counsel for the plaintiffs in error asked the court to instruct the jury, that if the act complained of was done by the plaintiffs in error, on the freehold of said E. Wilson, by himself and by his orders, and if the defendant in error had no other right than what was conferred by a parol license-to construct the abutment thereon, and the construction and maintenance thereof, for the term aforesaid, and if there was no written paper or note, in writing, evidencing said license, the defendant in error could not maintain the action; which instructions the court refused to give, but, on the contrary, charged the jury that, on those facts, the action would lie, and they ought to find for the defendant in error. To this charge of the court the counsel for the plaintiffs in error excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b211-7\">Several errors are assigned:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b211-8\">1.

That Chalfant acquired no right to the <em>locus in quo, </em>by the parol license, the same being void under the statute of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>^frauds, and that he was himself a trespasser in erecting the abutment; and,</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b212-5\">2. That even if the grant were binding and valid, as conveying an easement, the action was misconceived; it should have been case instead .of trespass <em>guare clausum fregit </em>He relied upon the case of Miller <em>v. </em>Auburn and Syracuse Railroad Company, 6 Hill, 61, and the eases there cited.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b212-6\">P. Van Trump, for defendant:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b212-7\">That a parol contract relating to lands, executed, can be enforced, has been decided or recognized so often as no longer to be an open question. The Ohio cases are Wilbur <em>v. </em>Paine, 1 Ohio, 151; Buck <em>v. </em>Waddle, 1 Ib. 357; Waggoner <em>v. </em>Spick, 3 Ib. 292; Moore <em>v. </em>Beasley, 3 Ib. 294; Reed <em>v. </em>McGrew, 5 Ib. 375.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b212-8\">A parol license is also recognized by courts, and when executed, is not countermandable. Winter <em>v. </em>Brockwell, 8 East, 508; Webb <em>v. </em>Paternoster, Poph. 151; Rerick <em>v. </em>Kerr, 14 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 267; Lefevre <em>v. </em>Lefevre, 4 Ib. 241; McKellip <em>v. </em>McIlkenny, 4 Watts, 317; Gay <em>v. </em>Bartlett, 20 Pick. 186; 7 N. H. 237; 7 Bing. 682.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b212-9\">The contract being a binding one, and the right of Chalfant under it such a one as the law sanctions, it is necessary, to his full enjoyment of it, that the interest of Chalfant in the abutment-should be regarded and protected as an exclusive freehold interest. This being so, of course trespass lies for an injury to it, such as this. This view of the case is sustained by the following authorities : 2 Johns. 22; 8 Ib. 220 ; 18 Pick. 385.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b212-10\">Wood, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"APh\">Whether the declaration, as originally filed <em>in </em>this case, was sufficient- to maintain this action, is now of no moment. The new assignment in the replication, places it before the court, as to the whole cause of action, in trepass <em>*guare clausum fregit. </em>In such case, the gist of the action is the breach of the close, and other wrongs laid are merely in aggravation of the damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-12\">The other assignments, all of them, may be considered as presenting substantially the same question, <em>whether there was a breach of the close of the defendant in error ? </em>Whether the <em>locus in guo </em>was merely the right of the defendant in error to an <em>easement </em>in E. Wilson\u2019s land, or a freehold, it would not aid us, in this case, to inquire: but had ho, in plain English, a right of possession, as against the owner in foe, or a wrong-doer? This is necessary, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>\u2022:he action fails. It is argued that the <em>license being by parol, </em>and no note or memorandum in writing, it is void and does not authorize an entry under it. If this be so, it follows that the defendant in error was himself a trespasser, in the entry and erection which he made on the land of the plaintiff in error, E. Wilson; was liable to an action, and, if sued, his license could not have been pleaded in bar. On this subject, the decisions of judicial tribunals of our sister states differ. 6 Hill, 61; 4 Watts, 317; 4 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 241; 10 Johns. 426. But in Ohio, we think it can, at this day, be hardly considered <em>as an 'open question. </em>Part performance of parol contracts, especially when the non-execution would operate as a fraud on the rights of the vendor, have repeatedly been enforced in equity, and a <em>parol license executed </em>has been held to be <em>irrevocable, </em>in numerous instances upon the circuit, <em>at law. </em>A license to ditch and flow water through a race, to dam a stream and set back water on the plaintiff\u2019s land, are instances within my own knowledge, where a license executed was held to be irrevocable, and a bar both in trespass and in case. In the case at bar, the license was executed and consideration paid; and as the defendant in error had the right to make the abutment, it follows, as incident to that right, that he acquired the lawful possession of the <em>locus in quo </em>for that purpose, and the right of egress and regress to keep it in repair and control it, so long as it remains for the purpose, at least, for which it was constructed. This bright of possession is <em>exclusive, </em>and may be maintained against the owner of the freehold, at law ; and trespass against him for any wrongful invasion of such possession, in our opinion, lies. The court wore, therefore, right in overruling the demurrer to the replication, and in sustaining the demurrer .to the rejoinder, and also in the charge given, and refused to be given, to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b213-6\">Birchard, J., doubted whether the parol license was not void, under the provisions of the act for the prevention of frauds and perjuries.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
