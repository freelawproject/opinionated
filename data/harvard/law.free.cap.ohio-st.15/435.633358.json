The deed from ^Farmer to Letts is the last deed in the chain of title on record. Letts conveyed to Lewis Nichols. This deed is not on record ; and neither Nichols nor any of his grantors were ever in possession of the land. On October 25, a. d. 1831, Nichols, then residing in the State of Now York, attempted to convey the land in controversy to Benjamin Paine, the lessor of the plaintiff, and at the same time delivered over to Paine the recorded deed from Farmer to Letts, and the recorded deed from Letts to Nichols The conveyance from Nichols to Paine proved defective for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>want of a seal. This mistake was corrected by the decree of the court of common pleas, in chancery, in 1839, perfecting the title of Paine as against Nichols. The defendant, Mooreland, was then in possession of the land, and was not made a party to the proceedings in chancery. The execution of the unrecorded deeds is admitted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-5\">The defendant claims under proceedings in attachment against N iehols. On June 20, 1832 (over eight months after Nichols attempted to convey to Paine, and delivered to him the unrecorded title papers), an attachment was sued out against Nichols by one John Elder, and this writ was returned by the sheriff with the following return indorsed, to wit: \u201cAttached the following described property, viz: All that tract or parcel of land, lying and being in the county of Licking and State of Ohio, in range 12, township 3, and section 1, the south half of lot number-, except twenty acres, to be taken out of the southwest corner of said half-lot, commencing at the southwest corner and running north forty rods; thence east, so far as to contain twenty acres; which said twenty acres of land was sold to Bazaleel Mooreland by the defendant Nichols.\u201d At the March term of the court of common pleas, 1833, a judgment was rendered under this attachment, by default, for \u00a772.21 debt, and \u00a79.50 damages and costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-8\">After the rendition of said judgment, and ou July 6, A. D. 1833, a writ of execution was issued, called a <em>*fieri facias et levari </em>facias, against Nichols; and upon the return day of said writ, the sheriff returned the same, with the following return indorsed, to wit: \u201c Received this writ July 19, 1833. No goods. And in pursuance of the command thereof, I, on the 29th day of July thereafter, levied on the following described tract of land, to wit: Lying and being in the county of Licking, and State of Ohio, in range twelve, township three, and section one, TJ. S.

It is also admitted and understood, that the record and papers in the attachment suit, and the deeds and papers in the possession of the lessor of the plaintiff, and the record in the suit in chancery in the common pleas court, of Paine <em>v. </em>Nichols, are all'admitted in evidence, and to be considered as part of this agreed ease, reserving all questions touching the admissibility of the record in the chancery suit of Paine <em>V. </em>Nichols, as evidence in the cause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-8\">It is also agreed and understood to be admitted, that the deed made by the sheriff, under the order of the court, in the attachment suit, to John Elder, the purchaser, was executed and delivered on November 4, a. d. 1834, and was received for record and recorded (book W, p. 553), on January 23, a. d. 1836.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-9\">The proceedings in attachment, under which the defendant derives title, do not show that any notice of the pendency of the suit in attachment was given, as the statute requires.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b368-10\">Geo. B. Smythe, for plaintiff:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b368-11\">1. At the time of the attachment, Nichols, in fact, held but the naked legal title, <em>in trust for Paine. </em>This trust estate was not subject to execution against the trustee. 1 Ohio, 258. It is not sought to disturb the principles decided in Scribner <em>v. </em>Lockwood, and Parker\u2019s Lessee <em>v. </em>Miller, in 9 Ohio; but they surely have carried the law far enough. Here the purchaser was not injured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>by the non-recording of the deed ; because if he went to the record for information, there were other defects in the chain of title, as well as this.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b369-5\">The act under which this land was sold, provides that it shall be sold \u201cunder the same restrictions and regulations as if the same had been levied upon by execution.\u201d A sale on execution \u201cshall vest in the purchaser as good and as perfect an *estate in the premises therein mentioned, as was vested in the party at or after the time when the lands became liable,\u201d etc. Nichols at the time of the attachment, as before stated, was not <em>vested' </em>of <em>an estate. </em>Swan\u2019s Stat. 476.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b369-6\">2. There was no notice of the pendency of the proceedings in attachment, as required by the statute, without which the court had no jurisdiction. This was not a proceeding according to the course of the common law. It was a proceeding under the statute, affecting title to real estate. Hence the provisions of the statute must be fully eompliod with. Adams\u2019 Lessee <em>v. </em>Jeffreys, 12 Ohio, 271; 13 Mass. 73. But the precise point made here has been decided, as contended for the plaintiff, in Warren v.Webster et al., 13 Ohio, 506.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b369-7\">It may be said this is a proceeding <em>in rem, </em>and therefore the land is bound by the action of the court. It is true the form of the proceedings is <em>in rem; </em>but they are not effectual to charge the land, till after there is a judgment <em>in personam.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b369-8\">3. The return upon the attachment is too vague to cover any particular land, and parol evidence is inadmissible to prove what land was actually attached. 4 Mass. 205; 7 Johns. 217 ; 4 Mass. 196; 5 Wheat. 359; 4 Peters, 350; 13 Johns. 77; 3 Ohio, 272; Wright, 768; 1 N. H. 93, and 5 Ohio, 459.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b369-9\">4. The sale by the sheriff conveyed no title, for the reason that no correct process was issued, upon which the sale was made. The statute required that an order should issue ; the process issued was a <em>fi. fa. </em>This was void for the want of power to issue it, and of course all proceedings under it are void. 1 Ohio, 466; 9 Ohio, 112.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b369-10\">5. D. King, for defendant:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b369-11\">The plaintiff makes four objections to the defendant\u2019s title:</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b369-12\">1. That at .the time of issuing the attachment, Nichols held but the naked legal title in trust for Paine.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b369-13\">*2. That the proceedings in the attachment were void for the want of the requisite notice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b370-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>3. That in consequence of imperfection in the description of the land attached, tho levy was void for uncertainty.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b370-5\">4. That tho process under which the sale was made, was void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b370-6\">1. It is believed that the decision of this court, in the case of tho Lessee of Parker <em>v. </em>Miller, 9 Ohio, 108, is a complete answer to the first objection. It is claimed that there is a difference between this caso and the one referred to in this particular, to wit, that the title of Nichols, the defendant in the attachment, did not appear on record, and that therefore the attaching creditor was bound to look after his title papers, which, being in.the hands of the plaintiff, would have led to a discovery of his rights. The force of this reasoning is not perceived.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b370-7\">2. To the second objection, that the proceedings in the attachment were void for the want of the requisite notice, wo reply, that the proceedings can not be thus collaterally impeached, unless the omission to give notice goes to the jurisdiction of the court. Now, it is clear that, the jurisdiction of the court was complete, provided the requisite affidavit was made, and tho property of the defendant in the attachment was seized. It is a proceeding <em>in </em>rem, and unless some property of the defendant can bo found, the jurisdiction fails. The court, on the filing of the proper affidavit, is required to issue its writ; and if anything can be found for the writ to act upon, the jurisdiction is obtained. In tho case of Mitchell <em>v. </em>Eyster, 7 Ohio, 257, it was held \u201cthat the fact of indebtedness of the defendant, his non-residence, and the actual levy upon his property, gave jurisdiction.\u201d And, in the case of Yoorhees <em>v. </em>Jackson, 10 Peters, 449, it was decided, \u201cthat the want of evidence of publication upon the record was, at most, but error, and did not vitiate the proceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b370-8\">It must be manifest, that the jurisdiction of the court is acquired before the notice is required to be given. Parker\u2019s Lessee <em>v. </em>Miller, 9 Ohio, 113.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A4h8\">*In the case of Lessee of Adams <em>v. </em>Jeffries, 12 Ohio, 272, tho court use this language: \u201cAfter jurisdiction is once acquired, however irregular and erroneous their proceedings may be, they can not be collaterally impeached, and they conclude all parties, unless annulled by <em>certiorari </em>or appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b370-10\">3. To tho objection, that tho levy of the writ of attachment was void, for want of certainty in the description of the property, we answer: The question of identity is always a matter for parol <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>proof, and it is admitted, in the argued case, that such proof can be made, and that it is, in fact, the same land.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b371-5\">The case of the Lessee of Matthews <em>v. </em>Thompson et al., 3 Ohio, 273, settles this point. The levy, as indorsed on the writ in that case, was, \u201cupon 100 acres of land in section 4, township 7, range 4,\u201d with no further description. The court held, \u201cthat the return ought to have been so specific as to enable the purchaser to ascertain the land which he purchased with certainty. This defect, however, may be supplied by parol testimony.\u201d In the same case, it was said by the court, \u201c that a variance between the levy and the description in the (sheriff\u2019s) deed might also be explained by parol.\u201d \u201c If the levy was actually made on the tract contained within the boundaries set out by the deed, and the fact was known and understood at the time of the sale, no injustice has been done.\u201d \u201cAn innocent purchaser, under such circumstances, ought not to suffer by the careless manner in which the officer has stated his proceedings, if, in point of fact, they have been substantially correct.\u201d 3 Ohio, 274.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b371-6\">4. The last objection is, that the process upon which the sale was made, was void. The statute requires the property attached \u201cto be sold by order of court, under, the same restrictions and regulations as if the same had been levied in execution.\u201d Collated Stat. 92. This, we claim, has been substantially done. The <em>ft. fa. </em>issued by the clerk was the order of the court on which the sale was made. The court acts by its clerk, and the act of the clerk was the act of the court. *If such proceeding was not strictly formal, the thing, nevertheless,'intended to be done was dono, and no injustice was done to any one. After the confirmation of the sale by the court, and deed ordered to the purchaser, it surely can not be held that such -irregularity would affect the title.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b371-7\">Read, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aox2\">Both parties derive title from Nichols; the plaintiff by direct purchase, and the defendant under a sale in attachment. The deed to Paine was defective, for want of seal. Its date was October 25, 1831. This defect in the deed was barred by decree in chancery against Nichols, in the year 1839. This deed was not put upon record. Eight months after its execution and delivery, to wit, on June 20, 1832, a writ of attachment was sued out against Nichols, at the instance of John Elder, and such pro. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>ceedings were had in this suit, that the land convoyed to Paine was sold, bought by Elder, and, subsequently, by competent conveyance, transmitted to defendant. The judgment in attachment remains unreversed, and the defendant was not a party to the suit against Nichols, to correct the deed; and, at the time of the purchase under the attachment, Elder had no .notice of Paine\u2019s equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">The determination of the following propositions must dispose of this cause'</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">1. Had Nichols an interest in the land subject to attachment?</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">2. Were the proceedings iu attachment void ?</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">If Nichols had no interest in the land, or if the proceedings in attachment were void, the plaintiff must recover. But if he had an attachable interest, and the proceedings in attachment are not void, the defendant must recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">As to the decree in chancery, perfecting the title from Nichols to Paine; it is of no binding effect as to the defendant, as he claimed title to the land and was in possession at the time suit was brought, and was not made a party. Yet, the proceedings in such suit were competent evidence; as in one aspect of the case, to wit, if'the proceedings in the attachment should *be held void, it would warrant' a recovery, as the plaintiff must recover upon the strength of his own title, and show that he had acquired the legal title from Nichols. Beyond this, the chancery proceeding can have no effect. As to the question, whether the land was subject to attachment as the property of Nichols; Nichols was the admitted owner of the land, unless ho had divested himself of title by the conveyance to Paine. It is not contended that the defective deed to Paine transferred more to him than an equity. Nichols was still clothed with the legal title, and had the power to transfer the whole interest in the land to any person purchasing for a valuable consideration, without notice. In fact, he was- the true owner, so far. as third persons were concerned, without notice. It would not be contended,'that, had be made sale to an innocent purchaser, without notice, that it would not have transmitted the whole title. Purchasers at judicial sales, -without notice, are treated as innocent purchasers. They fall within the same principle of protection that is extended to private purchasers. Hence, the land was subject to attachment, as the property of Nichols. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>This doctrino is settled in numerous reported decisions. Lessee of Parker <em>v. </em>Miller, and Scribner <em>v. </em>Lockwood, 9 Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Are the proceedings in attachment void? It is contended they are void because no notice of the pendency of the attachment was given, as required by the statute. If the jurisdiction of the court once attached, subsequent irregularities would render the judgment voidable only; and it would remain valid until reversed, and can not bo impeached collaterally.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">What, then, gives the court jurisdiction in a proceeding in attachment ? The filing of the proper affidavit, issuing the writ, and attaching the property. The moment the writ goes into the hands of the officer, he is authorized and required to seize the property. When this is done, the property is taken out of the possession of the debtor into the custody of the law. The court have authority, at any time after the return of the writ, to direct property of a perishable nature to be sold. It is not *until after the return of the writ that the clerk is directed to make out the advertisement, which the plaintiff is required to have published, as the statute directs. If he neglects to have such notice published, for six weeks successively, the statute directs that the attachment shall be dismissed with costs. Here, then, for a period of six weeks at least, if the publication of the notice only gives jurisdiction, the court both have, and have not, jurisdiction over the property seized in attachment. It is contended the court has no jurisdiction, and yet the statute authorizes the court to exercise a judicial act over property attached; namely, to determine whether it is perishable, and if so, to direct its sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">Will it be contended, then, that the court has jurisdiction over perishable property before notice consummated; but not over property not perishable? This is a distinction not authorized by the statute. A court acquires jurisdiction by its own process. If the process of the court be executed upon the person or thing, concerning which the court are to pronounce judgment, jurisdiction is acquired. The writ draws the person or thing within the power of the court; the court once having, by its process, acquired the power to adjudicate upon a person or thing, it has what is called jurisdiction. This power or jurisdiction is only acquired by its process. To give jurisdiction is the object of process. The mode of executing or serving process is sometimes directed or permitted to be by notice by publication. All process issues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>under the seal of the court. Notice by publication is not process, but, in certain cases in contemplation of law, is equivalent to service of process. The process in attachment is the writ authorizing and directing a seizure of the property. No process is issued against the person, because the proceeding is <em>in rem. </em>The statute, however, regards it but just that notice should bo given to the debtor, not for the purpose of giving the court jurisdiction over the subject matter, but to permit the debtor to have an opportunity to protect his rights, and directs that the writ shall be quashed if it be not given. .The distinction \u2022 is between a *lack of power or want of jurisdiction in the court, and a wrongful or defective execution of the power. In the first instance, all acts of the court, not having jurisdiction or power, are void ; in the latter, voidable only. A court, then, may act: 1. Without power or jurisdiction. 2. Having power or jurisdiction, may exercise it wrongfully; or, 3. Irregularly. In the first instance, the act or judgment of the court is wholly void, and is as though it had not been done; the second is wrong, and must be reversed upon error; the third is irregular, and must be corrected by motion. The latter is where the power is rightfully exercised, but in an irregular way. Hence there is a vast distinction between a defect of power, a wrongful exercise of power, and an irregular exercise of power.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">Now, what happened in this instance? The court had the power, by the service of its process, to proceed and give judgment; but a circumstance occurred after having acquired such power, which forbid them the exercise of it; but having it, they did exorcise it, which was error. Such appears to have been the decision of the court in Parker <em>v. </em>Miller, 9 Ohio, 108, and caBes there cited. The case in 10 Peters, Yoorhees <em>v. </em>The Bank of the United States, recognizes these principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">It is true that it has been decided, in Warner <em>v. </em>Webster*, 13 Ohio, 506, that a judgment in attachment, if notice had not been given, was void. That ease was rightly decided, although a wrong reason was assigned. The truth is, in that case, an equity was attached, when the statute under which that proceeding was had, only authorized an attachment against a legal estate. The process, therefore, not having been executed upon a subject matter within its rightful action, brought nothing before the court upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>which they had power to act; and therefore the judgment was void for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">But it is contended that the purchaser under the sale-bond in the attachment, took nothing, because the sale was upon a <em>ft. fa., </em>and not an order of the court. The act allowing and regulating writs of attachment, of June 24,1824, directs that, after judgment, the property attached shall be sold by order of *the court. It is contended that, in this case, the land was not sold by order of the court, and, therefore, that the officer making sale, had no power to sell, and that hence the sale did not divest Nichols of the legal title. Judgment had been rendered against the debtor in attachment, to be satisfied out of the property attached, if there was sufficient, and if'not, execution could issue for the residue, as in other cases. A general execution issued in the first instance, which would have authorized the sale of any and all property of the judgment debtor, other than that attached. The officer making the sale, hence, was clothed with power to sell; the difficulty was, not defect of power, but too much power. In its exercise, however, he conformed strictly to the limitations of the statute, and sold only the land seized in attachment. The court failed to restrict the power of sale, conferred upon the officer by the general writ; but, on the return of the writ, finding that the power of sale had been rightfully exercised, the act of the officer was recognized as right, and the sale confirmed. We regard this as a mere irregularity. And it is doubtful, even, whether the court, had motion been made to correct it, and the confirmation of sale had been resisted on that ground, would have entertained the motion, for the reason, that no one had sustained any injury by the irregularity. All bad been done which should have been done. The general power of sale had been limited by the act of exercise, although not restricted by express order. To have set the sale aside for this ground, would have been to create the delay and expense of having the same thing done over again, precisely as it had already been done. This is not at all like the case of executors and administrators. The power to sell the land here results from the judgment. The order of the court is merely to restrict and direct the execution of this power. The power to sell results to executors and administrators alone, from the order of the court to sell. Hence, if there be in that case no order to sell, it is like a case of sale on execution without judgment. The order to sell lands un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>der attachment, limiting the sale to the lands attached, is a limitation, not a grant of power. The order to administrators and executors to *sell lands, confers the power to sell. The lack of the one is a mere irregularity of the other \u2014 a total defect of power. Hence the difference as to the results.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">There has been much ingenious and able argument in this case, to show what could be proved by parol, and what must be established by record \u2014 what will be presumed, and what must be established by positive proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">We rest the ease, nakedly, upon the ground, so far as the proceedings in attachment are concerned, that there was a judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, unrevorsed, conferring the power to sell the land in question, which can not be impeached in this collateral way; that the defects and irregularities complained of, should have been remedied by writ of error, or motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">In this view of the case, then, the defendant, by the proceedings in attachment, is clothed with the legal title ; and hence judgment must be rendered in his favor. Judgment for defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
