'The first count states, in substance, that the defendants, on July 23, 1838, associated themselves together, with sundry other persons, under the name and character of the G-erman *Bank of Wooster, and assumed to act as a company duly incorporated by law, and authorized to execute all the powers, privileges, and immunities of a bank, under and by virtue of the act entitled an act to incorporate .certain banks therein named, and to extend the charters of existing incorporated banks, passed February 23, 1816; that the defendants, being so associated, and pretending to act under the authority aforesaid, from the day and year aforesaid, continued to exercise the customary powers, privileges, and immunities of an incorporated bank, by lending money, issuing notes and bills for circulation, and performing the other ordinary business of a bank of issue, and of discount and deposit and exchange, for the space .of throe years; that the defendants, while so associated, and while assuming to act under the pretended authority aforesaid, through the agency of their officers in said pretended bank, did issue and put in circulation, as bank notes and bills, duly authorized by law and correct banking usage, the several notes and bills thereafter set forth, in each of which said several notes and bills the defendants bound themselves, in the name ' and style of the president, directors, and company of the Gorman Bank of Wooster, to pay to the persons therein named, or bearer, the amount thereof on demand, and each of which notes and bills was subscribed by the said Benjamin Bentley, as cashier, and by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>William M. Combs, or by Hiram B. Wellman, as president of said pretended bank; and then followed a pertinent description of the notes and bills on which the plaintiff claimed to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b556-5\">The declaration then further averred that the plaintiff, confiding in the pretensions and professions -made to the public by the defendants that they were duly incorporated, and authorized to act and exercise the banking powers and privileges aforesaid, and also confiding in the pretensions and professions of the defendants, that they were, in good faith and according to law, exercising the powers, privileges, and immunities of a bank, received in good faith, and for a valuable consideration became the holder of the aforesaid notes and bills, and that he was still the holder thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ArN5\">*The declaration then further alleged that the said law, entitled as aforesaid, passed February 23, 1816, so far as the same related to the incorporation of the stockholders of the German Bank of Wooster, by the name and style of the president, directors, and company of the German Bank of Wooster, had been violated, and said corporation had become liable to a decree of forfeiture, for abuse of the corporate franchise, and for non-user, prior to the timo when the defendants so associated themselves together; and that the defendants, when so associated, and .when in the exercise of the powers, privileges and immunities of a bank, under said pretended authority, and when they issued and put into circulation the notes and bills set forth in the declaration, were not duly organized, nor acting either in the proper corporate name, or by a board of directors and officers duly elected and constituted m conformity to said act of incorporation, and under which they protended to act, but, on the contrary, wholly failed to comply with all and singular the requisitions and duties required of them by said laws, according to the true intent and meaning thereof; and also that the defendants, so associated as aforesaid, were not possessed of a proper and suitable <em>bona fide </em>capital for said bank, and did not conduct the business of their said bank in good faith, but deceitfully and fraudulently confederating and combining together, and contriving to cheat and defraud the community at large, as well as the plaintiff \u2014 as the holder of said notes and bills \u2014after issuing and putting into circulation the notes and bills of their said bank, to the amount of 8125,000, and after contracting a largo indebtedness to sundry persons, for money deposited in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>said bank and otherwise, the defendants, so associated as aforesaid, closed their said bank, and ceased to .do any further business as such, professing that said bank had become insolvent, and refusing to redeem its notes and bills, so hold by the plaintiff as aforesaid, as well as the notes and bills generally of said bank, according to the tenor and effect thereof, and to discharge the other liabilities of said bank, although often requested so to do. And the defendants, in order the more ^effectually to defraud the plaintiff, and their creditors generally, and to secure in their own hands the property which they had acquired by the said banking operation, after having lent out the funds and money of said bank, to the amount of 1150,000, to several of the defendants, individually, on the day and year aforesaid, discharged, or pretended to discharge, the said liabilities of the said several defendants to said bank, by authorizing and permitting each of said defendants, so indebted to said bank, to transfer to said bank the amount of stock therein held by them, respectively, although the same- had become wholly worthless. By means of which said several premises the defendants falsely and fraudulently deceived the plaintiff, and caused him to lose and lay out of a large amount of money, to wit, etc., and otherwise greatly injurod the plaintiff, etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b557-5\">The second count was the same in substance as the first, except that the notes and bills held by the plaintiff were not specifically described.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b557-6\">The defendants filed a general demurrer, and to decide the questions thus raised, the case was reserved for decision here.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b557-7\">T. W. Bartley, for plaintiff:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b557-8\">It is the boast of the common law, that for every injury it furnishes a remedy. In cases of fraud and deceit, the comprehensivo remedy is an action on the ease ; and no principle is better settled than that, in all cases of fraud, where damage results, the action will lie. Paisley <em>v. </em>Freeman, 3 Term, 51; Haycroft <em>v. </em>Creasy, 2 East, 92; Tapp <em>v. </em>Leo, 3 B. &amp; P. 367 ; Harner <em>v. </em>Alexander, 5 Ib. 241; Wise <em>v. </em>Wilcox, 1 Day\u2019s Cases in Error, 22; Upton <em>v. </em>Vail, 6 Johns. 181; Barney <em>v. </em>Dewey, 13 Ib. 238; 1 East, 318; 1 Camp. N. P. 277.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b557-9\">The fraud may be perpetrated by any fraudulent device, pro-tense, or management. And it is sufficient if the intention be to defraud the public generally; without showing an intention to defraud the plaintiff in particular. Allen <em>V. </em>Addington, *7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>Wend. 9; Gordon <em>v. </em>Preston, 2 Day, 205; Williams <em>v. </em>Wood, 14 Wend. 126.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b558-5\">The action lies whenever the plaintiff is aggrieved and damni fied by unlawful acts done by the defendants, in pursuance of a combination or a conspiracy. Mott <em>v. </em>Danforth, 6 Watts, 306; Griffith <em>v. </em>Ogle, 1 Binn. 172; Penrod <em>v. </em>Mitchell, 8 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 522; Tappin <em>v. </em>Powers, 2 Hall, 277 ; Jones <em>v. </em>Baker, 7 Cow. 445 ; Gardner <em>v. </em>Preston, 2 Day, 209 ; Patton <em>v. </em>Gurney, 17 Mass. 186 ; 8 Wend. 676; 2 Murph. 329.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b558-6\">In view of these well-settled principles of common law, does not the declaration show a good cause of action ? Can the defendants shelter themselves behind their bank charter, when, as we claim, it has been violated, and is therefore void ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b558-7\">The charter of the German Bank of Wooster may be found in Chase\u2019s Stat. 913. Section 43 contains this provision: \u201cIf any bank, or the officers of any bank, shall fail to comply with all and singular the requisitions and duties required of them respectively by this act, according to the true intent and meaning thereof, such failure shall forfeit all and every advantage, privilege, and benefit of this act; and, from the time of such failure, shall be placed, adjudged, and considered in the same condition and situation as if this act had never been passed.\u201d Hence, then, by the very terms of this charter, if there has been a failure to comply with any of its provisions, from the time of such failure the charter was void, and conferred no power upon the defendants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b558-8\">Now, the declaration charges, in express terms, that the charter of the bank had been forfeited ; that the defendants acted without legal authority \u2014 were guilty of fraudulent acts; and that the plaintiff has been damnified thereby. And by the demurrer, these allegations are admitted. On what pretense, then, can it be said that the charter of the forfeited bank can protect these defendants from responsibility for their fraudulent acts?</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AVz6\">*The plaintiff is not precluded from pursuing this remedy by the act entitled \u201can act to prohibit the issuing and circulating of unauthorized bank paper,\u201d passed January 27, 1816. The remedy provided by that act is cumulative. If a statute gives a remedy, and docs not, in express words, or by implication, withhold the common law remedy for a matter which was actionable at common-law, the party has his option to pursue the common-law or the statutory remedy. 2 Inst. 200; 2 Roll. 49 ; 5 Johns. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>175; Skidmore <em>v. </em>Smith, 13 Johns. 322 ; Farmers\u2019 Turnpike Company <em>v. </em>Coventry, 10 Johns. 389; Bowen <em>v. </em>Huntington, 3 Conn. 423 ; Miles <em>v. </em>O\u2019Hara, 1 Serg &amp; Rawle, 32..</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b559-5\">It is where a statute creates a new right, and prescribes a particular remedy for the enjoyment of it, that he who claims the right must pursue the statutory remedy. Gedney <em>v. </em>Towksbury, 3 Mass. 307; Smith <em>v. </em>Drew, 5 Mass. 514.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b559-6\">But where a now right is created, and no remedy is prescribed, the common law will furnish an adequate remedy. Bigelow <em>v. </em>Cam. and Cone. Turnpike Corporation, 7 Mass. 202; Colden <em>v. </em>Eldred, 15 Johns. 220.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b559-7\">But assuming that the German Bank of Wooster had a legal existence at the time of the injuries complained of, does it protect these defendants? A corporation is a mere creature of the law and derives all its powers and capacities from the laws of its creation. It has no power except such as is expressly granted by its charter, or as is necessary to carry into effect the powers expressly granted. 2 Kent\u2019s Com. (2 ed.) 298 ; 2 Cranch, 127 ; 8 Ohio, 286.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b559-8\">The directors or managers of an incorporation are but its agents, to exercise its lawful powerR; when they exceed them, they act not as corporators but as individuals, and are liable as individuals. Ang. &amp; Ames on Corp. (late ed.) 242, 446, 450; Salem Bank <em>v. </em>Gloucester Bank, 17 Mass. 29; Lincoln and Kennebec Bank <em>v. </em>Richardson, 1 Greenl. 81; Lawrence <em>v. </em>Tucker, 7 Greonl. 195; Thayer <em>v. </em>Boston, 19 *Pick. 516 ; Stow <em>v. </em>Wise, 7 Conn. 129; Goodloe <em>v. </em>Cincinnati, 4 Ohio, 513.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b559-9\">It will hardly be contended, I imagine, that the wrongful acts complained of in the declaration were authorized by the charter of the bank. They were the acts of individuals as individuals.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b559-10\">The following authorities support this proposition: \u201cIf any number of persons combine with intent to injure and defraud another, they can not defend themselves against an action by showing they did the act in the character of corporators, under any charter whatever.\u201d Vose <em>v. </em>Grant, 15 Mass. 488; Spear <em>v. </em>Grant, 16 Mass. 15.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b559-11\">So, too, are corporators personally liable in an action on the case, for improperly obtaining and disposing of the funds or property of the company. Franklin Insurance Co. <em>v. </em>Jenkins, 3 Wend. 131: 2 Amer. C. L. 579; Vose <em>v. </em>Grant, 15 Mass. 488.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b560-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>John Harris and Levi Cox, for defendants, maintained :</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b560-5\">1. That if the German Bank of Wooster had violated its charter, as claimed by plaintiff\u2019s counsel, and as alleged in the declaration, whether by non-user or misuser, and if, in consequence, as further claimed, the corporation had ceased to exist, and was wholly void and inoperative, then, under tho act of 1824, the paper issued by these defendants, intended to pass as money, was wholly yoid.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b560-6\">2. That if it was intended to treat the bank as one authorized by law, whose paper was valid, then no mere irregularity in its organization, or in its business transactions, could be inquired into, collaterally, for the purpose of charging its officers and stockholders, in their individual capacity, with its indebtedness.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b560-7\">3. That this attempt to charge corporators individually for acts done by them as members of a corporation, even though fraudulent in an action on tho case, and not in chancery, *was a novelty in judicial proceedings, and that none of tho authorities cited by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel went so far as to sustain such an action ; while some of them sustained the position, distinctly, that such an action was not maintainable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b560-8\">4. That if this action could be sustained, endless litigation would ensue, and that it would be impossible to do equal justice to all the creditors, whereas, in chancery, the fund to be subjected could be appropriated among all the creditors and bill-holders of the bank, <em>pro rata.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b560-9\">5. That the declaration was uncertain, and did not charge the fraud upon the defendants in such positive and direct terms as to call upon them to meet it.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b560-10\">Birchard, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aax\">Two questions are presented for our consideration by this demurrer:</p>\n<p id=\"b560-11\">1. Can a special action on the case for fraud, which has resulted in damage of the plaintiffs, bo maintained in a case like this, upon sufficient declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-12\">2. Is this declaration good upon demurrer ?</p>\n<p id=\"b560-13\">It may bo regarded as a well-settled principle, that for every fraud or deceit which results in consequential damage to a party, he may maintain a special action on the case. Upton <em>v. </em>Vail, 6 Johns. 182. The principle is one of natural justice, long recognized in the law. Barney <em>v. </em>Dewey, 13 Johns. 236. And it ma\u00a3<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>ters not, so far as the right of action is concerned,- whether tho means of accomplishing the deception be complex or simple \u2014 a deep-laid scheme of swindling or a direct falsehood \u2014 a combined effort of a number of associates or the solo effort of a solitary individual \u2014 provided the deception be effected and the damage com plained of be the consequence of the deception. A valid act of incorporation, or an invalid and pretended right to exercise corporate franchises, is alike powerless to secure tho guilty from the consequences of their fraudulent conduct, where it has been knowingly resorted to as the mere means of chicane and imposition, and used to facilitate the work of deception and injury. Wore it otherwise, it would be a reproach to the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">*If the defendants, with the design to defraud the public generally, have knowingly combined tog\u00f3tber and held forth false and deceptive colors, and done acts which were wrong, and havo thereby injured the plaintiff, they must make him whole by responding to the full extent of that injury, and they can not place between him and justice, with any success, the charter of the German Bank of Wooster, whether it be valid or void, forfeited or in case. Neither a good nor a bad thing may be falsely used for purposes of deception and made a scapegoat for responsibility. Nor is it material that there should have been an intention to defraud the plaintiff in particular. If there was a general design to defraud all such as could be defrauded by taking their paper issues, it is sufficient, and the plaintiff may maintain his suit, provided ho has taken the paper and suffers from the fraud. Allen <em>v. </em>Addington, 7 Wend. 22; Williams <em>v. </em>Wood, 14 Wend. 126.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">Tho act incorporating the president and directors of the German Bank of Wooster,'admitting it to be in force, conferred no authority upon any person to hold out false colors to deceive the public-no authority to issue bills without the moans of redeeming them, and those who combined to use it for the purposes of swindling, acted for themselves rather than as agents of the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">They would make themselves liable, at all events, upon the general principle applicable to-natural persons. The agent may bind himself, if he exceed tho authority of the principal, and conduct himself fraudulently when the principal is a natural person. Tho same rule applies to the agents of artificial persons. In Yose <em>v. </em>Grant, 15 Mass. 519, it is said : \u201c If tho stockholders of a bank, while their charter is in force and their bills in free circulation, should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>suddenly determine to 'divide and withdraw their capital, and if the funds left in the bank should be insufficient to pay their debts, it would appear impossible to reconcile their conduct with honesty and good faith, and they would be liable to all persons injured by the measure. . . . If any number of persons combine, *with intent to injure and defraud another, they can not defend them selves against an action by showing that they did the act in the character of corporations, under any charter whatever.\u201d These are safe principles, founded in good sense, which we recognize as <em>law.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">On a question of so much importance in point of principle, and of some novelty, we owe it to the profession to notice the objections urged in argument to sustaining an action in a case of this nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">It is first said, that to allow bill-holders who have been defrauded to sue the members of the company individually at law, will produce endless litigation, and when applied, the i*emedy can not by possibility do equal justice to all tbo creditors, or to the members of the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">It may be that numerous suits will be prosecuted; and if the averments of the declaration are true, and over $125,000 in paper was fraudulently put in circulation, it is more than probable that a great many persons have been defrauded by it, and have sustained injury, for which they will prosecute those who contrived to cheat them. And yet the doctrine, that because they have cheated thousands they are safer than they would bo if only one man had suffered, does not obtain in courts of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">Concerning the other branch of the argument, \u201cthe impossibility to do equal justice to all the creditors,\u201d there may be some mistake. So far as a right of action is given to each thero will be equality. And if equal vigilance is pursued, no one will gain any advantage of the other bill-holder.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-10\">Again, it is said the fund sought is a trust fund, and a bill in chancery is the proper remedy. There would be much propriety in the position, wore it in point of fact true, that a party who has been defrauded by the act of another has no redress save out of a fund composed solely of the proceeds of the imposition. In that case strict equity might require that all those whose injuries had been the source of the fund should share equitably in it. But the rule that a person sustaining damage *by fraudulent acts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>of another can only look to a particular fund of the wrong-doer for redress, never existed anywhere. Whenever the judgment shall bo obtained, the sheriff will collect it out of any property liable to sale which he can find belonging to the defendants. This is applicable to all judgments recovered in special actions on the case. In this case the damages to be recovered should be commensurate with the injury done to the plaintiff, which will not in any sense depend upon the state of the assets of the bank, or its solvenej\u2019-. The judgment, therefore, that may be recovered will not affect trust funds, strictly so called, but general funds, the rights, credits, and effects of the individuals instrumental in committing the fraud complained of. The rules of right are not so narrow as to compel the plaintiffs to put up with less than a full compensation in .damages, and the extent of that damage in no sense depends upon the profits of the banking speculation entered upon by the defendants. It is not of any moment that the defendants should have made a profit by their frauds. That is an inquiry that can not affect the plaintiffs rights. The gist of his complain is, that they by their acts have imposed upon him, and that be has sustained an injury by means of the imposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">The second branch of our inquiry relates to the sufficiency of the declaration. For my own part I should not find much difficulty in holding, upon general demurrer, that it contains a substantial cause of action. Two of my brethren are clear in the opinion that the declaration is insufficient, and out of respect to them, and entertaining some doubts upon the subject, I, with the other members of the court, unite with them, much preferring to subject the party to the expense and trouble of amending, than that be should run any risk of a trial upon an insufficient declaration ; and this the more readily, inasmuch as it will not delay the final disposition of the cause. The objection taken by counsel is a want of certainty. The action is founded on a fraudulent combination, and for holding out false colors at the commencement of the banking operations, and at various subsequent periods. The only direct charge of *a fraudulent intention is in the withdrawal of the funds, and this, for aught that appears, may have been long since the bills in plaintiff\u2019s hands were issued. Besides, the declaration does not directly charge that the false pretense of acting, under the charter of 1816, was made, or that the association was entered into with a fraudulent intent, nor that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>the excessive issue of paper was so made. It is thought that the averment of a fraudulent design should have been made in positive terms, as to each specific act relied upon to sustain the action. That although it may appear, by inference, that the original design, or those subsequently formed, was to impose upon community, inasmuch as deception must necessarily result from the alleged pretenses, which the declaration falsifies, yet, that the court will not, in support of pleading, infer a criminal intention where the pleader, has not ventured directly to affirm that it existed. The issue of the bills which have come to the plaintiff\u2019s hands was the cause of his loss. These bills were, in fact, fraudulently issued, if put forth without capital to sustain them; and to pretend that the charter of 1816 authorized the assumed operation under it, when it did not in fact confer such authority, owing to the causes assigned in the declaration, was doubtless the employing of false pretenses well calculated to deceive the public; and the charge should be made in direct terms, that, in using these means, the design was to defraud. It should not be left to inference.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">On motion, leave was given to amend the declaration, and the cause continued.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
