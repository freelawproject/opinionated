The facts with respect to this lot, as charged in the bill, were, that in 1825, Stevens borrowed of Thomas Reddish, deceased, $200, and to secure payment, gave to Reddish-a deed of this lot, absolute upon its face, with a separate defeasance, and this debt was paid off with money borrowed of Dawson ; but the land was not reeonveyed by Reddish in his lifetime, nor by his heirs after his death. On March 11, 1826, Stevens, by absolute deed, conveyed the same land to the defendant Dawson, and took back a bond, by which Dawson bound himself to reeonvey, if Stevens should pay him $250, with five dollars interest *for each thirty days; but if Stevens neglected to pay the interest for sixty days, then the bond to be void.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">On February 4, 1828, Stevens, the complainant, made to Dawson an absolute deed of the property, with covenants of warranty. On the 6th day of the same month, Dawson borrowed of defendant Hey $1,000, and gave him a mortgage of that date on the property in question, with other property which was previously incumbered.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">After several years had elapsed, and Dawson having failed to pay, Hey filed a bill in. the court of common pleas to foreclose his mortgage; and at the November terra, 1837, obtained a decree, finding due $1,525, and ordering a sale of the real estate in default of payment. On June 4,1838, a sale was made to Hey of the mortgaged property. Hey then commenced his action of ejectment to recover possession of the property, Stevens having been from the beginning and then being in possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>The bill charges that the deed from Stevens to Dawson, dated March 11, 1826, is a mortgage, and was so intended, and that the same had been paid off in work done for Dawson; that Dawson fraudulently recorded the deed; that the complainant has no recollection of the execution of the deed of February 4, 1828, and never did knowingly execute such deed, and says that complainant is ignorant of the effect of deeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Defendant Hey, in his answer, denies notice of the defeasance or conditions of the deeds as charged; avers that ho loaned the $1,000 upon the supposition that Dawson was the legal and equitable owner of the lot in dispute. Never hoard that any person claimed the lot except Dawson until after he had obtained his decree of foreclosure. He did not know that Stevens was in possession of the property, nor did ho inquire: finding, as his counsel informed him, that the title was free and unincumbered of record, he made no further inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"A3jb\">^Hearing that Stevens claimed an interest in the lot, his , counsel agreed to stay the sale to enable him and his friends to redeem the mortgage, which they had professed a willingness to do, but which they neglected until he bought in the property for his own protection. He claims he is a purchaser for a valuable consideration, without notice of the equitable rights of Stevens, if any exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">Depositions were taken with a view to contradict the answer as to the fact of notice; and at the April term the cause was submitted to the court, and a decree entered in favor of the defendant, Hey. In the decree, the court find the equity of the case to be with the defendant, Hey, and that he was entitled to charge the promises described in the bill with the payment of the money and interest due upon the mortgage, secured by the said mortgage executed by the said Dawson to the said Hey, and that the said Hey had no notice, actual or constructive, of the equity claimed by the complainant, when he received the said <em>mortgage </em>and loaned the money secured thereby, as is set forth in defendant\u2019s answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">The court further found that the said Stevens was entitled, in equity, to redeem the said premises, on payment to the complainant of the amount of the decree, and all costs and interest thereon found due, or since accruing upon the decree rendered by the court of common pleas of Hamilton county, upon which the prom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>ises were sold and purchased by said Hey, as set forth in his answer, amounting in the whole to $1,795.18.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">It was thereupon ordered, adjudged, and decreed that the said Isaac Stevens be allowed to redeem the said premises from all the claims of said defendant thereon, upon the payment of the said sum found due with' the accruing interest thereon, and the costs of the action of ejectment, wherein the said James Hey was plaintiff and the said Isaac Stevens defendant; the payment to bo made to the said Hey, or his attorney, on November 1, 1840.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">And it was further ordered and decreed that upon the payment of said sum the said Hey should release to tho said *Stevens, by deed, all right, title, interest, and estate in said promises, by virtue of his mortgage, or his purchase under said decree; and that the said Stevens should also be substituted to all the right and claim which the said Hoy had-, or had held upon said premises, or any other premises, to recover the debt due him by said Dawson. It was further ordered and decreed that if the said Stevens should fail to pay as aforesaid, on the day named, the right to redeem said premises should thenceforth be foreclosed, cease and forever determine, and the complainant be barred from all right under the decree. And it was further ordered that the complainant should pay tho costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">The first error complained of in the decree is, that the court erred in deciding that tho notice of the existence of the equity of the complainant, in the lot mortgaged by Dawson to Hey, given to Henderson, tho attorney of Hey, was not notice to Hey, the principal, and that the said Hey was not prejudiced thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">Tho record does not show any such decision. The court find, expressly, that Hey had no notice, actual or constructive, of the equity of the complainant. Now, if the fact had been that Henderson was tho attorney of Hey, and this attorney had notice, it would have been notice to Hey \u2014 a fact which is expressly negatived by the finding of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">But it may be the object Of counsel, by this assignment, to call in question the correctness of the conclusion of the court, as to the matter of fact. If the court was mistaken as to tho matter of fact, it would seem to be the more correct course to correct this mistake on a rehearing than by review. It is not, I apprehend, the practice of the English court of chancery, on the hearing of a petition for review, to examine tho proofs in the case. -But, in that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>country, the facta are found by the court, in the first instance, and if those facts sustain, or are a proper foundation for tho decree, the bill of review must bo dismissed. Tho facts thus found are conclusive in the case. The bill, answers, and decree, what in this state wo should call tho record, is what comes before the reviewing court. In this *state, however, it has boon hold, that the original bill, answers, exhibits, and depositions are open for examination ; but this is only where tho decree contains no statement of the facts found. 7 Ohio, 372. Where the facts are expressly found, and stated in tho decreo, I can see no reason why the English practico should bo departed from. In tho caso before us, there was no controversy as to tho equity of tho complainant. Tho only matter in issue was, whether Hoy had notice of this equity. The court found, from <em>tho </em>evidence, that ho had not. I think this should bo conclusive. But if wo go behind the decree, and look into the depositions, w.e find nothing to contradict tho finding of tho court. There might be some doubt upon the subject; nothing beyond this. And this can be no reason why the decree should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">There are other matters assigned for error in tho decree, but as they are not referred to by counsel, I deem it unnecessary to notice them, any further than to say, that there is nothing in them which would induce the court to change the former decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">The complainant claims that, since the decree was made, he has discovered new and material evidence, which was unknown to him belore, and socks to have the decree reversed on this account. This newly discovered evidence consists in the admissions made by Hey as to the agoncy of Henderson, and of certain receipts, which go to show that the amount found to be duo to Hey, by his decree against Dawson, is greater than \u201eho amount actually duo to him. It will be soon that these matters wore before tho court on the former hearing. The great point in controversy was as to the notice. Upon this there was much testimony. And tho proof of the declarations of Hoy would bo merely cumulative evidence ? Should tho decree be reversed merely to let in cumulative evidence? It seems to us not. If such rule was to bo adopted, it is difficult to see whore a case could bo ended. As often as a now witness was discovorod, there must be a review, and nothing short of a statute of limitations would put an end to the litigation. Such seems to *be the opinion of Chancellor Kent, iu Liv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>ingston <em>v. </em>Hubbs, 3 Johns. Ch. 124. As to the receipts, it does not appear but that the evidence with respect to them, or tho receipts themselves, might have been had upon the hearing, by the exercise of the most common or ordinary diligence. And where a party by his own negligence has sustained a loss, ho can not, with propriety, call upon a court of chancery to relieve. Ho ought, at least, to show that he has made use of such diligence as would justify a court in continuing a case before trial. Justice Story, in his treatise upon Equity Pleadings, sec. 414, says, that \u201cthe matter must not only be now, but it must be such as the party, by reasonable diligence, could not have known; for if there be any negligence or laches in this respect, that destroys the title to the relief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">On full consideration, we are of opinion that there is nothing erroneous in the original decree, and that the bill of review be dismissed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
