Gwynne <em>v. </em>Christopher Niswanger.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b309-8\">In the Virginia military district, where lands are entered upon the duplicate for taxation before the patent has issued, and are sold for the non-payment of the tax, the purchaser takes the entire interest of the former owner; and if such owner subsequently receives a patent, he will be treated as a trustee for the purchaser at the tax sale, and be compelled to convey the legal title to such purchaser, provided the proceedings are regular, and in conformity with the law.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b309-9\">This case comes into the Supreme Court, by appeal, and was reserved in the county of Madison.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b309-10\">It is a suit in chancery, depending upon bill and demurrer. The caso was presented to the court of common pleas of Madison county, at the September term, 1845. That court overruled the demurrer, and entered a decree for the complainant. From this decree the defendant appealed to this court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b309-11\">The bill states that, on or about June 22, 1810, David Ross, as assignee, in trust for himself and others, entered survey No. 6,780, of 640 acres in the Virginia military district; that it was surveyed in April, 1816, and lies in Madison county ; that on or about August 1, 1828, the auditor of Madison county prepared, in due form, a list of lands in said county, on which the tax was due and unpaid, with the years for which the same appeared to be due and unpaid, prior to 1820, as required by, and in pursuance of section 3 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>of the act, entitled \u201c an act foi\u2019 the remission of penalties and for the sale of land for taxes,\u201d passed January 29, 1827, upon which list the above survey was duly cbai\u2019ged; that said list was duly sent by said county auditor to the auditor of state; that the auditor of state received it, compared it with the duplicates and other documents in his office, and transmitted duly to the auditor of Madison county a correct list, duly certified under his official seal, of all lands in said county on which the damages, interest, and penalty were due and unpaid, as directed and required, and in manner pointed out by section 4 *of said act, and on said list the above tract was duly listed; that on this list the above tract was charged with the damages, taxes, and interest, which were due and unpaid, prior to 1820, to wit, from the year 1811 to the commencement of the year 1820, and also the taxes, interest, and penalties which accrued on said tract, from the commencement of the year 1820 to the year 1828, amounting, in all, to $278.99.1, which were not paid, etc.; that the auditor of Madison county, having neglected to .soil said lands on the second Monday of December, 1828, as requirod by said law, did, on October 15, 1829, cause these and other lands to be advertised for sale, on the second Monday of December, 1829, in pursuance of an act, supplementary to the above-named act, passed February 11, 1829; that, at such sale, the above tract was sold to Dyne Starling, who subsequently conveyed to complainant, in 1832, by deed of quitclaim; Niswangor, as assignee of the heirs of Ross, obtained a patent for said survey, in 1838, brought an action of ejectment, and recovered by a decision of this court, in December, 1844; that Niswanger is about to sue out a writ of possession, etc., and prays an injunction, a decree that he convey to the complainant, and for general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-4\">To this bill the respondent demurs generally.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b310-5\">J. <em>W. </em>Andrews, for complainant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b310-6\">Gilbert &amp; Baldwin, for defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b310-7\">No arguments were furnished to the reporter.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b310-8\">Hitchcock, J,</author>\n<p id=\"AO35\">Two questions are presented, in this case, for the consideration of the court-; first, whether a court of equity, aeting within its ordinary powers, can compel the legal-owner of land to convey the same to a purchaser at tax sale, the owner, at the time of the sale, having no other than an equitable interest, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>but having, subsequent to the sale, acquired the legal title; and second, if the court has such power, is the *case made in the complainant\u2019s bill such as to justify the exercise of it?</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Here it may be proper to remark, that questions of this nature can scarcely arise, except where, at the time of sale, legal title is, as it was in this case, in the United States. Where, at the timo of sale, the legal title is in an individual, that title passes; and it is not material that the land was taxed in the wrong name, or even as belonging to unknown owners. In such case, the proceeding being regular, the title passes; and there is nothing unjust in this. It is the duty of tho owner of land to see that it is properly listed, and it is also his duty to pay the taxes. If he neglect this duty, the state can not be deprived of its lien upon the land ; nor can the purchaser at the tax sale be deprived of his right by a mistake on the part of the officers of the government, as to the name of the person to whom the tax is charged. But where the legal title is in the United States, it has been held that such title dees not pass. It was so decided in the case of Stuart\u2019s Lessee <em>v. </em>Parrish, .6 Ohio, 204; and in the case-of Niswanger <em>v. </em>Gwynne, 13 Ohio, 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">Counsel for defendant insist, that the title acquired by a tax purchaser is purely legal; and unless a legal title is acquired by the purchase, nothing is acquired. I am aware that it is generally understood that the interest acquired by purchasers, at sheriffs\u2019 as well as tax sales, is purely legal, and that such purchasers can not be aided by a court of chancery. But if there is anything in our peculiar system which requires of us to adopt a different rule, we ought not to hesitate in adopting it. All lands in the state are subject to taxation as a general rule, except such as are owned by the United States; and the lands, the legal title to which is in tho United States, may be taxed, when they become in equity tho property of individuals. Lands commonly called Congress lands could not be taxed until five years after they had been sold; but when such lands wore sold on credit, the state was not bound to wait five years from the time the patent issued, but only five years from the *time the lands were appropriated by entry in the register\u2019s office. The title to the lands in the Virginia military district was in the United States, but were hold in trust for those for whose benefit they were appropriated. These lands have always boon hold to be subject to taxation from the time of their ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>propriation by entry. The right thus to tax them has never been questioned by the United States. They have been taxed and sold under such circumstances, but upon the hypothesis of defendant\u2019s counsel the purchaser acquires nothing. This court, however, has held otherwise. In the case of Stuart <em>v. </em>Parrish, the court do not say, it is true, in express words, that the purchaser acquires an equitable title, but they do say that he acquires nothing more than an equity. But in the case of Wallace <em>v. </em>Seymour Ronick, 7 Ohio, 156, it is expressly decided, that by a sale of land for taxes in the Yirginia military district, surveyed but not patented, tho whole interest passes to the purchaser, and no right remains in tho original holder. We believe this to be a sound principle \u2014 one which it is necessary to sustain and carry out. And we have no doubt that, under such circumstances, upon proof being made at tho proper department, a patent would be issued to the tax purchaser. It ought to be done, and wo believe it would be done. In the same case, the court further decide, that if such former holder, to defeat the sale for taxes, is permitted to withdraw the entry and survey, and make a new one, upon which ho obtains a patent, although such patent is not void, yet the patentee holds the title subject to tho rights that may have been acquired by the purchaser for taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">To apply this principle to the case under consideration. The land in controversy had been entered in 1811, and surveyed in 1816, in the name of David Ross, in trust for himself and others. It was entered upon the duplicate for taxation, in the year 1811, by a pertinent description; but tho taxes were not paid. In December, 1829, the taxes having remained unpaid for eighteen years, the land was sold. If this sale was regular, then all the interest of Ross, the former holder, was ^vested in Starling the purchaser ; and0if, after the sale, a patent had been issued to Ross, he would have taken it subject to the rights of Starling, in trust for him. Niswanger having obtained an assignment from Ross after .the sale, and having taken out a patent in his own name, takes the naked legal title in trust for the purchaser at tax sale. He stands in a similar relation to the purchaser for taxes, as does the patentee under a prior entry to him who has the older entry and survey. He is a mere trustee, and a court of equity may, with propriety, compel him as a trustee to convey to the <em>cestui que trust. </em>'It was upon this principle that the court, in the ease of Niswanger <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number><em>v. </em>Gwynne, decided that the remedy of the defendant Gwynne, if the proceedings in the tax sale were regular, was in chancery.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">The next question is, whether the case made in the bill is such as to show that the proceedings at the tax sale were regular. \"We have carefully compared the statements in the bill with the requisitions of the statute, and have no hesitation in saying that if the statements of the bill are true, and they are admitted by the demurrer, the complainant is entitled to relief. The demurrer is therefore overruled. But if the defendant would contest the facts stated, he can have leave to answer.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
