Risk, decided at the *present term of the court, and reported at page 84, where the subject was fully discussed, the arguments are omitted.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b393-13\">Hitchcock, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AhVf\">The facts of this case, as agreed by counsel, are, that on September 6, 1836, Freeby, the complainant, sold the land, covered by the mortgage, consisting of 110 acres, to the defendants, Thomas Tupper and Alanson Penfield. On the same day, Tupper and Penfield made three several promissory notes, payable to Freeby, for $400 each \u2014 one payable September 1, 1837; another payable September 1,1838 ; one payable September 1, 1839, and also one note for $300, payable September 1, 1840; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>and on the same day executed a mortgage upon the same premises, to secure tho payment of said notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">In September, 1837, when the first note fell due, suit was brought upon it by Freeby, in the court of common pleas of Portage county, and a judgment recovered, at the February term of said court, 1838, for $440.68. On this judgment execution was takon out, and, by procurement and direction of Freeby, was levied on forty-four acres of land, part and parcel of the aforesaid.! 110 acres. The land thus levied upon was sold at sheriff\u2019s sale on September 3, 1838, at and for the price or sum of $500, this being a little more than two-thirds the appraised value. With the avails of this sale, the sheriff paid to Freeby tho amount of his judgment and interest, together with \u00a1he costs. He also paid over to Tupper and Ponfield, the judgment debtors, the residue of the purchase money, amounting to fifteen dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">In September, 1838, Freoby brought suit upon the note which fell due on the'first day of that month, and at the February term of the same court of common pleas, 1839, recovered a judgment for $469.90.. On this judgment ho took out execution, and caused the same to be levied on the remainder of the mortgaged premises, arid the- same were sold at sheriff\u2019s sale on May 27, 1839, and purchased by said *Alanson Penfield, at the price of $759\u2014 this sum being more than two-thirds the appraised value. This money was paid to the sheriff, with which he satisfied tho last-named judgment, and paid tho surplus in his hands, amounting to $257.87, to Tupper and Penfield.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">In September, 1839, suit was commenced by Freeby on the note falling duo on the first day of that month. In thissuitjudginont was recovered at tho April term of the court, 1840. Alanson Penfield and Thomas Tupper have no real or personal estate subject to levy and sale, from which, on execution, this latter judgment can be satisfied, except 22 30-100 acres of the aforesaid premises, lying in common and undivided, in tho sixty-six acres of said land which was sold upon the second judgment and execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">On June 5, 1839, Alanson Penfield sold and conveyed all the aforesaid mortgaged premises to Horace Ponfield, one of the defendants, by a deed of warranty, except the twenty-two acres before mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">On December 5, 1839, Horace Penfield, being indebted to the presideut, directors, and company of the Commercial Bank of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>Lake Erie in the sum of $1,500, by a mortgage deed conveyed all of the aforesaid mortgaged premises to the said president, directors, and company, in full satisfaction of said debt, at which time said president, directors, and company had no knowledge, in fact, of the existence of any incumbrance on said land, but supposed the same to be free of any incumbrance whatever.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">The aforesaid sales, by the sheriff, of said mortgaged premises, were regularly approved by the court, and deeds executed by the sheriff to Alanson Penfield prior to tho date of his deed to Horace Penfield; and the said mortgaged premises were appraised under the statute, without any reference to the mortgage incumbrance to the complainant.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">This agreed statement of facts shows that the mortgagee, not electing to rely upon his mortgage, the condition of which was broken by the non-payment of the first note when it fell *due, commenced suit\" upon that note, recovered judgment, and caused a part of the mortgaged premises to be sold on execution. The money made by this sale was applied in satisfaction of his judgment. When the second note fell due, the same course was pursued. And now, after having caused the entire land to be sold on execution to satisfy the first two notes, he seeks to subjeet it to' sale in equity to satisfy the last two notes. The case is not different, in principle, from the case of Fosdick <em>v. </em>Risk, decided at the present term. And it seems to the court, that it would be manifestly inequitable-and unjust to permit the mortgagee so to defeat the title of the purchaser at sheriff\u2019s sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">It may be thought that, inasmuch as Alanson Penfield, one of the mortgagors, became the purchaser at sheriff\u2019s sale, a different rule should prevail than would have done had the purchaser been a stranger. But we can see no difference in principle. By this purchase, Penfield acquired a new title. Before, he hold the land in common with the defendant, Tupper, subject to the incumbrance of the mortgage. By the purchase and sheriff\u2019s deed, he became tho sole owner of the property, and that purchase having been made at a judicial sale, directed by tho complainant himself, there can be no good reason why he should not hold it divested of the lien of the mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">From the agreed facts, it would seem that, although the lien of tho mortgage was discharged by tho sale on execution, that twenty-two acres of the land purchased by Penfield at that sale remained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>in him when the third judgment was rendered. If so, that judgment would operate as a lien. But it is not the lien of a judgment we are called upon to enforce, but the lien of a mortgage; and, in the opinion of the court, there is not now any such subsisting lien.</p>\n<p id=\"A_yY\">Bill dismissed at complainant\u2019s costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
