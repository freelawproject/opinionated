The defendant claimed the land by virtue of a deed from said John Overmyer, to the Ohio Railroad Company, dated October 4, 1839, and from the company to himself, dated June 19,1842. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>The defendant also proved on the trial, that it was difficult, if not impossible, to procure materials for the construction of the road without the purchase of land ; that this tract of land was bought by the company for the purpose of procuring materials and the right of way; that the road passed over a corner of this land; that the timber growing upon it was used in the construction of the road; and that it was as convenient, or more so, to obtain timber from this land as from any other land, though abundance of timber might be procured in the neighborhood. Upon this proof, the court of common pleas \u2014 before which the case was tried, without the intervention of a jury \u2014 rendered a judgment for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b22-5\">To this decision of the court, the defendant filed exceptions, and assigned for error:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b22-6\">1. That the court erred in deciding that the Ohio Railroad Company had power, by their charter, to receive and hold a conveyance of real estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ao8\">*2. That the court erred in deciding that the deed from John Overmyer, to the Ohio Railroad Company, passed the title of said, land to the company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b22-8\">3. That the court erred in giving judgment for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A6vy\">To decide the questions presented upon this assignment of errors, the case was reserved for decision here.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b22-10\">L. B. Otis, for plaintiff in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b22-11\">Had the Ohio Railroad Company power, by their original charter, passed March 8, 1836, to receive and hold the legal title to the premises in controversy?</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b22-12\">Section 3 of their charter says, \u201cthat they shall be capable in law of purchasing, holding, selling, leasing, and conveying <em>estates </em>real, personal, and mixed, so far as the same shall be necessary for the <em>purposes hereinafter mentioned, and no </em>further.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b22-13\">The purposes here referred to, are defined in section 12 of the charter to be, \u201c the location, construction, and repairs of a road not exceeding one hundred feet in width.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b22-14\">A clause in section 3 of this charter fully empowers the company, and its agents, \u201cto enter upon and use any adjoining land; take stone, timber, materials,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b22-15\">Thus it will be seen that this company, to carry out the purpose for which it was created, did not need a single foot of land, except a strip for its track one hundred feet in width.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b23-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>It is claimed by counsel for the defendant, that the power of acquiring title to lands, is an incident to every corporation. \"We think this position incorrect. In the case of the State of Ohio <em>v. </em>Granville Alexandrian Society, 11 Ohio, 12, the court say the rule of construing, acts of incorporation is, \u201cto consider corporations as having such powers as are specifically granted by the act of incorporation, or as are necessary for carrying into effect the powers expressly granted, and as not having any other.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b23-5\">*The power to deal in real estate generally, by purchasing and selling the same, is expressly prohibited to this corporation, by the use of the words \u201cand no further,\u201d in section 8 of their charter. What else could the legislature have intended by the use of this language, than to prohibit this corporation from dealing in lands generally, as in the case of the lands in controversy?</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b23-6\">Again, this power was taken away from this corporation impliedly, by the purposes for which it was created.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b23-7\">That this corporation had not the power, by its original charter, to acquire the title to the land in controversy, is evident from the fact that an amendatory act was passed, March 23, 1840 (38 Ohio L. 210), expressly conferring upon this company the power to purchase and sell lands. Why was this amendatory act passed, if they had this power by the original charter ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b23-8\">The language made use of in this amendatory act is such, that we may infer that it was intended to give it a retroactive effect, and in this way legalize the proceedings of this company under their original charter, so far as their <em>speculation </em>in land was concerned. But that it can not have such a retroactive effect, is settled by the ease of Good <em>v. </em>Zercher, 12 Ohio, 364.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b23-9\">Buckland, Hays &amp; Lane, for defendant:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b23-10\">Both parties make title under John Overmyer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b23-11\">In 1839, John Overmyer sold and conveyed to the Ohio Railroad Company, for a consideration fully paid. In 1842, tho Ohio Railroad Company conveyed to Cyrus Williams, in payment of a debt.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b23-12\">In 1845, John Overmyer sold and conveyed to Samuel Overmyer, for the nominal consideration of $100. This conveyance assumes that the former conveyance is void. To maintain this position, the plaintiff must show :</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b23-13\">*1. That the Ohio Railroad Company could not hold land for this purpose; and,</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b24-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>2. That a conveyance of land to a corporation which the charter does not authorize it to hold, passes nothing.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b24-5\">Section 3 of the charter (34 Ohio L. L. 319) renders the company \u201ccapable in law of purchasing, holding, selling, leasing, and conveying estates, real and personal, or mixed, so far as the same shall bo necessary for the purposes hereinafter mentioned, and no further.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b24-6\">By section 12, the corporation may enter, use, and excavate any lands which may be wanted for the site of the road, or for any other purpose necessary and useful for the construction and repairs, etc.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b24-7\">By section 13, the company may agree with the owners of the land which may be wanted for the construction and repairs of the road, for the purchase, ote.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b24-8\">The road is built upon piles. The land is a quarter section, in the black swamp adjoining the road, but far from town, and valuable for timber only. The deposition of Wilson, a part of the bill of exceptions, shows the timber was necessary to construct, and was constantly wanted to repair; that the most convenient and economical mode to obtain timber for these purposes was to purchase land; that this land was eminently subservient to this purpose, and that it was acquired by the company with no other view, although afterward, in the derangement of the company\u2019s affairs, it was sold to pay its debts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b24-9\">If this purchase had been made upon speculation, or to furnish a basis of credit, or with any other slippery design, we would not try to uphold it. But when the timber upon it was really needed, and when this mode of obtaining it was not only the most convenient and economical, but precisely the mode which a prudent man of business would take to get it, we hold the purchase of the land, and the payment of a fair price, to the owner\u2019s satisfaction, is not only justified by the charter, but a far more commendable and honest course than the harsh and forced appropriation from an unwilling donor, under the right of eminent domaiu.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0y\">*2. Whatever may be hold as to the capacity of the corporation to <em>hold </em>the land, this \u201c mousing\u201d plaintiff will be disappointed, as well as the (honest?) grantor who sells it a second time, after receiving full payment; for the law does not enable a vendor to a corporation to resume his estate, and thus take from the company the ability to pay its debts, and from the grantees the property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>they have honestly paid ior. It is a principle well established, that lands liable to forfeiture from the want of capacity in a corporation to hold, are not forfeited without <em>office </em>found, or some equivalent judicial action; and upon the interposition of the court in such cases, by the operation of the Ohio statutes (v. 40, p. 67, sec. 14), the property is applied to its debts, or to other legitimate objects. A few quotations will set this, point at rest.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b25-5\">It was decided by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania that a bank might purchase absolutely, and not for debts, lands in a distant county which they did not occupy, although they or the the third person to whom they might convey, would hold them by a title defeasible by the commonwealth, and the commonwealth alone, as in the cases with title by aliens. Leasure <em>v. </em>Hillyas, 7 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 319; Angell &amp; Ames, 92.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b25-6\">The court of appeals in Yirginia decided that, though purchasing the land in question, the banks violated their charters, and they might for that cause be dissolved by a proceeding at the suit of the commonwealth, yet that any conveyance made before dissolution, would pass an indissoluble title to the purchaser. 3 Rand. 136.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b25-7\">If the plaintiffs are a duly incorporated body, with authority to contract and take mortgage\u2019s, and if they pass the exact line of their power, it would rather belong to the government of Pennsylvania to exact a forfeiture of their charter, than for this court, in this collateral way, to decide a question of misuse, and set aside a just and <em>bona fide </em>contract. Per Kent, 4 Johns. Ch. 373.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b25-8\">This doctrine has been examined and adopted by the Supreme Court at Washington, in the case of Runyan <em>v. </em>Lessee *of Carter et al., 14 Pet. 131. They say : \u201c The right of a corporation, in this respect, is like an alien who has the power to take, but not to hold lands. And although the land thus held by an alien may be subject to forfeiture after office found, yet until some act is done by the government, according to its own laws, to vest the estate in itself; it remains with the alien, who may convey it to a purchaser. But he can convey no estate which is not defeasible by the commonwealth. This principle has received the sanction of this court, in Fairfax <em>v. </em>Hunter, where it is said to be incontroverlibly settled, by the fullest authority, that the title acquired by an alien, by purchase, is not divested until office found.\u201d They proceed to say, that doctrine clearly establishes the right of the lessees of plaintiff to hold the premises in question, until some act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>shall be done by the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, according to its laws, to divest that right and vest the estate in itself. The legal estate is, accordingly, in the lessee of the plaintiff, and the defendant can not set up any right of forfeiture which the State of Pennsylvania can alone assert.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b26-5\">Birchard, J.</author>\n<p id=\"As-\">From the bill of exceptions, the determination of this question will dispose of the three assignments of error. Did the deed of John Oveimyer, executed in 1839 to the Ohio Railroad Company, divest him of title to the land described in the deed? The plaintiff in error assumes that it did not, for the alleged reason, that the corporation had no power to receive the title. At common law, corporations had the capacity to purchase and alien lands, unless restrained by statute or by their charters. 2 Kent\u2019s Com. 227, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">Owing to the lavish manner in which corporations are granted in modern times, a safer rule has obtained. The better and true doctrine, which now is generally recognized, is, that corporations have such powers only as are specifically granted by the act of incorporation, or as are necessary to carry into effect the powers expressly granted. 2 Cranch, 127; 15 Johns. 358; 5 Conn. 530; 12 Ohio, 12.</p>\n<p id=\"A8V\">*The purchase in this case was made, as is shown by tbs proof, for the expross purpose of securing the right of way and the timber growing on the land, which was needed in constructing the track of the road, and was actually so used. The superintendent states that\", after several ineffectual attempts to procure timber for the making of the road by purchase, he found it necessary to resort to the purchase of lands in the vicinity of the road to supply the materials for making the superstructure; and, in accordance with that view, the company made the purchase of the land in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-8\">We look, then, to the charter of this company (24 Ohio L. 320) in order to determine whether the deed of 1839 is void. Section 3 confers the power of \u201cpurchasing, holding, selling, leasing, and conveying estates, real, personal, and mixed, so far as the same shall be necessary for the purposes hereinafter mentioned, and no further;\u201d \u201cand they shall have, enjoy, and exercise all the powers, rights, and privileges which corporate bodies may lawfully do, for the purposes mentioned in this act.\u201d The purposes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>referred to are declared in the subsequent sections of the act, among other things, the building of a railroad not exceeding 100 feet in width.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">Section 12 gives the right to \u201c enter, use, and excavate any lands which may be wanted for the site of the road, or for any other purpose necessary and useful for the construction and repair \u25a0 of said road and its works.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">Section 13 contains a paragraph which reads thus: \u201cThat the president and directors of said company, or a majority of them, or any person authorized by them, or a majority of them, may agree with the owner or owners of any <em>land, </em>earth, timber, stone, or other materials, or any improvements which may be wanted for the construction or repairs of said road, or any of their works, for the purchase, use, or occupation, of the same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">In view of these grants of power, it would seem that the purchase in question was expressly authorized by'the charter. Timber was needed for the construction of the road, and power *was intended-to be granted so ample, that it might be procured at all events. The first and preferred mode of procuring it, was by purchase, upon mutual agreement with the owner; and it is evident from the whole scope of the charter, that the legislature preferred that the company should make the necessary acquisitions of property, by purchase, to a resort to the other means conferred upon them, to wit, the exercise of the delegated right of eminent domain. The company did just what a prudent man would have-done under like circumstances, and the charter justified them, because it was the intention of the legislature (and which intent is to be gathered from the act of incorporation) to authorize purchases of all necessaries at fair prices, and in the mode most economical, least likely to give cause of offense, and least prejudicial to the rights of others.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
