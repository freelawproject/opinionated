The facts *of tho case, as gathered from the bill of exceptions, are, in substance, these:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b435-10\">On September 7, 1837, Le Baron was possessed of a large real and personal estate, and also a contract with one Zane to build a bridge over the Ohio river, at Wheeling. He was largely in debt; and unable to meet his liabilities; and for the purpose of saving his property from sacrifice, he executed two deeds \u2014 one bearing date September 7, 1837, the other September 25, 1837 \u2014 conveying all his property, of every description, to Benjamin, the interest in the bridge contract included. Le Baron died, and Benjamin claimed all the property, under the deeds aforesaid. Lathrop was appointed administrator, and commenced this action for all of the personal property above stated, and for the bridge contract, and, as was contended by defendant, for fixtures; also, to deprive Benjamin of the property thus held, and appropriate it to the payment of Le Baron\u2019s debts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b435-11\">Yarious errors are assigned, among which are these: That the court erred in charging the jury that an administrator can maintain trover for goods fraudulently transferred by his intestate, and in charging that trover would lie for the bridge contract.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b435-12\">C. C. Carroll, for plaintiff in error :</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-13\">Can the administrator of a fraudulent grantor, in an action of trover against the fraudulent grantee, recover for the conversion of the goods thus fraudulently transferred ?</p>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b436-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>No lawyer of any considerable reputation, I apprehend, would hesitate for a moment as to the proper answer to be given to this question. These are familiar and well-settled principles : A man is estopped by his own deed, his own act of transfer; he can not take advantage of his own wrong, nor avoid his deed because of his own fraud that deeds executed to defraud creditors are valid, as between the parties thereto. But despite these, as we vainly thought, impregnable axioms and *well-established principles, a court has decided that this action can be maintained \u2014 not, perhaps by the grantor himself, but by his administrator. We must revise our law upon this subject, and see if there be, verily, just ground for that decision.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b436-5\">Le Baron himself, the fraudulent grantor, could not maintain this suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b436-6\">\u201c A deed made to defraud creditors is void only as against creditors.\u201d ..... \u201c Such fraudulent conveyances are valid, as between the parties.\u201d Burgett <em>v. </em>Burgett, 1 Ohio, 469; Douglas <em>v. </em>Dunlap, 10 Ohio, 162. \u201c He who parts with property to defraud creditors, can not bring trover to recover it.\u201d Stewart <em>v. </em>Kearney, 6 Watts, 453.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b436-7\">Le Baron could hardly succeed with the indorsement upon the writ, that he was-suing for goods which he had fraudulently transferred.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b436-8\">If Le Baron could not succeed in maintaining this action, can his administrator succeed ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b436-9\">What is an administrator ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b436-10\">By the statute 31 Edward III, \u201c It is accorded and assented, that in a case where a man dieth intestate, the ordinaries shall depute the next and most lawful friends of the dead person intestate, to administer his goods, which deputies shall have an action to demand and recover, as executors,\u201d etc. Roberts on Personal Succession, 28.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b436-11\">In the Ohio Reports, the administrator is spoken of as the personal representative of the deceased, in whom the personal estate is vested, as a trustee for those who are ultimately to receive the benefit of the personal estate (8 Ohio, 370; 5 lb. 503), as agent of the intestate\u2019s estate, and of all the creditors also. 9 Ohio, 18.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b436-12\">Deputy, representative, trustee, agent 1 Rightly considered, the administrator is, perhaps, none of these. In some respects, he is a trustee for the. creditors, or heirs, or both, as administering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>a fund, not his own, for thoir benefit; but he does not represent them. As agent or trustee, he derives no authority from them. His admissions are <em>prima facie </em>evidence of the ^indebtedness of the intestate (8 Ohio, 249), but they are of no efficiency as against the creditors. The law <em>deputes </em>the administrator, adjusts his position, and then the legal -life of the intestate flows into him; and, so far as assets go, he succeeds to all his legal rights, and is amenable to all his legal obligations ; and, in all things concerning the estate, is estopped where his intestate was or would bo estopped, bound where his intestate would be bound.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b437-5\">I think it is easy to see, that the administrator is something more than agent, trustee, or even representative. A man dead is dead in law, and the legal existence of the administrator is substituted for his. The administrator is invested with the personal estate. He succeeds to the legal rights and the legal individuality of the intestate, and is regarded as enforcing his rights, impelled by his own instincts of selfishness, and as resisting the demands of others from the same impulse.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b437-6\">From whence, then, does the administrator derive his authority to avoid the fraudulent deed of the intestate? Not from the creditors; he is not their constituted agent or. appointed trustee. To them, he is antagonistical. Not from the intestate, for the intestate did not himself possess that power. Not from the common law, for the common law confers no power or. right upon the administrator which was not possessed by his intestate. Not, certainly, from the statutes of Ohio.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b437-7\">Thus, if I have rightly apprehended and correctly drawn the character and attributes of an administrator, it is easily seen that as Le Baron could not, his administrator can not maintain this suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b437-8\">But what is the law, as ascertained by judicial decision ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b437-9\">\u201cPersons making voluntary, or fraudulent, or covinous conveyances, and all those claiming under them, are as much bound by such conveyances as if these statutes (13 and 27 Eliz.) had not been made.\u201d 4 Cruise Dig. 470. Nor will courts of equity assist the party making a voluntary conveyance, or his representative, claiming as such, by setting them aside.\u201d Spencer, C. J., in Jackson <em>v. </em>Garnsey, 16 Johns. *192 ; and see 4 Cow. 216. In both these cases the representative was the heir. \u201c A conveyance to defraud creditors is good against the grantor and his heirs, and is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>void only as <em>to </em>creditors.\u201d Parsons, J., in Drinkwater v. Drinkwater, 4 Mass. 356.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b438-5\">\u201cA deed made to defraud creditors, is void only as against creditors.\u201d Burgett <em>v. </em>Burgett, and Douglas v. Dunlap, <em>ubi sup. </em>\u201c The statute only makes the sale void, as against creditors, and not as to the vendor or his personal representatives.\u201d Babcock v. Booth, 2 Hill, 185. A voluntary deed is void, as to creditors, if made to their injury, but is binding on the donor, her executors, administrators, and assigns, and all claiming under them, both at common law and under the act of assembly. The executor is es-topped to allege that the deed is in fraud of creditors. Dorsey <em>v. </em>Smithson, 6 Har. &amp; Johns. 61.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b438-6\">\u201c The bill of sale, though fraudulent as to creditors, is good between the parties, their heirs, executors, etc.; so that these effects could never be assets in the hands of the rightful executor.\u201d Foster et al. v. Newlin, 4 Mo. 18.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b438-7\">The case of Howland et al. v. Davis, Charlt. 383, was a case of a creditor against a grantee, as executor <em>de son tort. </em>The court say: \u201c The principle is, that the fraudulent bill of sale, as to the creditors, is void, and that any interference with the goods conveyed after the death of the vendor, will make the vendee chargeable. In these cases, there can be no remedy in favor of the rightful executor or administrator, because the conveyance is good against the grantor. It is the creditor only who can charge the vendor.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b438-8\">In the case of Osborne v. Moss, 7 Johns. 161, it is decided that a judgment, fraudulent and covinous as against the creditors of the judgment debtor, is nevertheless binding upon the judgment debtor and his administrator; and a sale of chattels to the fraudulent judgment creditor, upon execution issued upon said judgment, was held valid as against the administrator. The decision is made upon the authority of the *ease of Hawes v. Leader, Cro. Jas. 270; Yelv. <em>196. </em>The court say: \u201cIn that case, the intestate made a grant of his goods to B., by fraud between him and B., to cheat the creditors, and he kept possession of the goods and died. B. then sued the administrator for the goods, and he pleaded this covin and fraud, and the statute of 13 Elizabeth, which declares all such gifts and grants void as against creditors; but, on demurrer, the plea was hold bad, and judgment was rendered for the plaintiff, on the ground, among others, that the deed was void only as against creditors, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>but that it remained good as against the party himself, and his executors and administrators.\u201d In the case in Johnson, as in the case now under consideration, the administrator was also creditor. The case, it seems to me, is very much in point.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b439-5\">Thus, I think it is proved by abundant authority, that the fraudulent conveyances in this case are good and valid, as against Le Baron and his personal representatives. This point being made good, the case of the defendant in error fails, and the judgment of the court below must be reversed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b439-6\">Daniel Peck, for defendant in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b439-7\">Can an administrator maintain an action under the circumstances disclosed in the bill of exceptions?</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b439-8\">Here is the case of a man who is indebted to a much greater amount than the value of all his property, and for the purpose of defrauding his creditors conveys all his property to his brother-in-law, without consideration, and dies. After his death the fraudulent grantee, by virtue of those conveyances, takes the possession of, and claims the property. Are the creditors of the fraudulent grantor without any remedy in such a case; and if not, what is their remedy ? Can the administrator recover this property for the purpose of paying the debts ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b439-9\">It has always been held by this court, and is no doubt good law, that there can bo no executor <em>de son tort </em>in Ohio. If the administrator can not sue for and recover this property, as assets *of the estate, in what manner can the creditor come at his debt? By our law this property is assets to pay debts, and should be distributed <em>pro rata </em>among the creditors, for undoubtedly the creditors are entitled to it. The creditors have no judgment, and can not file a bill; no one but the creditor will administer, and is he remediless ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b439-10\">Originally, in England, it is probable that the administrator succeeded to the rights and liabilities of his intestate, and might not have boon able to maintain any suit his intestate could not have sustained. Le Baron, if living, could not set aside those fraudulent conveyances, or recover back the property from Benjamin, if it had been delivered; but if it had not been delivered, Benjamin could not have enforced the delivery of the property under such a fraudulent contract. If Le Baron was alive, his creditors could recover judgment against him, and, by bill in chancery, subject any of his property, in the hands of Benjamin to the satisfaction of their judgments. But Le Baron is dead; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>his creditors have no judgments ; none but the principal creditor will administer, and he is forced to do it to secure his debt. In what other way can he proceed but the way he has chosen ? Tho property has been so wasted or so converted by Benjamin, that it can not be found : it seems to me that this is the only way that it can- be reached.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b440-5\">In Ohio, I apprehend that the administrator represents both the intestate and his creditors, and that he can do, himself, everything in relation to the assets of the estate that creditors could do by bill in chancery, or otherwise. He surely ought to bo able to administer everything that can, in any sense of the word, be considered as assets, for the payment of the debts. Ho is the proper person to make the distribution. If this was not the case, one creditor might realize the whole of his debt, and the others be entirely cut off.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b440-6\">Can there bo any doubt but that this property, or its value, if recovered, is assets to pay the debts, and that the administrator is the proper person to distribute the same in the payment of the debts of the estate?</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ap9\">*The legislature has expressly made lands, fraudulently conveyed by the intestate, assets to pay the debts in the hands of the administrator, and has pointed out the manner of obtaining the possession of such lands.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b440-8\">In a similar case in England, and in most of the states, tho creditor could have sued Benjamin as executor <em>de son tort. </em>Campbell <em>v. </em>Toucy, Ex'r of Booth, 7 Cow. 64.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b440-9\">But, as before observed, the creditor who could proceed in that manner would get the whole of the assets. Now, the spirit of every administration law we have been governed by, has had equality of the distribution of the'effects for its basis \u2014 that is one reason why our laws and courts have been so uniformly opposed to any law which will admit of executors <em>de son tort.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b440-10\">The case of Babcock <em>v. </em>Booth was decided in New York, in 1842. 2 Hill, 181. In pronouncing the opinion of the court, the judge says : \u201cWhere a fraudulent grantee takes possession of tho goods in the lifetime of the vendor, who afterward dios, leaving debts unpaid, it seems that the goods will, as to creditors, bo decreed to be asset\u2019s in the personal representative of the deceased; and if so, the executor or administrator must, of course, have an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>action against the fraudulent vendee to recover the property.\u201d Rob. on Frauds, and Cro. Eliz. 810, are cited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b441-5\">\u201c The only question, then, to be considered is, whether the personal representative of a fraudulent grantor, who remained in the possession of the property, can, for the benefit of creditors, set up the fraud, and thus avoid the sale. I think ho can, and that the court below erred in holding the contrary doctrino. All the books agree that the sale, though not void as to the parties to it, is utterly void as to creditors, and the only difficulty is as to the mode in which they shall come at their rights.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b441-6\">\u201c In Bethel <em>v. </em>Stanhope, Cro. Eliz. 810, the fraudulent donor died in the possession of the goods, and it was said, that when the donor afterward took them, it is a trespass against *the .administrator, for which he hath his remedy, and they are always assets in his hands.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b441-7\">Lately, in New York, the legislature passed an act, declaring that no one shall be charged as executor <em>de son tort </em>in that state.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b441-8\">In Doe <em>v. </em>Barkenstose, 12 Wend. 145, the court says: \u201cExecutors and administrators have a new character, and stand in a different relation, from what they formerly did, to the creditors of the deceased person, with whose estates they are intrusted. They are not now the mere representatives of their testator or intestate; they are constituted trustees, and the property in their hands is a fund to be disposed of in the best manner for the benefit of the creditors.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b441-9\">In Shield <em>v. </em>Anderson, 3 Leigh, 729, the same doctrine is'held by the court of appeals of Virginia. So it is held in Massachusetts, if the estate is insolvent. 4 Mass. 356.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b441-10\">I do not doubt but that executors and administrators have always, in Ohio, represented both the deceased and the creditors, and were always the trustee of the creditors, and never the mere representative.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b441-11\">It will be claimed, however, by the counsel for the plaintiff in error, that the administrator is a mere representative of the deceased, a substitute for him, and that he could have been sued, and can yet be sued as executor <em>de son </em>tort, and therefore there can be no necessity for such an action as this. It will be insisted that the decisions of this court in relation to this subject are not law, and ought to be disregarded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b441-12\">However ingenious an argument to prove that executors <em>de son </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number><em>tort </em>ought to be tolerated under our peculiar system may be, it fails to convince me that such is or ought to be the law of Ohio; and that, if no precedent for such a case can be found, it is high time for this court to make one on this occasion.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b442-5\">The court is not put to the necessity of deciding the question that would arise if Benjamin had taken possession of the property in the lifetime of Le Baron, because the testimony *fully proves that he did not convert this property until after the death of Le Baron. I do not yield the point, that if it had been converted in the lifetime of Le Bai\u2019on, his administrator could not sustain this action, for I see it quite clear that he could; but ever since the time of Queen Elizabeth, it has been held, that if the fraudulent donor die in possession of the goods, the fraudulent donee can not take them from the administrator.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b442-6\">I conclude, then, that the plaintiff in the suit below could sustain his suit for such a cause of action.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b442-7\">Read, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AAW\">The record in this case is exceedingly voluminous. To -follow through all the motions, exceptions, demurrers, and alleged mistakes, interposed by the ingenuity of counsel, would lead to unnecessary prolixity, and throw no light upon the case. Some eighteen errors are assigned, but they dwindle down to two.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">1. Can an administrator maintain trover to recover property assigned and transferred by his intestate, to hinder, delay, and defraud creditors? and,</p>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">2. If so, would trover lie for the bridge contract, as above stated ?</p>\n<p id=\"b442-10\">The first proposition the court intend to decide, and that only.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-11\">We hold that the administrator can only maintain such action as the intestate might, if living. He represents the intestate; he steps into no other right. As between the fraudulent vendor and vendee, the transfer is good. Such conveyances are void only as to creditors. This is the well-settled doctrine in Ohio. Hence, as between the vendor and vendee in this ease, the vendor had no rights, and of course his administrator could have none. But it is said that, unless we sustain a suit of this sort, on the part of the administrator, creditors will have no remedy. This does not follow. When a bill shall be filed for that purpose, it will be time to consider of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-12\">As to the-second proposition, whether trover would lie for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>bridge contract, it is unnecessary to decide, as it is disposed *of by the determination of the first proposition. Tot in my own opinion, although not authorized to say so by the court, I should not deem trover the suitable remedy to hunt down the results of a contract of that sort, as has been argued. It has been claimed that an executor <em>de son tort </em>may exist in Ohio, and that we ought to review our decisions upon that point. We are content to let that matter rest as it is. We are not disposed to introduce or sanction a principle which would draw a fund wholly'to one creditor, instead of a fair distribution, as would result in case of an execution <em>de son tort. </em>Judgmcnt reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b443-5\">Birchard, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AOM\">dissenting. It has been held that there is no such thing in Ohio as an executor <em>de son tort. </em>In the case at bar, had Le Baron lived, Lathrop, as creditor, might have sued out his writ, prosecuted his action to judgment and execution, and finally made his money out of the property fraudulently conveyed to this plaintiff. It was, as to creditors, a void transfer. When the estate of one is thus made insolvent, the heirs can have no interest in seeing to its settlement. They will not administer, but will leave the burden of administration to those who have some interest in the matter, that is, to the creditors. Now, what I consider erroneous in the opinion of the court is this : It misconceives the office and duties of an administrator un der the laws of this state, and defeats the policy of our statute. It applies principles which had their origin in another country and under laws, in this respect, dissimilar to our own. The act of March 23, 1840, entitled \u201can act to provide for the settlement of the estates of deceased persons\u201d (Swan\u2019s Slat. 339), provides that all the personal estate shall first be applied to the payment of the debts due by the estate, and, if found insufficient, that the lands shall next be appropriated, by a sale, on petition to the court of common pleas of the county where it lies. Section 12 declares that the land which shall then be sold, shall include all that the deceased may have convoyed, with intent to defraud his creditors. Section 122 *gives the administrator a right to maintain the action of ejectment, or a bill in chancer}\u2019 to avoid such sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Under this statute, the administrator represents the creditors of the deceased person making a fraudulent conveyance, and is bound to pursue the property, for the benefit of creditors, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>they might have reached, if the intestate had lived. He is bound to deal fairly with all the creditors; is authorized expressly to pursue his legal action to obtain possession of lands fraudulently conveyed ; and <em>a fortiori </em>he may sue for and recover the personal property so conveyed. By'other provisions of the statute, personalty must be first resorted to for the payment of debts. The creditor can not look to lands, in any case, for the satisfaction of - his debts, until all the personal estate within his reach has been exhausted.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">The facts disclosed by the bill of exceptions show that the administrator of Lo Baron does not, in point of fact, represent the interests of his heirs to the amount of a cent. The estate is deeply involved. The judgment of $13,000, recovered against the fraudulent assignee, should be suffered to stand for the benefit of the creditors of the estate, among whom the law distributes it upon equitable principles. I maintain that the action was well brought; that the creditors are the parties in interest, and duly represented under the provisions of the statute; that the fraudulent transfer of goods or lands by the intestate, destroyed no claim which creditors have upon them, or their proceeds; and that, if the estate is insolvent, <em>such lands, goods, and their proceeds, </em>are assets for the payment of the debts due and owing by the estate. Who can administer <em>assets </em>of a decedent, in Ohio, but the administrator? The answer is, to me, plain <em>: </em>\u2014 no <em>one. </em>Then, does not the above decision make a case of wrong without a remedy? It is said that the remedy is in chancery. Admitting that it is; but for this decision, it would not follow that it is there, because there was not a plain and adequate remedy at law. For, it is palpable that trover is a form of action less complex than a bill in equity; it requires but two parties, and affords the very best tribunal *for exposing a fraud; to wit, a jury trial. While, upon a proceeding in chancery, every one of the creditors must como in and be made a party, or he can not get his distributive share ; and the administratoi\u20198 and heirs must also be brought in, if for no other purpose than to deny that there are other assets.</p>\n<p id=\"AbkY\">But I have said enough. I leave the subject, with a request that those who may think me in error, will take the trouble to examine the question in connection with the past decisions of the court, the legislation of the state, and the authorities cited by counsel.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
