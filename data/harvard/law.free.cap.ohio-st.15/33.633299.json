The record of this judgment shows the service was made by the levy of an attachment on the interest of the defendant in a certain tract of land in said Adams county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AT7\">*To the declaration in this suit, on this record from Pennsylvania, the defendant has plead specially in bar of the action, that he was never served with process; that he did not appear in the suit, neither by himself nor bis attorney, and that he was never within the jurisdiction of' the State of Pennsylvania.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b28-9\">The plaintiff has replied to this plea, that the defendant was brought before the court by an attachment <em>served on Ms land in Pennsylvania; </em>and to this replication the defendant has filed a general demurrer.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b28-10\">J. B. Hart and H. H. Hunter, for plaintiff:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b28-11\">The only question is as to the effect in the State of Pennsylvania of a judgment rendered in that state in a suit commenced by foreign attachment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b28-12\">The record, of which <em>profert </em>is made in the declaration, shows service of the writ by an attachment of all the interest of the defendant in a certain tract of land on October 3, 1836; and that judgment was rendered on motion, April 25, 1837, for real debt, 1432.60, and interest from September 15, 1836.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b28-13\">After the manner of Pennsylvania records, which ordinarily, I believe, only show the beginning and conclusion of things, it does not appear whether the defendant appeared, or whether judgment was rendered by default.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b28-14\">We assume that it was by default, that being the most probable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aa\">It being a personal action for the recovery of a debt, and not a proceeding <em>in rem, </em>and the court having competent jurisdiction, wo claim that the effect of the judgment is general, and concludes the party so that he can not controvert it or aver against it, unless by statute of Pennsylvania the effect of the judgment shall be limited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b28-16\">The form of the process by which the subject matter is brought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>before the court, or the manner in which it is to be served, whether by seizure of property, or personally, we think *can make no difference, provided it be such as, according to the law of the state, is prescribed to give jurisdiction to the court to pronounce upon the evidence as to the <em>amount </em>of the plaintiff\u2019s demand.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-5\">Every state or sovereignty has the right and power to prescribe in what manner causes shall be brought before its judicial tribunals to be adjudged. Under the constitution and laws of the United States, and the judicial determinations, especially of the Supreme Court of the United States, the effect of a judgment in every other state is made the same as in the state in which it is rendered. So far as the present ease is concerned, this question, we understand, is conceded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-6\">The State of Pennsylvania has provided that suits may be brought by foreign attachment, to be served by the seizure of property; and tbeir statute expressly provides that judgment may be rendered therein, not merely to subject the property seized to a sale, but generally. The effect of such judgment is not declared by statute, nor is the effect of a judgment, where personal service of process is had, so declared. The effect is therefore a legal consequence as much in the one case as the other.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-7\">An abridgment of the laws of Pennsylvania on the subject of foreign attachment, will be found in Purden\u2019s Digest, 5 ed., 436, etc.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-8\">By section 1 it is, in substance, provided, \u201cThat it shall be lawful for the plaintiff, at the third term after execution of the writ, if he shall have filed his declaration, to take judgment <em>for default of </em>appearance, unless the attachment before that time be dissolved.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-9\">Section 2 proves, \u201c That after judgment, as aforesaid, the plaintiff may have a writ of <em>scire facias </em>against the garnishee.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-10\">Section 9 provides, \u201c That after judgment, and before execution executed, the plaintiff shall give security that if the defendant will, within a year and a day, <em>disprove </em>or <em>avoid </em>the <em>debt recovered, </em>\u25a0 or discharge the same with costs, the plaintiff shall restore the goods or effects, or value thereof, attached,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-11\">^Section 12 provides, \u201c That the defendant may appear and make defense before judgment; and if judgment be rendered for the plaintiff, it shall have tho same forco and effect as if commenced by summons.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b30-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>These are all the provisions appearing to relate to the question under consideration with which we have met.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b30-5\">The record shows a <em>scire facias </em>and judgment therein, August 28, 1837, against the garnishee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b30-6\">The record also shows that a <em>fieri facias </em>issued against the garnishee, and that the lands attached were condemned November 24, 1837.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b30-7\">According to section 9, above cited, the condemnation under the execution could not take place without bond being given by the plaintiff. It must therefore be presumed, in favor of the proceeding, that bond was given. If given, the defendant, according to the further provisions of the same section, had a year and a day, which would expire on November 26, 1838, to <em>disprove </em>or <em>avoid, </em>the <em>debt. </em>If not disproved or avoided within that time, the fair construction is, we think, that the judgment, as well as the right of the plaintiff to retain the proceeds of the property, becomes absolute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b30-8\">If it were <em>disproved </em>or avoided, the fact, if relied upon by the defendant, should be pleaded. The provisions of section 12 are quite distinct in declaring the effect of the judgment when the defendant appears, provided the effect of a judgment in a case commenced by summons be known. But we submit that it does not follow that the judgment by default is destitute of effect, because the legislature has seen proper to declare the effect where there is an appeai-ance. We think the effect of the judgment, where the defendant appears, would have been the same if its effect had not been declared, that it is declared to be, by the provision referred to. And by the same process of reasoning, the effect of the judgment by default flows as a necessary consequence from the judgment, without its being declared. It is a general judgment, ascertaining the amount of the debt by a court of competent jurisdiction, in a *cause duly brought before it, according to the laws of the state for adjudication.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b30-9\">H. Stanbert, attorney-general, for defendant:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b30-10\">This case is supposed to depend on the force and effect of this judgment in Pennsylvania. If it is simply a proceeding <em>in rem, </em>no one pretends it has any validity here; but if the judgment operates beyond the property attached, so as to establish a debt <em>in </em>personam., it is claimed on the other side it must have a like effect here.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>It is understood that this court recognize such a distinction, and incline to give extraterritorial effect to judgments in foreign attachment, wbolIy\" <em>ex parte, </em>if the courts of the state, where they are rendered, give effect to them beyond the property attached.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-5\">In this particular our court is directly at variance with all the most enlightened state courts. There is a surprising uniformity of decision, to the effect that a judgment wholly <em>ex parte, </em>without service upon, or appearance by the defendant, is totally void out of the state in which it is rendered as against persons not citizens of that state. Bissell <em>v. </em>Briggs, 9 Mass. 462 ; Thurber <em>v. </em>Blackburn, 1 N. H. 242; Whittier <em>v. </em>Wendell, 7 N. H. 257; Rangely <em>v. </em>Webster, 11 N. H. 299; Hull <em>v. </em>Williams, 6 Pick. 232; Starbuck <em>v. </em>Murray, 5 Wend. 148; Roberts <em>v. </em>Caldwell, 5 Dana, 512; Holt <em>v. </em>Alloway, 2 Blackf. 108.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-6\">The whole difficulty upon this question arose out of the loose language of Judge Story in Mills <em>v. </em>Duryee, construing <em>faith and credit </em>as meaning/oree <em>and effect. All </em>judgments are in that case declared to have the same force in a sister state which they have in the state where the judgment was first rendered. But the absurdity and gross injustice of giving conclusive effect to an <em>ex parte </em>judgment, soon became apparent, and it was found necessary to qualify that decision.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-7\">*It is supposed the case of Bennott <em>v. </em>Morley, 10 Ohio, 100, had fixed the rule in Ohio in conformity with the current of decisions in the other states. The court in that case, after noticing the cases of Hall <em>v. </em>Williams, and Starbuck <em>v. </em>Murray, says: \u201cThose decisions <em>necessarily </em>followed after the qualification which had been given to the case of Mills <em>v. </em>Duryee, by the very court in which it was heard. They seemed to be indispensable in order to give import and meaning to the distinction between those proceedings where the party has had a day in court, and those where he had not.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-8\">It is now understood that our court does not adhere to what was said in that caso, but proceeds upon the distinction already stated. The consequence necessarily is, that our citizens are at the mercy of the wildest legislation of any state in the Union. If Texas enacts a law that a judgment in her courts, without process or pleadings, or any service on the defendant, shall be conclusive there, it is to bo taken as conclusive in Ohio, simply because it must have the same force and effect in Ohio that it has in Texas. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>Any one of our citizens, who has never been within a thousand miles of Texas, may be made a beggar by that doctrine.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b32-5\">Fortunately for the defendant in this case, the distinction saves him. This judgment in foreign attachment, as the defendant never appeared to make -a defense in the case, is strictly a proceeding <em>in rem, </em>and has no force or effect beyond the property at tached, even in Pennsylvania. See the statute of Pennsylvania as to foreign attachment, in Purden\u2019s Digest, 5 od. 436, etc.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b32-6\">It is strangely contended by the counsel for the plaintiff, against the clear language of this statute, that it is a judgment <em>in personam, </em>and has force and effect, as such, beyond the property attached. There is not a syllable in the whole law which can be tortured into,that construction. Without going over the different sections, it is sufficient to refer to the 12th, which provides, \u201c that the defendant may appear and make ^defense before judgment, and if judgment be rendered for the plaintiff, it shall have the same force and effect as if commenced by summons.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b32-7\">Now it happens in the case at bar, that the defendant did not appearand make defense, so that instead of becoming a proceeding <em>in personam, </em>it ended, as it began, <em>in rem.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b32-8\">I have looked very carefully into the Pennsylvania reports, but can find nothing to countenance the idea that the judgment in attachment, where the defendant does not appear, is anything but a proceeding <em>in rem.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b32-9\">In McClenachan <em>v. </em>McCarty, 1 Dall. 403, counsel, speaking of this proceeding, say : \u201c In this action the plaintiff acquires no general lien by his judgment as in other actions, but can only issue execution against the property attached.\u201d Shippen, President, says, in the same case, that their attachment act of 1705 is modeled after the attachment upon the custom of London ; that it is strictly an <em>ex parte </em>proceeding until the defendant appears.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b32-10\">In Flannagan <em>v. </em>Wotherill, 5 Whart. 286, the court say. \u201cSuch judgment in foreign attachment, it is true, is not conclusive to every purpose, but as to the property attached and ultimately made liable, it is conclusive as a proceeding <em>in rem.\u201d</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b32-11\">In Hawley <em>v. </em>Lumberman\u2019s Bank, 10 Watts, 232, it is said: \u201c The nature of an attachment, as used in this state, seems to bo a process not directly issued against the defendant himself or property in his possession, but to seize and secure property of defendant in the hands of some other person.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b33-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>It would seem, from the statute of Pennsylvania, and from what is said in the foregoing cases, that the foreign attachment in thal state, where the defendant does not appear, has no effect, even there, beyond the property attached.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b33-5\">In Pelton <em>v. </em>Platner, 13 Ohio, 218, this court treated a judgment in attachment, rendered in Michigan, as of no validity in Ohio, there being no service on the defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b33-6\">In the same case, the court reaffirm the doctrine, that if such a judgment had a further effect <em>in personam </em>in Michigan, it would have equal effect in Ohio.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b33-7\">^Although this ease does not require the defendant to combat that doctrine, I trust the court will not consider a few observations upon it as out of place.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b33-8\">' I have not found an authority in any other state that will support it. Everywhere, even among the strongest advocates for the full faith and credit clause of the constitution, it is admitted that the court rendering the judgment must have jurisdiction before any effect can be given to such judgment in a new jurisdiction or in another state.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b33-9\">Surely no one has gone further than Mr. Justice Story in giving force to foreign judgments, and yet in Piequet <em>v. </em>Swan, 5 Mason, 42, he uses this language: \u201cI have already intimated that no sovereignty can extend its process beyond its territorial limits, to subject either persons or property to its judicial decisions. Every exertion of authority beyond this limit is a nullity, and incapable of binding persons or property in any other tribunals. If a state were to pass an act declaring that upon personal notice of a suit brought against a foreigner, resident in a foreign country, proceedings might bo had against him, and a judgment obtained <em>in invitum ; </em>for aught I know, the local tribunals might give a binding efficacy to such judgments; but elsewhere, they would be utterly void, as a usurpation of general sovereignty over independent nations and their subjects.\u201d Again, he says: \u201c Where a party is within a territory, he may justly bo subjected to its process and bound personally by the judgment pronounced on such process against him. Where he is not within such territory, and is not personally subject to its laws, if, on account of his supposed or actual property being within the territory, process by the local laws may, by attachment, go to compel his appearance, and for his default to appear, judgment may be pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>nounced against him; such a judgment must, upon general principles, bo deemed only to bind him to the extent of such property, and can not have the effect of a conclusive judgment <em>in personam, </em>for t'no plain reason that, except so far as the property is concerned, it is a judgment <em>*coram non judice. </em>If the party chooses to appear and take upon himself the defense of the suit, that might vary the case, for he may submit to the local jurisdiction and waive his personal immunity.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b34-6\">The learned judge, among other authorities for this doctrine, refers particularly to the case of Bissell <em>v. </em>Briggs, 9 Mass. 462, which was upon a judgment of a sister state, and held a nullity in Massachusetts for want of personal service.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b34-7\">I must further refer this court to Judge Cowen\u2019s note, 4 Phil. Ev. 9C7, in which all the authorities are collected, and the doctrine is summed up in these words :</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b34-8\">\u201c A person, however, though a citizen of another state or country, when he comes within the territory of a particular sovereignty, contracts a sort of temporary allegiance to it, and may justly be subjected to its process and bound personally by the judgment of its courts. And whether jurisdiction be founded upon the <em>person </em>being within its territory, or the <em>property </em>being there, the judgment will be deemed valid so far as that jurisdiction could legitimately extend, but no further. Thus, a very common course in many of the United States and in many other countries, is to proceed against non-residents by an arrest or attachment of their property within the territory. Judgment obtained on process of this kind will generally bind the property so arrested or attached. But such judgment will not be regarded by neighboring states, or other nations, as evidence of indebtedness or as operative in any measure <em>in personam, </em>and for this obvious reason, viz: that, except so far as the property attached is concerned, there is and can be no jurisdiction \u2014 no power of adjudication.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b34-9\">Now, in the ease at bar, an attempt is made to give effect to this Pennsylvania judgment <em>in personam, </em>in Ohio. It is admitted in the pleading, that no service was made on the defendant; that he did not appear in person or by attorney, and that, in fact, he never was within the territorial limits of Pennsylvania. The courts of that state never had jurisdiction *of his person, and under such circumstances, they render a judgment against him and give <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>it effect there as a judgment <em>in </em>personam, yet in the language of Judge Story, <em>elsewhere it would be utterly void.</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b35-5\">Wood, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aba\">By the pleadings in this case, it is admitted that the only service in the action, upon the record of which this suit is brought, was by seizing the lands of the defendant. It is not claimed that any <em>personal </em>notice was ever given to the defendant. Is the record of. a judgment obtained by means of <em>such </em>service in <em>Pennsylvania,prima facie </em>evidence of debt in Ohio? If so, the plea is no answer to the declaration ; the replication is sufficient, and the demurrer should be overruled. But if not, the defendant is entitled to judgment on this issue of law. To acquire jurisdiction over the person of an individual, it is necessary that ho should be, or <em>at least </em>have been, within the territorial limits of the sovereignty, or no judgment can be rendered against him which will bind him <em>personally. </em>This is not only a principle of common law, but such service must be made that a defendant may have his day in court. \u201c Strike, but hear me,\u201d is the spirit of the rule, and if any exception intervene, it is the creature of positive legislative provision. Property within the territorial limits of a sovereignty, will, in like manner, confer jurisdiction over it, and where service is made upon it the judgment rendered will bind it; but beyond this, it is of no validity, and can not be enforced against the debtor \u2014certainly not, in the absence of statutory provision. In Pelton <em>v. </em>Plainer, 13 Ohio, 218, this court has said, that execution can not be issued by a justice of the peace and levied on other property than that attached, when the suit is commenced in that way ; nor can execution issue on such judgment against the person; nor is such judgment <em>prima facie </em>evidence of debt and the reason is, that when the judgment has converted the property, it is <em>functus officio </em>for every other purpose. Id, But where service is made on property only, and judgment is rendered in a court of record, the statute of Ohio provides for the issuing of execution against *the defendant for any <em>balance due after exhausting the property. </em>If, however, the debtor had never been within the territorial limits of Ohio before the rendition of such judgment, it is worthy of the most serious consideration whether, by the force of this statute, execution could be issued against him <em>personally. </em>The decision of this question is, however, not necessarily involved in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>If this record of the Pennsylvania judgment is <em>prima facie </em>evidence of debt in this state, it is because it is so in Pennsylvania. The law is well settled, at this day, that the judgments of our sister states must have the same faith, credit, validity, force, and effect in every other state that they have by law or usage in the state where they are rendered; and that whatever pleas would be good to a suit thereon in such state, and none others, could be pleaded in any court of the United States (3 Wheat. 234; 13 Pet. 324), though execution can only issue in the state wherein the judgment is pronounced. 13 Pet. 225. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania have, however, recently held that a judgment in foreign attachment, affecting to bind not only the property attached, but the persons of defendants not citizens of the state, nor within its precincts at the time, is to be treated as a nullity by a court in another state, which is called on to enforce it by action, though it would bind the persons of the defendants in the courts and by the laws of the state in which it was rendered. ' Law Rep. for Feb. 1846, p. 471. In Ohio, as the law now stands, though such a judgment would be held, <em>prima facie, </em>valid, the counsel for the plaintiff have totally failed to show us that the judgment in question binds anything in Pennsylvania beyond the property attached. Of the statutes of other states wo do not take judicial notice. They must be proved, and if any such effect as is claimed is given to the judgment in question, where it was pronounced, the counsel for the plaintiff have entirely failed to show it. \"</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">Nothing of the kind is evidenced by the reports of that state that we are able to find, and, in our view, it would be a most unwarrantable assumption to presume it.</p>\n<p id=\"Ahq\">*The statute of Pennsylvania provides only, in such case of attachment, that the defendant may appear and make defense, and in such case \u2014 that is, when he appears, submits to the jurisdiction and has his day in court \u2014 the judgment rendered shall have the same effect as if the suit was commenced by summons. Purdon\u2019s Dig. 437. It is silent as to the effect when the defendant has no notice of the attachment until after judgment rendered, and before which period the defendant had not been within the jurisdiction of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">There appears to us, therefore, no authority for saying that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>this judgment is of any validity where pronounced, beyond the conversion of the property seized, and ought not to be considered as <em>prima facie </em>evidence of debt in this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">Demurrer sustained.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
