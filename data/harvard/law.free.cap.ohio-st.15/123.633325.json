The declaration con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>tains one common and two special counts, and to which the plaintiff in error plead the general issue of <em>non assumpsit. </em>The case was tried in the Supreme Court for Trumbull county, at the August term, 1844, by a jury, and a verdict and judgment rendered for the defendant in error. This judgment is sought to bo reversed by the prosecution of this writ of error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-5\">From a bill of exceptions which was taken during the trial, it appears that the defendant in error gave evidence to prove that, at the time stated in the declaration, he conveyed the land described therein, to the plaintiff in error. That the price agreed upon between the parties was $800; and he received, in payment therefor, $400, and <em>two certificates of honorable discharge from the army of the </em>* <em>United States, </em>at the close of'the war with Great Britain, <em>given </em>to soldiers therein, which were estimated by the parties at $200 each ; and which certificates were, at the time of the trade, assigned to the defendant in error. The defendant in error gave evidence tending to prove that, at the time said certificates wore assigned to him, the plaintiff in error had warranted them. The defendant also gave evidence as to the value of the land sold, and likewise evidence tending to prove that both the parties supposed the certificates of honorable discharge would entitle the holder to certain quantities of land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-6\">The plaintiff in error then gave evidence tending to prove that at the time said certificates wore taken by the defendant in error, it was agreed between the parties the defendant in error should take them <em>at his own risk. </em>He also gave evidence as to the value of the land purchased by him. There was no proof of fraud in the transaction, nor that the defendant in error had ever offered to rescind the contract, except by demanding payment of the plaintiff in error, and to which he replied ho would see the defendant in error the next day.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-7\">The court then charged the jury that if these certificates were supposed by the parties at the time they were assigned, to convey lands or to transfer a right to obtain lands, that the defendant in error was entitled to recover, inasmuch as the assignment of the certificates was made void by the laws of the United States, and vested no interest in him; and the rule of damages in that event would bo $400, the amount at which the certificates were estimated by the parties, with the interest thereon; but if the certificates were received by the defendant in error under an agreement that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>he should take them <em>at his own risk, </em>whether they were of value or not, he was not entitled to recover. -To this charge of the court the plaintiff in error excepted, and has assigned the same for error, and by reason thereof now seeks to recover the judgment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b105-4\">*Tod\u201e Hodman &amp; Hutchins, and Wade &amp; Ranney, for plaintiff in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b105-5\">1. All the parts of the contract between these parties go to make up an <em>entire contract; </em>and, in making it, each party relied upon and was influenced by each and every part of it. And we can well imagine- that one great inducement with the plaintiff in purchasing the land was, that ho could pay in part with his certificates. But for this, he would not have purchased tho land at so high a nominal price, if indeed he would have purchased at all. BeiDg a contract of this description, the defendant can not recover without first having offered to rescind it, return the certificate, and thus place the parties <em>in statu quo. </em>Coolidge <em>v. </em>Bingham, 1 Met. 547; 2 Kent\u2019s Com., 3 ed. 479, 480; Kimball <em>v. </em>Cunningham, 4 Mass. 502; Conner <em>v. </em>Henderson, 15 Ib. 322: <em>Perly v. </em>Balch, 23 Pick. 283-286; Hunt <em>v. </em>Silk, 5 East, 449; Alexander <em>v. </em>Owen, 1 Term, 225.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b105-6\">2. But if it is permitted to the defendant, at his own option, to rescind the contract or not, as he may please, either in whole or in part, surely the plaintiff should bo allowed the poor privilege of proving the value of the land, and establishing a correct rule of damages. If the land was worth $800, the plaintiff should pay $400, with the interest; but if tho sum named ($800) was a mere nominal sum, he should not be estopped from proving what it was actually worth, otherwise gross and,manifest injustice will be done him. Spencer <em>v. </em>Tilden, 5 Cow. 144; Sherman <em>v. </em>Comstock, 21 Wend. 457; Gleason <em>v. </em>Pinney, 5 Cow. 152.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b105-7\">3. The certificates having been assigned in good faith, and proving worthless, the loss should be borne by Wildman, else there is no mutuality in the agreement. Suppose the certificates had proved to have been worth more than $400, and neither knew but they were actually worth more, could Taft have sued Wild-man for the excess ? Certainly not. And why? Because he had agreed Wildman should have them, no matter *what their value. Shall not Wildman, then, be compelled to keep them, regardless of their value ? It seems to us that in no other way can exact justice be done between the parties.

Taylor, for defendant in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b106-6\">I. Tho certificates of \u201chonorable discharge \u201d to tho two soldiers were valueless, unless as evidence for the soldiers <em>themselves, </em>to procure lands from tho government. They were called \u201c soldiers\u2019 rights \u201d by the parties, who, in their ignorance of their value, supposed they would authorize the holders to draw military bounty lands from the general government. Any assignment of a soldier\u2019s right to military bounty land was, by act of Congress, rendered void both at law and in equity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b106-7\">The attempt of Taft to assign these \u201csoldiers\u2019 rights\u201d was a void act; \u201cvoid things are nothings.\u201d It was no payment of the $400.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b106-8\">II. The authorities fully establish the following positions :</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b106-9\">1. A payment in a counterfeit bill, supposed by the parties at the time to be genuine, is no payment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b106-10\">2. It is the same as. to payment in the bill of a broken bank, supposed by the parties to be solvent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b106-11\">3. Payment for goods, or of a pre-existing debt, i.n the note of a third person, who proves to be insolvent, is no payment, unless it be made affirmatively to appear that there is \u201ca clear and special agreement that the vendor shall take the paper absolutely as payment.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ay1\">*These cases are not precisely the same, in point of fact, with that at bar, but the principle governing them is, wo apprehend, precisely the same.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b106-13\">Wildman parted with his property \u201c without receiving the compensation which was intended.\u201d Ho' \u201creceived, by mistake, a thing in payment, different from what was due.\u201d It being \u201cof no value, the creditor might consider it as waste paper, and resort to his original demand.\u201d \u201c It is a maxim of the law, that tho loss is to him who was the owner at the time such loss happened, if both parties were ignorant of the loss at the time of making their contract.\u201d \u201cWhen a man pays a debt, the medium of payment must turn out to bo what he represented it to be at the time of payment.\u201d Markle <em>v. </em>Hatfield, 2 Johns. 455; Johnson <em>v. </em>Weed, 9 Johns. 309; Ontario Bank <em>v. </em>Lightbody, 13 Wend. 101; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>also, Yanshaick, Senator, in same case; Darst <em>v. </em>Brockway, 11 Ohio, 471.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b107-5\">III. The common count, for land sold, is sufficient to maintain the action. 1 Chit. Pl. 338.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b107-6\">IY. It was not such a special exchange of property as that the plaintiff below was bound to declare upon it specially as such. Porter <em>v. </em>Talcott, 1 Cow. 359, is a thorough examination of the authorities on this point, and fully sustains our position.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b107-7\">Y. The plaintiff below was not bound to, nay, he could not rescind the contract. The land was deeded, and possession given to Taft; personal property had been received and appropriated by Wildman. No contract is to be rescinded, except the parties can be placed <em>in statu quo. </em>When <em>possession </em>has accompanied the contract, the parties can not be placed <em>in statu quo. </em>Hunt v. Silk, 5 East, 449 ; Caswell <em>v. </em>Black River Manufacturing Co., 14 Johns. 453.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b107-8\">The question made by the plaintiff in error is, in substance, this: The vendor having convoyed, the vendee, by mistake, failing to pay, as he undertook to do, the vendor is bound to demand a rescission of the contract; that can not be law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b107-9\">*YI. The rule of damages, as held on the circuit, was right. The parties themselves had fixed the price of the land, and neither court nor jury had authority to make a new contract for them.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b107-10\">Wood, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AHa\">The question submitted for our consideration in this case is, did the Supreme Court err in the instructions given to the jury?</p>\n<p id=\"b107-11\">The counsel for the plaintiff in error have submitted an argument close, logical, and able. It does much credit to their ingenuity; but we are, nevertheless, unable to adopt their views, as applicable to <em>this </em>case. They claim the action is founded upon a supposed rescission of the contract, as to a part of the consideration, the certificates of discharge, without rescinding the agreement <em>in </em>toto, by tendering back the money received and the certificates of discharge, and demanding a reconveyance of the land, when the contract formed, it is said, but a single transaction, and is entire. No principle is better settled than that a party who would rescind an agreement must place his adversary <em>in statu quo. </em>If he have received anything of value, he must offer to restore it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>or he will not be permitted, by rescinding his agreement, to recover for what he has advanced by reason thereof. The charge of the court was <em>not inconsistent with any principle here laid down. </em>It does not appear from the record these honorable discharges were of any intrinsic value whatever; certainly not, in the hands of the purchaser, because, by the laws of the United States, the assignment was absolutely void. Neither does it appear from .the record that they were of value in the hands of the seller; for it is -not shown that the period of his enlistment, or his term of service in the army of the United States, entitled him to any bounty in land from the government. Under such circumstances their return was of no importance to the rescission of the agreement. Neither the necessity of a return of those certificates, however, nor of the money received, to enable the defendant in error to recover on the trial, appears to have been made *a point in the defense. The bill of exceptions does not show that any instructions were asked of the court, and it is, therefore, no error that they did not charge the jury on that point, nor would it have been had no charge at all been given to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">But there is nothing in the record to show that there was any claim to have this agreement rescinded by the defendant in error. On the other hand, he counts upon it specially in his declaration, and relies for recovery on the breach of it by the plaintiff in error, in not delivering <em>two </em>certificates, which would entitle the defendant in error to the contemplated land, and for this failure in making part payment for the land conveyed, damages are sought. This is, in fact, the whole case: If A. convey land to B. and agree to receive payment in cash and other specified property, and the cash only is paid, can not the vendor sue for tho value of the property without returning the cash and demanding back the land ? We think he can, and there is <em>nothing\u25a0 more sought or charged \u25a0 by the court in the case at bar. </em>The jury have found that these parties acted in the sale and transfer of these certificates, under a <em>mutual mistake.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">The law is: If C. receive of D. a thing represented to be valuable, and which C. supposes is so, in payment of a debt, but which is in fact of <em>no </em>value, C. may sue on the original demand for the consideration, as if no payment had been made, and <em>quoad hoc, </em>treat the thing received as no payment. This transaction was not a barter, however, or exchange of property, as presented in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>the record, but the sale of a farm, to be paid in cash, and certificates which would entitle the vendor to other lands, and as this part of the consideration failed, the court did not err, in our opinion, in saying a recovery might be had under the limitations and restrictions set out in the bill of exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">But it is said the court erred in the rule of damages given to the jui'v; that tho true rule would be, the value of the property sold. \u2022 The law, however, permits parties, in their agreements, to fix their own terms, conditions, and prices; and as *they had estimated the certificates at $400, tho court did not err, wo think, in holding that amount, with the interest thereon from the time of their delivery, to bo the rule of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">We are, therefore, of the opinion the judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b109-7\">Birchard, J., having been counsel with one of tho parties, took no part in this decision.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
