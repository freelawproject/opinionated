Clark and others.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b501-5\">A recognizance to let to bail on the allowance of a writ of error, after conviction, is not authorized by the act allowing writs of error in criminal cases, and is therefore void.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b501-6\">This is a writ of error to the court of common pleas of Summit county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b501-7\">The original action was debt, upon a criminal recognizance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b501-8\">The facts were as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b501-9\">At the May term, 1843, of the court of common pleas of Summit county, Don R. Clark was convicted of grand lareenyj %nd sentenced to the penitentiary for the term of three years. Application was made for the allowance of a writ of error, under the act allowing writs of error in criminal cases. The writ was allowed, made returnable forthwith, the judgment of the court ordered to be suspended, and Clark to be let to bail in the sum of $1,000, and discharged from custody. The condition of the recognizance was, that said Clark should prosecute his writ of error to effect, or surrender himself to the sheriff if said judgment should not be reversed. The judgment of the common pleas was affirmed, and Clark fled the country. The other defendants were Clark\u2019s sureties in the recognizance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b501-10\">To the declaration filed in the cause the defendants demurred, and the court of common pleas sustained the demurrer and gave judgment against the state for costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b501-11\">To reverse this judgment this writ was sued out; the errors assigned being, first, that the court erred in sustaining the demurrer, and second, in rendering judgment against the state for costs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b501-12\"><em>W. </em>S. C. Otis, for the state:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b501-13\">I maintain that the judge allowing the writ of error had power to make the order which he did in the premises, and that the bond executed in accordance with the order was good and valid in law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b501-14\">The policy of our government and laws is to secure the liberty of every citizen, unless his restraint be imposed as a punishment, or to secure his appearanee to answer to a criminal charge. Hence the provision in the constitution, \u201c that all persons shall be bailable by sufficient sureties, unless for capital offenses,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b502-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>Tho right to admit to bail is a common-law right, and the constitutional provision confers no new right. The court of king\u2019s bench, having a supervision over all the courts, has always exereised the power of admitting to bail, as well <em>after </em>*as <em>before </em>conviction, in their discretion. 1 Hale\u2019s P. C. 106; 2 Hawk. 443 ; 3 Hill, 676.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b502-5\">The Supreme Court of any of the states of the Union, or any one of the judges thereof, having a like supervision over other courts, have tho same power in relation to bail in criminal cases as tho king\u2019s bench in England, unless restrained by the constitution or by statute. 5 Cow. 39; 1 Gall. 488; 1 Story on Con. 140 ; 2 Ib. 264, 268.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b502-6\">The question whether bail shall be taken or not is, in all cases of felony, purely judicial. The statutes, in giving power to bail, create no new ministerial duty. 3 Hill, 673; 10 Wend. 464.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b502-7\">The constitution and laws of Ohio, it is conceded, do restrain courts from receiving bail in capital cases, but leave the matter in all other cases as at common law, subject to judicial discretion.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b502-8\">As far as regards the powers and principles involved in this \u25a0 ease, the case of Morris <em>v. </em>Marcy et ah, 4 Ohio, 83, is almost, if not altogether in point.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b502-9\">E. P. Spalding, for the defendants: \u25a0</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b502-10\">Waiving the discussion of the question whether, at common law, the power to let to bail, as well after as before conviction, is inherent in the office of a judge of the Supreme Court, it is sufficient to reply that that implied power is, in this state, controlled by express legislative enactment. The statute has made provision for letting to bail in certain cases, and pointed out the mode of proceeding, and prohibited it in others; and nowhere is the power conferred to let to bail after conviction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b502-11\">If, then, the power to let to bail and take a recognizance after conviction is not conferred by statute, the recognizance is void, either as a statutory or common-law obligation. 11 Mass. 337; 7 Pick. 231.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AqEJ\">*Eead, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A2d\">The whole question in this case is, whether tho judge allowing the writ of error and directing a suspension of the execution had authority to discharge upon bail. This had been done in several instances after the passage of the act allowing writs of error in criminal eases. If the judge directing tho recog<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>nizance had no power to let to bail, it is void. We have decided this point at this term in the case of Powell <em>v. </em>State of Ohio. If the recognizance is not good as a statutory bond, it is not good at common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">It is contended that section 12 of article 8 of the 'constitution, which declares that all persons shall be bailable by sufficient sureties, unless for capital offenses, where the proof is evident or the presumption great, confers the power to let to bail, as exercised in this instance, and that the <em>habeas Corpus </em>act recognizes the same principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">It is claimed that, at common law, all felonies were bailable until limited by statute, and that the court of king\u2019s bench exercised this power as well after as before conviction. For the power to bail, and its mode of exercise, we look to our own constitution and laws. Although the jurisdiction and power of the court is conferred by the constitution, it is to be exercised in the mode pointed out by tho statute. Tt is true that the constitution confers sufficient power to authorize the legislature, by statute, to permit bail, as well after as before conviction. This power has been both exercised and prohibited, in the very act under consideration, according to the grade of offense; forbidding, upon the well-known rules of construing statutes, to discharge upon bail in capital or penitentiary cases, and directing that bail in all other cases may be taken, until judgment be reversed or affirmed. Prior to this act, writs of error were not allowed in criminal cases, and a suspension of execution could only result from executive pardon or respite, or a continuance by the courts. The act allowing writs of error in criminal cases directs a suspension of execution in capital and penitentiary *cases until the writ of error shall be finally disposed of, but in all other cases makes the suspension of execution to depend upon entering into a recognizance, conditioned to prosecute his writ of error to effect, and to surrender himself to the sheriff of the county in which conviction was had, unless the judgment be reversed or a new trial ordered. The statute, then, has directed the mode and incidents of the application and allowance of a writ of error in criminal cases. The person convicted is in a better condition than before this statute was enacted. If it had not been enacted the judgment could have been at once carried into execution. The constitution did not forbid that, or authorize bail. Why, then, after con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>viction, if the legislature see proper to suspend sentence for the benefit of the prisoner, should the constitution step in and direct bail? If, after conviction, there is power to order immediate execution, why should a more merciful and favorable exercise of power in behalf of the prisoner create an additional right to bail ? We can perceive no solid reason for any such construction. Before conviction, all persons, as limited by the constitution, are bailable. After conviction, it depends upon the statute whether they shall be let to bail or not. In this case, the act not authorizing bail, the judge had no power to direct the recognizance, and it is therefore void.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">The demurrer to the declaration was well taken, and the judgment of the court of common pleas is affirmed, except as to judgment for costs against the state, and, as to that, reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
