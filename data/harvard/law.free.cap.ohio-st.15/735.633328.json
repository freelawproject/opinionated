Ewing, for the plaintiff, made the following points :</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b619-13\">1 <em>Conveyance by married women </em>\u2014 Acknowledgment. \u2014 The certificate must show that the married woman, upon a separate examination, acknowledged the facts necessary to the validity of the deed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b619-14\">When the certificate does not show that one of the grantors is a married woman, but merely states that \u201cSusan M., John H., and Eliza A. H.,\u201d severally acknowledged the indenture to bo their voluntary act, for the uses, etc., there is no ground whatever for \u00a1presuming that there was a separate examination of one of the parties as a married woman, and a due acknowledgment of the facts necessary to the validity of the deed. It can not be presumed, even, that the justice knew that one of the parties was a married woman, for the justice examines the contents of the deed only, when he takes the acknowledgment of a married woman as such.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b619-15\">2. <em>Statute of limitations. </em>\u2014 A eonveyance in fee simple by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>husband of his wife\u2019s lands passes an estate for their joint lives The possession of the grantee is not adverse, but *1 awful, and the wife\u2019s right of action does not accrue until after her husband\u2019s death.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b620-5\">Adverse possession is never presumed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b620-6\">Title, by adverse possession, is confined to that which is actually possessed, where there are several distinct lots.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b620-7\">It is not presumed that a mortgagee is in possession, and that his possession is under a title adverse to that of the mortgagor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b620-8\">Even if the grantee had hold adverse possession before such conveyance, the right of action being destroyed or suspended thereby during the coverture, the statute of limitations would begin to run after the husband\u2019s death. Possession by the authority or with the assent of the husband is rightful, not adverse.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b620-9\">3. <em>Ordinance of 1787 </em>\u2014 Legislative <em>power of the governor and judges. </em>\u2014 The governor and judges could not adopt a law enacting that the owner of land mortgaged before such adoption should bo deprived of his estate by a judicial proceeding against another person. That would not be \u201ca judicial proceeding according to the course of the common law,\u201d within the meaning of the ordinance, article <em>2; </em>for in such proceeding the party to be affected has his day in court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b620-10\">4. <em>Statute </em>\u2014 Unconstitutionality.\u2014Mortgaged lands descended to the heir in the year 1806, when there was no law in force authorizing the summary seizure and sale thereof; the legislature could not afterward enact that the estate should be divested by means of (so-called) judicial proceedings, carried on between third persons. But the legislature might declare the effect of mortgage deeds to be made in future, and authorize a foreclosure without notice to the mortgagor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b620-11\">5. <em>Legislative enactment </em>\u2014 Construction <em>of. </em>\u2014 An act should not be construed so as to give it a retrospective operation when that can be avoided.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b620-12\">An act should not be construed in such a way as to make it unconstitutional, if it will reasonably admit of a contrary interpretation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AF6x\">*If the words of a statute are ambiguous, that construction should be put upon them which will make the statute conformable to legal principles, and preserve existing rights.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b620-14\">A law was adopted by the governor and judges of the North<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>west Territory, providing for the satisfaction of mortgages thereto'ore as well as thereafter made. It required process, by writ of <em>scire </em>facias, against \u201c the mortgagor or mortgagors, his, her, or their heirs, executors, or administrators, that he or they be or appear,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b621-5\">The proper construction of this law is, that a writ of <em>scire facias </em>is to go either against the heir, executor, or administrator of the mortgagor, according to the nature of the estate mortgaged: if the land is freehold, the writ must go against the owner (the heir); if it be leasehold, it must go against the executor or administrator, he being the legal owner.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b621-6\">The law should not be construed to mean that the mortgagee may cause the process to bo issued against either the heir, executor, or administrator, according to his own mere whim and caprice, without any regard to the tenure and ownership of the property mortgaged.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b621-7\">This latter construction would violate the rules above stated, and would make the law unconstitutional when applied to mortgages executed before its adoption.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b621-8\">But when an act similar in other respects was prospective only in its operation, and authorized the rendition of a judgment affecting the personal estate in the hands of the executor, as a debt of record, as well as the mortgaged lands belonging to the heir, it has been held (8 Ohio, 45) that the citation of either party was a compliance with the law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b621-9\">6. <em>Jurisdiction over the person </em>\u2014 When <em>presumed. </em>\u2014 The service of process on the owner of land can not be presumed when she is not named as a defendant in the proceedings; but the writ being produced, is found to have been issued against and served upon another person.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b621-10\">7. <em>Judgment against an administrator </em>\u2014 Its <em>effect. </em>\u2014 When a legislative enactment confers upon a court the power *of summarily seizing and disposing of the lands of a citizen, without giving him a day in court, the judgment must be such as the enactment authorizes, or it can not be made available against a stranger to the proceedings.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b621-11\">Therefore, a judgment rendered against an administratrix, adjudging her to pay a debt, and directing execution therefor&gt; can not be produced in evidence against another person, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>owner of mortgaged land, as a judgment that the plaintiff shall have execution upon the mortgaged premises.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b622-5\"><em>A </em>fortiori, the judgment can not be so produced in evidence by the party obtaining it and those claiming under him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b622-6\">Even a j\u00fadgment, erroneous only and not void, can not be used in evidence against a stranger; he may defeat the judgment by plea \u2014 it is his only remedy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b622-7\">8. <em>Writ of execution, levy, cind sale </em>\u2014 Validity <em>of. </em>\u2014 When a legislative enactment confers upon a court the power of summarily seizing and disposing of the lands of a citizen, without giving him a day in court, the writ of execution must be such as the enactment authorizes, or it is unavailing against a stranger to the proceedings.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b622-8\">Therefore, a writ of execution upon all the goods and lands formerly belonging to a deceased person, can not be produced in evidence against a stranger to the proceedings, as an execution authorized by such last-mentioned enactment, to be levied upon lands included in a particular mortgage deed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b622-9\">A levy, under said writ, of a part of the mortgaged land, and a sale thereof for part of the debt, leaving the remainder unpaid, is not a levy and sale under the special statutory power above referred to.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b622-10\">The rule that ancient judicial proceedings are to be regarded with favor, does not apply where no possession is founded upon them. Nor should it be applied at all to <em>ex parte </em>proceedings; they are not favored by courts of justice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b622-11\">Such levy and sale are not valid under the general execution law, authorizing the levy upon and sale of the lands of the defendant in an action. In this case, lands not belonging to the defendant were levied upon and sold.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ABf\">^Besides, the general execution law forbade a sale at less than two-thirds of the appraised value. It was not intended to apply this restriction to mortgages taken under the old laws, with the right to subject the property to sale for what it would bring. Hence the act of 1807, reviving the old <em>scire facias </em>laws, enacts that the mortgage money shall be recoverable under the laws in force when the mortgage was executed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b622-13\">9. <em>Evidence </em>\u2014 Proof <em>of sale by sheriff, and of his authority to sell. </em>\u2014 \u25a0 The sale to the grantee must be proved, either by the sheriff\u2019s return, or by other competent evidence. A recital in the sheriff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>deed, that he had sold to A. B., is not evidence, unless the deed is acknowledged in open court, or the conveyance is approved of and confirmed by the court having specific authority to revise tho proceedings after the judgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b623-5\">A sale to the sheriff\u2019s grantee may be presumed, if he has obtained and held possession under the deed; but when that is not tho case, and the deed is produced in evidence against a stranger to the proceedings, no such presumption arises.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b623-6\">In the latter case, tho party setting up the proceedings should bo hold to strict proof. Therefore, when the sheriff\u2019s deed recites, as the authority for the conveyance, one judgment rendered by the court of common pleas, in December term, 1810, and the proof relied on is two judgments rendered in April term, 1808, the proof of the sheriff\u2019s authority is insufficient. Nor will it be made sufficient by evidence that no other suits were brought in the court of common pleas, if the sheriff could have derived authority from a judgment of the date recited in another court in the same county. A mistake in the description of the court may be presumed, instead of three mistakes as to the number of judgments, tho year and tho term.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b623-7\">10. <em>Sheriff\u2019s deed </em>\u2014 Acknowledgment <em>in open court. </em>\u2014 A law authorized the sate of mortgaged lands on a special execution, and directed them to be \u201cconveyed to the buyer or buyers thereof, . . in manner and form as therein above ^directed, concerning other lands and hereditaments to bo sold.\u201d The \u201c manner and form \u201d of the conveyance therein above directed, was by a deed duly executed and acknowledged by the sheriff in court.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b623-10\">A deed not so acknowledged is void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b623-11\">When the law requires a confirmation by the court of a sheriff\u2019s sale, a sheriff\u2019s deed, without such confirmation, is void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b623-12\">There was the same necessity for examining the fairness and regularity of a levy upon and sale of mortgaged lands as of other lands, especially if the law authorized the summary seizure and sale without notice to the owner.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b623-13\">A conveyance is just as necessary where the mortgagee is the purchaser, as in other cases. There is tho same necessity for an examination of the proceedings on the acknowledgment of the deed in open court. The words of the law do not except this case, but require a conveyance to the buyer in all cases.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b623-14\">The general execution law of 1805, providing for sheriffs\u2019 con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>veyances of lands of defendants, levied upon and sold under that law, does not apply to a levy and sale under the <em>scire facias </em>act of 1795, for the reasons stated in the eighth proposition.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b624-4\">The levy and sale wore to be made under the <em>scire facias </em>act of 1795, and the court were to examine such levy and sale, and allow or disallow the deed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b624-5\">11. <em>Deed </em>\u2014 Want <em>of attestation of signature. </em>\u2014 It is necessary for the attesting witnesses to subscribe an attestation of the facts constituting a due execution of the deed. An adoption of the testimonium clause, by a simple subscription of the witnesses\u2019 names, is sufficient; but a certificate that the deed was sealed only, or signed only, can only prove the fact certified. Tho signature does not prove itself.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b624-6\">If evidence is admissible, in such case, to prove the signing or sealing, it may be presumed in a proper ease, as where possession has been held under the deed, and the attesting witnesses are dead, or can not be produced.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AF5L\">*12. <em>Deed\u25a0 </em>\u2014 Acknowledgment <em>and attestation of, in the year </em>1798. \u2014 A deed, dated February 10, 1798, attested by one witness, not acknowledged, did not pass any title.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b624-8\">An affidavit, made by the attesting witness, before a justice of the peace, in the year 1802, that he was present and heard such deed acknowledged, is of no validity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b624-9\">Under the territorial law of June 18, 1795, a deed not acknowledged or proved, as thereby required, did not in any way affect the title \u201c in law or equity.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b624-10\">The legal title never passed in this state, by a deed not executed according to the provisions of the law in force at the date of its execution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b624-11\">13. <em>Jurisdiction of courts over the subject matter. </em>\u2014 The rights of persons, not parties, to judicial proceedings, can not be destroyed when the jurisdictional facts do not exist, especially if the plaintiff in the action be the purchaser at the sale.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b624-12\">Therefore, when a judgment has been obtained by default, in a suit against an administrator, and is produced in evidence against the owner of freehold land, as a judgment on a mortgage, under an act authorizing summary and <em>ex parte </em>proceedings on mortgages \u2014 in such case, if no mortgage ever existed, such judgment is void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b624-13\">If there be no record of the proceedings, but the papers in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>case are produced in evidence, and the so-called mortgage appears on its face to be insufficient to pass the legal title, the want of jurisdiction is shown, and the judgdment is void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b625-5\">So, if the papers show that there was no legal-title in the mortgagor, the judgment is void, as the proceedings, by writ of <em>scire </em>facias, could not be resorted to when the mortgage did not pass a legal estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b625-6\">14. <em>Validity of writ.- </em>\u2014 When a judgment, by default, against an administratrix is produced in evidence against the heir, as a judgment on a writ of <em>scire facias </em>authorized by statute, it is necessary to prove that there was a writ of <em>scire facias. </em>If the writ produced is without a seal, the judgment is void as against one not a party to the proceedings.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b625-7\">*15. Mortgage\u2014 <em>When it may be set up as a defense. </em>\u2014 In an action of ejectment, the defendant can not set up a mortgage held by a third person.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b625-8\">A mortgage is at law, as well as in equity, a security for a debt. Ho who is legally entitled to the debt, is legally entitled to the mortgage lien or pledge.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b625-9\">A conveyance in fee simple, by one claiming to be the owner, will not operate as an assignment of a mortgage debt. The purchaser does not intend to take a mere debt, and the grantor does not intend to transfer anything but real estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b625-10\">An assignment of <em>part </em>of a debt, secured by a negotiable instrument or by a mortgage, does not vest in the assignee a <em>legal </em>right.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b625-11\"><em>A fortiori, </em>a conveyance by a mortgagee of a part of the estate in foe simple, does not invest the grantee with a legal right to an undefined portion of the mortgage debt.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b625-12\">Such grantee holds adversely, and could not be made liable to account lor the rents and profits, as a mortgagee in possession. It follows that he can not set up the defense that he is a mortgagee in possession.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b625-13\">16. <em>Mortgage </em>\u2014 Effect <em>of payment of the debt, or credit on part of it. </em>\u2014 Payment or satisfaction of the debt destroys the mortgage.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b625-14\">An agreement to give credit on a mortgage, founded on a sufficient legal consideration, reduces the mortgage lion <em>pro tanto. </em>The fact that the consideration received was of less value than supposed, will not prevent this, especially if the consideration can not be restored, and more especially, if possible, where the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>sideration received exceeds in value the amount credited. See Fowler <em>v. </em>Shearer, 7 Mass. 19.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b626-5\">17. <em>Deed of release of claims. </em>\u2014 A release, under seal of the heirs, representatives and estate of John Mercer, \u201cfrom any further liability for or on account of any existing claims, debts, demands, and judgments,\u201d is conclusive evidence, at law, of the-non-existence of claims prior to the date of the deed. Such release is binding at law, unless obtained by fraud or duress. *If given under a mistaken supposition that some claims had been satisfied, the remedy is in equity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b626-6\">There is no remedy, even in equity, if a consideration has been received for the claims sought to be revived equal in value to those claims, especially if such consideration can not be re- - turned.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b626-7\">18. <em>Estoppel </em>\u2014 by <em>decree. </em>\u2014 A former judgment or decree is no estoppel, unless it appears that it could not have passed without deciding the matter set up afterward. And a verdict can not be urged as an estoppel to the litigation of a fact, which was not absolutely necessary to the finding of the verdict in the previous suit. But it may be shown, by parol evidence, that the matter was tried and determined, where the pleadings and judgment are in general terms; for example, where the declaration is on the common counts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b626-8\">The dismissal of a bill without any reasons being assigned for such dismissal, does not operate as an estoppel, unless it is manifest that the court must inevitably have decided the facts necessary to sustain the claim or defense afterward set up. If the dismissal may have been for want of sufficient parties, or for a variance between the allegations and proof, or for any other reason not affecting the matter afterward set up, there is no estoppel. Because, to constitute an estoppel, there must be a precise, certain, direct, and absolute adjudication of the very matter afterward brought in controversy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b626-9\">In the absence of enactments, a decree against a married woman, depriving her of her lands, would bind her. So, if a decree be pronounced in her favor, founded upon statements in a bill filed by her husband, perhaps she may be bound thereby. But mere statement in a bill filed by the husband, in the name of his wife, upon which no relief is had by hei'j do not bind her by way of estoppel; but the rulo applies, that a <em>feme covert </em>is not bound ty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>matters of estoppel during coverture. Such statements would only be <em>prima facie </em>evidence against the husband himself.</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b627-5\">\u2018*Even an actual recovery of the lands of the wife during coverture will not, in this state, deprive her, after the death of her husband, of any right which she had to such lands.</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b627-6\"><em>A </em>fortiori, the mere dismissal of a bill in chancery, filed during coverture, will not estop the wife from claiming her lands after the death of her husband.</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b627-7\">A conveyance was made by the husband of lands belonging to his wife; she joined in the conveyance, but was not separately examined. Aftei\u2019ward a bill in chancery was filed by the husband, in the names of himself and wife, charging, among other things, fraud in the procurement of the deed, and praying to be relieved therefrom, and then charging various matters relating to the state of the title before such conveyance was executed. The bill was dismissed without any reasons being given, and the defendant was decreed to pay the costs. It is obvious that the charges relating to the state of the title, before the conveyance, could not have been gone into by the court, as the plaintiffs were not relieved from that conveyance.

On this motion, the whole case has been opened and spread out before us with ability and zeal. The magnitude of the controversy, from the immense value of the property in dispute, makes it one of exciting interest; and it is creditable to the learned counsel, and to the profession to which they belong, that their efforts have been conducted with a becoming spirit of fairness and liberality, deigned to the abridgment of our labors, and to enlighten, not to throw shadows in our path.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>The court has not been unmindful of its responsibility in approaching this litigation. We have proceeded <em>slowly, </em>and devoted to it our best energies, so far as has been consistent with other important' functions, and are not, therefore, responsible for the result.</p>\n<p id=\"AWL4\">I will take this occasion to say a word in reference to an allusion thrown out in the argument. Fear is entertained that the feelings of this court are hostile to the disturbance of titles long enjoyed, and that unwarranted prejudices may defeat a recovery. For one, I muist admit that it is always, with me, a matter of serious regret when I see litigation springing up that is so often attended with such disastrous results to <em>innocent occupants. </em>It is only in those cases, however, where the <em>spoil is to be divided </em>with some <em>mousing speculator, </em>and when from the state of the law, the court may be forced to *aid in that result, that it feels itself called upon to give judgment in that spirit of disapprobation which tends to discourage a course that adds nothing to the character of a profession in other respects proverbial for integrity1 and correct sentiment throughout the civilized world.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">Now, let me say to the counsel for the plaintiff, if prejudice and not stern duty were to control the judgment of this court, she might receive more than <em>even-handed justice. </em>This would be the only danger. She is a female, claiming to have been unjustifiably stripped of the property in her youth, which is now <em>an immense estate, </em>and calls on this court to aid her to acquire its repossession. The very nature of such a claim, urged with force, by honorable counsel, though it may not be supported by proof, is calculated to fill an abiding place in th.e bosom of human nature herself, which it is difficult to resist. Let me not be understood as imputing to the counsel, in the case at bar, the setting in motion the engine of the law for the purpose to which I have before alluded. This court would resist, in their behalf, any intimation of the kind; for, even in this exciting case, everything has been conducted with the most <em>honorable and scrupulous integrity.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">The facts of the case are, so far as it becomes necessary to state them, substantially these: On June 10, 1796, John Mercer was seized of the following lands, in Cincinnati: One lot in the fractional part, No. 201, containing sixty square rods of ground; one other lot in the fractional part of the town, (now city), No. 409, of the like quantity; also, of a four aero lot adjoining said town, No. 29 ; a fractional part of an out-lot on the north of No. 29, supposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>to contain three acres; also, out-lot No. 28. The title of John Mercer to the above-described lots and fractional part of lot north of No. 29, was admitted on the trial in the Supreme Court for the county. The plaintiff also proved that John Mercer died in the year 1806, leaving a widow, Susan Mercer, who administered on his estate, and that the lessor of the plaintiff was his only child and heir at law. The plaintiff\u2019s ^lessor intermarried with John Heighway in the year 1812, and her husband died in 1828. The result of these facts, thus far, in the case, leaves, in the lessor of the plaintiff, a <em>perfect legal title.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">The defendants then gave in evidence, a mortgage from John Mercer and wife, dated June 10, 1796, to Abijah and Jesse Hunt, of all the above lands described, except lot No. 409. This mortgage was conditioned for the payment of $720, with interest, on or before September 10, 1796. On February 10,1798, Mercer and wife executed another mortgage to said Hunts, of all the aforesaid lands, except lot No. 201, and conditioned for the payment of $302.84, with interest, on or before February 13, 1799.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">The mortgagor being dead, and both the mortgages having years before become absolute at law, in April, 1808, Abijah and Jesse Hunt caused to be issued, out of the court of common pleas of Hamilton county, writs of <em>scire facias </em>upon each of the mortgages, against Susan Mercer, who had been appointed administratrix on the estate of her husband. The sheriff returned, in obedience to the command of these writs of <em>scire facias, </em>that he had summoned the said Susan Mercer. She made default, and thereupon judgment was rendered against her, as administratrix, for the debt, and damages adjudged to the mortgagees, and it was also ordered that <em>they have execution therefor. </em>On each judgment, on March 29, 1809, a <em>ft. fa. et lev. fa. </em>issued, on which the sheriff made a return of <em>nulla bona, </em>by the order of the plaintiffs. On March 4, 1811, <em>alias </em>writs of <em>fi. fa. et lev. fa. </em>issued. On one of these executions the sheriff returned: \u201cLevied on lot No. 201, in the fractional part of Cincinnati, sixty square rods, more or less; one out-lot, No. 28, supposed to contain four acres.\u201d On the other execution the sheriff returned: \u201cLevied on lot 409, in the fractional part of the town of Cincinnati, being sixty square rods of ground, more or less; also, four acres, lot No. 29, and a fractional part of an out-lot on the north part of said town and adjoining to lot *No. 29, supposed to bo three acres, more or-less; also, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>out-lot No. 8, on the plat of the town of Cincinnati, containing four acres, strict measure.\u201d This return is dated March 7, 1811.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">On the 2d of July thereafter, writs of <em>venditioni exponas </em>were issued, on one of which the sheriff returned $200 made, and on the other, $400. On November 5,1811, having sold parts of the property on each execution, the whole on both, the sheriff of Hamilton county conveyed to Jesse Hunt, whom he describes to be the purchaser, at the sheriff\u2019s sale, for the consideration of $600, returned by him as so much money made on the aforesaid executions, <em>all the lands described in the above levies.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">Various objections were taken by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel to the above proceedings, under which Hunt\u2019s title was derived. It is insisted that the <em>scire facias </em>issued on the mortgage of 1798 is without seal, and that it was admitted to go in evidence upon the trial. These positions are both denied by the counsel for the defendant. The judge who presided on the trial has no recollection whether the <em>scire facias </em>was offered in evidence or not, nor any memorandum from which it can <em>now </em>bo ascertained. That this objection may be of any avail, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, who move for the new trial, having the affirmative, must establish the fact. This has not heen done, and there is nothing to warrant the presumption that the <em>scire facias </em>was offered. It is not, perhaps, very important who of the counsel are right or wrong on this point, in the view the court take of it. There is now something on the writ which hears the <em>slight impression of a seal, and, after the lapse of more than a third of a century, </em>from the date of the <em>scire facias </em>to the commencement of this ejectment, the court will presume the due and legal authentication of the writ, and that the impression of the seal has disappeared from the <em>lapse of time, </em>even were this the first opportunity offered to take advantage of the assumed defect in the process.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">*There is, however, a more unfavorable point of view in which the objection may be placed. The administratrix \u2014 the mother of the plaintiff\u2019s lessor, and who represented her interest in the proceedings at law, on the mortgages \u2014 had a much earlier opportunity to object to the <em>sci. fa. </em>for its invalidity. She was summoned to plead to another <em>sci. fa. </em>to revive the original judgment on the mortgage of 1798. Her plea was filed, but nothing heard of the want of a seal, and the original judgment was revived. Under these circumstances it is <em>now </em>perfectly immaterial whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>the original <em>sci.fa. </em>was sealed or not; nor does this opinion at all conflict with the decisions <em>of </em>this court that judicial process must be under seal. A party may waive a legal right by positive act, or lose it by neglect.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Other objections were urged to both the writs of <em>sci.fa. </em>1. That they should have issued against the heir, and not against the administratrix. 2. That the lands descended to the heir on the death of John Mercer, in 1806, when there was no law authorizing the seizure and sale of mortgaged premises. The first objection is disposed of by the case of Biggerstaff <em>v. </em>Loveland, 8 Ohio, 44. To that decision this court adheres, for the reasons therein expressed. The second objection would have been of far moi\u2019e importance if the writs of <em>sci. fa. </em>had been issued before the supplemental law of 1807. The act of 1805 was in force when the supplemental act of 1807 was passed. Swan\u2019s L. L. 355. The object of this act was to extend the provisions of the statute of 1805 to mortgages which had before been executed, and to which, as the law then stood, the remedy by <em>sci. fa. </em>did not apply, as the act of 1805 was entirely prospective in its terms. This supplemental act extended the same remedy to mortgages executed before the passage of the law, as existed by th e act then in force. My impression is, that it was never intended, as is'claimed, after judgment, that the money should be made by execution according to the law in force <em>when the mortgage was executed; </em>but to leave the sale of the land for the collection of the money to the law in force when the execution was issued. Otherwise the ^burden would be thrown on the sheriff, when an execution came into his hands, of searching the record for the date of the mortgage, that he might not mistake the law under which his proceedings must be conducted.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">In the third place, it is said these judgments were void against the administratrix, but if good against her, could not affect the lands, because they were general. Before we declare the effect of these judgments, all reasonable presumptions and intendments should be <em>made </em>\u2014 after <em>the lapse of nearly forty years </em>\u2014 in their favor. The act of 1795, in force when the mortgages were executed, provides that the judgment shall be entered; that the plaintiff in the sci. <em>fa. </em>shall have execution by <em>lev. fa. </em>directed to the proper officer. The <em>sci. fa. </em>on each recites the mortgage on which it issued, and the mortgages the obligations, each, respectively, they were given to secure. \u2022 A definite description of the lands on which, by law, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>the judgments operate, is contained in each of the mortgages. The entry of judgment is in these words : \u201c And the said Susan says nothing in bar or preclusion of the action aforesaid, of the said Jesse and Abijah, therefore it is considered by the court that the said Jesse and Abijah recover of the said Susan, administratrix as aforesaid, their debts aforesaid, and damages, etc., by the court to the said Jesse and Abijah adjudged; and that they have execution therefor.\u201d The amount for which execution was to be issued, and the amount of debt and damages, are not found in express words. Those judgments can not bo considered as void, for these reasons : the substance is on the record \u2014 the amount of debt and damages is the amount due on the mortgages \u2014 and the law fixes the amount of the <em>lev. fa. </em>to be the same. These things are reducible to certainty, from fixed data, by the ordinary rules of reference and computation ; and in the early period of our judicial history, when the senses of parties were unsharpened by the rapid increase of the value of property of which they had been honestly deprived by the forms of law, that the plain and ordinary sense of of a thing, if expressed on the record, constituted a sufficient ^judgment, was doubtless supposed by all. Nor were they, in our opinion, far out of the way. The proper writs of execution, and for the legal amounts, did issue, and this was sufficient. Earle\u2019s Lessee <em>v. </em>Shoulder, 6 Ohio, 416, is in point; also, Lessee of Paine <em>V. </em>Mooreland, decided at the present term. In this last case the law required an order to be issued for the sale of the land attached, after judgment. A <em>ft. fa. </em>in the ordinary form was directed to the sheriff, which was not only levied on the identical land attached, but more, and this court held the sale on the execution a substantial compliance with the statute, sufficient after the intervention of many years. 15 Ohio. The objection that these writs of execution were not writs of <em>lev. fa. exclusively, </em>but also of <em>ft. fa., </em>is of no importance at this late day. Besides, the evidence of Gano and McMasters proves that the judgments are the same on which the executions issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">The deed executed by the sheriff is supposed to be defective, for the want of a <em>proper acknowledgment. </em>This point has been argued with great ability, as if it were the turning point in the controversy; but, without following counsel through the varying language of sections 4 and 6 of the act of 1795, in which the deed, on such sale, is proyided for, and ascertaining the precise meaning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>of the word recovered, as there employed, in the supplemental law of 1807, I have come to the conclusion that the legislature intended deeds, upon sales of mortgage property, to bo acknowledged in the same manner as in sales of real estate on ordinary judgments. The execution law of 1805 was in force when these judgments were rendered, and authorized the acknowledgment, by the sheriff, in the <em>same manner </em>that acknowledgments of other grantors were required to be made. This was the general rule, and no reason is perceived to exist for a construction of the law of 1807, making sheriffs\u2019 deeds, on mortgage sales, an exception ; and the acknowledgment in question is in <em>the ordinary form. </em>But it is said that the law of 1795 was the law of the contract, and that the intention of the legislature was evidently that the whole ^proceedings should be controlled by it. The law of a contract, it is true, can not be so changed as to impair the force of its obligation, but the remedy may be molded into any shape to suit legislative discretion ; but there is nothing in the act from which the design claimed is by any means evident, or opposed to the construction to which I have alluded. On sales of mortgaged premises, and lands upon ordinary judgments, there are many reasons why distinctions should not be made in the form of the acknowledgment of the conveyance. Uniformity in the rule of action in similar cases, prescribed for ministerial officers, conduces to accuracy and regularity, and diminishes the chances of confusion, lessens the probability of error, gives stability to judicial proceedings, and security to rights and interests acquired under them. By the act of 1805, the sheriff was authorized to acknowledge deeds <em>before a justice of the peace. </em>This deed is so acknowledged, and we hold it to be sufficient, without an acknowledgment in open court, and find no serious difficulty in supporting this judicial sale throughout. This, alone, is decisive of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">It is supposed, however, that the judgment on the mortgage of 1798, will not sustain the proceedings had under it, for the reason that it had but a <em>single witness. </em>If this were a <em>defective </em>execution of it, advantage should have been taken on the return of the <em>sci. fa.; </em>but, though <em>personal </em>service was made upon the writ, on the administratrix, judgment was permitted to be obtained. But this was not all. This judgment was afterward revived, and no objection taken to the original j udgment on this ground ; and if the objection could, at anytime, be made available, that time was per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>mitted to pass by, and the door is now closed against it. But admitting the mortgage was defective, it can not for a moment be claimed the judgment founded upon it was <em>void. </em>It was merely erroneous, and, until directly attacked and reversed, is equally available to sustain a sale made under it, as if it were not liable to such objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">*There is another point in the defense equally fatal to any right of recovery by the plaintiff. The mortgage of 1796 covered the entire premises described, except lot 409, which is not in controversy. This mortgage was <em>well executed, </em>though the mortgage of 1798 had but <em>one witness. </em>Jesse Hunt took possession, under his sale, upon both mortgages. He got peaceably into the possession, which possession the defendants claiming under him have since enjoyed by virtue of his title. John Mercer being in life when the mortgage of 1796 became absolute, the legal title, as between the parties, passed to Jesse and Abijah Hunt, and it remains there until the mortgage is satisfied. If, therefore, the proceedings under the sale ai\u2019e invalid to pass title, there is'no satisfaction of the mortgage, and the defendants hold this legal title of their ancestor, Jesse Hunt; and, in this view of the case, there is nothing in the plaintiff but an equity of redemption, and her only remedy is by bill in chancery, to redeem.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">To avoid this aspect of the case, a compromise is relied upon between Hunt and the administratrix, by which portions of the land, not now in controversy, were relinquished to her, and this in dispute, with others, retained, and that a release was then executed by Hunt from all mortgage demands. It is urged that the administratrix, mother of the plaintiff\u2019s lessor, could not bind <em>her </em>by any such agreement, and that the plaintiff\u2019s lessor may discard the whole consideration to Hunt, for the execution of the release, and hold on to the release, as a satisfaction and merger of the mortgage. This would be playing fast and loose with a vengeance, and a proposition so monstrously unjust can not for a moment be entertained. The compromise was an <em>entire </em>transaction, and if good in part, it is for the whole. But had not the administratrix the perfect right to enter into that compromise? The plaintiff\u2019s lessor never had any legal title in the premises, without the compromise, or with it, so far as this controversy is embraced. Her father was <em>in esse </em>when the mortgage became absolute; the legal title passed, therefore, to the Hunts, and not to her by descent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>cast. An ^equity of redemption was not then considered as a <em>chattel real, </em>descendible to the heir, but as <em>personal, </em>to be controlled by the administratrix, and for this reason the law in force at the commencement of these suits, authorized, after condition broken, a <em>sci. fa. to </em>be issued and served on the administrator. <em>Where, then, is even the equitable title of the plaintiff\u2019s lessor ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">Many other points have been made in the case by the learned counsel on both sides. They have been examined, though not alluded to in this opinion. In this, like most cases which swell to an enormous bulk, when examined it is found to turn upon either of two or three points; and the numerous ones besides, which are put forth, are merely skirmishes to ward off the attack from the main body.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Allusion, in the argument, has been made to the character and conduct of Jesse Hunt; but, after the most careful examination, we find nothing in the case inconsistent with the strictest integrity, honesty, and even liberality, in his dealings with the ancestors of the plaintiff\u2019s lessor, in this whole transaction. We think no substantial error intervened, on the trial, to warrant this court in interfering with the verdict; and, indeed, upon the whole case which has been considered, that the plaintiff is not entitled to re cover.

I can not concur in tne opinion just pronounced.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">The material facts appear to me to be briefly as follows: John Mercer, on June 10,1796, mortgaged to Jesse A. Hunt, a fractional lot, 201, in Cincinnati, out-lot 29, a fractional part of an out-lot adjoining, and also out-lot 28, to secure the payment of $720, with interest, on or before the 10th of September then next.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">On February 10, 1798, John Mercer executed another deed, to the same parties, purporting to be a mortgage of fractional in-lot 409, out-lot 29, the fractional lot adjoining the same; also, out-lot 28; also, a military warrant, to secure the ^\u2019payment of $320, with interest, on or before the 13th February then next. The instrument was not acknowledged, and was attested by one witness only.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-9\">John Mercer died in 1806, leaving an only daughter (the lessee of the plaintiff), his heir at law. She married John Heighway in 1812, and he died in 1828.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>In the year 1808, the mortgagees caused two writs of <em>scire </em>facias, on the mortgages, to bo issued against Susan Mercer, the widow and administratrix of John Mercer-. The writ on the so-called mortgage of 1798 is without a seal.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">Two judgments were rendered by default, not adjudging the mortgaged lands to be levied upon and sold, but adjudging the defendant to pay the respective sums of $1,232.58, and' $473. Writs of execution were issued, commanding the sheriff to levy upon all the lands and goods which belonged to John Mercer.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">The sheriff accordingly levied under the judgment for $1,232.58, part of the property included in the first mortgage, namely, in-lot 201 and out-lot 28, and sold the same for $400. Under the other judgment, for $473, the sheriff returned that he had levied on in-lot 409, on No 29, on a fractional out-lot, and on out-lot No. 8, and had sold the same for $200. The returns are merely, \u201c made $400,\u201d \u201cmade $200.\u201d No. 8 was not mortgaged.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">A conveyance was made by the sheriff to Jesse Hunt, dated November 5, 1811, which was set up as a conveyance under the judgments, executions, and sales above mentioned. It recites a judgment rendered by the court of common picas of Hamilton county, in December term, 1810 \u2014 not the two judgments rendered in April term, 1808. It was not acknowledged in open court, and the attestation was not <em>thus </em>\u2014 \u201c sealed and delivered in presence of.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">Some time after this deed had been executed, a dispute arose between Jesse Hunt and Susan Mercer, the latter insisting the purchase had been made for her benefit by Jesse Hunt, as her trustee. Mrs. Mercer retained possession with her daughter *until the year 1815, when the dispute was compromised by Jesse Hunt\u2019s taking part of the property, and the'widow Mercer the remainder. The lessor of the plaintiff joined with her husband and mother in a conveyance to Jesse Hunt of the property now sought to be recovered; but the lessor of the plaintiff was not separately examined as a married woman, and she denies that the compromise was binding upon her, and insists that the proceedings against her mother are of no effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">In 1818, a bill was filed by Mrs. Mercer, and Mr. Heighway and his wife, to be relieved from the deed of 1815, on the ground that it had not been drawn up according to the compromise, and that Jesse Hunt had violated the compromise by setting up claims to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>the mortgage money which had been released on the compromise. Relief from the sheriff\u2019s deed was also prayed, on the ground of fraud ; but as the bill was dismissed, at defendant\u2019s costs, without any reason being assigned for such dismissal, it is apparent that the attack upon the deed of 1815 failed, and consequently the other matters charged in the bill could not have been litigated. The deed of 1815 was binding on the complainants in that suit. In 1823, the judgments were received like ordinary judgments, for the purpose of'obtaining common executions for the collection of the balance complained to be due. The administratrix put in pleas in those proceedings. The administratrix having claims upon the estate, applied to the probate court for an order to sell land; namely, out-lot 36, to pay debts. Jesse Hunt filed a bill in chancery, in 1824, to enjoin this sale, and claiming abalance to be due to him upon the mortgages. To-this bill Susan Mercer answered, under oath,- that some time after her husband\u2019s death, Jesse Hunt advised her to have the mortgaged property sold under execution, and promised to attend the sale as her agent, and bid off the property for her; that after the sale, she made payment on the mortgages and paid the taxes. The particulars of the compromise are also set forth. In 1830, the bill was dismissed with costs, the balance claimed by Jesse Hunt having been settled by the conveyance of a piece of property to N. G. Pendloton. *Upon the settlement, in 1827, Jesse Hunt executed a deed of release of the estate of John Mercer \u201c from any further liability for or on account of any existing claims, etc.\u201d .</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">In 1820, Jesse Hunt conveyed the property in question to his son, George N. Hunt, under whom the defendants claim as devisees. The property has been improved, and the lessor of the plaintiff set uj} no claim to it after the death of her husband, but has spoken of it as belonging to the defendants, and has so described it in transactions with third persons; and she assumed the absolute ownership of that part of the mortgaged property which Jesse Hunt conveyed to Susan Mercer in 1815.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Two principal propositions are made by counsel on behalf of the defendants: 1. That the <em>scire facias </em>proceedings against Susan Mercer are sufficient to divest the title of her daughter; and 2. That the mortgages constitute a sufficient defense to this action. Various other defenses are set up, which I will dispose of before considering the great questions referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>Tho statute of limitations is relied upon ; and it is also said the lessor of the plaintiff is estopped from claiming the property by her acquiescence in what was done during her coverture, and by her not disturbing the possession of the defendants for many years.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s right of action accrued on the death of her husband. Up to that time, the possession of the defendants\u2019 ancestor was lawfully held under the deed of 1815, which passed an estate for the joint lives of John Heigh way and his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">As to the alleged estoppel <em>in pais, </em>it is not pretended that tho plaintiff has concealed any facts from the knowledge of the defendants. They can not acquire any title by reason of her ignorance of her rights, or by her failure to prosecute her action at an earlier period. What was done by her mother and husband did not bind her.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">It is also contended by defendants, that plaintiff is estopped by a decree in chancery rendered during her coverture, whereby the bill filed by her mother and husband, charging fraud in *the procurement of the compromise deed of 1815, was dismissed. Other matters are charged in the bill; but as tho complainants were bound by the deed of 1815, not having succeeded in their attack upon it, such other matters could not be gone into. This decree is no estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">It is also contended;; that circumstances may amount to a redelivery of a deed, and it is assumed that a void deed, executed by a married woman, will pass the legal title if she, after the coverture has ceased, redelivers the deed. That may be so in England; where the mere delivery of a deed conveying land is sufficient to pass the title, although there be no signature, attesting witnesses, or acknowledgment. But it is not so in this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">I am of opinion, that on the decease of John Mercer, his estate descended to the plaintiff, under the statute of descents of 1805. Chase\u2019s Stat. 515. It did not become vested in the administratrix either at common law or by any statute of this state. An administrator does not take any estate whatever, either of a legal or equitable nature. Such an estate is altogether dissimilar from a chattel interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-10\">Tho administratrix could not convey this estate, and she did not profess to do so as administratrix, when she executed the deed of 1815.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-11\">The proceedings had against the administratrix do not, in my <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>opinion, divest the title of the daughter. The judgments and executions are founded upon the erroneous supposition that all the lands and other property of the decedent could be levied upon and sold under and by virtue of judgments against the administratrix. Under such an erroneous opinion, a general judgment against the administratrix, and a general execution, would be preferred to a judgment upon proceedings against the heir, subjecting only the mortgaged lands to levy and sale. Hence, in the present case, common judgments were- obtained against the administratrix, followed by ordinary executions against all the property, real and personal, and a sheriff\u2019s deed under the law regulating common judgments and executions. *This court has decided such proceedings to bo void, so fiaras the lands of the decedent are concerned? Lessee of Grey <em>v. </em>Askew, 3 Ohio, 184. In consequence of that decision, the proceedings are, by a mere after-thought, claimed to be under the law of 1795. The executions were respectively levied upon parts of the mortgaged lands, and sold, in each case, for part of the debt, as upon common judgments and executions for debt, without any regard to the mortgages. And the judgments were revived as common judgments and executions for debt, without any regard to the mortgages, for the purpose of recovering the balance of the debt, unsatisfied by the sales. Jesse and A. Hunt preferred ordinary judgments in debt with general executions, and it will not do now to produce these proceedings as special judgments and executions under the law of 1795.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">The law of 1795, adopted by the governor and judges (Chase\u2019s Stat. 138), authorizes a writ of <em>scire facias </em>to be issued against \u201c the mortgagors and mortgagees, his, her or their heirs, executors and administrators.\u201d Judgment was to be rendered condemning the mortgaged property to be sold, and nothing more; the judgment was not available for the recovery of the unsatisfied balance. The sheriff was to convey the property to the purchaser by deed, \u201c acknowledged in open court.\u201d The design of the last provision was to secure the previous examination of the proceedings and the confirmation or disallowance of the sale. Roads <em>v. </em>Symmes, 1 Ohio, 315.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">The law of 1795 authorized the proceedings on <em>scire facias </em>to bo had upon mortgages executed before as well as after the adoption of the law. An act passed by the territorial legislature of 1802 (Chase\u2019s Stat. 346), authorized the writ of <em>scire facias </em>on mort<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>gages, and the sheriff was to make a deed in the ordinary manner. If the mortgaged premises were not sufficient to satisfy the debt, the remainder was to be a debt of record, upon which the plaintiff might issue a <em>scire facias </em>and proceed to judgment and execution as in other cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">*This act was repealed by the act of 1805 (Chase\u2019s Stat. 496), which confines <em>scire facias </em>proceedings on mortgages to those executed after its passage.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">Another act, passed in 1805 (Chase\u2019s Stat. 517), repealed the law of 1795; and when the estate descended to the lessor of plaintiff, in 1806, no summary proceedings by <em>scire facias </em>could be resorted to for the recovery of the mortgage money. But in January, 1807, an act was passed (Chase\u2019s Stat. 559), enacting that all money secured by mortgage executed prior to the act of 1805, \u201c be and the same is hereby made recoverable in the same manner that money secured by mortgage was made recoverable by the law in force at the timo such mortgage was executed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">It is argued by the counsel for the defendants, that under these laws it was unnecessary for the owner of the mortgaged property to have his day in court, and that the true meaning of the act of 1807 is, that the judgment might be obtained under the law of 1795, and the subsequent proceedings had under the general execution law, which authorizes the sale of all the property <em>of the </em>defendant, etc., on action, real or personal, and a conveyance 'by the sheriff, without a previous examination of his proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">On the contrary, it appears to me that no other execution could be issued upon a judgment under the law of 1795, than an execution upon the mortgaged property; and that the only authority conferred upon the sheriff was, by virtue of that law, revived for the purpose by the act of 1807. It is absurd to suppose that a special judgment, had under the act of 1795, condemning the mortgaged land, would authorize a general execution against all the property of the decedent. The general execution law was inapplicable for another reason; it did not authorize a levy upon the lands of the decedent, but only upon the lands \u201c of the defendant;\u201d and the only defendant was the administratrix. This point is settled by the decision of this court in Lessee of Grey <em>v. </em>Askew, 3 Ohio, 484.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">*The legislature intended to require the mortgaged lands to be sold and conveyed, according to the law in force when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>mortgage was executed. It was not intended to apply subsequent execution laws, which forbid a sale except at two-thirds of the appraised value. The legislature intended to avoid that retroactive legislation, which has recently been condemned by the Supreme Court in Bronson <em>v. </em>McKenzie, 1 How. 311. The policy of our statute law, on this subject, is explained in Lessee of Allen <em>v. </em>Parish, 3 Ohio, 189. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">As the judgment, levy, and sale, authorized by the act of 1807, must have been in accordance with the law in force when the mortgage was executed, it follows that the sale must have been perfected as required by that law, and the proceedings under it must have been examined and confirmed by the court, as directed by its positive provisions. In other words, the deed must have been acknowledged in court. I am therefore of opinion, that the judgments, executions, and sales, and the sheriff\u2019s deed, were inoperative in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">Other objections are urged by plaintiff\u2019s counsel to sheriff\u2019s deed, on which it is unnecessary to give an opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">1 hold the first objection taken to the judicial proceedings to be fatal. The owner of the property had no day in court. She would have been entitled to that right in proceedings had under the law of 1795, and no other proceedings could be of any avail. It is said that this court has decided otherwise in Biggerstaff <em>v. </em>Loveland, 8 Ohio, 44. I do not so understand that case. It was under the act of 1810 (Chase\u2019s Stat. 645), and it was founded expressly upon the peculiar provisions of that act, provisions which are not to be found in the law of 1795. The court say, page 45, \u201c as a general rule, none but parties and privies are bound by a judgment; and upon ordinary judgments against personal representatives, the lands of decedents can not be seized in execution. 'Still, there can be no doubt that it would be competent for the legislature to change the rule of law.\u201d The rule of law could not be changed by retrospective legislation. Now, the act of 1810 is prospective only; it- is confined to mortgages executed after *its passage. But the law of 1795 applied to mortgages made before as well as after its adoption ; and I feel constrained to put sueh a construction upon the law as will prevent it from assuming to authorize the taking away of an estate which had become vested before its adoption, by so-called judicial proceedings against a third person, not the owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">Indeed, the meaning of the law is plain and obvious. It re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>quired the court to go against either the heir, or the personal representative of the mortgagor, according to the nature of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">Thus, if the land was freehold, the fundamental rule of law and justice was to be complied with \u2014 the owner (the heir) was to have his day in court: and by virtue of the same rule, if a chattel interest was the subject of the mortgage, the executor or administrator was to bo served with process.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">The court, in Biggerstaff <em>v. </em>Loveland, say : \u201c Generally, when a suit is authorized by statute, to be commenced against the heirs, executors, or administrators of a deceased person, wo should conclude that the suit must be brought against one or the other, according to the nature of the particular cause of action. If it was one in which the heirs were bound, or had a peculiar interest, the suit should be brought against them; otherwise against the executor or administrator. If, however, we were to adopt this principle in construction of this statute, no difficulty would be removed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">The reason given is, that the act makes the judgment a debt of record, if the mortgaged premises are insufficient; so that the personal representatives, as well as the heirs, are affected by the proceedings which, by the express terms of the statute, may be commenced against either. It may well be doubted whether this reasoning is consistent with the rule, that a right to a day in court should be jealously preserved. But it is clear that the language of the court affords no countenance to the proposition, that, in the absence of the provision referred to, the heir is deprived of his day in court. On the contrary, the court fully recognize his right, where the difficulty, supposed to be raised by the act of 1810, does not exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">*It is said, however, that it was not the practice to give the owner his day in court. This assertion is purely gratuitous, and, if true, it would not affect the question; for, as decided by this court, in Lessee of Grey <em>v. </em>Askew, 3 Ohio, 479, \u201c where .a practice was insisted on, it is not enough that the question passed unnoticed, it must have been decided; a construction must be given by the courts themselves.\u201d The case just cited shows that it certainly was the practice, to some extent, to seize the lands of heirs without giving them their day in court. But this court refused to sanction the practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-10\">As to the alleged practice, under the act of 1807, for the sheriff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>to execute a deed without the confirmation of the court, there is nothing to support the assertion. The number of suits commenced after the passage of the act of 1807, on mortgages made before the year 1802, can not have been numerous; and, out of the whole of them, it is very unlikely that more than half a dozen were conducted without regard to the law in force when the law was executed. It is true that in some, of the cases, as in this, the plaintiffs, according to an error common at one time, may have preferred obtaining a general judgment and proceeding, under a general execution, against all the property of the decedent, and then, of course, the deed would be executed under the general execution law.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">There are some additional- objections to the title derived by the defendants to a portion of the property \u2014 the fractional sections which were levied upon and sold, -under the judgment rendered against the administratrix, for $473.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">The so-called writ of <em>sci.fa. </em>was founded upon the deed of 1798, which did not pass any title. But it is said, not only might the heir be deprived of his freehold, by proceedings upon a mortgage, without being allowed an opportunity of defending himself; but, also, that the absolute owner might bo divested without being allowed his day in court, even when there was no mortgage in existence. I oan not for a moment assent to this proposition. The suggestion, that the administratrix might have denied the alleged mortgage, has no force. If <em>the owner </em>*had been before the court, and thus had an opportunity of traversing the allegation, she would have been bound by an adjudication of the court that there was a mortgage, if such adjudication had been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">There was no valid mortgage, and there was no valid writ of <em>sci. fa., </em>the writ produced being without a seal, and there is no such thing as presumption of a seal to process. Both of these are matters which the plaintiff never had an opportunity of controverting before the trial of the action. The defendants\u2019 ancestor obtained possession under the compromise deed of 1815, the possession being retained by Mrs. Mercer and her daughter up vo that time, notwithstanding the sheriff\u2019s deed of 1811.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">The mortgage title does not, in my opinion, form any defense to this action. The mortgage money has been fully satisfied; and, if it had not been, as the defendants are not proved to be entitled to it, they would have no defense. They are not liable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>to be charged as mortgagees in possession for the rents and profits, because they hold adversely. It follows that they can not set up the defense, that they are mortgagees in possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">The heir of the mortgagee takes no title in the mortgaged premises. This court has decided that a simple transfer of the mortgage debt leaves no interest in the mortgagee, because the mortgage lien is a mere incident of the debt. Upon the death of the mortgagee, his executor or administrator becomes legally entitled to the debt, and consequently to the mortgage lien. \u201c It would be absurd in principle, and oppressive in practice, for the debt and mortgage to be separated and placed in different and independent hands.\u201d 5 Cow. 207.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">The deed of release of all claims on the estate of John Mercer, executed in 1827, is conclusive. A deed of release is always binding at law, unless obtained by fraud or duress. If executed under a mistaken supposition that some claims have been satisfied which have not been, the remedy is in equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">But all the evidence in the present case shows that no debt remains unsatisfied. According to the case made on behalf of ^defendants, credit was given, on the compromise of 1815, for only a part of the mortgage money. This was on account of the conveyance made to Jesse Hunt of part of the property belonging to the plaintiff. She was deprived of the use and profits thereof, during the life of her husband, by that conveyance. There was, then, some consideration for the credit given on the mortgage, and this consideration can not be restored. Its <em>adequacy </em>certainly can not be inquired into in this action. Chit, on Con. 31; Fowler <em>v. </em>Shearer, 7 Mass. 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">The argument that the amount credited in 1815 is now due is untenable, even if we go behind the release, for the life estate held and enjoyed by Jesse Hunt can not bo treated as of no value. The balance of the mortgage money was settled by a conveyance of property in the year 1827, and thereupon the deed of release of all claims was executed and delivered.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">As to what has been said about Jesse Hunt\u2019s conduct in his dealings with the widow Mercer, I am unable to say whether he did agree, to purchase the property at the sheriff\u2019s sale as trustee, as sworn to by her, nor cun I say whether the terms of the compromise were violated by Jesse Hunt, and the mortgage money paid twice; with these matters we have nothing to do. I should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>not have alluded to them had they not been made to assume considerable prominence in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">In my opinion the decision in this case has violated a great constitutional principle, and has sanctioned the errors of post-judicial proceedings at the expense of fundamental right, and exhibits the sad spectacle of a person being deprived of her estate without ever having had a day in court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
