It appears by the bill of exceptions that on September 20, 1832, the lands in dispute, then wild and uncultivated, were sold and conveyed for valuable consideration by the Luptons to <em>Kline; </em>that between that time and April 15, 1843, a period exceeding ten years, they passed by five intermediate conveyances, to persons by whom they were *held in possession, improved, and cultivated; that with a knowledge of these facts, from a view to speculate by litigation with the tenants, Welch, for a small consideration, procured a deed to himself from the Luptons, who had never set up any claim to the premises after their deed to Kline, nor sought by any means to avoid their former conveyance. The deed', thus procured, forms Welch\u2019s whole claim of title; and the main question presented by the record is, whether, under the existing state of facts, his title is better than the holder of the land in possession, and claiming under the prior deed of the Luptons.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b135-9\">The title of the Luptons, at the date of the first deed, is unquestioned. Supposing them to have been under age at the date of its execution, still that deed passed their title, and vested the fee in the grantee and his assigns, where it would remain until that deed should be legally avoided. \u201c The deed of a minor is not void, but only voidable. It transmits the title to the grantee, and after vesting, it continues in the grantee until divested by some act of the maker of the deed.\u201d Lessee of Drake and wife <em>v. </em>Ramsey et al., 5 Ohio, 251.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b135-10\">Bool <em>v. </em>Mix, 17 Wend. 130, whero the effect of such conveyance is fully considered, and many authorities cited. No act is claimed to have been done by the Luptons in disaffirmance of the former deed, other than the mere execution of the subsequent deed to Welch. And unless the mere execution of the second deed could perform the twofold office \u2014 first, of re-investing the Luptons with title; and secondly, passing it from them to Welch, he has no title.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b135-11\">The principal cases relied on to sustain Welch\u2019s title are John<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>son <em>v. </em>Carpenter, 11 Johns. 539; Jackson <em>v. </em>Burchin, 14 Johns. 124; Tucker <em>v. </em>Moreland, 10 Pet. 58; Lessee of Drake and wife <em>v. </em>Ramsey et al., 5 Ohio, 251.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b136-5\">' Those eases were all cited and examined in the latter case of Bool <em>v. </em>Mix, 17 Wend. 133; and the rule established by them is thus stated by Chief Justice Bronson, delivering the opinion of the court: \u201cA deed of bargain and sale executed by an infant *may, under certain circumstances, be avoided by another deed of bargain and sale to a third person, after he becomes of age, that being an act of the same description and of equal notoriety with the original conveyance.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AlX\">Thus, it is seen, the rule is not universal in its application. It may operate \u201cunder certain circumstances.\" What these circumstances are, is to be learned from the cases. They are thus stated, in Bool <em>v. </em>Mix, by Chief Justice Bronson, reviewing each case: \u201cIt was said, in Jackson <em>v. </em>Carpenter, that the conveyance of the infant was not attended with all the solemnities of a feoffment and livery, and that it might be defeated by an act of the same description and of equal notoriety. In holding that an entry was not necessary to avoid the deed, stress was laid on the fact that the land was vacant and uncultivated, and an entry would have been useless. In Jackson <em>v. </em>Burchin, the land was also vacant at the time the second deed was executed; and the court, say, the law does not require idle and non-essential ceremonies; and it would bo idle to require an entry on the premises in 1795, when, not only this lot, but the whole country in which it was situated, was a wilderness. In Tucker <em>v. </em>Moreland, 10 Pet. 58, the infant had never been out of possession.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b136-7\">He then remarks: \u201c If, in these cases, the land had been hold adversely to the infant, the second deed would, I think, have been void, and could not have amounted to a revocation of the first conveyance. This was admitted in Jackson <em>v. </em>Burchin. See also 13 Mass. 375.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b136-8\">Thus, then, the Supreme Court of New York, with the light of the former case before them, state the rule by which a subsequent deed amounts to a revocation of an infant\u2019s former conveyance, as existing, not universally, but under certain circumstances, viz: first, where the land is vacant, and actual entry impracticable; or, an idle ceremony, as in Jackson <em>v. </em>Carpenter, 11 Johns. 539, and Jackson <em>v. </em>Burchin, 14 Johns. 124; or, secondly, whore the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>infant has never been out of possession, as in Tucker <em>v. </em>Moreland, 10 Pet. 58.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b137-5\">*Now, it will be observed, that at the execution of the deed to Welsh, the land was cultivated, improved, and was \u201c held adversely to the infant.\u201d It is stated, moreover, by William Lupton, \u201cRezin Welch knew, at the time Cyrus and I sold him the land in Ohio, that wo had before deeded and sold the same land to Mr. Kline. Rezin Welch mentioned to Cyrus and myself, at the time he bought the land of us, that he, Welch, was buying a lawsuit, and told us that there was five or six persons living on said land, and that he, Welch, expected to have a great deal of 1 lawing \u2019 to do before ho would get possession of said lands.\u201d (Wm. B. Lupton\u2019s deposition in bill of exceptions.) These facts bring the case directly within the opinion expressed by Bronson, J.: \u201cIf, in these cases, the laud had been held adversely to the infant, the second deed would have been void, and could not have amounted to a revocation.\u201d Bool <em>v. </em>Mix, 17 Wend. 133. The ground of the distinction, as explained by the whole case, seems just and reasonable. To constitute an estate in fee, there must be legal and actual seizin of the land. Where there is no actual adverse possession, as in the case of vacant and uncultivated lands, the actual seizin will be presumed to follow the legal seizin, and thus actual entry becomes useless ceremony. Whore there is actual adverse possession, this presumption can not be made for presumptions can never be made against the established fact.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b137-6\">The same doctrine is established by other cases. In Worcester <em>v. </em>Eaton, 13 Mass. 375, it is said by Chief Justice Parker, that the deed of an infant is not void, but voidable, so that the title will remain good to the grantee until the gi'antor shall lawfully disaffirm it. \u201c He can only do it by entry; but having entered, his subsequent deed, accompanied by proof of facts tending to avoid the first, will convey a title. And the reason why, unless the first deed be thus avoided, no subsequent conveyance by the grantor can be good, is, \u2018because he would not be seized of the land.\u2019 \u201d Worcester <em>v. </em>Eaton, 13 Mass. 375. So in Roberts <em>v. </em>Wiggins, 1 N. H. *73, it was said that, \u201c in general, an infant, to avoid his deed, must re-enter on the land and oust the <em>occupant; </em>or, if already in possession, must perform some act expressly evincing his intention to defeat the conveyance.\u201d In the latter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>instance, the mere execution of another deed would amount to a disaffirmance, because the infant has actual seizin.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b138-5\">It is claimed, however, that by the case of Drake and wife\u2019s Lessee <em>v. </em>Eamsey et al., 5 Ohio, 251, the validity of Welch\u2019s deed is established. That was ejectment by the infant and her husband. It was not a suit by a third person, claiming disaffirmance by the mere execution of a deed, while the lands were in adverse possession ; the questions were, within what time the infant\u2019s deed might be disaffirmed, and whether it might be done by action. An ejectment was held to be sufficient disaffirmance, and the judge delivering the opinion remarked: \u201cWe believe that an entry, suit, or actioD, a subsequent conveyance, an effort to restore parties to their original condition, or any act unequivocally manifesting the intention, would render the avoidance effectual; and that the institution of their suit is an act fully possessing that character.\u201d It is apparent, therefore, that the case of Drake and wife\u2019s Lessee <em>v. </em>Eamsey can not be considered an authority directly supporting Welch\u2019s deed; because the facts are not the same, the mode of disaffirmance being totally different. The most that can be claimed is an intimation of opinion, an <em>obiter dictum. </em>But even that is not warranted; for the judge does not say that the modes of disaffirmance enumerated by him are of universal validity. Nor does he undertake to distinguish, except in the case then before the court, under what circumstances any specific mode may operate as a disaffirmance. He by no means intimates even an opinion that a subsequent conveyance would operate to dis-affirm the prior contract, and also vest the estate in a third person, where there is adverse possession under the former deed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b138-6\">The question is, therefore, open to this tribunal. Since Drake and wife <em>v. </em>Eamsey was decided, the questions here *involved have been examined and elaborately discussed in Bool <em>v. </em>Mix, 17 Wend.; and the opinion sanctioned by the Supreme Court of New York, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire, that where the land is held adversely, at the execution of a subsequent deed, the mero execution of such deed is not sufficient to disaffirm a former deed by an infant, under which the tenant is in possession, and vest the estate in a third person; but such subsequent deed is itself void. This opinion is founded, moreover, in the general principles and theory of the law, and not contradicted by any authority.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b139-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>II. The deed to Welch is void on the ground of maintenance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b139-5\">In some states, deeds made by parties out of possession of lands held adversely, are prohibited by statutes, declaring the instruments void, and imposing penalties upon the parties. In Ohio, no such statute exists, but the rule of the common law prevails. 13 Ohio, 175. In Indiana, there is no such statute ; and there it has been repeatedly held, that a deed for real property, if there be an adverse possession at the time, is void. Fite <em>v. </em>Doe, 1 Blackf. 127; Martin <em>v. </em>Pace, 6 Blackf. 99; Bowman <em>v. </em>Wathen, 2 McLean, 380. In Fite <em>v. </em>Doe, the court remarks: \u201c We have no particular statute prohibiting the buying and selling of pretended titles, and therefore reference must be had for the doctrine to the common law of England, which is adopted into our code. The law undoubtedly is, that if a person, out of possession, convey to a stranger land held at the time adversely by another, the conveyance\u2019is void as an act of maintenance.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b139-6\">In Martin <em>v. </em>Pace, 6 Blackf. 99, it was held, that if a person, out of possession, convey land held adversely by a third person, the conveyance is void on the ground of maintenance, and the title remains in the grantor. It is remarked by the court: \u201c The persons who claimed the land could have nothing more than a <em>right of </em>entry, the land being held at the time adversely by another ; and it is a principle of the common law that such a right is not assignable.\u201d Co. Lit. 266 ; *Jackson <em>v. </em>Dumont, 9 Johns. 55. In New York, it is held, that if a person, out of possession, convey land held adversely by another, the conveyance is void for maintenance, and the title, of the land remains in the grantor, Williams <em>v. </em>Jackson, 5 Johns. 489. We entirely approve the New York decision, that the conveyance which is void on the ground of maintenance, creates no forfeiture of the grantor's title; but if it did, that circumstance would not weaken the defense under consideration. The authorities all concur that the grantee, in a case like the present, takes nothing by the deed. Martin <em>v. </em>Pace, 6 Blackf. 99.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b139-7\">So in Bowman\u2019s Devisee <em>v. </em>Wathen et al. 2 McLean, 380, the same doctrine is held. \u201c If the possession was held adverse, the deed conveyed no title. In Indiana, there is no statute which prohibits the sale of pretended titles. But the statute of 27 Heni'y VIII was in affirmance of the common law. And' in Co. Lit. 369, it is laid down, if a person out of possession convey land <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>\u25a0which is held adversely, the conveyance is void. 9 Johns. 55; Partridge <em>v. </em>Strange, Plowd. 77; Fite v. Doe, 1 Blackf. 127.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b140-5\">The principle has, moreover, been recognized in a late case by this court. In \"Weakly v. Hall, \"13 Ohio, 175, Judge Wood remarks: \u201cThe English and American courts have considered agreements, founded on such considerations as champerty and maintenance, as against sound policy, and void. Key v. Vattier, 1 Ohio. The common law discourages officious intermeddling in the litigation of others, as it clearly ought. In some of the states, they have statutes passed to prevent it, in others not; <em>hut where no statutory regulation exists, </em>the common law is universally holden to prevail, as imported by our ancestors, and applicable to our local circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b140-6\">In Maryland, where this deed appears to have been executed, it would have been held void. 4 Kent\u2019s Com. 448. For in that state the doctrine prevails, that a conveyance by a party out of possession, and with an adverse possession against him, is void. 4 Kent\u2019s Com. 448.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A7sG\">*It is said, however, that the Supreme Court of this state has decided, in Hall\u2019s Lessee <em>v. </em>Ashley and Craven, 9 Ohio, 96, that a deed for land, notwithstanding adverse possession at the time of its execution, is valid. But that case will, on examination, be found clearly distinguishable from the present; and even if it were not, a consideration of the reasoning and authorities might lead to a different conclusion.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b140-8\">In that case, it appears that adverse possession was proved on the trial. But, from the abstract of the defendant\u2019s argument, it does not appear that the point was made on the motion for a now trial. Not one authority is cited to that point. But the judge, in delivering the opinion of the court, alludes to the question as having been made, and expresses his views upon it. In that opinion, the judge seems to have thought, that the doctrine of deeds being void in cases of adverse possession, was derived solely from the English statutes against champerty, and that those statutes not being in force in this state, the law did not prevail. He moreover attributes the passage of these statutes to \u201cpeculiar exigencies ; such as signal revolutions, when the property of the kingdom, to a great extent, changed hands, and to the introduction of uses.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b140-9\">Now, it has been decided, as we have seen by numerous respee<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>table tribunals \u2014 the Supreme Courts of New York, Massachusetts, Indiana, and the circuit court of'the United States, that this doctrine has no dependence whatever upon any English statutes; that it has ever been a principle of the common law, depending upon no \u201cpeculiar exigency,\u201d occasioned by no \u201csignal revolution,\u201d and having not the remotest connection with \u201cthe introduction of uses.\u201d History, moreover, informs us, that since the Norman conquest, no revolution, however \u201csignal,\u201d has affected any great change in the possession of lands in England. And&gt; says Chancellor Kent, \u201c this principle is not peculiar to the English law; it was a fundamental doctrine of the law on the continent of Europe \u2014 in Holland and in Germany. It seems to be the general sense and usage of mankind, that the transfer of real property should not be valid, *unless the grantor hath capacity, as'well as the intention, to deliver possession.\u201d Sir Wm. Blackstone says, that it prevails in the code of \u201c all well-governed nations.\u201d 4 Kent\u2019s Com. 448. And, again, he says : \u201c The doctrine that a conveyance by a party out of possession, and with an adverse possession against him, is not valid, prevails equally in Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont; Maryland, New York, Virginia, North Carolina, Kentucky, Indiana, and probably in most of the other states.\u201d 4 Kent\u2019s Com. 449.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b141-5\">In three states only does the different doctrine prevail, viz : New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee. 4 Kent\u2019s Com. 449-</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b141-6\">Whatever may have been its origin, this doctrine does not depend for its existence upon English statutes, or any other statutes) but obtains, as a settled principle of the common law, whether the states have, or have not, statutes against champerty. Nor does it depend upon what Judge Grimke terms \u201cpeculiar exigencies, which are almost entirely foreign to our habits and condition,\u201d but is sanctioned in' nearly every tribunal in this country, having the same condition and habits as ourselves; and it. is because such sales are, in the language of the later opinion of Weakly <em>v. </em>Hall, 13 Ohio, 175\", \u201c against sound policy, and void.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b141-7\">It is true, as is said by Chancellor Kent, that the principle was founded, that is, had its commencement \u201c in a state of society which does not exist in this country.\u201d And so did almost every principle and rule of law relative to real estate, which is still cherished. But although the state of society is changed, the prin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>ciple and its application, resting upon reason and policy, has undergone no change; for it has been found adapted to eveiy age and state of society \u2014 foreign to no \u201chabits or condition.\u201d That portion only of the ancient policy, declaring a forfeiture of the grantor\u2019s estate, and imposing a penalty upon the purchaser, has, in the absence of express statutes, been abandoned. 4 Kent\u2019s Com. 446,447 ; 6 Blackf. Moreover, the doctrine expressed by the judge, in 9 Ohio, *is overruled partially; and so far as the general principle he asserts, by the late case of Weakly <em>v. </em>Hall, 13 Ohio, 175, wherein it is asserted, \u201cthat the common-law principle in relation to champerty and maintenance does exist, notwithstanding the absence of express statute,\u201d and is universally holden to prevail, as imported by our ancestors, and applicable to our circumstances. The opinion therefore, in Hall\u2019s Lessee <em>v. </em>Craven, 9 Ohio, is to be limited to the precise case then before the court; and, beyond that, is neither correct history nor solid law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b142-4\">But should this court hold, upon the authority of Hall\u2019s Lessee <em>v. </em>Craven, that a deed might, under some circumstances, be valid, notwithstanding adverse possession, still the present is distinguishable from that case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b142-5\">In Hall\u2019s Lessee <em>v. </em>Craven, noither grantor nor grantee had any acknowledge, at the execution of the deed, of an adverse possession. The tenants claiming under the heir at law had a merely naked possession. There was nothing to impeach the fairness or motives of the parties to the deed; no \u201cbuying a lawsuit,\u201d as Welch termed it, nor any reason whatever to question the title, or suspect that it would be contested. What constitutes the tui\u2019pitude of such acts, in the eyes of the law \u2014 vexatious'litigation, harassing and overreaching innocent persons in possession \u2014 seems to have been wholly absent from the case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b142-6\">Whereas, at the time this conveyance was made, \u201c when he bought the land of us,\u201d says William H. Lupton, \u201cRezin Welch knew that we bad before deeded and sold the same land to Mr. Kline. Rezin Welch mentioned to Cyrus and myself that he was buying a lawsuit, and told us there was five or six persons living on said land, and that he expected to have a great deal of 1 lawing\u2019 before he would get possession of said land.\u201d (Wm. H. Lupton\u2019s deposition.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b142-7\">Whilst, therefore, in the case of Hall\u2019s Lessee <em>v. </em>Ashley, there seems to be nothing calling specially for the interference of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>law \u2014 nothing demanding its stern rebuke \u2014 it is ^difficult to conceive a case which would (if Welch\u2019s deed be upheld), more than the present, encourage, proihote, and extend litigation; \u201cthat indicates a more officious intermeddling in the litigation of others,\u201d and, therefore,_ in the language of the opinion, in 13 Ohio, 175, \u201c to be discouraged by the common law, as against sound policy and void,'and which the law of Ohio will not tolerate.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b143-4\">This difference in the circumstances of the cases, as regards the state of title at the date of the deed; the knowledge, conduct, and design of the parties, in respect to the tenants in adverse possession, warranted a difference in the principle of law to govern them. In one case, it was a purchase of a valid right, without knowledge of adverse claim or possession. But in the present case, it was \u201cbuying a lawsuit\u201d with open eyes, full knowledge, and declared intention to speculate, by \u201clawing\u201d the tenants out of their possession.</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AeW\">Now, in Massachusetts, Somes <em>v. </em>Skinner, 3 Pick. 61, a distinction has been made, where -the purchase has been knowingly made, with intent to disturb possession, from the ease where the adverse.possession was unknown at the time. It is there said, where the grantor is disseized, and this fact is known to the-grantee at the time, by the policy of the law, and in virtue of ancient statutes, perhaps the deed would be wholly inoperative, both parties being transgressors in relation to such conveyance; but where the disseizin of the grantor is not known, which may be where the land granted is remote from the domicile of the parties, as no offense will have been committed, there seems to be no good reason why the contract between the parties should be defeated. Somes <em>v. </em>Skinner, 3 Pick. 61. And, in New York also, a distinction has been suggested between the sale of a pretended title, on speculation, and that of a valid right. 3 Johns. Cases, 105.</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b143-6\">Whatever, then, may be thought of the law expressed in Hall\u2019s Lessee <em>v. </em>Craven, and even if this court should reassert it as a general rule; still, the circumstances of this case withdraw it from the operation of that rule, and render Welch\u2019s *deed inoperative, and void at common law; void by the concurring views of courts in almost every state in the Union, without reference to any statutes \u2014 and void by the principles of good morals and sound policy, declared and acted on by this court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b144-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>III. The instrument under which Welch claims is either a mere release of an undefined interest, or an executory contract to convey ; and, in either case, it is inoperative to disaffirm the prior deed, or to pass title.</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b144-5\">The preceding remarks have been made upon the hypothesis that the instrument under which Welch claims was in due form, with apt and proper terms in the law to pass title ; but upon examining it, as sot forth in the appendix (B), it will not be found to have that effect.</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b144-6\">' In considering the deed, its different parts, the premises, recitals, habendum clause, and covenant of assurance, must be taken together, and subjected to these well-established rulos :</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b144-7\">1. That the construction be made upon the entire deed, and not merely on disjointed parts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b144-8\">2. That the general words in the premises of a deed or grant may be corrected, restrained, and explained by the context, or recitals of the deed. 5 Com. Dig. 264 ; Parols, A, 7.</p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b144-9\">How, it will be observed, that the premises alone do not contain any words of present grant. And they are inoperative, because, in that portion of the deed, there is no description of the subject matter to which they may,apply, and also because they are repugnant to the context. The premises would imply an intention to convey some entire tract of land <em>; </em>whereas, it subsequently appears that the grantors claim only an undivided interest, as \u201cpart of William B. Lupton\u2019s legal heirs and representatives,\u201d having a \u201cdistributory share;\u201d and that they had agreed to \u201csell, transfer, and set over their estate, right, title, and interest.\u201d The recitals therefore narrow, or, in the language of Comyn, <em>restrain </em>the general words of the premises, and import an executory agreement \u201cto sell, assign, transfer, and sot over their estate, right, title, and interest, claim, and ^estate, at law and in equity.\u201d The deed contains nothing further, except the habendum clause and the covenant of further assurance ; which covenant comports with, and strengthens the construction here given, as does also the habendum clause. This clause is for \u201c the said described interest\u201d in said lands and premises. The habendum clause may abridge or alter the generality of the premises. Hob. 171; 4 Com. Dig. 107, Fait. And the covenant for further assurance is of \u201cthe right, title, estate, and interest, at law and equity, which said parties hath, or can lawfully claim in and to said premises.\u201d The sealing and ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>knowledgmcnt of the instrument, though essential to constitute a deed, yet do not aid its construction, nor change the effect of its terms. And hence what is usually termed the granting clause of the deed, being itself insufficient to pass title, for want of description of the subject matter to which the terms therein used may apply ; and the remainder of the instrument containing no words of grant, bat merely a recital of an agreement to sell, assign, transfer, and set over an undefined interest, with a covenant to the same effect, it would seem to be a merely executory contract, and not a deed operating, upon its delivery, to vest title <em>eo instanii. </em>At all events, it can not be construed as anything more than a release or quitclaim of an undefined interest in the land, and could operate only upon such interest as the Luptons had at the date of its execution. Now, we have seen they had not then any interest in the land. They had a mere right of entry, or a personal right to avoid a prior deed, by which the estate had passed, and was that moment vested in the tenants holding under Kline\u2019s deed. Until this avoidance were made, the Luptons had no interest, and the right to avoid being personal, could not be purchased by, or released to Welch. But yet it is manifest from the whole instrument, that the intention was, on the one hand, for Welch to purchase, and, on the other, for the Luptons to sell, assign, transfer, and set over, this very right or interest, and nothing more.</p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b145-5\">*For it is curious to observe how carefully the instrument avoids the assertion of any positive or certain interest of Cyrus and William in the land, or any reference to their former deed. There is neither seiziD nor warranty mentioned. It would seem from the face of the deed and William Lupton\u2019s deposition, that never having before asserted any claim to the land since the deed to Kline, they were still resolved to do no act, except receive the money Welch offered for his speculation, and let him into their rights, and to pursue them at his own hazard. He informs them of the situation of the land; he \u201cbuys the lawsuit;\u201d he is \u201cto do the lawing \u201d necessary to get possession. In prepai\u2019ing the instrument, the Luptons seem expressly to avoid anything like a disaffirmance of their former deed, at the very time they tell Welch oi its existence, without expressing any dissatisfaction, and do nothing more than suffer Welch to step into their shoes. Now whatever right they may have had to disaffirm their prior deed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>that right was personal, and could not -be purchased or \u201cassigned, transferred; and set over.\u201d Their release of it is therefore void, because at the time they had no assignable interest. Welch doubtless supposed that an infant\u2019s deed was void; that, therefore, they were still seized of the land, and that any instrument operating as a release or quitclaim of their right and interest, would vest in him the title. If in this he has been mistaken, he has met a common fate of speculators in \u201clawsuits.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b146-5\">This view is strengthened by a comparison of the two deeds, from which it will appear that the deed to Welch could not have been intended as a disaffirmance of the prior deed to Kline, but as a mere assignment, or release of some fancied, undefined, and uncertain interest.</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b146-6\">Should the preceding views be correct in reference to the disaffirmance of the prior deed, or in respect to the validity of the subsequent deed as a conveyance of title, in either case the court of common pleas erred in charging upon the <em>second, third,, </em>and <em>fourth </em>points mentioned in the bill of exceptions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b146-7\">IV. It is also claimed that there is error in the charge *upon the remaining points herein specified, except the <em>first, </em>which is abandoned.</p>\n<p data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b146-8\">Upon the <em>fifth </em>point the court charged that lapse of time, less than twenty-one years, was not, <em>o\u00ed itself, </em>evidence of acquiescence, but might be evidence in connection with other facts and circumstances. Now, the law is thus declared in Drake and wife <em>v. </em>Ramsey, 5 Ohio, 152: \u201c In our opinion, lapse of time may frequently furnish evidence of acquiescence, and thus confirm the title; but, of itself, does not take away the right to avoid until the statute of limitation takes effect.\u201d The right to disaffirm is taken away by any affirmance or assent after coming of age. It may exist, provided there has been no affirmance, until the period limited by the statute. Lapse of time less than the period is no bar, but is evidence of acquiescence or assent. Whether it will be plenary proof of such assent must depend upon the circumstances of each case. In asserting that lapse of time was not of itself <em>evidence </em>of assent, the court of common pleas erred.</p>\n<p data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b146-9\">V. The court also erred on the sixth point, assuming to say, \u201cThat retention of the purchase money, <em>in this case, </em>was not, of itself, an act demonstrating a willingness to be bound by the contract.\u201d It was for the jury alone to say whether a retention of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>the purchase money was or was not, in this case, evidence of affirmance. The question of affirmance was one of fact. The retention of the consideration was evidence of that fact, to be weighed by the jury in this case, and decided by their own judgment, as much as in any other case. And in undertaking to decide for the jury that, <em>in this case, </em>it was not evidence of assent, the court assumed a province not belonging to. them, and therein erred.</p>\n<p data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b147-5\">YI. Upon the seventh and last point the same error as in the fifth was committed. Silence, after coming of ago, is evidence of acquiescence, whether for a day, a year, or series of years. Like lapse of time, it forms no absolute bar within less period than twenty-one years, as a general rule, although it *may, in some case, even have that effect within less period, operating by way of estoppel. But, under all circumstances, it is evidence itself of assent. How far it may operate to establish the fact of affirmance, is for the jury to determine. The court charged that, \u201cSilence for less than twenty-one years was not, unless connected with other facts and circumstances, evidence of assent.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b147-6\">The evidence, from lapse of time and silence, was, by this mode of charging, substantially excluded from the consideration of the jury, who were thereby misled, and a verdict secured to the plaintiff in ejectment. For these errors the Supreme Court is asked to reverse the judgment.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b147-7\">James Mason and A. L.

The deed to Welch is <em>not </em>void on the ground of <em>maintenance.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b147-10\">If the question, how far the English statutes against champerty and maintenance, or the common-law doctrine in relation to such acts, are applicable to our laws, customs, and institutions, was unsettled in this state, we should feel called upon to enter more fully into the discussion of this question.</p>\n<p data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b147-12\">In some of the states, statutes have been passed prohibiting such acts. In some other states, no prohibiting statutes have been passed, but the common-law doctrine has been expressly recognized and adopted by their tribunals. In other states, the common-law doctrine is not recognized, and no statutes upon the subject have been passed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b147-13\">In the State of New York, the statute of 32 Henry YIII was re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>enacted, almost in its very words. By this statute, the parties were made liable to forfeiture, and the conveyance was *rendered null and void. By the revised statutes of New York, the forfeiture is abolished, but the act is made a misdemeanor. See 4 Kent, 448, 449.</p>\n<p data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b148-5\">In Massachusetts, the penalty of the statute of Henry VIII has never been adopted, but the common-law doctrine is there assumed that such conveyance is void, and \u201c champerty is an offense\u201d in that state. 4 Kent, 448.</p>\n<p data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b148-6\">In Indiana, the court say, in 1 Blackford: \u201cWe have no particular statute prohibiting the buying and selling of pretended titles, and therefore reference must be had, for the doctrine, to the common law of England, which is adopted in our code.\u201d The statute of Henry VIII, on the subject, is said to have been enacted in affirmance of the common law, and to have made no alteration in it except that of adding a new penalty. That statute, therefore, and the construction put upon it a few years after its enactment, in the ease of Partridge <em>v. </em>Strange, Plowd. 77, furnish the necessary information.</p>\n<p data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b148-7\">The existence of the statutory provisions in New York, the adoption of the common-law doctrine as affirmed by the statute of Henry VIII, in Indiana, and the fact that \u201c champerty is an offense\u201d in Massachusetts, abundantly explain the cases cited by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, from the reports of those states respectively. In those states they have seen proper to apply to their peculiar laws and systems this doctrine of the common law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b148-8\">In other states, it appears that a contrary doctrine prevails; for example, in New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee. In these states, \u201c a conveyance by a disseizee would seem to be good, and pass to the third person all his right of possession and of jjroperty, whatever it might be.\u201d See 4 Kent, 449.</p>\n<p data-order=\"102\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b148-9\"><em>In-v. </em>Lessee of Whitman, 6 Binn. 416, is a case precisely similar to the one now before the court. The conveyance had been made by one out of possession, to the lessor of the jjlaiutiff, of lands held adversely by a third person. The court say, upon this point: \u201cWithout entering into the consideration *of the law of England, it may be affirmed with certainty, that the law as held there, was never adopted here. From the equality of condition of jjei\u2019sons in this country, there was no danger of maintenance from the interference of powerful individuals. In our courts, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>has never been made a question whether the grantor or devisor was in or out of possession; and to make it now, would disturb what has been looked upon as settled.</p>\n<p data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b149-5\">In Ohio, this question has arisen, been discussed, fully considered, and decided; and the doctrine which is applicable to our peculiar system has been settled.</p>\n<p data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b149-6\">In Lessee of Hall <em>v. </em>Ashley &amp; Craven, 9 Ohio, 96, this identical question arose: F. L. Henop was out of possession of the land; Ashley &amp; Craven were in possession, holding adverse to Henop, under a deed of conveyance ; there had been a judicial sale of the land, and, as in the case before the court, there were sundry intermediate conveyances of the land before Ashley &amp; Craven acquired title. Under these cireumstancos, Henop conveys to Hall by a release deed. It is not to be supposed that Hall bought the land without lookiug at it, or without knowing of the possession and claim of'the defendants; nor is it to be doubted that Hall, in the favorite language of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, knew that he was \u201cbuying a lawsuit.\u201d Although the imperfect report of the argument of the counsel of Ashley &amp; Craven does not set forth their argument on this point, yet the question was discussed by the counsel on the other side, in answer to their argument, and is fully considered by the court in noticing the defendant\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p data-order=\"105\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b149-7\">The counsel for the plaintiff have elaborately criticised the reasoning of the court in this case, as well as their historical information as to the origin of the doctrine upon champerty. We think the learned counsel are unfortunate, both in their criticism and \u201c history.\u201d We believe that it is a matter of history that the statute of 32 Henry Till did grow out of \u201cpeculiar exigencies,\u201d and that it was \u201cadapted to a state of society very different from what prevails hero.\u201d It is said that *this statute was but in affirmance of the common law; but if the \u201cexigences \u201d do not here exist which required the passage of that act, neither do those circumstances nor that state of society here exist which require the application of that doctrine which this act merely affirmed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"106\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b149-8\">The court say: \u201c Both of these classes of laws were adapted to a state of society very different from what prevails here. So far from opposing obstacles to the transmission of land, we have endeavored to render it as free as possible. The simple prohibition of selling land where the vendor has no title to it (29 Ohio L, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>142) has set bounds to the only real inconvenience and mischief which has sprung from the practice of champerty.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"107\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b150-5\">We believe that this was the first case in which the Supreme Court of Ohio were called upon to determine how far this doctrine of the common law was applicable to our institutions and state of society. As each of the other states have established a policy for themselves, either by statute or recognizing or disclaiming the doctrine of the common law, so our state has adopted its own policy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"108\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b150-6\">The counsel refer to the case of Key <em>v. </em>Vattier, 1 Ohio, 132, and 13 Ib. 175, and even claim that the latter case partially overrules the case in 9 lb.</p>\n<p data-order=\"109\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b150-7\">The counsel have ingeniously confused distinctions, which are palpable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"110\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b150-8\">In the case in 1 Ohio, the very essence of the contract was maintenance and champerty. T.he plaintiffs (lawyers) asked the court to enforce a contract, where the conditions precedent to the defendant\u2019s covenants, which the plaintiff averred and must prove, were palpable acts of maintenance. The court very properly held that the contract was against public policy, and that they had a right to treat it, and would treat it, as they would every other contract which was against public policy. But how wide is the difference between the application of that salutary principle and the doctrine which is here sought to be maintained ! If there was a subsisting contract between Welch *and the Luptons, by which the Luptons agree to convey to Welch one-half of the land, if recovered, \u2014 Welch to carry on the lawsuit, pay expenses, etc., \u2014 and Welch now came into court and sought to enforce this contract against the Luptons, the court might very properly say, The contract is against public policy, and wo are not bound to enforce it. But Welch seeks to enforce no contract which is against public policy. He stands upon a legal right and legal title. He has the legal title to the land, or he has no right to recover. Unless the law makes void the conveyance by which he claims title, we apprehend that, if he had acquired the title even by crime, the tenants in possession could not avail themselves of the objection. It was in the power of the Luptons to convey to Welch a title to this land, and that power was exercised by the deed; if not, he has no title. It is a question of title, and the court are called upon to determine whether it is in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>Welch. If a law was in existence in this state prohibiting such a purchase as the one made by Welch, his deed might be void, be-, cause of the want of power thus to convey or acquire title.</p>\n<p data-order=\"111\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b151-5\">It is further said, that \u201cit seems to be the general sense and usage of mankind, that the transfer of real property should not be valid, unless the grantor hath capacity as well as the intention to <em>deliver possession.\u201d </em>This doctrine proceeds from the old feudal rule, thatno feud could be created, or transferred, without investiture.\u201d It is not applicable to'modern titles or conveyances.</p>\n<p data-order=\"112\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b151-6\">As for the case in 13 Ohio, the court recognize the case in 1 Ohio. Judge Wood says, that \u201cwhere no statutory regulation exists, the common law is universally holden to prevail, as imported by our ancestors <em>and applicable to our local circumstances.\" </em>How this decision <em>overrules, </em>in any respect, the case in 9 Ohio, we do not understand.</p>\n<p data-order=\"113\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b151-7\">Judge Grimke thinks that the doctrine which makes void conveyances of land where the grantor is out of possession, is not applicable to the state of society which prevails here. Judge Wood does not say that it is.</p>\n<p data-order=\"114\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b151-8\">*We have discussed this case as though it really was, as the plaintiff\u2019s counsel claim, infected with champerty and maintenance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"115\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b151-9\">In 13 Ohio, Judge Wood defines champerty thus: \u201cAn agreement to prosecute, at one\u2019s own risk and expense, and to take a part of the thing received, in compensation.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"116\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b151-10\">Blackstone says, that \u201cmaintenance is an officious intermeddling with a suit that in no way belongs to one, by maintaining or assisting either party with money, or otherwise, to prosecute or defend it.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"117\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b151-11\">In the case before the court, according to the testimony of Mrs. Lupton, the land which these boys inherited from their father was sold to Kline for horses, when two of the boys were infants. They joined in the deed, but the elder brother received all the horses, and the minors received, as she believes, no part of the proceeds. This deed was a void or voidable one. Notwithstanding the deed to Kline, the boys really owned the land. They, at the same time, avoid their deed to Kline, and sell their land (not a \u201clawsuit\u201d) to Welch. He pays them, not a trifling consideration, but $1,250. As there were other persons in possession of the land wmch belonged to these minors, Welch may have supposed that possession <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>would not voluntarily be given up to him. He neither prosecuted, maintained nor intermeddled with the suit of any one. He bought land of those who ho supposed had the title. It was just such a \u201c speculation \u201d as the one in 9 Ohio. If there was nothing demanding the \u201cstern rebuke\u201d of the court in that caso, there is nothing in this. The cho'ice epithets applied by the counsel to Welch and his conduct, are not called for by the circumstances of the case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"118\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b152-5\">3. It is claimed that the deed to Welch is not such a deed as to entitle him to sustain an action of ejectment; that it is a mere release of an interest, without any conveyance of title.</p>\n<p data-order=\"119\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b152-6\">The objection is certainly futile. The language of the deed is: \u201c hath bargained and sold, and by these presents doth give, grant, ^bargain and soli; alien, enfeoff, release, convoy and confirm unto the said Rezin Welch, his heirs and assigns, the following described tract of land,\u201d etc. The deed then contains a recital, in which the land is specifically described. All this recital is of no account, except to ascertain the tract of land referred to in the grant. It had no other object than to describe the land and show the nature of the title which the Luptons held; to wit, a title by inheritance, and the interest which each held; to wit, one undivided third part. From the face of the deed, what did the grantors intend? Unquestionably, to convey their shares of this land, as. heirs of Wm. B. Lupton, deceased.</p>\n<p data-order=\"120\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b152-7\">But, even if this deed had been simply a quitclaim, it would have been sufficient, in Ohio, to have passed the title. See Lessee of Hall et al. <em>v. </em>Ashley &amp; Craven, 9 Ohio, 96, where this question is decided.</p>\n<p data-order=\"121\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b152-8\">4. The fourth assignment is an objection arising from principles feudal in their origin, and principles which are applicable only to feudal tenure. So rigid was the feudal rule, that a feoffment made by a minor could only be avoided by entry. It could not be avoided by suit, by notice, or by any other means. See 3 Com. Dig. 622.</p>\n<p data-order=\"122\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b152-9\">\u201cThe feoffment being a conveyance made with much greater solemnity than any other, the infant can not, as in the case of a lease, surrender, grant, etc., have an assize, or bring trespass until he has avoided the feoffment by entry \u2014 for it is to be presumed in favor of such a solemnity, that the assembly of the pais then present would have prevented it if they had perceived his non-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>ago; and, therefore, the feoffment shall continue until defeated by entry, which is an act of equal notoriety.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"123\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b153-5\">See Bingham on Infancy, 60, 61. In the case of a feoffment, this doctrine is reasonable and right, for it is placed upon tho ground that the act of avoidance should be of equal notoriety and solemnity with the act that created the estate, and a feoffment must always be accompanied with livery of seizin. 4 Cruise Dig., title Deed, ch. 4, sec. 26.</p>\n<p data-order=\"124\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b153-6\">*In the case of Lessee of Drake and wife <em>v. </em>Ramsey et al., 5 Ohio, cited by the plaintiff in error, the court recognize this doctrine as peculiar to feudal tenure, thus: \u201cSome of the books apparently suppose that the act of avoidance must be of equal solemnity with the act of grant; but I can not find it to be expressly decided, except in cases of feoffments, where a peculiar feudal principle renders it necessary.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"125\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b153-7\">We have no feoffments in Ohio. Tho instrument sought to be avoided is not a feoffment, but a simple deed of conveyance. Can it be possible that the old feudal doctrine, applicable to feoffments only, can be applied to modern conveyances? Surely, nothing\" but a superstitious veneration for the idle ceremonies of the common law, when the causes of their existence have all passed away, could suggest the application. But, even if we recognize the rule which \u201c some of the books apparently suppose,\u201d the deed to Welch is an \u201cact of equal solemnity\u201d with tho deed to Kline, and, consequently, the act of avoidance is equal in notoriety and solemnity with the act of grant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"126\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b153-8\">The plaintiff in error relies upon the eases of the Inhabitants of Worcester <em>v. </em>Eaton, 13 Mass. 374, and Bool <em>v. </em>Mix, 17 Wend. 119.</p>\n<p data-order=\"127\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b153-9\">The case in 13 Mass, is not in any respect in point. In this ease an <em>entry </em>had in fact been made \u2014 the question decided by the court was, should duress be pleaded? The acts of a person under <em>duress, </em>wore under consideration, not the acts of <em>minors. </em>The coui\u2019t evidently incautiously go out of the case to say that an infant\u2019s deed can be avoided \u201c <em>only 'by </em>entrywhereas the doctrine universally recognized, is, that it may be avoided in different modes other than by entry; and such is the doctrine expressly recognized in all of the other cases cited by the plaintiff in error.</p>\n<p data-order=\"128\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b153-10\">The case of Bool <em>v. </em>Mix is not directly in point; but, as it is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>case at variance with the case of Drake and wife <em>v. </em>Ramsey, 5 Ohio, it will claim some consideration at our hands.</p>\n<p data-order=\"129\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b154-5\">The relics of the ancient common law have more or less existed in the eastern states, and the decisions of their courts *are frequently tinged with them. It is but late that the old writ of right, with all its subtleties, was in lull force in the State of Massachusetts; and, at the present time, the people of New York are complaining of the old feudal tenures that have tied up their landed property. But, in this state, it is otherwise. Since the organization of our state government, it has been the constant aim of our legislature, as well as of our courts of judicature, to avoid the idle ceremonies of the common law, and to make our laws plain and comprehensible, and consistent with the principles of common sense, applicable to the customs of our people, and to the spirit of our liberal institutions. It would not, therefore, be strange, if the courts of Now York would go farther toward recognizing some of these ancient feudal principles than would the tribunals of Ohio. But an examination of the reasoning of the court, together with the point in the case which was decided, will do away with the force of the authority. In this case there had been <em>no act of avoidance whatever </em>before bringing the action. The defendant was in possession, by virtue of a deed, good on its face. No notice was given him of the claim of the plaintiff, but, when quietly in possession, he was treated as a trespasser and wrong-doer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"130\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b154-6\">The court say, that the defendant\u2019s possession was not tortious; that it would be imposing no unreasonable burden upon one wishing to avoid his deed, to require that it shall be done by an entry on the land, or by <em>some other act of equal notoriety </em>\u2014 and the avoidance, whatever its form, must precede the bringing an action to recover possession ; that, although the title of the tenant may be defeated, yet so long as the deed remains unrevoked, he has the legal seizin, and can not be treated as a trespasser. In this case, there was <em>no act of avoidance whatever </em>before the bringing of the suit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"131\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b154-7\">In the ease before the court, there was an act of avoidance before bringing the suit; to wit, an avoidance by deed of conveyance \u2014 an act of <em>\u201c equal notoriety and solemnity </em>\u201d with the instrument thereby avoided. The court do not say what *shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>be the necessary act to avoid \u2014 they only say, that it must, in some manner, be avoided.</p>\n<p data-order=\"132\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b155-5\">In the case of Lessee of Drake and wife <em>v. </em>Ramsey et al., the court held the bringing of the suit to be a sufficient avoidance of the minor\u2019s deed; and therein the case conflicts with the case of Bool <em>v. </em>Mix. It may, however, be remarked that the service of the notice in ejectment under our statute, is a notice to the tenant, and that it is only by his entry into the consent rule, that he can, under our practice, be subjected to costs. It is true, that the judge in the case of Bool <em>v. </em>Mix, goes beyond the question involved in the case, and says that (in relation to the cases of 14 Johns. 124; 11 Johns. 539, and 10 Pet. 59), \u201cif in these cases the land had been held adversely to the infant, the second deed would, I think, have been void, and could not have amounted to a revocation of the first conveyance.\u201d But the court further say, that \u201c it is unnecessary, on the present occasion, to say, that an entry in the land was the <em>only mode </em>in which the deed could be avoided; for the plaintiff, previous to bringing the action, had done no act whatever to disaffirm the conveyance.\u201d The court do not decide that a subsequent conveyance would not have been an \u201cact of equal notoriety,\u201d and sufficient to have avoided the deed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"133\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b155-6\">The case of Tucker et al. Moreland, 10 Pet. 59, is also cited by the plaintiff in error. In this case the deed was avoided by a subsequent conveyance. No entry was made. True, the infant had never given up the possession of the land, but it does appear to ns that the language of Mr. Justice Story fully sustains our views of this case. Ho says: \u201cBut if the act of the infant is a matter <em>in pais, </em>it may be avoided by an act <em>in pais </em>of equal solemnity or notoriety.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"134\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b155-7\">In referring to the case in 14 Johns., he says : \u201c The court proceed upon principles which are in perfect coincidence with the common law, and are entirely satisfactory; that it would seem not only from principle, but authority, that the infant can manifest his dissent in the same way and manner by which *he first assented to convey. If he has given livery of seizin, he must' do an act of equal notoriety to disaffirm the act \u2014 he must enter on the land and make known his dissent. If he has conveyed by bargain and sale, then a second deed of bargain and sale will be equally solemn and notorious in disaffirmance of the first. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>know of no authority or principle which contradicts this doctrine. It seems founded in good sense, and follows out the principle of notoriety of disaffirmance in the \u2014 case of a feoffment by an entry \u2014 that is, by an act of equal notoriety and solemnity with the original act.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"135\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b156-5\">In the case of Jackson <em>v. </em>Burchin, 14 Johns. 126, although it is true that the lands were uncultivated, yet the decision of the court upon the question whether entry was necessary, is not placed upon that ground. The court say, that if the infant \u201c has given livery of seizin, ho must do an act of equal notoriety to disaffirm the first act; be must enter on the land and make known bis dissent. Tf he has conveyed by bargain and sale, then a <em>second deed of bargain and sale </em>will be equally solemn and notorious in disaffirmance of the first.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"136\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b156-6\">In the case of Jackson <em>v. </em>Carpenter, 11 Johns. 541, the court say, expressly, that \u201c the doctrine requiring an actual entry to avoid a feoffment and livery made by an infant, <em>does not apply to a bargain and sale.\u201d</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"137\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b156-7\">The plaintiff in error undertakes to make a distinction between wild and cultivated lands, as to the necessity of making entry. Is there any real distinction ? Does the entry operate upon the possession, or as a notice to the tenant in possession? If on the possession, it would be as important in the one case as_ the other. Suppose the law of feoffment to be in force, and a minor should, by livery of seizin, convey away wild land, would not an entry become necessary for him to avoid that conveyance ? Most certainly it would, because the act of avoidance must be an act of <em>equal notoriety </em>with the grant. Will it be pretended that the bare entry, by the Luptons, upon the land, before making the deed to Welch, would have been of *any benefit to any one, or could have been anything but a most idle and ludicrous ceremony ? The defendant claims that the deed to Welch was a sufficient act of avoidance, and sufficient to pass the title of the shares of Cyrus and William in the land to Welch.</p>\n<p data-order=\"138\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b156-8\">The ease of Drake and wife <em>v. </em>Ramsey et al. is claimed to bo directly in point.</p>\n<p data-order=\"139\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b156-9\">The Court, in this case, lays clown with groat clearness what acts will constitute an avoidance of a deed, made by an infant during minority, when he comes of age. The court says, that an entry, suit, or action, a subsequent conveyance, an effort to restore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>the parties to their original condition, or any act unequivocally manifesting the intention, would render the avoidance effectual.</p>\n<p data-order=\"140\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b157-5\">It appears to have been the intention of the court to settle the question, and lay down such landmarks as could easily'be understood. There had been great uncertainty as to what acts would constitute an avoidance; and, to put the matter at rest in this state, the court, in deciding whether an entry was necessary before suit, laid down what acts would constitute a disaffirmance of a former deed, made by an infant. This is not a hasty decision, but is one of great consideration; and every principle that it contains is fraught with the plainest principles of common sense. What more than a subsequent\" conveyance, to avoid a mihor\u2019s deed, can be required? It is an unequivocal manifestation of an intention to avoid the former deed. It is an act of equal notoriety and solemnity with the first deed. It is an act of greater notoriety than entry; for entry may be made, unknown to the tenant in possession, whereas a subsequent conveyance is a matter of record. The law of feoffment requires only an act of equal notoriety. Surely our law will not require more.</p>\n<p data-order=\"141\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b157-6\">In 2 Dev. &amp; Battle, 320, the same question was fully examined, and the decision, in the case of Drake and wife <em>v. </em>Ramsey, fully sustained. See also 2 Konf\u2019s Com. 237, notes <em>a, b, c.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"142\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b157-7\">*It is further claimed by the plaintiff in error, that, even if a subsequent conveyance is a sufficient act of avoidance, yet it can not be sufficient to avoid the former deed, and at the same time pass the title. But, in the cases in'll and 14 Johns., it is held that the subsequent deed is sufficient for both purposes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"143\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b157-8\">5. It is claimed by the plaintiff in error, that the court erred in charging the jury, that lapse of time, less than twenty-one years, was not of itself evidence of acquiescence, but might bo evidence in connection with other facts and circumstances.</p>\n<p data-order=\"144\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b157-9\">To sustain this objection, roieronce is made to Drake and wife v. Ramsey et ah, 5 Ohio, 152. It is difficult for us to perceive any substantial 'difference between the charge of' the court upon this point and the opinion of Judge Lane. Both agree that lapse of time, less than twenty-one years, does not amount to <em>acquiescence; </em>but that lapse of time, loss than twenty-one years, in connection with other facts and circumstances, might be evidence of acquiescence. The jury wore virtually told, that the simple fact that ten or eleven years had elapsed alter the minor came of age, before his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>deed was avoided, was not, of itself, an <em>affirmance </em>of the &lt;jeed; that it was a fact which might aid in establishing an affirmance, when taken in connection with other facts and circumstances That lapse of time, less than twenty-one years, did not constitute acquiescence, is a principle decided and established, and was not a question for the jury to decide. Whether there were other facts and circumstances, which, taken in connection with the lapse of time, amounted to acquiescence, was a question which they had a right to determine, and was properly submitted to them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"145\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b158-5\">In holding that lapse of time, connected with other circumstances, might be evidence of acquiescence, and thus confirm the title, the court went further than any of the leading cases in other states upon the subject. In Jackson <em>v. </em>Carpenter, 11 Johns. 542, the court held, that an acquiescence by the grantor for eleven years, after he came of age, \u201c did not ^amount to a confirmation of that conveyance; that <em>soma positive act </em>was necessary, evincing his assent to the conveyance.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"146\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b158-6\">In 10 Peters, 76, Mr. Justice Story refers to 11 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 311, where the court held, \u201cthat to constitute a confirmation of a conveyance or contract by an infant, after ho arrives of age, there must be some distinct act, by which he either receives a benefit from the contract after he arrives at age, or does some act of express ratification ;\u201d and of that decision, and the one in 11 Johns. 542, says, \u201cthere is much good sense in these decisions, and they are indispensable to a just support of the rights of infants, according to the common law.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"147\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b158-7\">In the sixth place, it is claimed by the plaintiff in error that the court erred in charging the jury, \u201cthat the retention of the purchase money in the case was not, of itself, an act demonstrating a willingness to be bound by the contract.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"148\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b158-8\">It was not a question for the jury to determine, whether the retention of the purchase money was, or was not, evidence of affirmance. The law is perfectly well settled, that a minor is not bound to return the purchase money before disaffirming his deed, made during minority. 10 Peters, 74.</p>\n<p data-order=\"149\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b158-9\">The counsel do not even claim that such is not the law, but only that the question should have boen left to the jury, to determine whether it was evidence of affirmance. If the law is, that retention of the purchase money is not an affirmance, surely it was right for the court so to charge the jury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"150\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>In this case, by reference to the testimony of Mrs. Lupton, it will appear that there was, probably, no part of the purchase money retained by the minoi\u2019s. The same remarks may be applied to the seventh objection as to the fifth, as they are one and the same.</p>\n<p data-order=\"151\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-5\">The evidence, from lapse of time and silence, was not, in any manner, excluded from the jury. It was all before them; and they wore, as we think, properly instructed as to the effect which they had a right to give to it. We think, the ju ;ment of the court of common pleas should be affirmed</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"152\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b159-6\">\u2666Hitchcock, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Az5\">The several facts of this case, as exhibited in the bill of exceptions, are that William B. Lupton, in the year 1815, died seized of the premises in controversy. On September 20, 1832, Elisha E. Lupton, Cyrus C. Lupton, and William H. Lupton, all of Baltimore, in the State of Maryland, and heirs of said William B. Lupton, conveyed the same land to Peter Kline, of Trumbull county, by deed duly executed. The plaintiff in error claimed title under conveyances from Kline. At the time of the conveyance to Kline by the Luptons, CyruR C. and William H. were infants, within the age of twenty-one years.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">The defendant in error claimed title under a deed executed to his lessee, by Cyrus C. and William H. Lupton, on April 15, 1843, conveying to him their interest in the premises. He also gave evidence as to the consideration paid by Kline, and conducing to prove that payment was made to the brother, who was of full age ; and further, that his grantors were citizens and residents of the State of Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">In order to ascertain whether the court of common pleas committed any error in the charge complained of, it will be necessary to examine particularly what that court was requested to charge, and what they did actually charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">1. The court was requested to charge \u201c that if a person under the age of twenty-one years, but above the age of discretion, and apparently twenty-one years of age, represents himself to be of that age, and thereby induces another person to purchase land from him, take a conveyance, and pay the purchase money, or part of it; the party making such representations is estopped from claiming back such land and proving that he was not of ago, if the purchaser, believing such statement, acted upon it, paid the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>purchase money accordingly, and has in his conduct been perfectly fair in the transaction; which instruction the court refused to give, but charged that such was not the law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">It will be seen from an examination of the bill of exceptions that no evidence has been given to the jury conducing to prove *that the two younger Luptons, or either of them, had, at the time of the conveyance to Kline,-represented themselves as being' of full age, thereby inducing him to purchase the land, nor that he acted upon any such belief. This, then, was a mere abstract proposition, entirely out of the case; and if the court were mistaken upon the point of law, it would make no difference in the result. Under such circumstances we never interfere with the judgment of an inferior court. We would not be understood as saying that here was any mistake; but if there was, it was in a matter upon which the plaintiff had no right to ask the instruction of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">2. The court were next asked to charge the jury, \u201cthat the purchase by Welch, and receiving a deed from persons out of possession, of lands in the actual adverse possession of persons claiming title, is an act of champerty and maintenance, illegal and void.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">This instruction the court refused, and charged that such was not the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">The question here presented is not one which now comes before the court for the first time. It is well known that, in England, a sale and conveyance of land by a person out of possession of land, the same lands at the time being in possession of another, claiming title, would be void, as being against the policy of the law. Whether this is a principle of the common law, or whether it is based upon some statute, is a question which has been much controverted. But this is a matter of little consequence, so long as such is the law. In many, probably in most of the states of this Union, the same principle prevails; but in this state the decisions have, from the earliest period of our judicial history, been different, and such sales and conveyances have been held to bo valid. This identical question was belore this court in the case of Hail et al. <em>v. </em>Ashley et al., 9 Ohio, <em>96; </em>and the title acquired under such circumstances was held to be good. The case referred to is the first brought before the court in bank, in which this question was agitated, and the decision was merely in affirmance *of what was understood to be the rule of law, as estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>lished by frequent determinations on the circuit. Now, I have no hesitation in saying that, in my opinion, the rule contended for by plaintiff\u2019s counsel would be beneficial, and highly conducive to the public interest. It would prevent the practice of purchasing doubtful titles. It might interfere with the interest of keen-sighted speculators, who make it a business to hunt up and purchase in such titles, but it could do no injury to the honest man. .But although such is my opinion, still, acting in a judicial capacity, I can not consent to change the rule. Such change would interfere with a multitude of land\u2019titles heretofore acquired, and acquired, too, with a knowledge Of the law as expounded by tho court. But there is a body which can apply a remedy which shall operate hereafter; that body is the general assembly. And to me it is a matter of surprise that we have not an act upon our statute books, declaring void sales made under the circumstances referred to by counsel in their second request to the court. But until some statute of the kind is enacted, we feel ourselves bound by the law as heretofore settled.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">3. and 4. The third and fourth instructions requested of the court, were, in substance, that the execution by Cyrus C. Lupton and 'William H. Lupton, of tho deed to the defendant in error, did not, on their part, amount to a disaffirmance of the former deed to Kline, by them executed while infants. This the court refused to do, and held that such was not the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Much has been said in the books with respect to the deeds of infants conveying land, whether they were void or merely voidable. The better opinion, as we believe, is, that they are merely voidable; and it was so held in the case of Drake and wife <em>v. </em>Ramsey ot al., 5 Ohio, 251. Such being tho law, the deed of an infant will hold good until some act has been done by him to avoid it, although there has been no express act of affirmance after his arrival at full age. But what the act of disaffirmance shall be, is a matter of more doubt. *If it be one of equal solemnity with the original act of conveyance, it would seem to be sufficient. Thus, in England, if a feoffment be made by an infant, he can only avoid it by entry. He must be in possession in order to make the feoffment; for that is not done without livery of seizin. He must then again enter to avoid the feoffment; and perhaps this alone would not be sufficient. But in this country, and especially in this state, this mode of conveyance is not adopted. Lands here <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>are conveyed by deed of bargain and sale, and deeds of other descriptions. Livery of seizin is not known in practice, and is entirely unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">In the case of Drake and wife <em>v. </em>Ramsey et al., before referred to, the judge, in delivering the opinion of the court, says : \u201c Some of the books apparently suppose that the act of avoidance must be of equal solemnity with the act of grant; but I can not find it to be expressly decided, except in cases of feoffments, where a peculiar feudal principle renders it necessary. We believe that an entry, suit, or action, a <em>subsequent </em>conveyance, an effort to restore the parties to their original condition, or any act unequivocally manifesting the intention, would render the evidence effectual,\u201d etc. It is said, however, that this question did not properly arise in that case, and, therefore, that this dictum of the court can not be relied upon as authority. It was the deliberate opinion of the court, in a case where one of the principal questions was, what act would amount to the avoidance or disaffirmance of a deed executed by an infant. True, the act relied upon in that case, and which was held to be sufficient, was the commencement of an action of ejectment. That a subsequent conveyance would amount to a disaffirmance, has been decided in the Supreme Court of New York and of the United States. 11 Johns. 541; 14 Johns. 128; 10 Pet. 59. In fact, I can not well conceive what would be a more decisive act of disaffirmance than the conveyance of the same land to another person. It would be conclusive evidence that the person making such conveyance, did not intend to be bound by his deed made in infancy.</p>\n<p id=\"AOh\">*5. The court was next requested to charge the jury, \u201cthat lapse of time less than twenty-one years, after the minor comes of age, may furnish evidence of acquiescence, and confirm the title.\u201d In response to which request, the court charged, that the lapse of time less than twenty-one years was hot of itself evidence of acquiescence, but might be evidence of such acquiescence in connection with other facts and circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">In this particular, I understand the court to have stated, in substance, that lapse of time alone would not amount to an affirmance on the part of the grantor of the deed executed in infancy, unless that lapse of time amounted to twenty-one years. Such was the opinion of this court, as expressed in the case of Drake and wife <em>v. </em>Ramsey. But in that case, as in this, the- court held, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>lapse of a less period of time, taken in connection with other circumstances, might amount to a confirmation. The idea might have been conveyed in different language, but I do not see wherein the court violated any principle of law in this particular.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">6. The next request made to the court, was to charge, \u201c that the right to disaffirm a deed made during minority, may be extinguished by an act done under a knowledge of his right, which demonstrates a willingness to be bound by the contract; or, by continuing after acquiring such knowledge, to enjoy any <em>benefit, profit, </em>or <em>privilege, </em>under the contract, after they attained full age.\u201d The court admitted such to be the law, but added, \u201cthat retention of the purchase money in this ease was not, of itself, an act demonstrating a willingness to be bound by the contract; and that a minor was not bound to return the purchase money before dis-affirming his deed made during minority.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">It can hardly be supposed that any one will seriously contend, that an infant who has conveyed land during infancy, can not dis-affirm his contract before returning the money which he has received upon the contract; nor that the retention of the money is demonstrative evidence of a willingness to be *bound by the contract. If I am correct in this, then it follows that there was nothing erroneous in the opinion expressed, in itself considered. It was not a violation of law. Whether it was proper, under the circumstances, to make the statement, is another question ; and in order to solve this, it is necessary to look to the bill of exceptions. From that, it appears that the infants had not \u201creceived any benefit, profit, or privilege,\u201d from the contract, \u2014neither before nor after they arrived at full age \u2014 except the purchase money; and it is left doubted whether they have even received that much. The court were pressed to say, that the grantor of a deed made during infancy, by continuing after acquiring a knowledge of his rights, \u201c to enjoy <em>any benefit, profit, </em>or <em>privilege, </em>under the contract,\u201d after arriving at full age, would confirm the deed; and this, too, in a case where the facts showed that the only \u201c <em>benefit,profit, </em>or <em>privilege\u201d </em>was the retention of the purchase money. The court admitted the correctness of the general proposition, qualifying it, however, by saying, in substance, that the retention of the purchase money was not such a \u201c <em>benefit, profit, </em>or <em>privilege </em>\u201d as would be equivalent to a confirmation of the contract; or, in other words, that it is not necessary that a person who has con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>veyed his land by deed during infancy, should, as a condition precedent, refund the purchase money before he disaffirms his contract of conveyance. I do not perceive that there is anything wrong in this.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">V. Counsel for plaintiff in error next requested the court to charge the jury, \u201cthat the silence of the party after coming of age, might be evidence of acquiescence and confirmation, although for a less period than twenty-one years after coming of age.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">This is but a reiteration, in substance, of the request which had been before made, and which is noted on the bill of exceptions as being the fifth. The. words are not identical, but there is no difference in substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">The court also responded as before, stating, \u201c that silence for a less period than twenty-one years, was not, in itself, unless connected with other facts and circumstances, evidence of *assont to, or confirmation of, a deed made during minority.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">As to these three last points, I do not see that there was anything substantially wrong. The ideas might have been conveyed in different language, and, possibly, in language more appropriate. The whole substance and effect of it is this, that where an infant convoys land by deed, although the contract is voidable, and must be disaffirmed after he arrives at full age, yet, that he has the length of time allowed by the statute of limitations, within which to disaffirm. But if, in the meantime he has done other acts which show a manifest intention to confirm the deed so executed, those acts, taken in connection with the lapse of time, although that bo less than twenty-one years, will amount to a confirmation. It was so held by this court,in the case of Drake and wife <em>v. </em>Ramsey, and so held in the cases cited from Johnson\u2019s Reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">The only other matter ruled by the court upon one of these three last points, was, that an individual who would disaffirm a conveyance made by him during infancy, need not, as a condition precedent to the disaffirmance, refund,'or offer to refund, the purchase money. These are not the words, but it is the substance and effect of the ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-10\">Upon the whole, we see nothing erroneous in the charge of the court complained of, and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-11\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"153\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b164-12\">Birchard, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ADT3\">dissenting. The deed of a minor is universally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>held voidable, not absolutely void. Infancy is a personal privilege, and can be taken advantage of only by the infant after arriving at years of maturity. He must do some act in avoidance of his deed, before the person occupying lands as the rightful owner, having entered under the deed, can be put in the wrong, and proceeded against a's a trespasser. \u00abThis position is not denied. It is admitted. Cresinger, and those under whom he claimed, had held and improved the land in their own right, as lawful owners, under the deed of the Luptons, executed during minority; and no act or movement had been made by them to disaffirm the deed, for near ten years. Welch, ^seeking to speculate, then applied to them for the purchase of a lawsuit; and they executed to him a quitclaim deed. By this decision now made, that act of putting their hands and seals to, and acknowledging the instrument before a magistrate in Baltimore, works the wondrous effect' of changing the rightful possession of him who was the legal owner one moment before, into a tortious act, for which this court will maintain the action of trespass and ejectment. I can not believe that such is the law. Bool <em>v. </em>Mix, 17 Wend. 132, is expressly against it; and in my judgment is a decision that will bear the strictest scrutiny, and be found sustained both by principle and authority. I refer to that ease as a full exposition of my views upon the point wherein I differ from the other members of the court. It seems to me that their opinion makes the minor\u2019s deed, in substance, an absolute nullity; contrary to the admitted rule which I have firstly above stated. That it is at war with the second rule which I have stated, inasmuch as it permits other persons than the minor to take advantage of his minority; and that it is against good policy, inasmuch as it must tend to encourage a species of speculation that should be invariably discouraged, and which disturbs the peace of community.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
