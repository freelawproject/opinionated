Curtis was the resident engineer upon said portion of the public works of the state, and that he delivered to defendant, on said May 2, 1837, a paper, of which the following is a copy:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-10\">\u201cMcConnellsville, <em>May </em>2, 1837.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-11\">\u201cMessrs.

Curtis, <em>Resident </em>Engineer.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b39-6\">The admission of this paper in evidence was objected to by plaintiff. No proof, other than is above set forth, was given of the defendant being in the employment or service of the board of public works; nor any other proof than is above set forth that the board of public <em>'\u00a1\u00a1rovks, </em>any member thereof, or any agent thereof, authorized or commanded the plaintiff\u2019s land to be entered, or his timber taken by the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b39-7\">Evidence was given by the plaintiff tending to show that the plaintiff\u2019s land was two or two and a half miles from said section seven, and that the necessary timber could have been obtained from land lying nearer to said section, and the plaintiff\u2019s counsel claimed in argument that such fact had been fully established.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b39-8\">It was in evidence that the defendant owned timber lands adjoining the plaintiff\u2019s land, from which he had taken timber *for section seven, and proof tending to show that he had exhausted his own timber before ho resorted to the timber of the plaintiff. There was proof on the part of the defendant tending to show that the quantity and quality necessary for section seven could not be obtained so conveniently nearer than the plaintiff\u2019s and defendant\u2019s lands, and claimed this fact to be established before the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b39-9\">The court charged tho jury that the material parts of the defendant\u2019s second plea were : Was the defendant a contractor on section 7 ? was he authorized by the resident engineer to enter upon the plaintiff\u2019s land and take the timber which he had taken? and did he, in exercising that authority, do any unnecessary damage? That it was not necessary to be shown that any application had been made to tho owner of the land for timber, etc., or that the owner had refused, or had asked an exorbitant price therefor. That the defendant was not obliged to resort to timber which was nearer the section, but would be equally justified in obtaining it within five miles or one mile \u2014 that he might exercise a reasonable discretion as to the place where to obtain it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>1 To the opinions of the court in admitting the said paper in evidence, and in the charge to the jury, the plaintiff excepts, etc.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b40-5\">C. B. Goddard, for plaintiff:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b40-6\">On behalf of the plaintiff in error, I claim that this judgment must be reversed, for the following reasons:</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b40-7\">1. The evidence shows that the only authority ever given by the board of public works to the defendant, to enter upon the plaintiff\u2019s land, required a previous application to the plaintiff, and a refusal, or a demand of an exorbitant price.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b40-8\">The plea alleges that the defendant was the agent of the board of public works, and was commanded by the board, through Mr. Curtis, the engineer, to enter upon the plaintiff\u2019s land and take his timber, etc. The proof wholly fails to ^sustain this allegation. The board of public works did agree to give such authority, but upon one contingency, which was, when the contractor could not obtain materials except at exorbitant prices. This is the only case in which it is necessary for the board to interfere for the benefit of the contractor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b40-9\">The case of Bloodgood <em>v. </em>Mohawk and Hudson Railroad Company, 18 Wend. 9, is much in point: The legislature of New York authorized the railroad company to enter upen land for their road; but in case of a disagreement as to price, the governor was to appoint three commissioners to determine the damages, etc. Held by the court, that the company could enter upon no land without the consent of the owner, until the damages were assessed and paid.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b40-10\">2. The paper signed by Mr. Curtis is inadmissible in evidence, or, if admissible, could not confer the power assumed for it by the learned judge who tried the cause \u2014 inasmuch as no evidence was given that the board, or any member thereof, authorized the order, and because it is general in its terras, specifying no land, but leaving the whole of this tremendous discretionary power, which the legislature has devolved upon the members of the board of public works, or canal commissioners, to be exercised by a contractor as capriciously as he pleases.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b40-11\">The statute under which the defendant justifies, is found in Swan\u2019s Collated Statutes, chap. 93, sec. 5. It authorizes the ;i canal commissioners \u201d \u2014 whose duties at the time of the alleged trespass were performed by the board o\u00ed public works \u2014 \u201cand each of them, by themselves, and by any and every superintend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>ent, agent, and engineer employed by them, to enter upon, etc. It is admitted that the proof established the fact that Mr. Curtis was an engineer. He belonged to a class who <em>might </em>be empowered by the board to enter land, etc. But there was no proof this power ever had been conferred upon him, and if it had been, he could not confer it upon another.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b41-5\">*1 know of no case which has sanctioned the delegation of this power. The leading New York cases which establish the constitutionality of their canal laws \u2014 from which ours are borrowed \u2014 are Jerome <em>v. </em>Ross, 7 Johns. Ch. 315, and Rogers <em>v. </em>Bradshaw, 20 Johns. 735. In both these, the acts complained of were done by the state officers; and in the last-named case, Chancellor Kent, in delivering the unanimous opinion of the court of errors, lays stress ujjon the fact, that the chief engineer approved of the road as staked out, and that it was staked out by his direction. He says also, page 739, <em>\u201c </em>the commissioners were made the judges as to what lands were necessary for the prosecution of the improvements.\u201d And again: \u201cHere was, then, the exercise of a sound discretion in the execution of the trust.\u201d Again, page 740: \u201c What was proper to be done, and what damages were unavoidable, were questions left entirely to the judgment of the commissioners.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b41-6\">3. The charge of the court assumes, that proof that the defendant was a <em>contractor </em>established the second plea, whieh had carelully omitted to style him a contractor, and called him the <em>agent </em>of the board.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b41-7\">The truth is, there was no proof that the defendant was an agent of the board of public works, except so far as proof that he was a contractor made him so. Nor was there any proof that the board commanded the defendant to enter the plaintiff\u2019s land, except as that proof may be found in the letter of Mr. Curtis, authorising him to enter upon anybody\u2019s land. And it is worthy of remark, that the original plea in this case, in which the defendant justified, on the ground that he was a \u201c contractor,\u201d was adjudged bad on demurrer.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b41-8\">C. C. Covey, for defendant:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b41-9\">The reasoning of the counsel for the plaintiff fails to convince me that he is correct in his first position, which is, that private property can not be appropriated to public use, before *application to the plaintiff, and a refusal, or demand of an exorbi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>tant price. Equally at fault is the counsel in his reference to the case from 18 Wendell, for this reason: The Mohawk and Hudson Railroad Company is a private corporation ; the road is made for individual gain, and is not a public highway. True, the legislature of New York authorized the company to enter upon land for the construction of the road, but in the same clause provided, th\u2019at in case of a disagreement as to price, the governor should appoint three commissioners, etc.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b42-5\">The court there held that, as between these private individuals before the property of one could be converted to the use and benefit of another, that other should receive pay in full. The court in that case very wisely refused to recognize the doctrine that the owner of private property should depend for a repayment of 5ts value upon the solvency of a private corporation, where that property has been seized for individual benefit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b42-6\">This.doctrine has been fully sustained by this court, in Bates <em>v. </em>Cooper, 5 Ohio, 120. The coui\u2019t in that case, remarking upon cases similar to that cited from 18 Wendell, remark : <em>\u201c </em>Whatever construction we might feel constrained to put upon authority given to individuals to appropriate the property of others to their private advantage, we can not believe the cases to have any very material bearing on agents and officers exclusively public, engaged in the construction of a great public improvement, for the sole benefit of the state.\u201d In this same case also, of Bates <em>v. </em>Cooper, the doctrine of the learned counsel, that an application must first be made to the owner, a refusal made, or an exorbitant price demanded before the board can exercise its authority, of entering upon lands and for the purpose of taking materials, is expressly controverted in the following language, page 118 : \u201cBut we are not advised that the court has ever held, that compensation must be actually assessed, and paid over to the owner, before a public work can progress, whether he desires it or not. The constitution must receive a construction that will leave it possessed *of practical utility. The public interest is to be promoted, while private rights are secured. But can it be for a moment supposed, that a road or canal of general importance to the community should be interrupted or suspended, at the capricious will of an individual ?\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b42-7\">I contend further, that the engineer, Mr. Curtis, was clothed with ampio power to enter upon lands to procure the necessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>materials; that he could rightfully delegate this power to the defendant, as he did, and that the defendant was authorized to exercise a sound discretion in making his selection of the land, from which he would procure the materials.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b43-5\">Admitting that the agent, in exercising this discretion, erred; that the materials might, by possibility, have been procured nearer his work; yet, if it appears that there was no error in intention, no disposition manifested to exercise the authority given him by the state, to the injury of one, and in a spirit of favoritism toward another, the court will not hold him responsible as a trespasser.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b43-6\">In the case of Lyon <em>v. </em>Jerome, 15 Wend. 569, the court say: <em>\u201c </em>It is stated that the stone could not have been procured so conveniently anywhere else; but this fact is not noticed by the chief justice in delivering his opinion. No such qualification of the powers given to the commissioners and their agents is found in the act; and although it is highly proper that it should enter into their consideration in determining upon the appropriation of the private property of individuals, an error in judgment in respect to it ought not to subjoct them to be treated as trespassers.\u201d They further add: \u201cIt may be added that it appears in this case also, that the stone from the quarry of the plaintiff was the most convenient for building the locks. I conclude, then, that though the authority to enter upon the plaintiff\u2019s land and use his quarry, must be derived from the canal commissioners, no express and specific directions need bo given.\u201d The statute of New York, then under consideration by Chief Justice Nelson, was in almost the identical words of the statute of Ohio. What, *then, can be plainer than this position, \u2014 that the agents of the commissioners may, without any express authority from them, enter upon lands, and use the timber and other materials necessary in the consti\u2019uction of the public works?</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b43-7\">In Rogers &amp; Magee <em>v. </em>Bradshaw, 20 Johns. 735, the action was trespass, brought against contractors, for entering upon land and cutting timber to make a road, in place of one which had been appropriated for a canal. The plaintiffs in error had entered into a contract with Samuel Young, one of the canal commissioners, for making this road, and, in doing so, cut the timber necessary for its construction-. The chancellor delivered the unanimous opinion of the court of errors, in favor of the plaintiffs in error, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>they hold the entering of the contractor to be, in fact, the entering of the commissioners. See also, in this case, Wheelock <em>v. </em>Young &amp; Pratts, 4 Wend. 647; Calking <em>v. </em>Baldwin, Ib. 667. In the last case tho judge, in delivering the opinion of the court, says: <em>\u201c </em>The legislature have prescribed tho mode in which damages for the plaintiffs shall be ascertained, and in that mode only can they properly seek compensation.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b44-5\">Unless, then, there is something in this case to distinguish it from cases of a similar nature, so often decided by the courts of Now York and Ohio \u2014 unless, in fact, the agents of the state have, in the exercise of tho power given them by the state, been influenced by improper motivos, and caused unnecessary damage to result to the plaintiff, tho decision of the court below must be sustained.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b44-6\">Birchard, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7x\">Two errors are assigned :</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">1. The admission of tho order of the engineer. 2. The instructions given to the jury. Of these in their order.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">It is objected to the order, that, before it issued, there should have been a previous application to tho plaintiff for leave to enter tho land, and a refusal, or the demand of an exorbitant price. In reply to this objection, it is sufficient to observe, that tho law imposed no such limitation of power upon the board *of public works; and had Curtis, the engineer, been joined in this suit with these defendants, as he well might have been, if they were trespassers, his justification would have depended in no sense whatever upon any such fact. Most certainly, whatever would have sustained him in entering the promises, would also sustain those who entered in virtue of his directions; they were but his agents and assistants in executing the work of the Muskingum improvement. Much reliance is placed upon certain clauses in the contract, and in the notice to bidders. These provisions were inserted for the benefit of the contractors, not to embarrass them, but to insure to them the means of securing the necessary materials, for the structure of their dam and locks, at reasonable prices. Hence the board contracted, binding themselves, and giving to the defendants the right to compel them to exercise, in their behalf, the extraordinary powers conferred by statute, in case the stipulated contingency should happen. The insertion of this provision of the contract, with no limitation of tho power conferred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>upon the board of public works, or the engineer, by the statute , that was still left to be exercised, or not, at their discretion, under the responsibilities of their several stations, as duty and propriety might dictate. But the record shows that plaintiff was a minor\u2014 a person who could not act \u2014 one with whom no contract could be made by these defendants. The fact was alleged in the plaintiff\u2019s pleading, and needed no proof; and had it been material, was sufficient, so far as plaintiff\u2019s land or timber was concerned, to have justified the order of Curtis under the clauses in the contract and notice. A minor could give no permission that would bo obligatory upon him, not having the capacity to make an obligatory contract; and if that state of facts did not make a ease that would justify the engineer in giving a proper order, it is difficult to say what would.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">The order, however, is said to be void because it is too general in its terms, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">I take it, that is not the true test of its validity. The question is, was it broad enough to authorize the specific acts done Sunder it, and were those acts authorized by law? It may have been very improvident on the part of Curtis, the engineer, to give so general a direction; most certainly would it have subjected him to serious personal responsibility, had that been dono under it which the law would not sanction. If a man of ordinary prudence, he would not have given such a general permit without the most implicit confidence in the good faith and intelligence of the contractors. Whatever may have been his motives, the true question was, not whether the direction was too general and improvident, but whether it was, in fact, given; and if so, was it ample and sufficiently descriptive to authorize an entry upon the land of plaintiff? \u201cYou are hereby authorized to go on to the woodlands, in the vicinity of this place, and select, cut, and furnish yourselves with the requisite quality and size of timber, for the construction of locks, dams, and other wooden structures, as may be required,\u201d etc. It is equivalent to \u2014 \u201cYou may seek your materials from any woodland about this place; go where you can find it of the requisite quality and size in this vicinity, and cut what is necessary.\u201d Surely this was ample; and the proof tended strongly to show that suitable timber, at reasonable prices, could not well be procured nearer than from plaintiff\u2019s land. The object of the legislature in granting the power to enter, seize, and make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>use of the necessary materials, is'manifest. They were unwilling to subject the state to the hazard of having its great public works impeded at the caprice of every or any individual, and equally unwilling to permit the cupidity of any person to interpose any obstacle whatever to their completion, at a fair price. It was never contemplated that the officers and agents of the state should be restricted, in their right to appropriate materials, to such as were nearest to the place of use; such a restriction would have doubled the expense of the state. On the contrary, the plain intent was to confer ample power to take these materials wherever they could be procured at the least expense, in order that the public works might be completed at a fair cost. This, we must presume, was the understanding *of the board of public works, and of the contractors, at the time the contract in question was entered into. Consequently the stipulation of the board to authorize seizures, must be understood in reference to this view of their powers and the objects of the law. With what propriety, then, could the board refuse to permit the contractors to take materials from the places least expensive to them? Admitting that ample groves were to be found in the village of McConuellsville, were the contractors bound to take it thence, and pay the enhanced value which the peculiar locality gave to it, when, by going a short distance from town, better materials, at half the price, could be procured? Must they strip the reserved groves in the village, when by going a few miles better material was worth but little more than the expense of cutting, and to take it would aid the owner in clearing the forest, instead of injuring him? Surely no prudent person would so conduct his private affairs. It is as certain that the state never designed their agents to conduct the public business of canal-making less providently than a fair man of business would manage his objects of individual enterprise. This question is not a new one in Ohio. For more than twenty years the provision of the statute has been in force and acted upon in Ohio. Resident engineers in some parts of the state, during all that time, under the direction of the canal commissioners and board of public works, have been permitted to direct the taking of material, from such places as were least expensive to the contractor and state, without specific instructions from the canal commissioners; and their right to do so, whether in writing or by parol, though often questioned, has over been sus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>tained. In disposing of the second assignment of error, this subject will be necessarily again remarked upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">We come, then, to the objection taken to the charge of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">The law under which this defense was made, is section 8 of the act of 1825 (Swan's Stat. 747, 748), which provides thus : \u201cThat 'it shall and may be lawful for the said *canal commissioners, and each of them, by themselves, and by any and every superintendent, agent, and engineer employed by them, to enter upon, and take possession of, and use. all and singular any lands, waters, streams, and materials necessary for the prosecution of the improvements,\u201d etc., \u201c doing do unnecessary damage.\u201d A subsequent statute conferred this same power of the canal commissioners upon the board of public works. That part of the act which I have quoted, is copied in the very words of the law of New York of 1817. Under this law, the courts of New York have hold that an engineer, employed by the canal commissioners, to whom was given the superintendence in constructing a portion of the canal, was authorized to enter upon the lands of individuals, and take materials for the furtherance of the work, without any express orders or direction of the commissioners. Lyon <em>v. </em>Jerome, 15 Wend. 569; Wheelock <em>v. </em>Young and Platts, 4 Wend. 647.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">The reasoning of the court in those cases is applicable to this. As is said there, so say we here, that a construction of the law that would require every act done by the resident engineer and superintendent to be especially authorized by the board, or one of its members, could not have been within the contemplation of the legislature; it would have embarrassed the work, and was not practicable. True, the act of entering lands to take materials necessary for the work, by statute, is to be done by the board, or one of its members; but how to be done? The law says, by one of their number in person, \u201c <em>and by any and every superintendent, agent, and engineer employed by them.\u201d </em>When done by an engineer duly employed by them, the act is the act of the board, and tlm engineer or agent must justify it as such. The fault of the pleas first filed in this case, consisted in a ndglect to aver an entry under the authority of the board. The amended plea, upon which the verdict was taken, is liable to no such objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">We now come to the instruction complained of. Take it altogether, and we are still satisfied with it. The jury wero <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>*told, in substance, to inquire whether defendants were contractors ; whether they were authorized by the resident engineer to enter on the plaintiff\u2019s land and take tho timber which had been taken, and whether, in so doing, they did no unnecessary damage ; and if so, they should find them justified of the alleged trespass. Had Curtis, the engineer, been joined with these defendants, and justified under the board of public works, and the contractors justified, as they have, this case would not be distinguishable from the case cited from 4 Wendell. Young, in that case, was the engineer, and justified as such ; the others acted under his directions, without any specific directions of the canal commissioners of New York, and it was held they were not liable in trespass. This case, then, and the justification, is liko that, with this difference; here the engineer is not sued, and there both he and tho contractors were joined. The article there taken was stone; and it is to be gathered from Young\u2019s case, as well as the case in 15 Wendell, that, whether the materials could have been had more conveniently somewhere else was a matter of no moment. This brings us to the last clause in tho charge of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">The objection does not seem to be much relied upon by counsel, yet it is worthy of a remark. The object and intention of the legislature has already been .stated, in disposing of the main objections of plaintiff, to the ruling of the court below. The engineer\u2019s direction was, to go upon the woodlands in the vicinity. Counsel had urged to the jury, that the form, of expression! required the defendant to cut tho necessary timber from tho lands nearest to the lock and dam \u2014 that is, nearest to the town. The substance of tho charge was, that Curtis meant no such thing; that ho intended tho contractors might do what the state was authorized to do, go to such land in tho neighborhood as was most convenient \u2014 such as would subject the state to tho least sum in damages, and consequently subject the contractors to the least loss. Wo believe still that the charge of the court placed the correct construction upon the letter of the ^resident engineer ; because the words will bear that construction, and because, as a faithful agent of tho state, bound to deal fairly with the contractors, under the law and in virtuo of the contract, ho was under obligation to permit tho contractors to go where they could procure materials to the best advantage. And he was bound so to act as to secure to the contractors the benefits of their own skill and capacity as business <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>men. He had no i-ight to lessen the profits of their contract, by forcing them to procure timber whore it could only be had at an' extra price. Such a course would have violated the spirit of the contract, and been highly injurious to the contractors. It would have accomplished what was not right \u2014 what was of no advantage to tho state, or any one else \u2014 what the law never contemplated, and what both parties to the contract intended should not happen.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
