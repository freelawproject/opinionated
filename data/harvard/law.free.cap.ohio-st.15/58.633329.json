Two pleas were pleaded by the plaintiff in error; first, <em>non assumpsit; </em>second, a special plea in bar, of discharge in bankruptcy and certificate thereof, granted December 5, 1842, on a petition filed July 18, 1842, etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b49-12\">The defendant in error replied, that the debt and cause of action arose, and was contracted, in a <em>fiduciary capacity, </em>and that the plaintiff in error had applied said money to his own use, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>not in the payment or discharge of the note. The plaintiff rejoined, and put in issue the facts averred in the replication.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b50-5\">On these issues, the cause was submitted to the court without the intervention of a jury, and judgment given for the defendant in error; and to the finding of the court the plaintiff in error excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b50-6\">It appears from the record, that, on the trial, the defendant in error, to maintain the issue on his part, gave in evidence the note described, and that the plaintiff in error was one of the firm of. Bissell &amp; Gardner, who signed the note as sureties for the defendant in error, the other maker thereof; and that to indemnify Bissell &amp; Gardner, as such sureties, on June 20, 1839, the defendant in error, as principal, with one Peter Navarre as his surety, executed and delivered to said Bissell and Gardner their promissory note, for the sum of $103.50, payable on demand. The defendant in error also proved, that he paid $100 on the last mentioned note to said Bissell &amp; Gardner, with the understanding, that they were to apply it on the note to Knapp. The small balance due on the note, to indemnify Bissell &amp; Gardner, was afterward paid to Gardner, after the dissolution *of the firm, but was receipted for by him in the name of the partnership. It was likewise proved, that Bissell &amp; Gardner intended to have paid the $100 so received to Knapp, on the note first mentioned, but the firm soon after becoming embarrassed, failed, and said note remained unpaid. The payment to Bissell &amp; Gardner was proved to have been made before the discharge of Bissell, the plaintiff in error, in bankruptcy, and the counsel for him therefore submitted a motion for a nonsuit. This motion was resisted by the counsel for the defendant in error, on the ground that the debt, for which the action was brought, was contracted in a <em>fiduciary capacity. </em>The court of common pleas so held, overruled the motion, and gave judgment for the defendant in error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b50-7\">Lane, Hill &amp; Bennet, for plaintiff in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b50-8\">Is the finding of the court, as to the issue on the plea of discharge in bankruptcy (which finding appears only in the bill of exceptions), sustained by the evidence? Did Bissell become indebted in a fiduciary capacity? We maintain that he did not. The evidence shows, that the $100 was paid to Bissell &amp; Gardner in part payment of the note given <em>to them </em>by Couchaine and Navarre. This $100 is all that even constructively came to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>hands of Bissell; the balance having been paid to Gardner, <em>after </em>the firm of Bissell &amp; Gardner was dissolved.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b51-5\">It does not appear that Bissell &amp; Gardner were to pay over the money within a specified time, or that they were to pay over tho identical money received from Couchaine on his note; but they were to \u201c apply that amount \u201d on tho note which they had signed as his sureties. The $100 undoubtedly went into the cash drawer of Bissell &amp; Gardner \u2014 was mixed up and used with their own funds; and, before the balance was paid by Couchaine, the firm of Bissell &amp; Gardner had become embarrassed, and failed, \u201chaving no means or effects with which to take up said first-mentioned note.\u201d Whatever remained, then, *of the estate of said firm, acquired in whole or in part by means of this $100, passed to, and vested in the assignee in bankruptcy, by operation of law. TJ. S. Bankrupt Law, sec. 3, passed August 19, 1841.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b51-6\">Such would be the case with money in the hands of a bankrupt executor or administrator, if it could not be \u201cspecifically distinguished and ascertained to belong to a testator or intestate, and not to the bankrupt.\u201d 3 Burr. 1369 ; Owen on Bankruptcy, 125, 126.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b51-7\">And where a bankrupt, who is factor for another, has sold the property of his principal, and received the price, before any notice to the vendee not to pay him, the principal has no other remedy but to prove for the amount upon the estate, unless the price remain in the hands of the factor, specifically distinguishable from the factor\u2019s own property. Owen on Bankruptcy, 126.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b51-8\">It was for the defendant in error to show that this money, or some part of it, did remain in the hands of the plaintiff in error, <em>specifically distinguishable </em>from tho plaintiff\u2019s own property, and, not having shown it, the certificate and discharge in bankruptcy should have boon held a bar. \u201e</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b51-9\">The principle which we are contending for, is again declared in Waller <em>v. </em>Edwards, 6 Litt. (Ky.) 384; where it is held, that a certificate and discharge in bankruptcy is no bar to the recovery of specific property held by the bankrupt as executor. <em>Aliter, </em>as to a recovery by distributees of money received by him in his fiduciary capacity, and for which he was liable before bankruptcy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b51-10\">But we suppose it will be contended on the other side, that Bissell had assumed <em>a trust </em>in favor of the owner of tho first-mentioned note; and although tho trust was purely voluntary, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>without any consideration, yet, as the beneficiary is not shown to have become a party to it, it was revocable, and being revoked, an implied trust results in favor of the party who originally created it, and that the non-payment of the money establishes the fact of indebtedness in a fiduciary capacity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"As0\">^Before this position can be made available to the defendant in error, some proof would seem to.be required that the trust was revoked before suit was brought; but there is no proof whatever on that subject.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b52-6\">Again, the construction of that clause in the bankrupt law, which is involved in this suit, has been authoritatively settled by the Supreme Court of the United States, in the case of Chapman <em>v. </em>Forsyth et al., 3 Howard, 202, showing that the indebtedness proven in this case is not a fiduciary debt within the meaning of the act. We extract so much of the opinion of the court as bears directly on the point under consideration :</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b52-7\">\u201c The second point is, whether a factor, who retains the money of his principal, is a fiduciary debtor within the meaning of the act?</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b52-8\">\u201c If the act embraced such a debt, it will be difficult to limit its application. It must include all debts arising from agencies; and, indeed, all cases where the law implies an obligation from the trust reposed in the debtor. Such a construction would have left but few debts on which the law could operate. In almost all the commercial transactions of the country, confidence is reposed in the punctuality and integrity of the debtor, and a violation of these is, in a commercial sense, a disregard of a trust. But this is not the relation spoken of in section 1 of the act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b52-9\">\u201cThe eases enumerated \u2014 \u2018the defalcation of a public officer,\u2019 \u2018executor,\u2019 \u2018administrator,\u2019 \u2018guardian,\u2019 or \u2018trustee\u2019 \u2014 are noteases of implied, but special trusts ; and t\u00a1he \u2018other fiduciary capacity\u2019 mentioned, must mean the same class of trusts. The act speaks of technical trusts. A factor is not, therefore within the act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b52-10\">\u201cThis view is sti-engthened, and indeed made conclusive, by the provisions of section 4, which declares that no \u2018 merchant, banker, factor, broker, underwriter, or marine insurer,\u2019 shall be entitled to a discharge \u2018who has not kept proper books of accounts.\u2019 In answer to the second question, then, we say, that a factor, who owes his principal money, ^\u2018received on the sale of his goods, is not a fiduciary debtor within the meaning of the act.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b53-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>Opon the strength of these authorities, we feel warranted in saying, that the ease at bar does not present a fiduciary debt within the meaning of the act of Congress, as found by the common pleas, and that its judgment ought to be reversed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b53-5\">E. Johnson, for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b53-6\"><em>Wood, </em>C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9q\">It is insisted by tho counsel for the defendant in error, that, as this case was submitted to the court instead of a jury to determine the issues of fact, if the judgment is reversed it must be because the court of common pleas gave too much or too little credit to the testimony introduced, and, in the opinion of this court, did not give the evidence its proper and legitimate influence, or weight, in its application to the facts of tho case. If it be sought to disturb this judgment on this ground, the position assumed can not for a moment bo entertained. The reason why not, is given in several reported cases, and need not, in this, bo again repeated from the bench. Utter <em>v. </em>Walker\u2019s Adm\u2019r, Wright, 46; Price <em>v. </em>Orange, Ib. 568; Reynolds <em>v. </em>Rogers, 5 Ohio, 169; Bank of Cincinnati <em>v. </em>Buckingham, 12 Ohio, 482.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">The record, however, shows no such case as belongs properly to that class of cases, in w'hich the principle alluded to has been maintained. The record presents all the testimony adduced upon the trial. There does not appear to have been any disagreement with court or counsel as to the proof; and, from the facts adduced, tho court hold, that the money received by the plaintiff in error, in truth, in discharge of his own note of indemnity, and which he agreed to apply on the note of the defendant in error to Kmapp, was received in a <em>fiduciary capacity, </em>and therefore not embraced within the terms, and could not bo disehai\u2019ged under the bankrupt law. Not for the erroneous finding of a fact, but for deducing tho legal result from *tho fact, that the debt was created in a fiduciary capacity, the error is assigned, and this court is called upon to revise the judgment of tho court below. What is a fiduciary capacity, is a question of law; and if the common pleas erred in applying the law to the facts, tho judgment is erroneous. It isi perhaps, only necessary to refer to the case of Chapman <em>v. </em>Forsyth ot al., 2 Howard, 202. The Supreme Court of the United States holds this language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-8\">\u201cThe second point is, whether a factor, who retains the money of his principal, is a <em>fiduciary debtor </em>within the meaning of the act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>\u201c If the act embraced such a debt, it will be difficult to limit Its application. It must include all debts arising from agencies ; and, indeed, all cases where the law implies an obligation from the trust reposed in the debtor. Such a construction would have loft but few debts on which the law could operate. In almost all the commercial transactions of the country, confidence is reposed in the punctuality and integrity of the debtor, and a violation of these is, in a commercial sense, a disregard of a trust. But this is not the relation spoken of in section 1 of the act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-5\">\u201c The cases enumerated \u2014 \u2018 the defalcation of a public officer,\u2019 \u2018 executor,\u2019 \u2018administrator,\u2019 \u2018guardian,\u2019 or \u2018trustee\u2019 \u2014 are not cases of <em>implied, </em>but special trusts ; and the \u2018 other fiduciary\u2019 capacity mentioned, must mean the same class of trusts. The act speaks of <em>technical trusts. A </em>factor is not, therefore, within the act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-6\">\u201c This view is strengthened, and indeed made conclusive, by the provisions of section 4, which declares that no merchant, banker, <em>factor, </em>broker, underwriter, or marine insurer shall be entitled to a discharge \u2018 who has not kept proper books of accounts.\u2019 In answer to the second question, then, we say, that a factor, who owes his principal money, received on the sale of his goods, is not a fiduciary debtor within the meaning of the act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AE3\">*If a factor is not within the act, when he refuses to pay to the principal the money in his hands for the sale of goods, why is the plaintiff in error, who received $100 on his own note of indemnity, but which he promised to pay in discharge of the obligation for which his was taken ? It was a debt created ; but not a <em>special, technical, or express trust. </em>If a trust, legally speaking, was created, a bill in equity, to compel an account and a decree for its execution, would be an appropriate remedy ; but we think the most careless and unskillful solicitor would hardly dream of that form of remedy in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
