Renick caused to be delivered $4,000 of the notes of the Circleville Bank to Robert Larimore, who is made a defendant, <em>to be exchanged for other funds, </em>and returned to the bank, in order to aid in the extension of its circulation \u2014 Renick, at the time of the delivery, being the president of the institution. It is averred that Larimore converted a part of this $4,000 to his own use, and that, in the autumn of 1841, Renick, the president, having become insolvent, transferred the claim of the bank against Larimore, as his own personal claim, to his brother, Felix W. Renick, who brought suit upon it in his brother\u2019s name, for his (Felix\u2019s) uso, and recovered a judgment thereon for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>the balance due, some $1,600 or $1,700. The object of this proceeding, on the equity side of the court, is, to enjoin Felix <em>W. </em>Renick from the collection of the judgment for his own use, in the name of his brother, and to compel Larimore to pay the ^amount over to the receivers of the bank, for distribution among its creditors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-6\">Seymour G-. Renick, in his answer, admits that he was the president of the bank, at the time stated in tho bill, but swears that the $4,000 advanced, was by way of loan to Larimore, and that, in tho advance of the money, he did not act in tho capacity of an agent for the bank ; that it was a personal matter between him and Larimore, who was to refund the amount to the respondent, to be used by him to pay a bill due, or soon to become duo, in the other bank of Circleville. That the $4,000 was drawn out of the bank on the cheek of this respondent, and charged to his account, which showed a balance in his favor, at the* time of the date of tho check, on the books of the bank, after the check should be paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-7\">Felix W. Renick, for his defense, sets up, in his answer, that he is informed, and believes, that said pretended bank never went legally into operation, and that the charter and privileges, thereby granted, ceased and wore of no effect, for want of compliance with the provisions of sections 3 and 4 of the act of incorporation. Both of the respondents admit the assigment of the claim, and state the consideration of such assignment was liabilities incurred by Felix <em>W. </em>for his brother; but Felix denies any knowledge of the claim of the bank to the amount of the judgment. Replications have been filed, and testimony taken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-8\">Only so much of the arguments of the counsel is published as relates to the question of the legal existence of the bank.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b272-9\">T. Ewing, for complainant;</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-10\">The answer of Felix W. Ronick sets up, by way of defense, \u201c that he is informed, and believes, that said pretended bank never went legally into operation ; that the charter and privileges ceased, determined, and were of no effect, for want of compliance with tho provisions of sections 3 and 4 of the \"charter of said bankand Seymour Gr. Ronick, *the president of this same bank, who \u201c purchased and took hold of it\u201d in February, 1841, testifies thus : \u201cI know tho Bank of Circleville, chartered in 1818, did not go into operation till the opening of 1840, nor attempt to do business uu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>til that time. That about that time said bank commenced issuing bills and notes. The governor of Ohio never did appoint any person to examine the books and vaults of said bank, to ascertain whether they had complied with the provisions of section 4 of the bank charter ; and the governor never did give public notice that said bank had complied with the provisions of section 4 of the charter of said bank.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b273-5\">This defense is set up under circumstances somewhat striking and remarkable. The president, and principal owner of the bank, who personally knew all about each secret defect in its organization, has taken a portion of its funds and handed them over to a brother, his private creditor; and he himself has become insolvent, so that no creditor of the bank can have any personal security against him; and now, when those creditors, who knew nothing of the defects in the organization of the bank, but who received its bills in good faith, do through the trustees appointed by law to represent their interests, bring suit to recover this money, and apply it to the satisfaction of their claims, this .defect in organization is disclosed, and set up as defense by this president and owner of the bank, and his creditor, who has through him received its funds, is or is not, as the law may determine, to save and indemnify them in the plunder and spoliation. It could not be the intent of the law to countenance such injustice; and I will endeavor to show, that, rightly understood, the law does not do it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b273-6\">That we may know where the burden of the controversy lies, it is important to understand exactly what is admitted, and what is denied by the pleadings; and to this point:</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b273-7\">The answer of Felix W. Renick admits the charter; it admits, by clear implication, that the complainants had possession of that charter, and acquired rights under it; but avers that the charter, and privileges thereby given, ceased, determined, and *wore of no effect-, for want of compliance with the provisions of sections 3 and 4 of the charter of said bank.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b273-8\">Now, compliance with the provisions of section 3 is abundantly proved. We show, by the statement of Edson B. Olds and P. N. White, that the 3,000 shares were subscribed, and fifteen per cent, thereon paid in, and in the vaults of the bank, in gold and silver; and they commenced the operations of the bank as far as permitted by section 3 of the act. This is not denied, but it is alleged that they went further, and issued bills without the money hav<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>ing been counted by commissioners appointed by the governor, and his consequent proclamation. Nay, further, the fact is, and so admitted, that they gave notice to the governor of their compliance, and asked for commissioners, who wore never appointed. The bank, therefore, had complied, as far as action on its part could go, with the provisions of sections 3 and 4, and it was the governor only, who had failed to comply with bis duty. This is upon the face of the matter. Whether there was anything of it whatever, in good faith, is extremely doubtful; but those who set up the bank, and those who managed it, and those who have received its funds from the owners and managers, can not be permitted to aver that acts, fair on their face, were fraudulent, to the end that they may extend and consummate the fraud.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b274-5\">Then, after the 3,000 shares were subscribed, and the \u00a1\u00a1&gt;23,000 in gold and silver were \u00a1laid in, these corporators had possession of the charter of the bank ; they are authorized, by the express terms of the charter, to \u201c forthwith commence the operation of said bank, so far as may be necessary, in the appointment of officers,\u201d etc.; but if they commence issuing bills, without having first complied with the provisions of section 4, they forfeit the charter. That compliance, so far as their action is concerned, consists in giving notice to the governor, an'd that notice was, in fact, given.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b274-6\">But the spirit and intent of the law was, that they should issue no bills until the governor made his proclamation. This is admitted. And it is further said, that the charter became #forfeited, if having done everything on their part, and the governor failing to do his duty, they should issue bills. This is not so clear; the statute does not say so in express terms. There is room for construction ; and it is proper that the matter should bo settled by a direct adjudication on the very point. If the charter, onco brought into being, has been avoided or annulled, that fact should be made known to the people by a public judicial proceeding, the <em>quo warranto </em>provided by our law, that the violators of the law might <em>not </em>make that violation an instrument of further injustice, and that the innocent and unsuspecting might be put upon their guard. The question of compliance or non-compliance with the requirements of the charter, in putting such bank into operation, can not bo inquired into collaterally, but only on a <em>scire facias </em>or <em>quo warranto, </em>where the state is a party. This I hold to bo clear &lt;911 principle and authority.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b275-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>On principle, it is a matter of no moment to the individual who is the debtor of the bank, or who has taken its property as a trespasser, or has got possession of its funds by fraud, whether, in going into operation, the bank did or did not comply strictly with all the requirements of its charter ; there is no natural justice or right in them to set up, as a defense against an action for the injury, any such defect, if it in fact exist. It is a question solely between the sovereign and the corporation, the creator and the creature ; and, as the corporation must, if at all, take possession of its franchise and go into its exercise, in the presence of the sovereign who gave it all its faculties and prescribed the conditions of its being, it must be presumed, from his acquiescence in their exorcise, without all conditions performed, that those omitted have been waived, and our laws have made most ample provisions for the trial and adjustment of questions such as this. Section 44 of the act of February 23, 1816, provides, \u201cthat the Supreme Court shall have full power, on a <em>quo </em>warranto, to hear and determine all questions touching the violation or forfeiture of charters;\u201d which provision, that is, the section containing it, is ;,f:expressly adopted in section 1 of the act incorporating this bank.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b275-5\">The law, therefore, has made ample provision for this examination and adjudication, on the direct issue at the suit of the state. It would seem, therefore, that the legislature intended that mode should be adopted; and public convenience and public justice require that it should; for the same law must apply to this as to all other banking institutions. The fact that it has, been purchased and taken hold of by men who chose to use it as an instru.ment of fraud, can not change the law with respect to it; at least it can not be allowed to change it to their advantage.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b275-6\">We have had some thirty banks in operation at once in this state, and for a period extending through many years. To all these were certain requirements, certain acts <em>in pais, </em>necessary to be performed before they were allowed to go into operation; but they went into operation, and there is no existing evidence that in all, or in any of these cases, all the prerequisite acts wore performed. Those who organized the banks died, and the stock descended to their children. Persons who knew nothing of its organization, but merely knew that the bank was openly and publicly in operation, under a charter, bought and paid their money for the stock; men who wanted money, borrowed it, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>gave their notes for its repayment; officers were chosen for these banks, and took charge of their funds. Now, in this state of things, where millions uj&gt;on millions are involved in the legality of those institutions, it is ascertained that some requisite of the act incorporating them has not been complied with. The debtors who have borrowed their money, determine not to pay; the presidents, who have taken hold of the banks, seize upon the funds in the vaults, and hand them over to their friends; and they all with one voice answer \u2014 the promissor to an action on his EOto, \u2014 the officers of the bank and their friends, to an action of trespass or assumpsit for the cash, or to trover, or oven to a bill in chancery for the assets. They answer either to the bank itself, or its assignees, who sue in behalf of its creditors, *\u201cYou can not sustain your action, for you had not commissioners enough by one who took your subscriptions; you lacked ten dollars of having paid in fifteen per cent, in gold and silver on your capital stock, before you issued your notes; you thought you had enough, but I happen to know that you counted French crowns at $1.10, when they were worth but $1.07. This is our plea in bar to your recovery, and for me, who am in chancery, this is my equitable defense.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b276-5\">The system of law must be very imperfect which would endure a defense like this; and ours is not chargeable with such imperfection. As I have already said, these questions are all between the sovereign and the corporation only, and that upon a direct issue. No one has a right to raise them collaterally. A corporation, when it brings suit, must, it is true, show that it is a corporation; and in England and New York, and perhaps some of the other states, it must show it upon the general issue pleaded; and where that is the rule, <em>nul tiel </em>corporation is a bad plea, as amounting to the general issue.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b276-6\">But tho <em>act of incorporation </em>and <em>user </em>under it, is all the proof necessary to sustain either issue. Bank of St. Charles <em>v. </em>Barnales, 1 Car. &amp; Payne, 569; Utica Insurance Co. <em>v. </em>Tillman, 1 Wend. 555 ; Utica Insurance Co. <em>v. </em>Badger et ah, 3 Wend. 296; see same volume, 301; Bank of Michigan <em>v. </em>Williams, 5 Wend. 478, S. P. 490; Williams <em>v. </em>Bank of Michigan, 7 Wend. 549.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b276-7\">And proof on the other side of a defect or omission in the steps necessary to carry the charter into effect, does not avail. It must be avoided, if at all, on a <em>scire facias </em>or <em>quo warranto </em>issued by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>order of the sovereign. Chester Glass Co. <em>v. </em>Dewey, 16 Mass. 101; Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Union Insurance Co., 5 Mass. 230; Centre Road Co. <em>v. </em>McConolly, 16 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 144; Hughs <em>v. </em>Bank of Somerset, 5 Litt. 45.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b277-5\">If it be contended, as I presume it will not, that this charter was void for non-user, I would answer, that no such defense is set up in the answer, and if it were, it could not prevail. The *act of incorporation contemplates a <em>judgment </em>to declare such forfeiture before it is effectual. Section 5, \u201cshall not be adjudged to be forfeited for <em>non-user,\u201d </em>etc. See also the mode of adjudication provided by the act of February 23, 1816, section 44, adopted in this'charter; and see, to this point,. 1 Bl. Com. 485; 2 Kent\u2019s Com. 51, sec. 33; Trevitt <em>v. </em>Taylor, 9 Cr. 51; Dartmouth College <em>v. </em>Woodward, 4 Wheat. 663 ; Society, etc. <em>v. </em>New Haven, 8 Wheat. 483; Rex <em>v. </em>Armory, 2 Tenn. 515, 528; 1 Gill &amp; Johns. 1; 2 Blackf. 367; 8 Ohio, 552; Shee <em>v. </em>Bloon, 5 Johns. Ch. 377.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b277-6\">And wo contend, on our part, that if these principles of law do not enable us to sustain our action, as against third persons wholly unconnected with the corporation, the defendant, Seymour G. Renick, is estopped from denying that it was a corporation. In other words, a court of equity will not suffer him to make such defense against his own solemn and public acts, as president of such bank, and that Felix W. Renick, holding through and under him, in privity with him, is also estopped.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b277-7\">And we claim also, that the proceedings in chancery under which the receivers derived title, and the verdict of the jury, in the case involving the very question of corporation or not, is equivalent to a judgment <em>in rem, </em>and concludes the question.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b277-8\">S. Brush and N. H. Swayne, for Felix W. Renick, one of the defendants:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b277-9\">.The defendant, Felix W. Renick, relies upon two grounds of defense :</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b277-10\">I. That there never was such a corporation in existence as is assumed by the complainant\u2019s bill.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b277-11\">II. If there Were such a corporation, that it had no right, legal or equitable, to the fund in controversy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b277-12\">1. As to the first proposition:</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b277-13\">The answer makes the issue of <em>nul tiel </em>corporation. The burden of proof rests upon the complainants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9V6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>*The legal provisions, and the facts upon which this question arises, are as follows ;</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b278-5\">On January 14, 1818, th\u00bb legislature passed \u201can act to incorporate the stockholders of the Bank of Circleville.\u201d 16 Ohio L. 70. It provides:</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b278-6\">\u201cSec. 2. Be it farther enacted, that the capital stock of said bank shall consist of 1300,000 (money of the United States), to be divided into six thousand shares, of fifty dollars each, and the subscriptions toward constituting said bank shall be opened at Circleville, and at such other places, and at such other time or times as the commissioners may direct, under the superintendence of Henry Nevill, John Ely, John Black, Daniel Eudwig, David Kin-near, Peter Apple, John Burr, Daniel Turney, Jacob Shoemaker, Samuel Lybrand, Jonathan Renick, and Joseph Hedges, who are <em>hereby </em>constituted and appointed commissioners; <em>and they, or a majority of them, </em>are hereby authorized and empowered to keep open the said subscriptions until three thousand shares of the aforesaid bank are subscribed for. and until directors are duly elected and qualified.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b278-7\">\u201c Sec. 3. Be it further enacted, That so soon as three thousand shares of said bank are subscribed for, and fifteen per centum paid on each share, said commissioners shall immediately give four weeks\u2019 notice of the timo and place of electing directors,yn the manner provided for giving notice of the payment of installments by section 8 of the act to incorporate certain banks therein named, and to extend the charters of existing incorporated banks; and the persons who shall then be chosen shall forthwith commence the operation of said bank, <em>so far as may he necessary in the appointment of the other officers of the hank, </em>and to direct such further installment or installments to be paid, as the interest and advancement of the bank may require; and all payments on shares, previous to said bank going into full operation, shall be made the one-half in gold or silver, and the other half in bills of the *Bank of the United States or some of its branches, or in specie, at the option of the stockholders.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b278-8\">\u201c Sec. 4. Be it further enacted, that so soon as fifteen per centum on three thousand shares of the capital stock of said bank is actually paid in, it shall be the duty of the directors to give notice to the governor of the state that <em>the said bank is ready to commence full operations; </em>and the governor, on the receipt of such no-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>lice, shall forthwith appoint some suitable person, not being a stockholder in said bank, to examine its books and vaults; and if, on examination, it shall appear to the satisfaction of the governor that the provisions of the third section of this act have been complied with, it <em>shall be the duty of the governor to give public notice that said Bank of Circleville has complied with the provisions of this section, and is thereby authorized to go into operation, and it is hereby authorized accordingly; </em>but in case said bank shall commence issuing bills or notes without first having complied with the provisions of this section, the charter hereby granted, and tho privileges given, shall cease, determine, and be of no effect, and the stockholders of said bank shall be liable for the debts contracted, as though this act bad never been passed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b279-5\">\u201c Sec. 5. And be it further enacted, that this act of incorporation, and the charter hereby granted to the Bank of Circleville, shall not be adjudged to be forfeited for any non-user whatsoever, at any time before January 1, 1820.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b279-6\">On August 16, 1839, Lybrand, Renick, Barr, and Shoemaker (four of the commissioners named in the act), opened books at Circleville, for the subscription of stock. Lybrand acted as chairman, and E. B. Olds as secretary. Stock was subscribed to the amount of-. Subsequently, Olds gave up the subscription book to George House, who, with others, made further subscriptions, to a large amount, \u201c not under the direction of the commissioners.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b279-9\">On April 6, 1840, E. B. Olds and P. N. White examined the books and vault of the bank, and found that three *thousand shares of stock had been subscribed, and that there was in the vault of the bank $23,000 in gold and silver. Olds and White, at the time, were not stockholders.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b279-10\">No person was appointed by the govornor to examine the books and vault of the bank; and no public notice was given by him according to the provisions of the fourth section of the charter.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b279-11\">We hold that these proceedings, not being in conformity to the charter, are a nullity, and that the omission stated is fatal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b279-12\">1. The charter names <em>twelve commissioners, </em>and \u201c they, or a majority of them,\u201d were required to act. A smaller number could do nothing. They were clothed with no power or authority whatsoever. The legislature confided in the judgment and integrity oi the majority, and was specific in requiring the action of at least <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>that number. If the law had not expressly authorized a smaller number than the whole to perform the duties designated, it would have been necessary that all should have been present and acting, though the concurrence of a majority in what was dono would have been sufficient. See Young <em>v. </em>Buckingham et al., 5 Ohio, 489, and the authorities there cited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b280-5\">The four commissioners who opened the books, having no authority to act, their action was wholly void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b280-6\">\u201c Where an act, prescribed by law, is done by persons who have no authority to do\u00bbit, it is not voidable, but void.\u201d See 10 Bac. Ab. (Amer. cd.) 374 ; 3 Inst. 231.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b280-7\">The subscription of stock under such circumstances \u2014 as respects the charter and the existence of a corporation under it\u2014 is as if it had not been made.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b280-8\">2. It appears by the certificate of Olds and White (which it is agreed shall go in evidence), that $23,000 were in the vault, but it does not appear that a dollar was, or was pretended to have been paid in on the stock subscribed. Indeed, it seems to be admitted, in the argument of the complainants\u2019 ^counsel, that the whole proceeding was colorable merely, and fraudulent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b280-9\">3. The counting of the specie of Olds and White was unauthorized and of no effect.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b280-10\">It is not pretented that either of them had any authority from the governor, or that they reported to him. No one else, under the charter, could give such authority. The acts of these persons can have no more effect than if they had been done by any other mere strangers for their amusement or the gratification of an idle curiosty.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b280-11\">4. Until public notice was given by the governor, the bank could not go into ojieration, nor do any act beyond the initiatory steps necessary to prepare it for corporate existence. Section 4 of the act provided, that upon a given state of facts, it should be \u201cthe duty of the governor to give public) notice that the Bank of Ciroleville has complied with the provisions of this section, .and is therebt authorized to go into operation, <em>and it is </em>hereby <em>\u25a0authorized </em>aooordinoly.\u201d We think it clear, that until this notice was given, the bank could have no <em>authority </em>whatsoever to go into operation. The notice was necessary to put life into it and give it a legal existence. Without the notice, it could be, at most, but \u25a0in an inchoate and embryo state. If it went into operation with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>out such notice being given, its conduct was not <em>under </em>the law, but <em>against </em>the law. It can claim no rights under enactments which it has violated and set at defiance. It has fulfilled none of the terms which its creator prescribed as conditions inevitably necessary to its existence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b281-5\">The clause in regard to issuing notes does not militate against this view of the subject. The legislature seems to have had two things distinctly in view, and made two distinct provisions accordingly :</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b281-6\">1. That the corporation could not exist at all, until certain conditions precedent were fulfilled.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b281-7\">2. If bank notes were issued before those conditions were complied with, that it never should exist.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b281-8\">*In such case the charter became <em>ipso facto </em>\u2014 wholly and forever void. A forfeiture at once ensued as the penalty of the transgression. Whatever may be thought of the other points relied upon, we think the giving of notice by the governor was indispensable to the existence of the corporation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b281-9\">There is a wide'distinction between the class of cases where a title is to vest upon the performance of a condition precedent, and those where an existing title is to be divested, upon a failure to perform a subsequent condition. <em>f</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b281-10\">This distinction runs through the law of corporations, as well as that of contracts and devises.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b281-11\">In respect of both the latter, the condition precedent must be performed, or the title can not vest.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AR_\">The important question which first demands the consideration of the court is one exclusively of fact, and that is, whether the $4,000 advanced to Larimore by Seymour G. Renick, in May, 1841, was <em>in behalf of the bank, </em>and <em>for its benefit, or a loan of Ms own </em>funds, <em>on Ms oion private or individual account. </em>If the money was advanced for the bank, Seymour G. Renick had no right to. mold the transaction into one of a private nature of <em>Ms own; </em>and as the claim was a mere chose in action, not negotiable, the bank, by its receivers, may pursue it into the hands of a <em>bona fide assignee without notice. </em>If collected by the assignee, the money should be refunded; if not, its collection should be enjoined, and Larimore decreed to pay directly to the complainants, for the benefit of the institution, that the avails of the judgment may <em>pro tanto </em>discharge the liabilities of the institution.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">The allegations of the bill, and the answer of Seymour G. Renick, are directly at issue on the main point, and have, consequently, thrown upon us the necessity of a careful examination of the depositions on file. From them, much curious history has been elicited as to the manner in which this slumbering corporation was revived, but which is irrelevant to the present inquiry. It is certain, however, that Seymour G. Renick took possession of the hank, in February, 1841, as <em>president, owner of a majority of the stock, </em>and, therefore, <em>the controlling director. </em>He was looked upon as the financier of the institution, and was, in fact, the bank itself, as is unequivocally established by the proofs in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">His first transaction with Larimore, of which we have any evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>denee, was on May 17, 1841. He then checked on *the bank, in favor of Larimore, for $2,500. This chock was charged to Renick, and the money, in the bills of the bank, paid to Larimore, to exchange for currency, and the currency to bo delivered to the bank. Seven days afterward, Larimore sent to the bank $2,750, in bills of other banks. This amount was credited to Eeniek. The depositions of McCulloch and Doney prove that, when this $2,750 was transmitted to the bank, it was accompanied by a letter from Seymour G-. Renick, inclosing his check for $4,000. The letter was dated the 22d of May, and the chock, inclosed in it, the 17th of June, and not charged to him on the books of the bank until that date, though paid, as the cashier testifies he believes, some time before. The cashier and Doney both swear, they understood this money was to be exchanged <em>for the benefit of the bank. </em>This evidence is corroborated by the fact, that Larimore afterward paid to the bank $2,000 in Chillicothe paper, for' which he had exchanged a like amount of this $4,000 of the paper of the Bank of Circleville. It is true, in the settlement between Rcnick and the bank, in December, 1841, he gave his note for the money advanced <em>to, </em>and unpaid <em>by </em>Larimore. But the bank was, at this time, insolvent, and <em>Benick had previously become so; </em>and counsel very properly infer, that he then deemed it more convenient to his condition, that <em>Larimore </em>should stand as his creditor than the <em>bank : </em>the former was able to pay \u2014 the latter could not. The depositions of both Seymour Gf. Renick and Larimore have been taken, but they are as directly in conflict as the bill and the answer; but laying Larimore\u2019s deposition aside, as <em>incompetent from interest, </em>it does not appear that any note or memorandum was taken by Renick for the money advanced to Larimore. On the contrary, it is sufficiently evident there was not. This fact is only to be accounted for on the ground that the advance was <em>not a loan, </em>but that the transaction was exclusively for the interest of the bank, and so considered at the time. No man lends a large sum of money, for months, preserving no written evidence of the debt, or, at least, id is not the ordinal^ mode in which a ^banker transacts his business. On the other hand, where large sums are to bo transmitted, or paper exchanged, for the benefit of another exclusively, nothing is more common; and we are therefore led irresistibly to the belief, from all the above facts, that this advance was <em>not a loan, </em>as set up in the answer. We arrive at this conolu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>sion, even regarding the answer as strictly responsive to the bill, because, to the substantial facts, there is far more testimony than the rule in equity requires, in such cases, to establish it.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Felix W. Reniek appears, however, to be <em>sorely troubled, </em>for the reason, that this bank had not been legally organized. IIo defends on the ground that a majority of the commissionei\u2019s named in the charter did not attend to open the books for subscription to the capital stock. The evidence is, <em>that four oat </em>of the <em>seven in esse, </em>were present. He claims again, in substance, that the charter was forfeited. In the absence of express provision, the forfeiture of the charter of a corporation can only be established by a judicial action, can not be collaterally inquired into. He defends, also, upon the ground, that no commissioner was appointed by the governor, as the charter required, to examine into the condition of the bank, count the funds in its vaults and report thereon to the governor, who was to issue his proclaimation, giving notice that the law was complied with, and without this, contends the bank had no legal existence. The evidence is, the amount of capital stock required by law, was subscribed; the per centum called for thereon by the charter, before commencing business, was in the vault of the bank, <em>in silver and gold, </em>and application made for the 'appointment of a commissioner, which appears to have been disregarded. The bank then had done all on its part, either <em>truly </em>or <em>falsely </em>; it had performed every obligation demanded and necessary to its complete organization. That all this was not done in good faith, we are not judicially informed. Under such circumstances, we are by no means prepared to say \u2014 \u25a0 certainly not as against those who admit its existence by the receipt of its funds and in transacting business with it as a corporation \u2014 *that they can deny it has acquired rights, as such, and defeat its <em>honest claims, </em>for any act of omission of duty by the executive, if it be such.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">The cases referred to, as authorities, by this defendant\u2019s counsel, do not seem to us to apply. They are cases where the plea of <em>nul tiel </em>corporation has been sustained on the ground either of some condition <em>precedent </em>to the organization, to be performed <em>by the corporation </em>and omitted to be done, or where a forfeiture has been established by judicial sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">Decree for complainants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
