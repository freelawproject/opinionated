The first was a bill in chancery, to compel the administrator to convey certain bank stock, standing in their names. The second was a petition by the administrator *of Christian King to sell lands. Both depended upon-the construction and effect of a clause in William King\u2019s will, which reads as follows;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-5\">\u201c If it so please God, that at the time of my decease, I should die without any lawful heir or heirs, born in wedlock, in such case I will and bequeath all the property I may be possessed of before my decease, to my brother Christian, without any reservation, to be used by him while he lives ; and, if it so please God, that, at the time of brother Christian\u2019s decease, he should be possessed of a legal heir or heirs, born in wedlock, I then will and bequeath all and every kind of property which might be considered mine, in my lifetime, and of which the said Christian may be seized at the time of his decease, to such heir or heirs, and no other. But should I myself die, without lawful heirs, and also my brother Christian die without heirs born lawfully, as above stated, I then will what may be considered my share, after my brother\u2019s decease, and not before, to my two'sisters\u2019 children, Ish and Cassell, in equal dividends or shares, and not to be used by any of them until they come to the age allowed by law.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-6\">The testator died, possessed of both real and personal property; Christian King survived the testator, and died, leaving heirs of his body. The sister of the testator had children living, both at the death of the testator and at the death of Christian King.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-7\">The court, in substance decreed, in the one case, that Christian King, under the will, took the personal property absolutely to himself; and in the other, that he took a fee in the <em>land; </em>and hence that both the personal and real property devised by the will, was subject to the payment of the debts of Christian King. In this respect, it is claimed, the court <em>erred; </em>and to reverse those decrees these bills of review are brought.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b471-8\">T.

The control over intention, by the rules of law, applies not to the construction of words,. but the nature of the estate. A testator may use such words as he may please to convey his intention; and such intention, if clearly manifested, will be carried into effect, if it be not unlawful, and does not create an estate forbidden by law. A testator has the perfect right to choose his own language, but not to create an estate which the law does not permit. He would have no right to create a perpetuity, or in any sense to break down or violate the fixed principles of property.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">If, then, in the case under consideration, it was the intention of the testator to give a life estate only to Christian King, with a remainder in fee to his children, if any, at the time of his death, and a contingent remainder over to his two sisters\u2019 children, Ish and Cassel, it would be perfectly legal, for the estates created are lawful; and the only question would be, has he employed words which manifest an intention ?</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">It is perfectly legal to give a life estate to one, and remainder over in fee to another. If, in the present instance, the testator had devised a life estate to Christian King, with a remainder over to a stranger, and a contingent remainder over, there would have been no doubt about the will at all; the estates they created would have all been legal, and been carried into effect. The whole doubt and confusion in this case grows out of the employment of the words \u201cheir or heirs.\u201d If the word \u201cchildren\u201d had been used, there would have been no doubt; but it is contended that the word \u201c heirs \u201d has a fixed legal ^meaning, and is always a word of limitation and not purchase, and hence would bring the estate devised to Christian King and his heirs within the rule in Shelley\u2019s case, and vest the entire fee in Christian. .The rule in Shelley\u2019s case is not a rule of construction, but a law of property. It is not designed to give a meaning to words, but to fix the nature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>and quantity of an estate. If tbe estate for life, created in the devisee or donee, is limited precisely as it would descend at law, the rule in Shelley\u2019s case vests the entire fee in the first devisee or donee. The testator may use the word \u201c heir,\u201d and take it without its usual legal sense, if he employ words respecting it to show that he did not use it in its ordin ary legal sense, or if the plain intention manifested in the will shows that it was not employed in its usual legal sense. A mere presumed intention will not control its legal signification and operation; but with words of explanation, showing the manifest intent of the testator, it can be made a word of purchase. If, where the word \u201c heir \u201d is used, there be superadded words of limitation, establishing \u00e1 new succession, the first donee or devisee would take but a life estate. The expressed intent, then, of the testator, will affix the meaning to the word \u201cheir \u201d \u2014 it is said a mere implication will not.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">What, then, was the intention in this case ? To ascertain this we must look to the words and motives of the devisee. We must not start out with the presumption that it was the design of the testator to create an estate tail, and construe the words of the will to effect that object. That was only a family law in England, designed to build up families, cheat creditors, and prevent forfeitures; and is in nowise consistent with the spirit and genius of our own government and laws, or the habits and feelings of our people. Our statute forbids it, and such, I believe, is the case in all, or very nearly all the states in this Union. Nor is there with us any disposition to strain a point to bring a case within the operation of the rule in Shelley\u2019s case \u2014 a rulo which had its origin in feudal tenure, and was first adopted to secure to the lords the profits and perquisites ^incident to inheritances; and, as an after-thought, the additional reason that it was necessary to prevent an abeyance of the fee. It is at best a mere artificial technicality; and just in proportion as it lacks reason, it appears to have won upon the affections of the profession. In its simplicity it possesses some sense, and to that extent we have adopted it as a rule of property in Ohio. But it is the high and imperative duty of this court to conform its judicial decisions, where we attempt to walk by the light of precedent from another country, to the nature of our own government and free institutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">Throwing aside, then, all presumptions in favor of estates tail, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>and all peculiar affection for the rule in Shelley\u2019s ease, and attempting to arrive at the intention of the testator from the language employed and the nature of the devises contained in the will, what must we say was the intention of the testator ?</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">1. \u201cI will and bequeath all the property I may be possessed of before my decease, to my brother Christian, to be used by him while he lives.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">2. \u201c And if it so please God that, at the time of brother Christian\u2019s decease, he should be possessed of legal heir or heirs, born in lawful wedlock, I then will and bequeath all and every kind of property which might be considered mine in my lifetime, and of which the said Christian may be seized at the time of his decease, to such heir or heirs, and no other.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">3. \u201c But should I myself die without lawful heirs, and also my brother Christian die without heirs born lawfully, as above stated, I then will what may be considered my brother\u2019s share at my decease, and not before, to my two Risters\u2019 children, Ish and Cassel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">Now, here is an express estate for life, by the words of the will, to Christian, and nothing more, and then to his heir or heirs; and if none at the time at the time of Christian\u2019s death, to the children of Ish and Cassel. The limitation of the remainder over to the children of Ish and Cassel is not to take place on the indefinite failure of issue of Christian King, but must vest at the instant of Christian\u2019s death, or never. Now, had the *testator intended to devise all his property to Christian King and his heirs, why limit over a contingent remainder to the childx'en of Ish and Cassel? If he had intended to devise his whole estate in the first instance to Christian, why do so vain a thing as to limit a contingent remainder over to the children of Ish and Cassel? If he had intended to use the words \u201cheir or heirs \u201d as words of limitation, he knew that the whole estate was vested at once in Chxdstian, and, why, therefore, create the contingent remainder over ? But, it may be said, he was ignorant of the rules of law. The presumption is that he knew the law, and that he employed the wox-ds \u201c heir or heirs \u201d in such sense as would permit the remainder to vest on the happening of the specified contingency. To give effect, then, to each devise in this will \u2014 the express life estate to Christian, and the contingent remainder to the children of Ish and Cassel \u2014 the words \u201c heir or heirs\u201d must be read, \u201cchild or children.\u201d It has already been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>stated that the words \u201cheir or heirs \u201d may be treated as <em>designatio personm, </em>or as \u201c child or children,\u201d if the manifest intent of the testator requires it. But it is said that Christian is vested by the will with the power of disposing of the property. This is not so said in the will. But it is expressly said it is to bo used by him while he lives. But it is contended the words \u201cseized at his death\u201d show that it was not contemplated by William that Christian should have all the property at his death which had been devised to him, and hence that it was contemplated that he might dispose of it. This form of expression may be accounted for in a different way. It might well be supposed by William, that the personalty could be lost in other ways than by disposition. To hold that the words \u201c seized at his death\u201d carried the implied power of disposition, would defeat other manifest intents; where, to hold that it merely was employed in reference to destruction or loss, would be consistent with, and support every intent expressed in the will. That construction, then, should be employed which is most consistent with the main expressed intention. But the,words used, \u201cfor life,\u201d are as strong to express an intention as *the words \u201c seized at the death.\u201d The intention, from the words employed and the nature of the devises clearly, was to give Christian an estate for life, and nothing more \u2014 remainder in fee to his children, and contingent remainder over. This withdraws the cas\u00e9 wholly from the rule in Shelley\u2019s case, for the estates created are such as the law recognizes.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Hence, as to the realty, Christian took a life estate only, and his children a remainder in fee, as purchasers. So of the personalty, the intent was the same; and remainder over after a life estate in personalty may be limited by devise. Hence in this also the children of Christian King take the remainder as purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">To adopt an opposite construction would be to conclude that the testator intended that the property devised should go to pay the debts of Christian. This, in view of the words of the will and the devises, would be doing violence to the whole will. It is said creditors may be wronged if the children of Christian King take this property. We can not perceive how. We know of no equity which should enable them to seize upon the bounty of a testator, and apply it to the payment of. the debts of another person., It is not the property of the debtor; and the equities of the devisees are equally strong.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>We have do doubt that there was error in the decrees heretofore pronounced, and therefore reverse them.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">A vast multitude of books and authorities have been cited in this case. I have not cited them expressly in my opinion. I am content to extract the essence, and do not choose to become a compiler. Decree reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
