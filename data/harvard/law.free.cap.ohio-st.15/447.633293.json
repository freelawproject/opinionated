D. 1826.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-22\">\u201cAnd now, at this day, came the complainant, by his solicitor, and this cause came on for final hearing, upon the decree <em>pro confesso </em>aforesaid, and the bill and exhibits filed in this cause, and upon the report of James A. Scranton, the special master commissioner in chancery, to whom, the same was referred; and the said master having reported to this court, in pursuance of their said order, that there was due complainant from the defendants the sum of $1,844.17, for his disbursements, advances, and services; the account having been received and inspected, the said report is accepted and confirmed by the said court, and find the said sum of $1,844.17 to be due from the defendants to the complainant. And thereupon the court do order, adjudge, and decree that the complainant do recover of the said defendants the said sum of $1,844.17, and his costs by him in this behalf expended. It is further ordered, adjudged, and decreed that this decree shall, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>from the time of its being pronounced, have the force, operation, and effect of a judgment at law, and shall be a lien upon all the town lots of the defendants within said county, and also on all other real estate of the said defendants, within said county of San-dusky, as security for the satisfaction of said decree. And it is further ordered, adjudged, and decreed, that if the above sum of \u00a71,844 17 be not paid within thirty days from the date of this decree, upon a precipe being filed with the clerk of this court, by the complainant or his solicitor, execution shall issue against *the goods, chattels, lands, and tenements of the defendants, which shall be taken in execution, and sold in like manner as though said execution issued on a judgment rendered in a court of law. And all further proceedings in this cause to be continued until next term.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-4\">No further action of the court was ever had in the case; but on August 8, A. D. 1826, an execution was issued on this decree; on the twelfth it was levied on the lot in question, and on September 25, A. d. 1826, it was sold by the sheriff, and bid off by said Hawkins, and the defendants in this suit hold whatever passed at said sale.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b381-5\">Bartlett &amp; Watson, for plaintiff in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b381-6\">It is insisted by the plaintiff, that the legal title to the land in controversy remains unaffected by the proceedings in chancery:</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b381-7\">1. Because jurisdiction was not conferred upon the court, by the publication of notice, over the <em>subject matter </em>upon which the decree is based.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b381-8\">All demands of a <em>personal </em>character attach themselves to the person of the party, and follow him wherever he goes; and their enforcement depends upon the laws of the country where the party is found.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b381-9\">At common law, bills, to enforce the specific execution of contracts for the conveyance of land, could only be prosecuted where the party could be personally served with process. Massie <em>v. </em>Watts, 2 U. S. Cond. 332; Story\u2019s Eq. Pl. 482.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b381-10\">Hence, it is by virtue of statutory provisions that a court has jurisdiction over a thing, when the <em>person </em>can not be reached, and the party must bring his case within its provisions. Raburn <em>it. </em>Shortridge, 2 Blackf. 109.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b381-11\">Courts, when proceeding under notice by publication, are courts of special and limited jurisdiction, and can not extend their decree beyond the provisions of the statute, even when *the</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b382-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>proceeding is strictly <em>in rem. </em>Hollingsworth <em>v. </em>Barbour et al., <em>4 </em>Pet. 466 ; Duval <em>v. </em>Duval, 13 Mass. 263.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b382-5\">2. The court of chancery had no jurisdiction of the case, for the reason that the <em>prescribed </em>publication was not made. The law required that the notice should \u201cset forth the pendency of such petition, and the substance of the prayer thereof.\u201d The proof was, that the order of the court had been published. This, certainly, was not a substantial compliance with the law ; without which the court had not jurisdiction. Dunning <em>v. </em>Corwin, 11 Wend. 647; Thatcher <em>v. </em>Powell, 6 Wheat. <em>119; </em>Jackson <em>v. </em>Esty, 7 Wend. 148.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b382-7\">The principle for which we are contending is also recognized and enforced in the following cases: Warner <em>v. </em>Webster, 13 Ohio, 506 ; Humphrey <em>v. </em>Wood, Wright, 566 ; Bennett\u2019s Lessee <em>v. </em>Williams, 5 Ohio Cond. 293 ; Campbell <em>v. </em>Cowden et al., Wright, 484; Taylor <em>v. </em>Kelson, 1 Blackf. 215 ; Lessee of Adams <em>v. </em>Jeffries, 12 Ohio, 271; 6 Har. &amp; Johns. 130; 6 Wheat. 119; 11 Wend. 647 ; 12 Wend. 9.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b382-9\">3. The proceedings are void for want of a pertinent description of the land. Lessee of Massie\u2019s Heirs <em>v. </em>Long, 2 Ohio, 287; Treon\u2019s Lessee <em>v. </em>Emerick, 6 Ohio, 391; Pelton <em>v. </em>Plainer, 13 Ohio, 219.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b382-10\">4. If jurisdiction was acquired for any purpose, it was such only as authorized a proceeding.ire rare, and the court transcended its authority in making a <em>personal </em>decree. It acquired jurisdiction only for a specific purpose; beyond that it had no power. Story on Con. of Laws, 461; Bates <em>v. </em>Delavan, 5 Paige, 299 ; Bissell <em>v. </em>Briggs, 5 Mass. 468 ; Kibby <em>v. </em>Kibby, Kirby, 119; Mitchell\u2019s Lessee <em>v. </em>Eyster, 7 Ohio, 384.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b382-11\">The statute giving the court of chancery power over land within the county, did not attempt to confer upon it a jurisdiction ire <em>personam </em>against non-residents; neither had the Hegislature power to confer upon the courts such an act of sovereignty. 3 Phil. Ev.

Ch. 1.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b382-12\">If the defendant is not served with process within the jurisdiction of the court, and does not appear to the suit, a valid personal judgment or decree can not be taken against him.

The statute of 1824 (22 Ohio Stat. 75) was in force at the time of these proceedings. Section 12 provides:</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b383-9\">\u201c That in all cases properly cognizable in a court of equity, when either the title to or boundaries of land may come in question, or when a suit in chancery becomes necessary in order to obtain the rescission of a contract for the conveyance of land, or to compel a specific execution of such contract, and the defendant or defendants against whom a decree is sought is or are not resident within the state, it shall be competent *for the complainant to file his or her petition in the proper court of the county in which such lands may be situate, and such court is hereby authorized to take cognizance thereof, and direct either personal notice or notice by publication, of its pendency, to bo given as in this act provided, and on proof of such notice having been given, to proceed as in other cases.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b383-10\">\u201c Sec. 7. That if any person shall file a petition in chancery against any defendant residing within this state, in which it shall be proper or necessary to join any other defendant residing out of the state, whether in the United States or any other country, the complainant may cause personal service to be made on such absent defendant by a written notice, setting forth the pendency of such petition, and the substance of the prayer thereof, or he shall cause publication to be made of such notice for nine weeks successively, in some newspaper printed in this state, and having general circulation. in the county where such suit shall be pending, and on due proof that such notice has been given, such defendant shall bo considered in court, and be thereupon proceeded against in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>same manner as if he had been regularly served with a subpena in the cause.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b384-5\">The notice actually published is as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b384-6\">\u201cThe State of Ohio, Sandusky Common Pleas, May term, A. d. 1825. Thomas L. Hawkins <em>v. </em>William T. Barry, Thomas E. Boswell, and William Whitimore. This day came the complainant, by Orris-Parrish, his solicitor, and filed the bill, and it appearing to the satisfaction of the court, the defendants are not residents of this state, but reside in the States of Kentucky and Massachusetts, it is therefore ordered that notice of the pendency of this suit be published in the \u2018Western Statesman,\u2019 a newspaper printed in the town of Columbus, Ohio, for the term of nine weeks successively, befoi\u2019e the next term of this court, that unless said defendants appear at the October term of this court, and plead, answer, and demur to said bill, that the matters and things therein set *forth and charged, will be taken as confessed, and a decree rendered against them accordingly. A true copy. James A. Scranton, clerk.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9qK\">It is assumed by the plaintiff, that the court only acquires jurisdiction by the publication of a notice which specifies \u201c the pendency of the petition and the substance of the prayer thereof,\u201d and that these proceedings are void because there was no sufficient compliance with the last condition. The defendants will attempt to show, that the validity of the sale does not depend upon such a strict and literal fulfillment of these requirements.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b384-7\">The defendants do not claim that a judgment or decree is binding upon a party who has had no day in court, or that a judgment is good without some equivalent to the service of process. For present purposes, they do not deny that a court of special jurisdiction, or a court of general jurisdiction, while exercising special powers, must show the condition upon whose existence its jurisdiction depends ; but they claim, that the proceedings of courts of general jurisdiction, <em>while exercising their ordinary </em>functions, shall be supported by every reasonable intendment, and they claim the benefit of the most favorable presumptions arising from the naturo of chancery tribunals to sustain the force of their acts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b384-8\">1. It is submitted, that the fair construction of section 12 requires no other notice than a notice of pendency. The notice of section 7 must set forth the pendency of the suit and the substance of the prayer. Section 12 carefully omits the requirement of the substance of the prayer. Its language is, \u201c a notice, by publica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>tion, of its pendency, to be given as in this act is provided ; and, on proof of such notice having been given, to proceed as in other cases.\u201d Not such a notice as section 7 requires, but \u201c notice of its pendency.\u201d The phrase, \u201cto be given,\u201d relates, not to the form of the notice, but to the communication of it to the party, viz: to the manner of publication; that is, \u201cnotice\u201d \u201cof the pendency of the suit \u201d \u201c is to be given\u201d \u201c for nine weeks *successively in some newspaper,\u201d etc., and the words \u201c such notice,\u201d in the last clause, by the common rules of interpretation, relate to the last antecedent \u2014 not such notice as section 7 demands, but such a notice as is designated in the same sentence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b385-5\">2. Admitting, for the sake of argument, that the notice must contain the substance of the prayer, is not this requisition satisfied when it actually contains the demand of a decree ? Is it not the whole substance of the bill, to obtain an answer or a decree? If it be held that section 12 require the substance of the prayer, we again recur with confidence to the practice of the day, which sufficiently manifests that courts and partitioners regarded such a notice a sufficient compliance with its demands.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b385-6\">3. But who can doubt that actual jurisdiction lawfully attached, and has been rightfully exercised between the parties to this record. Conceding that the case was regulated by section 12, \u201c it was competent for the complainant to file his petition in the. proper courts where the lands are situate, and such court is hereby authorized to take cognizance thereof, and direct notice.\u201d Now, it may well be contended, that complete jurisdiction is conferred by the simple words, \u201c take cognizance,\u201d when a bill is filed in the county where the land lies, which is to be affected by the decree, and that all after-proceedings can bo erroneous only. But our argument has stronger cogency; for the authority to take cognizance and direct notice confers expressly the jurisdiction to make the order, and involved the right of adjudicating whether such order has been complied with, so that complete jurisdiction over those parties, to <em>some </em>purposes, has become vested in the court, which, once required, enables them to go on and do complete justice between them. 11 Ohio, 462; 12 Ohio, 368. For where jurisdiction once attached, all subsequent acts, however erroneous, are not void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b385-7\">No language can more plainly define jurisdiction than that employed by the Supreme Court at Washington : \u201c The power <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>*to hear and determine a cause, is jurisdiction. It is <em>coram </em>judies, whenever a case is presented which brings their power into action. If the petitioner states such a case in his petition that on demurrer, the court would render judgment in his favor, it is an undoubted case of jurisdiction. Whether, on an answer denying and putting in issue the allegations of the petition, the petitioner makes out his case, is the exercise of jurisdiction conferred by the filing of a petition containing the requisites, and in the manner prescribed by law.\u201d 6 Pet. 709.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b386-5\">On a motion to dismiss, Judge Baldwin employs more forcible illustrations : \u201c Any movement (by a court) is necessarily the exercise of jurisdiction. Jurisdiction is the power to hear and determine the subject of controversy between the parties to a suit; to adjudicate or exercise any judicial power over them. The question is, whether, on the case before the court, their action is judicial or extrajudicial, with or without the authoi\u2019ity of law to render a judgment or decree upon the rights of the litigant parties ? If the law confers the power to render a judgment or decree, then the court has jurisdiction ; what shall be adjudged or decreed between the parties, and with whom shall be the right of the case, is judicial action, by hearing and determining it.\u201d 12 Pet. 718.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b386-6\">On another occasion, Judge Baldwin says:</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b386-7\">\u201c If the validity of a sale under its process can be questioned for any irregularity preceding the judgment, the court which assumes such power places itself in the position of that which rendered it, and deprives it of all power of regulating its own practice or modes of proceeding, in the progress of a cause to judgment. If, after rendition, it is declared void for any matter which can be assigned for error only, on a writ of error or appeal, then such court not only usurps the jurisdiction of an appellate court, but collaterally nullifies what such court is prohibited, by express statute law, from ever reversing.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b386-8\">\u201c The line which separates error, in judgment, from the usurpations of power, is very definite; and is precisely that which denotes the cases, when a judgment or decree is reversible *only by an appellate court, or may be declared a nullity collaterally, when it is offered in evidence in an action concerning the matter adjudicated, or purporting to have been so. In the one case, it is a record importing absolutely verity; in the other, mere waste paper: there can be no middle character assigned to judicial proceedings, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>which are reversible for error. Such is their effect between the parties to the suit; and such are the immunities which the law affords to a plaintiff who has obtained an erroneous judgment oi execution. It would be a well-merited reproach to our jurisprudence, if an innocent purchaser, no party to the suit, who had paid his money on the faith of an order of court, should not have the same protection, under an erroneous proceeding, as the party who derived the benefit accruing from it. A purchaser, under judicial process, pays the plaintiff his demand on the property sold; to the extent of the purchase money, he discharges the defendant from his adjudged obligation. Time has given an inviolable sanctity to every act of the court preceding the sale, which precludes the defendant from controverting the absolute right of the jfiaintiff to the full benefit of his judgment; and it shall not be permitted that the purchaser shall be answerable for defects in the record, from the consequence of which the plaintiff is absolved. Such flagrant injustice is imputable neither to the common nor statute law of the land. If a judgment is reversed for error, it is a settled principle of the common law, coeval with its existence, that the defendant shall have restitution only of the money \u2014 the purchaser shall hold the property sold; and there are few, if any, states in the Union who have not consecrated this principle by statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b387-5\">Acts of limitation become useless if a defendant is allowed to evade them, by avoiding judgments or executions, or the suggestions of defects or omissions in the records, which can be avoided only by an appellate court; a direct premium is held out for delaying the resort to the mode pointed out by law for correcting the errors of judicial proceedings. His debt *is paid by the purchaser; the property purchased is restored to the defendant, without any obligation to refund ; and that which was, when sold, of little value, and bought at its full price paid to the defendant\u2019s use, becomes his rightful estate when the remote out-lot has become a mart for commerce and covered with valuable improvements.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b387-6\"><em>\u201c </em>The principles which must govern this, and all other sales by judicial process, are general ones, and adopted for the security of titles, the repose of possession, and the enjoyment of property by innocent purchasers, who are the favorites of the law in every court and by every code . . . If the jurisdiction was improvidently exercised, or in a manner not warranted by the evidence before it, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>it is not to be corrected at the expense of the purchaser, who had a right to rely upon the order of the court, as an authority emanating from a competent jurisdiction.\u201d 2 Pet. 163, 168.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b388-5\">\u201cWhen a court has jurisdiction, it has a right to decide every question that arises in the cause; and whether the decision be correct or not, its judgment, until reversed, is regarded as binding in every other court.\u201d Elliot <em>v. </em>Pierrel, 1 Pet. 349; 2 Pet. 169; 10 Pet. 474.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b388-6\">It is needless to multiply these quotations. It can not be necessary to remind the court of the cases, where the finding, even by implication, by a court of limited jurisdiction, of a fact, whose existence is necessary to confer jurisdiction upon it, is itself an exercise of jurisdiction sufficient to establish its authority, and conclusive upon all interests. Whenever a subject- exists admitting any such exercise of judicial power, any action of the court upon it is conclusive. \u2022 2 How. 339.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b388-7\">4. The defendants have to submit one other view of this question. Admitting that section 12 required the notice to contain substance of the prayer in certain cases, is this case among them? That section points out four cases in which the court have a right to direct publication, namely, to settle land titles or boundaries, to rescind, or to execute contracts. This enumeration omits large subjects of chancery ^interference, as mortgages, liens, judgments, trusts, etc., etc. Now, hence arises the alternative, that, during the seven years when this statute was in force, either Ohio courts of chancery had no jurisdiction over non-residents\u2019 property, except in the enumerated cases, or they had jurisdiction in some cases where the form of notice was not prescribed. The first member of this alternative proposition will hardly be maintained. \u201c It wore a brave thing, indeed,\u201d if there ever was a time when Ohio courts could not foreclose a non-resident mortgage, or could fail to find means to subject to the satisfaction of a judgment or decree, the property of a stranger, which lay within its power. The latter alternative is therefore true, and Ohio courts could acquire jurisdiction in non-enumorated cases, by such process as conforms to the analogies of similar proceedings. If, then, a plaintiff were about to pursue a lien upon partnership property, a non-enumerated case, but one of undoubted jurisdiction, and the process employed answors every object of giving notice, and precisely conforms to the existing and well-established practice, there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>is no difficulty in sustaining the jurisdiction of the court. Now this precise case is shown in these proceedings. The bill was filed for two objects; one, to obtain a title to his share of the land, the other, to extend the lien for his advancements over partnership property. One was among the enumerated objects, the other was not. The enumerated cause of action was never pursued, but abandoned without an effort to maintain it; the non-onumoratod subject was pursued to decree. The case, therefore, as made and pursued, was one in which the court could acquire jurisdiction, by its own forms of notice, without being restricted by the provisions applicable to the enumerated grounds of equitable bills.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b389-5\">5. Should all these positions fail, the defendants do not yet despair of sustaining the authority of the court. Where either person or property are found within the jurisdiction of a given forum, which is competent to investigate a wrong, and whose forms of action furnish appropriate relief, its , jurisdiction is complete, and it will so shape its proceedings as to render its *interposition effectual. Story\u2019s Conflict, sec. 539; 5 Litt. 49. It is among the rights, privileges, and duties'of chancery, where relief for an injury depends\" upon a relation to the property of nonresidents, within its jurisdiction, to proscribe its own terms for the service of process to prevent a failure of justice. This power is exercised in every case of what is called \u201c substituted service.\u201d It is the course of the court, where ordinary process can not reach the defendant, to prescribe, by order, some form of service which the court will regard equivalent to it. Usually, it is the service upon the attorney, solicitor, or agent, or even by leaving subpena at the last place of abode of a defendant not within the government. 1 Barbour\u2019s Practice, 52. Where defendant is absent, service at his store on his servant, may be good service. 11 Paige, 288; 20 Wend. 570. So service on a guardian of an infant, a lunatic, may, by order, be made good service on the ward. 9 Vos. 357. Orders for substituted service are granted now with more caution than formerly; but they are still granted in proper cases, and they establish our present position, viz: that every court of chancery having jurisdiction over the subject, has an inherent power, not arising from statute, but from the very nature of the court (which relieves, beyond the ordinary forms of law), of adopting such process as, in its judgment, will afford due relief. But if the power be admitted to exist in any case, it must exist <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>in all; and it affords a just basis for the principle we maintain, that chancery, this extraordinary tribunal, exercising powers beyond the ordinary courts of law, and adapting remedies to all exigencies, does possess authority where property is found amenable to its process, to subject to its adjudications the rights of its owners, and this principle will sustain the validity of the present record.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b390-5\">Either of these positions seems to us sufficient to support the jurisdiction of the court, and establish the validity of the record.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AaqA\">*Read, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQs\">It is contended on the part of the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, that the defendants derive no title by the purchase at judicial sale, because the decree under which the sale was had was void, for want of jurisdiction in the court pronouncing it':</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">1. Because the respondents were non-residents, and the demand personal.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">2. That if the subject matter of the suit lay within the jurisdiction of the court, the requisite notice by publication was not given to make respondents parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">3. That the description of the land in the bill was too vague to constitute it a suit concerning lands, contemplated and authorized by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-10\">The distinction between void and voidable judgments and decrees, is assuming, in the State of Ohio, a v.ery high importance, as affecting title to lands derived through judicial sales. If the judgment or decree is void, the land itself sold to satisfy it may be recovered back, and such proceeding may be impeached collaterally. The result or consequence, in such case, is precisely as though no such judgment or decree had over been rendered or pronounced. If the judgment or decree bo not void, but simply erroneous, subject to reversal upon writ of error or review, the consequences are wholly different. They must bo impeached directly, and can not be questioned collaterally; and when reversed, the defendant shall have restitution in money against the plaintiff, and purchasers hold the land or property acquired by the sale had under such judgment or decree undisturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-11\">Such, in many instances, has been the rapid and great rise in the value of property in Ohio, from the springing up of towns, and other causes, that property which a few years ago was sold, even at its full value, to satisfy a small debt, would now, if it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>eould be recovered back, constitute a large fortune. The greatest possible efforts will therefore be made to recover the land itself, when the mere reversal of the judgment or decree, and a moneyed restitution, would be scarcely' worth the contest. Hence it is not surprising that .able and experienced ^counsel should, in such cases, put forward the most ingenious and subtle arguments, to show that every defect looks directly to the jurisdiction of the court. <em>We </em>shall adhere to those salutary and long-established principles, which have been adojffed from right and necessity, to give confidence to the judicial action of the country, and protect those who have made purchases upon the faith of judicial sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">It is admitted, that if the court had jurisdiction and authority to pronounce the decree under which defendants derive title, the plaintiff must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">It is said, in this case, that the demand was simply personal, and that without service upon the respondents, who reside in another state, the decree was pronounced against them. If this were so, the objection to the jurisdiction would have been well taken ; but the fact that the decree was for money only, does not establish that fact. The court pronouncing this decree was a court of general jurisdiction, and it is not disputed but that it had jurisdiction over cases of this sort.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">The bill upon which the decree was pronounced, set up that complainant and respondents had entered into a contract with each other to build a mill, some to furnish money, and some to contribute labor, for which a compensation was to be estimated in money; and that, finally, on acquiring title to the land, which was, at the time of the contract, in the government, the complainant was to have a certain portion of it; that respondents obtained the title, and refused, in any sense, to comply with the contract; and the complainant sought relief' by a specific execution of the contract, and by an account for money more than his share expended, and for improvements put upon the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">Now, the contract set up in the bill is mixed \u2014 a contract for title to real estate, dependent upon the payment of money and the performance of labor, connected with the land and the contemplated improvements. Before the court could decree a conveyance of the land, it would be necessary to determine whether the complainant had complied with his agreement. *The contract was an\u2019 entire thing. So far as the title to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>the real estate was concerned, as the land was within the jurisdiction of the court, it is admitted that that was the place where the suit should have been commenced. It is not contended that the complainant could enforce that contract, specifically, elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">It is not disputed but the court had jurisdiction over contracts affecting realty. This power is expressly conferred by section 12 of the act of 1824.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">The court then had a case before them, as presented by the bill, over which they had jurisdiction, and were competent to decree. But what is the error complained of? That the court, thus having a proper case before them, pronounced a wrong decree; that the court should have decreed a conveyance of the land ; that the money and services, expended and performed by the complainant, should have been treated as payment, by him, for the land. But the court, instead of this, simply decreed him a compensation in money. It is contended that the court had no jurisdiction to do this. If it was wrong, what is it more than error? It is the case of a court pronouncing a wrong judgment or decree, in a case properly before it. This, on that hypothesis, is precisely a case for a bill of review ; such error does not go to the jurisdiction of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">In this view of the case, then, there is no lack of jurisdiction in the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">But it is said the court had no jurisdiction, because there was not sufficient notice to respondents of the pendency of the suit, by publication.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">The objection taken, is not that no notice was published, but that the notice published was not full enough.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-10\">It is claimed that the statute required notice to be given, by publication, of the pendency of the bill, and of the substance and the prayer thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-11\">The notice actually given was, that a bill in chancery was pending, and a prayer lor a decree. The court had directed the notice, in pursuance of sections 7 and 12 of the act of 1824. The court regarded this publication as a compliance *with tho order made under the statute. The publication made was in the common or usual form adopted at that day, or, at least, in a form \u25a0.quite common.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-12\">Now, if there had been no notice at all, the objection would .have been well taken. But as there was notico, adjudged to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>be sufficient by the court ordering it, we will not disturb it collaterally.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">The description of the land in the bill is not very certain, but the bill seeks to reach land under a contract, and this is sufficient to bring the case within the statute. The fact that a bill, seeking to enforce a contract concerning land, does not describe very definitely the land embraced, does not go to the jurisdiction of the court. We find no error which would authorize us to disturb the judgment. Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
