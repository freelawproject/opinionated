Tracy\u2019s Administrators.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b363-9\">If notes be delivered to an executor to indemnify tbe estate against a liability where tbe testator was a surety, such notes and the money collected on them are not the property of the estate and the estate is not liable for ' the misconduct of such executor in respect to such notes and money. Under such circumstance, the executor is a trustee for the person delivering the notes, and he alone is responsible for a faithful application of the money collected.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-10\">This is a case in chancery, reserved in the county of Lake, and comes before this court upon bill, answer, replication, and testimony.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-11\">The facts disclosed are those: June 30, 1829, B. E. Tracy, Charles M. Reed, and Samuel Hayes became sureties for Andrew Arbuekle, on a note, in the sum of $559.11; and on April 25, 1833, they also became his sureties on another note in the sum of $689.29 \u2014 on both of which notes there are now judgments against said Tracy\u2019s estate. Arbuckle\u2019s estate has paid about $700 on said notes, leaving from $1,000 to $2,000 now due. Tracy died January..5, 1834, and by his last will and testament appointed Y. J. Card his executor, expressing the wish that ho \u201cshould take the whole management of settling his affairs and estate,\u201d and giving him \u201cfull power to settle each and every demand in law and ' equity.\u201d Card accepted the trust, gave bonds, and acted as executor until April or July, 1840, when, his account having boon filed and approved, he resigned, and respondents, Foote and Russell, were appointed administrators <em>de bonis non. </em>After said notes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>became due, and before suit upon them, to wit, April 9, 1835, Arbuekle, whether at the instance of Card or of his own mere motion does not appear, placed in Card\u2019s hands sundry notes amounting to the sum of $39G.08, and took from him a receipt, as follows: \u201cReceived of Andrew Arbuekle the notes, of which the foregoing is a list, as collateral security to indemnify *me as executor of the last will and testament of .Benjamin F. Tracy, deceased, against the payment of two certain notes,\u201d describing them, and adding: \u201cNow, if the said Arbuekle shall save harmless the estate of the said Tracy from the payment of the notes specified in the receipt, and so signed by the said Tracy and others as aforesaid, then I am to account to the said Arbuekle for the notes received of said Arbuekle, as per the <em>foregoing </em>list. Dated April 9, 1835.\u201d Signed, \u201cYarnum J. Card, executor of Benjamin F. Tracy.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-4\">Of these notes, Card collected part, using his name as executor; and, by reasonable diligence, might have collected most of the balance; but no part of said notes or of the money collected thereupon ever came to the use of Tracy\u2019s estate, or was applied for its benefit, or in any way intermingled with its assets. Card\u2019s account, filed, showed him largely indebted to Tracy\u2019s estate, but embraced none of the collections from these notes. Card died intestate, September 1, 1840, and Backus is his administrator. Tracy\u2019s estate is sol vent; Arbuckle\u2019s probably so; and Card\u2019s utterly insolvent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-5\">The object of the bill is to subject the estate of Tracy to the payment of the money collected by Card on the notes placed in his hands by Arbuekle.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b364-6\">Perkins &amp; Osborn, for complainants:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A1F0\">Card, the executor of Tracy, in procuring and receiving the notes of Arbuekle to indemnify the estate; was acting within the scope of his authority as executor, and in the faithful performance of his duty. It was his duty to protect the estate from loss, and, if possible, procure an indemnity. Off. of Ex. 171, noto 1. It would have been his duty, if necessary, to have filed a bill in chancery for that purpose, and he might as well receive the indemnity without suit as with. Stump <em>v. </em>Rogers, 1 Ohio, 225; 1 Law Lib. Prin. &amp; Sur., sec. 245.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b364-9\">An executor has large discretionary duties. Ho may exchange securities; he may continue the business of the 4'testator, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>and do many other acts for the benefit of the estate. Swan\u2019s Ex. 116; Toller\u2019s Ex. 164; Off. of Ex. 174,187; Williams on Ex. 1177.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b365-5\">An executor is regarded as the agent and trustee of the estate, and, when acting within the limit of his powers, the estate is bound for whatever he does. Within this limit he received these notes, and consequently, and especially, as the estate of Tracy has never paid anything for Arbuckle, it is bound to refund the amount with interest. Tanksloy <em>v. </em>Anderson, 4 Dessau. 44; 2 Bar. &amp; Har. Dig. 396. See also Tousant <em>v. </em>Martinant, 2 Tenn. 160, and Crawley\u2019s Assignee <em>v. </em>Dunlap et al., 7 Tenn. 565.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b365-6\">H. Foote, for defendants:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b365-7\">The notes were not placed in Card\u2019s hands on any contract therefor, express or implied, between Tracy and Arbuckle. Had Tracy contracted with Arbuckle for the notes afterward delivered, as collateral security against his becoming surety, it would have placed the matter on entirely different ground. But Card acted on his own responsibility. His naming himself as executor, does not change the character of the transaction. McCoy <em>v. </em>Gilmore, 7 Ohio, 268, pt. 1; Waldsmith <em>v. </em>Waldsmith, 2 Ohio, 156.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b365-8\">It is not competent for Card, as executor of Tracy, to originate liabilities or make contracts to bind the estate, under pretense of \u25a0 taking security against a contingent liability. Foster <em>v. </em>Fuller, 6 Mass. 58; Thatcher <em>v. </em>Dinsmoro, 5 Mass. 299.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b365-9\">It was no part of his duty to receive the notes of Arbuckle. It was not settling up the estate. It was not getting rid of liability, but prolonging it. Swan\u2019s Stat. 877.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b365-10\">Under the arrangement made between Card and Arbuckle, Card became the agent and trustee of Arbuckle. He was trusted by Arbuckle in a manner bcjmnd the sphere of his official duties, and is, therefore, only responsible to Arbuckle in his individual capacity.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b365-11\">*Read,J.</author>\n<p id=\"AtI\">Tracy was security for Arbuckle. It was the duty of Arbuckle to discharge the original debt. Tracy was liable only \u2022 collaterally. Arbuckle, on the decease of Tracy, delivered over to Card, his executor, the note in question, as indemnity or collateral security. When collected, the money did not belong to Tracy\u2019s estate, but was to be applied to discharge tho debt of Arbuckle\u2019s estate. Neither the note nor the money collected belonged to Tracy\u2019s estate, but was held in trust to bo applied to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>benefit of Arbucklo\u2019s estate. Card was a trustee or agent for Arbuckle, and was to account to Arbuekle. Hence, if he violates his trust or duty as agent, the loss must fall upon Arbuekle. It would be a novel principle, indeed, to permit Arbuckle to constitute Card, his agent, to do exactly what in the law he was bound to do; and then hold Tracy\u2019s estate bound for the faithful performance of the trust by Card. If Card had collected any money, and applied it to the benefit of Tracy\u2019s estate, to that extent the estate would be liable; but this is not pretended.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Bill dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
