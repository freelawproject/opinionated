They also insisted that the facts of the case warranted the court in coming to the conclusion that it was the design of Wilson, knowing\u2019 that he was in embarrassed circumstances, to placo a portion of his property beyond the reach of his creditors . \u2014 to commit actual fraud upon them; and that his retaining possession of the property himself, withholding for years the deed from record \u2014 taking, subsequently to the date of the deed to his children, a deed to himself for the same property, and making valuable improvements thereon \u2014 were among the badges of fraud which the case presented, and -which authorized the interference of a court of chancery to set aside the conveyance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b92-7\">They inferred the court to the following authorities: 1 Atk. 15 ; 2 Ib. 600; 3 Johns.

Under these circumstances he made an advancement to his two children of property worth, according to the complainant\u2019s proof, $2,000, or at most not exceeding $2,500.

The particular lands in controversy are in-lots 440 and 493, in Columbus. It is, perhaps, improper to say that there is any controversy with respect to this latter lot. The facts relative to it are, that it was purchased by Wilson in 1838, and by his direction conveyed to his wife. She does not, however, pretend to claim it, and if she did, the claim could not be sustained, as at the time of the purchase and conveyance, Wilson was hopelessly insolvent.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">It is claimed, however, that lot No. 440 was never the property of Wilson ; that it was, by his direction, conveyed by the former owner to his two children, Thomas and Ann; that it was intended by him as an advancement, and that the son, after his arrival at full age, conveyed his undivided half of the property to his mother, the defendant Margaret.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-9\">The leading facts as to this property are the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b94-10\">John Wilson, the decedent, some time before 1819, removed from Pennsylvania to Ohio, and took up his residence at or near Chillicothe. He was a man of small means, and was a tanner by trade. His father, whose name was Thomas, was a resident of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>the State of Pennsylvania, and had little or no property. Thomas Wilson had two brothers, Charles and John. John resided in Baltimore, and became wealthy. About the year 1819 he died, leaving his brothers Charles and Thomas his heirs. The amount of the estate of this John Wilson, of Baltimore, is not accurately ascertained. After his death, an arrangement was made between John Wilson, of Ohio, and his ^father, Thomas, by which John was to administer on the estate of his deceased uncle, and was to have, in consideration thereof, the one equal half of his father\u2019s share in that uncle\u2019s estate. In pursuance of this arrangement, John proceeded to Baltimore, and in connection with one Sterritt, took letters of administration on his uncle\u2019s estate. At this time he was somewhat, although not very deeply involved. John T. Barr, of Baltimore, a man of' wealth, and an old schoolmate and friend of John, was instrumental in procuring for him letters of administration, and was one of his securities, it being the understanding that Sterritt and Barr were to have the principal control in the settlement of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">This John T. Barr was the owner of a farm in the neighborhood of Columbus, containing 275 acres of land, and also of several lots in the town of Columbus. During the time that Wilson was in Baltimore, an arrangement was made between him and Barr, by which Barr agreed to sell to him this property at and near Columbus, and to receive compensation, as is supposed, from the estate of the deceased John Wilson, of Baltimore. A part of this property was the lot number 440, now in controversy, upon which there was at the time a dwelling-house and some other improvements.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">John Wilson returned to Ohio and took up his residence at Columbus, occupying the house upon lot 440, and continued in possession until his death, in 1841. While in Columbus, he owned a tannery and carried on the business of tanning.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">The estate of the uncle was not finally settled until April, 1829. In that month John Wilson, the decedent, was in Baltimore, for the purpose of making settlement. On the 27th day of the same month, he had a settlement with Barr, and gave him a note for SI,952.99, and procured Barr to make a deed to his two children, Thomas and Ann Wilson, for in-lot 440. At this time his son Thomas was eleven, and his daughter Ann five years of age.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">The question arises, as to this deed, whether it was made in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>*good faith, as an advancement to these children, or whether tho object was to defraud creditors. It is claimed by the complainants, that a voluntary conveyance, for the consideration of natural love and affection, can not be sustained, if, at the time, the grantor is involved in debt. Decisions to this effect have unquestionably been made in England, and probably such is the law in that country. And such seems to have been the decision of Chancellor Kent, in a case decided by him in the State of New York. 3 Johns. Oh. 481. We do not, however, conceive this to bo the correct rule, as generally established in this country: A man may make an advancement to his child, although at the time in debt, provided ho has sufficient property remaining to satisfy such subsisting debts. And if the advancement is made under such circumstances, it can not be impeached by subsequent creditors, merely because it is voluntary. A person claiming under such advancement, must be prepared, however, clearly and conclusively to show that there was other property sufficient to pay all subsisting debts.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Testimony has been taken in this case, to show the extent of the indebtedness of John Wilson in April, 1829, and also as to the value of his property. This evidence is not very satisfactory. It is admitted, that he was indebted as trustee to his father\u2019s estate, and which is one of the claims attempted to be set up in this bill, in the sum of $1,805.14, and to John T. Barr in tho sum of $1,952.99, making in the whole $3,758.13. It is claimed by the complainants, that there were other debts which would swell the amount to nearly $7,000. These were all eastern debts. There is no evidence as to any other.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Tho witnesses differ much as to the value of his property. It consisted of the property purchased of Barr, and of a tannery, with the stock therein. In estimating the entire value, witnesses vary from seven or eight to twelve or fifteen thousand dollars. This is including the lot in controversy. Exclusive of that lot, it is at least doubtful whether the other property would have been sufficient, under a forced sale, to have paid all the *debts. We are not prepared, however, to say absolutely, that it would not have been sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">But although an advancement may bo made as before stated, which, if done in good faith, can not be impeached by subsequent creditors, yet, if in taking all the circumstances into considera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>tion, the mind is brought to the conclusion that there was a fraudulent design, either as to subsisting or subsequent creditors, such advancement can not be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">The evidence in this case shows that upon a settlement with the orphans\u2019 court, as trustee of his father\u2019s estate, which was made in April 1829, Wilson was found in debt $1,805.14. On the 27th day of the same month, he settled with the probate court in Baltimore, and was found in debt; and on the same day, upon settlement, he was found indebted to Barr $1,952.99. In ten years from the time of undertaking to administer upon his uncle\u2019s estate, from which wealth was expected, he found himself indebted to the amount of more than $3,700, to say nothing of further indebtedness. And on this day he received from Barr the deed conveying to his two young children lot No. 440. But this deed, although delivered by Barr to Wilson, was not by him handed over to the children, nor was it immediately placed upon record. He retained it in his own possession, and continued in possession of the lot. In 1834, this deed to the children still remaining unrecorded, he received a deed from Barr, conveying to him, together with other property, this identical lot. This deed, it is true, so far as this lot is concerned, was inoperative. At length, in January, 1835, he placed the deed to the children upon record, and the next ensuing year put improvements upon the lot to the value of more than $3,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Under these circumstances, we can not but conclude that Wilson, finding himself thus in debt, in 1829, when he had expected to be wealthy, became apprehensive of eventual failure; and for the purpose of securing t.o himself and wife a home, as expressed to one or more of the witnesses, procured *the conveyance to be made as it was. But still hoping to extricate himself from embarrassment, he kept the deed from record until 1835, when it was delivered and recorded; and from this time he spared no expense to render this house comfortable and convenient.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">That his apprehensions were not without foundation, is manifest from the fact that, although during his life his credit was good, yet at his death, he was found to be involved to the amount of more than $18,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">But it is contended by the counsel for the defendant,Margaret, that if in the opinion of the court this deed was fraudulent as to creditors, still that she is entitled to dower in' the premises. The act relating to dower (Swan\u2019s Stat. 296) provides, that the widow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>shall be endowed <em>\u201c of </em>one full and equal third part of all the lands, tenements, and real estate of which her husband was seized during coverture,\u201d and also of \u201c one third part of all the right, title, or interest that her husband, at the time of his decease, had in any lands or tenements held by bond, article, lease, or other evidence of claim.\u201d In other words, she shall be endowed of one-third of the' legal estate of inheritance of which the husband was seized dni\u2019ing the coverture, and of one-third of any equitable interest he may have in lands at the time of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">That Wilson had an equitabje interest in this lot previous to 1829, there can bo no doubt. He was in possession under a purchase from Barr. But in 1829, he procured it to be conveyed to his children. Now this deed, although fraudulent and void as to creditors, was good as to Wilson. He could not controvert it. So far as he was concerned, and so far as his wife was concerned, it vested a legal estate of inheritance in the children. Wilson, then, had not, at any time during his life, a legal estate of inheritance in this lot. Had he any equitable interest in it at the time of his death? We think not. As to him, both the legal and the equitable interest was vested in the children, by the deed of 1829.</p>\n<p id=\"AAf\">*A number of authorities have been cited, which are claimed to be inconsistent with this opinion. Of these authorities, the case of Robinson <em>v. </em>Bates, 3 Met. 40, is the only one which has a direct bearing upon the case under consideration. In that case, Robinson and wife joined in a deed conveying certain lands, she releasing her right of dower. Subsequently a creditor of Robinson having obtained judgment and levied upon the land, recovered the same, thereby avoiding the deed, on the ground that it was fraudulent as to creditors. After the death of Robinson, his widow prosecuted her suit for dower. The tenant attempted a defense, on the ground that she had, by the deed before referred to, released her right of dower. But the defense was not allowed; the court holding that the tenant having avoided the deed for fraud, should not afterward be permitted to set it up as a bar to the widow\u2019s right of dower. The substance of the decision is, that if husband and wife unite in the conveyance of his land for the purpose of defrauding creditors, and the deed is avoided for the fraud, the wife is not thereby barred of her dower.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">The case differs from the one now before the court in this: Robinson had, during the coverture, a legal estate of inheritance in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>the land <em>then </em>in controversy, whereas Wilson had not, during the coverture, such legal estate in the tend <em>now </em>in controversy. Without such legal estate, his widow can not be endowed, unless, at the time of his death, he had an equitable interest. To the court, it seems clear that he had no such interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">Decree for complainants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
