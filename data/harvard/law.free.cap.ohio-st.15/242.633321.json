Mason <em>v. </em>Benjamin King.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b204-9\">An action will lie, at the suit of the owner of negotiable paper which haa been lost after it fell due, at law; hut if lost before due, the remedy is in chancery, where the owner can he required to indemnify the maker.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-10\">This is an action of assumpsit, reserved in the county of Miamij upon an agreed statement of facts, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-11\">The plaintiffs declared upon three several promissory notes, given by the defendant to one Joseph Layman; one dated December 5, 1837, for $65; one dated November 16,1839, for $8, and the other dated January 3, 1842, for $105.69; all payable on the day of their date, and duly indorsed by the plaintiffs. Plaintiffs proved, by Robert C. Sehenck, that, as attorney for plaintiffs, in the spring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>or summer of 1843, having a claim to collect for them, he called upon Joseph Layman, against whom the claim was, and received from him an assignment of the above notes; that the notes were all due at their respective *dates aforesaid, stating their dates and amounts, as in the declaration ; that they were payable to Joseph Layman, or order, who then indorsed them, in blank, and delivered them to the plaintiffs. On the same day, being on his way to Cincinnati, he lost said notes, in a package of papers, dropped somewhere upon the turnpike; that every effort had been made, by inquiry and advertisement, to find them, but without avail.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-5\">On this state of facts, the defendant\u2019s counsel moved to non-suit the plaintiffs, upon the ground that an action at law can not be maintained upon a lost note, payable to order, and indorsed in blank, after it became due; which question the court reserved for decision at the court in bank.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b205-6\">Odin &amp; Schenck, for plaintiffs :</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b205-7\">The question, reserved by the agreed case, is whether there is relief, at law, upon a lost negotiable promissory note, indorsed after due ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b205-8\">In 1 Story\u2019s Eq. Jur. 102, sec. 85, it is said, equity will <em>not </em>entertain jurisdiction for relief upon a lost negotiable note, so as to decree payment, upon the mere fact of loss ; for no such supposed inability exists to recover at law, as exists for want of a profer\u00ed of a bond, at law. No profert is necessary; and a recovery can be had, at law, upon mere proof of the loss. Walmsley <em>v. </em>Child, 1 Ves. 345; Glynn <em>v. </em>Bank of England, 2 Ves. 38, 41.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b205-9\">The first case was a bill in chancery, to be decreed payment of Goldsmith\u2019s notes, payable to bearer (and, by the custom of merchants, passing as cash), which had been lost. Lord Chancellor Hardwicke says : \u201c Upon the whole, therefore, the plaintiff must bring an action at law for the money.\u201d And, again: \u201c I see no doubt of maintaining the action.\u201d He also remarks, that, so far as concerned inland bills of exchange, the merchants procured the passage of the act of 9 and 10 William III, by which the drawer of a bill of exchange, lost, and never indorsed, is not bound to pay, without indemnity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b205-10\">*The second case was for the amount of Bank of England notes, averred to be lost. The chancellor decided, that the remedy on a lost note is at law ; and he takes the distinction between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>a note and bond, on the ground of oyer, at law, of sealed instruments. The bill in this case was filed for relief, and with an offer of indemnity. 2 Ves. Sen. 38, 41.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-5\">In Glover <em>v. </em>Thompson, Ryan &amp; Moodie, 403; 21 Eng. Com. Law, 372, it was decided that an action may be maintained on a lost bill of exchange, if the loss did not happen until after the bill became due.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-6\">In the case of Hansard <em>v. </em>Robinson, 14 Eng. Com. Law, 20; 7 Barn &amp; Cress. 90, in 1827, Lord Tcnterden, C. J., held that <em>\u201c </em>the holder of a bill of exchange can not, by the custom of merchants, insist upon payment by the acceptor, without producing and offering to deliver up the bill;\u201d and therefore it was held, \u201cthat the indorsee of the bill, having lost it, could not, in an action at law, recover the amount from the acceptor, although the loss was after the bill became due, and the indorsee offered an indemnity.\u201d' This case, being upon a bill of exchange, the court say, that the acceptor, paying the bill, has a right to the possession of the instrument, for his own security, and as his voucher and discharge in account against the drawer. The case is determined on the custom of merchants, and contains reasoning not applicable to promissory notes. Upon this question, it is admitted by the court, that the decisions are not uniform, and can not be reconciled.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-7\">In Story on Promissory Notes, 114, see. Ill, the authorities are collected in a note. \u201cThere is,\u201d says he, \u201cas in England, a diversity of judicial opinion as to the right of the holder, at law, to compel payment of a promissory note from the maker, without a delivery or production thereof. In some of the states, the affirmative has been maintained; in others, the English doctrine prevails; and in others, the holder is entitled to recover at law, if ho executes a suitable indemnity.\u201d To these authorities, as there collected, we refer, remarking that, in the case of Renner <em>v. </em>Bank of Columbia, *9 Wheat. 581, the Supreme Court of the United States permitted a recovery upon a negotiable promissory note, which had been lost during the pendency of the suit, it having been in court a few days before the trial, but had been mislaid, and.upon thorough search, could not be found.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-8\">Judge Story, in his work upon Bills of Exchange, 522, sec. 449, after noticing the discrepancy of the authorities upon this subject, remarks:</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-9\">\u201c Which doctrine (to wit, the recovery at law, or not) will uiti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>mately prevail in America, is not for the commentator to conjecture.\u201d \u201c It may be difficult,\u201d he says, \u201c upon satisfactory grounds, to overturn the reasoning of Lord Tenterden, already referred to.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b207-5\">That difficulty consists, in the reasons assigned, of throwing the burden of proof upon the drawer as to the loss, and of preserving and commanding the proof, in a future action. With all deference to this opinion, it may be answered, that at law, the fact of loss, and that the plaintiff is the <em>true owner </em>of the note, must be fully made out; and that all this difficulty equally arises in a court of equity: so that it is narrowed down to the simple question of <em>indemnity. </em>Neither will this indemnity be perfect; for the securities are equally liable to removal and insolvency, with the plaintiff. It must be judicially proved that the plaintiff, and the plaintiff alone, is entitled to recover \u2014 and that by disinterested testimony. It is true that the defendant may be made liable, in future, upon the presumption, that the holder of the note, indorsed in blank, received it before it became due. But indemnity does not help him, except to increase his prospect of the ultimate recovery of his money. We are not aware of any decision in Ohio upon this subject. If the court are free to adopt a rule amid these conflicting authorities, would it not be the better rule, if indemnity is required, to leave the defendant to his bill in equity, in cases where he may deem it necessary to require that indemnity?\u2014 the presumption of future liability being against the direct proof at law.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b207-6\">*E. Parsons, for defendant:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b207-7\">The authorities relied upon to sustain the motion for a nonsuit in this case are-Chitty on Bills, 9 ed. 291, 297; Pintard <em>v. </em>Tackington, 10 Johns. 104; Swift <em>v. </em>Stevens, 8 Conn. 431; Holmes <em>v. </em>DeCamp, 1 Johns. 34; Angel <em>v. </em>Felton, 9 Johns. 149; Cummings <em>v. </em>Hackley, 8 Johns. 202.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b207-8\">Read, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_l\">This case was reserved for the determination of the single question, whether a recovery could be had upon lost negotiable paper, at law, or whether the remedy, in such case, was in equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">Upon this question, there is a conflict of decisions, both in England and the United States. In the decisions which have been made, different and various reasons have been assigned in support of either side; but from a careful review of the authorities, and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>full comprehension of the principles of law controlling the transfer and fixing the right of holders of negotiable paper, it would seem that the only difficulty in the case grows out of the question of <em>indemnity. </em>All other matters, and the rights of parties, can be governed, controlled, and modified in a court of law as well as equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">It is a necessary and fundamental principle of negotiable paper, that the innocent holder receiving it before duo, is entitled to its proceeds. This is the essence and life of its negotiability. Hence, if the maker should be compelled to pay in case of negotiable paper lost before due, such payment would be no bar to the recovery in the hands of an innocent holder, who had received it before due; and in such case a double recovery might be had upon the same instrument. But if former payment or recovery would be a complete bar to any subsequent payment or recovery, the reason of the rule ceases, and the objection to a recovery by the owner no longer exists. Hence, if the circumstances of the case are such that the negotiable paper can never be produced for payment a second time, or if produced would permit no right of recovery in the hands *of the holder, no indemnity in such ease being required to guard against a second payment, recovery may be had in a court of law. Thus, if the instrument be totally destroyed, or if it pass into the hands of the holder, charged with all the equities which exist against the original holder, the action may be at law. Now, it is a well-recognized principle, that negotiable paper received after it is duo, is charged with all the equities existing between the original parties. So, if payment be made to the original holder, and a recovery be had by him, it would constitute a complete bar to another actio'n brought by any person who should receive it after due. But if it be lost before due, and the original holder commence suit, there is a possibility that the paper may be outstanding in the hands of an innocent holder\u2014 upon which recovery could be had; and hence the law will not permit, in such case, a recovery to be had until complete indemnity is furnished against such possibility. Now, a court of law has not the power to compel this indemnity; and hence is forbidden to give judgment or to entertain jurisdiction of the case. A court of law proceeds upon fixed principles; and if the party is entitled to judgment, he is entitled to execution without limit or restraint. But a court of equity being called upon to give its aid, will guard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>the rights of all parties, and will not permit a recovery until the party seeking it will guard the opposite party from a danger which exists by the misfortune of the very person seeking its aid. It will say : You have been unfortunate in the loss of your instrument\u2014 we will relieve you from this difficulty, provided you will fully guard the other party from all harm which may, by possibility, result from what, except from our aid, would be a misfortune to you. It has the power to determine the nature of the indemnity and the security. Hence, in those cases in which indemnity is to be given, relief must be had in equity. A court of law, it is true, might do the same thing if it had the power; and there is no direct impossibility to prevent its having such powers; yet, as such is not the case in the distribution of law and equity jurisdiction, as the systems now stand, relief can only be had in equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">*In the case, however, before the court, no such difficulty exists, as those notes were lost after they were due.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">Judgment for plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">Birchard, J., argued that judgment should be entered for the plaintiffs, but doubted the accuracy of the position taken by the majority of the court. He held that the weight of the evidence showed that the notes sued for were lost and out of circulation. Also, that the court might order a stay of execution until an indemnifying bond should be filed by the plaintiff. On the hypothesis that the negotiable paper had been found and put in circulation, and had come to the possession of a <em>bona fide </em>holder, for a valuable consideration, in the regular course of trade, without notice, he was of opinion that, under the rules of the commercial code, such holder might collect it; that the defendant, whether the paper was past due when negotiated or not, could not set up as a defense any matter that arose subsequent to the good title acquired by the <em>bona fide </em>holder.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
