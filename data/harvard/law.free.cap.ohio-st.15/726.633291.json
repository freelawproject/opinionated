In the Supreme Court, a trial was had to a jury, at the March term, 1845, and a verdict rendered for the plaintiff for $600, subject to the opinion of the court on the law of the case, arising on an agreed statement of the facts which accompanies the files, and by the consent of counsel, is submitted as the evidence in the suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b611-6\">The declaration contains three counts. The first describes a messuage in the possession of Andrew Allison (who had before mortgaged it to the plaintiff for $4,000), and avers that the defendant, MeCune, had broken down and destroyed a certain mill erected on the mortgaged premises, and carried away the machinery and fixtures of the value of $2,000, and converted them to his own use, whereby the messuage was ^rendered of less value, and the mortgage security of the plaintiff impaired, to his damage, etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b611-7\">The second count describes the plaintiff as a reversioner, and complains of the same acts as an injury to his reversionary interest. There is also a third count in trover, for the conversion by the defendant, of certain milling utensils, machinery, etc., particularly described, to the damage, etc. To this declaration the defendant pleaded the general issue of not guilty, and the evidence now to be applied to the issue in disposing of the verdict of the jury, is found in the agreed statement of facts, and upon which, under the issue, the law arises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b611-8\">It is in substance, as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b611-9\">On the trial of this case it was proved that, on March 11, 1841, Andrew Allison being in possession of, and residing on a farm in Washington county, mortgaged it (100 acres) to Hugh Allison; the plaintiff, to secure the payment of a promissory note from Andrew to Hugh, of the same date as the mortgage, for the sum of $4,000; which mortgage was recorded May 11, 1841. The note and mortgage were given to indemnify Hugh for becoming security for Andrew before that time to sundry persons.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b611-10\">The mortgage described the land by metes and bounds, and \u201c to have and to hold the granted premises, with all appurtenances thereof, to the said Hugh Allison, his heirs and assigns,\u201d with covenants of warranty. Proviso for the payment of the note of $4,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b612-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>\u2022 At the time of executing the mortgage, there was a steam grist and saw-mill and distillery on the land described \u2014 the grist-nill used principally in grinding for the distillery. Andrew remained in possession and use of the land described in the mortgage, until after the commencement of this suit, exercising ownership as mortgagors usually do.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b612-5\">On May 18,1842, Hugh filed his bill in the common pleas of Washington county, praying a subpoena against Andrew \u2014 that he be compelled to answer ; that an account might be taken of what was due Hugh for his principal and interest *due on the mortgage; that the mortgaged promises be sold, and the proceeds thereof applied to satisfaction of such principal and interest, and for further relief. Andrew was served with process, but did not answer; and at the August term of the court (August 22,1842), a decree was entered <em>pro confesso, </em>against Andrew, for $4,334 and costs, to be paid in ten days; and that in default thereof, the master commissioner proceed to sell the mortgaged premises as upon judgment at law, and bring the money arising therefrom into court, to abide the order of court. On August 22,1842, an order was issued to the master who appraised the premises, and offered, but did not sell, for want of bidders.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b612-6\">On December 13, 1842, a second order issued, on which the property was offered by the master on March 6, 1843, and bid off by Hugh at two-thirds the appraised value, $1,334; but not having advanced the costs, the master returned tho fact and no sale for want of bidders. April 4,1844, a third order was issued, and May 4th the mortgaged property was sold by tho master to John Mason, for $1,334, being two-thirds the appraised value; and at the May term, 1844, of tho court of common pleas, the sale was confirmed, deed ordered, and money directed to abide the order of court on the hearing of the bill of one Park, a judgment creditor of Andrew Allison, and Hugh Allison as security. Hugh had paid about sixty dollars on his liability as security for Andrew, and some attorney\u2019s fees. Andrew\u2019s property is exhausted, and Hugh's also, unless a sale of some of his land is set aside as.fraudulent, for which a bill is pending by creditors of Andrew and Hugh as security. Hugh\u2019s liability as security for Andrew did not amount to tho sum of the mortgage note; but his liability exceeds the \u00abmount of the proceeds of the mortgaged premises, and tho amount of the verdict in the present action. Andrew Allison was justly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>indebted to the defendant, MeCune, for which Hugh was not bound, and the defendant, MeCune, obtained a judgment against Andrew Allison, in the court of common pleas of Morgan county, February 28,1842, for $386.97 debt, and *$7.05 costR. On this judgment an execution was issued to the sheriff of Washington county, dated March 4,1842, which the sheriff levied April 1,1842, on the steam engine and fixtures, the running gear of the grist and saw-mill, and still-worm and tubs of the distillery, by direction of the defendant, MeCune; and before the return of the writ, on the 21st of May, the sheriff, by direction of the defendant, MeCune, went to the property and scheduled what had been levied on, and removed the same off the mortgaged premises. The stills, tubs, etc., which had been before that time sold on a constable\u2019s execution against Andrew Allison in some other case, were not taken. The steam-boiler was set in a furnace of stone and brick, on the top of the ground. The engine was also sot in timbers laid on raised walls on the top of the ground, and the machinery of both grist and saw-mill was attached by coupling shafts, drivers, and straps. The buildings for the grist and saw-mills were frames set on the surface, and against a bank, on slight foundations of stone and blocks.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-5\">In severing the property levied on, the furnace for the boilers, which was outside the mill-house, was removed on the top, leaving the foundation above the ground ; and all the other property was taken without injury to the buildings. The writ was returned by defendant\u2019s order without sale, and on August 11, 1842, a <em>vendi. </em>from the common pleas of Morgan county was directed to the sheriff of Washington county, to sell the above property so levied and removed. By virtue of this last execution, the sheriff of Washington county, after giving legal notice of the time and place, proceeded to sell the property at public sale, on August 31, 1842; at which time the plaintiff, Hugh Allison, appeared and'gave notice that he claimed the property, and forbid the sale. The defendant, MeCune, indemnified the sheriff, and the property was sold to MeCune and others, who were the highest bidders, in parcels for sums which, in the whole, amounted to $114 \u2014 Hugh Allison, the plaintiff, at no time after the execution of *tho mortgage, before this sale, having had actual possession of the mortgaged premises, or the property sold as above.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-6\">If, upon the above facts, the court is of opinion that the plaintiff is entitled to recover, then judgment is to be entered on the ver<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>diet; if otherwise, the verdict is to bo set aside and a nonsuit entered.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b614-5\">C.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Alq1\">It is urged by the counsel for the defendant, that this action is not sustainable by any known and well-settled principle of law. The absence of direct, or, at least, analogous authority, it is certain, with a <em>careful judge, </em>tends to create uncertainty and doubt, not unfrequently, whether a position assumed as the basis of a right to recover can be sustained. But cases do, however, often occur, in the multifarious relations and transactions of mankind, when it is, by no means, an <em>insuperable </em>objection to the remedy sought to be obtained, that there is no direct adjudication in point. Rules of law must sometimes, of necessity, be extended to suit the local condition and meet the exigencies of every people. The common law of England, imported by our ancestors, as is said, is <em>in force in Ohio, </em>but it rests, nevertheless, in the sound discretion of the court to say how far it is applicable to our condition. It is one of the maxims of the common law, that <em>for every injury </em>a remedy is given, and when the justice of a cause stares me fully in the face, I will say, with Mr. Justice Eyre, that <em>11Ido not feel myself pleased to be knocked down </em>with formal objections.\u201d If there is no <em>known </em>mode <em>of </em>redress, it is the duty of the court, in such case, to open some now channel through which a remedy may be obtained. But I am not aware that the plaintiff, in the case at bar, is driven *to the extremity to ask of the court the adoption of any such course. It appears to us, the action may be sustained upon the ordinary principles applicable to a special action on the case, in general. Such an action lies to recover damages for an act done by another, either lawful or unlawful, with force or without, when the damages are not <em>immediate, </em>but as a consequence resulting from some intervening act, produced by that which is the <em>gist of the </em>action. Examples in the books are known to every lawyer. The action, by a singular provision of the statute of Ohio, has been extended to cases where trespass will lie, and is now a legal remedy to recover for an assault and battery. But take the action of. case, as defined, with the general principle that <em>the law gives redress for every injury </em>(but to which rule there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>are doubtless exceptions), why is the plaintiff, <em>on principle, </em>not entitled to maintain his action? To simplify the facts, the agreed case shows he was a mortgagee of Andrew Allison ; the condition of the mortgagee was broken and the defendant was a subsequent judgment creditor of Andrew. As against Andrew, tho lien of the plaintiff\u2019s mortgage was older than that of the defendant\u2019s judgment. Under these circumstances, the defendant, with his execution, issued upon his judgment, interferes and <em>lessens the plaintiff\u2019s </em>security, by removing tho fixtures and destroying the mill covered by tho plaintiff\u2019s mortgage, so that the mortgage lien is an insufficient security for tho plaintiff\u2019s debt, and Andrew Allison has no other property of any description. In our opinion, on principle, where such security is thus diminished, and damages result from the act, to the plaintiff, <em>the action lies. </em>For authority, we have examined only the eases cited. 2 Greenl. 173, presents a ease directly analogous : M. mortgaged to W., and afterward erected a house on the land. M. sold the premises to another, and ho sold the house to the defendant, who removed it. The mortgage was assigned to the plaintiff, and it was held he might recover the value of the house. Ib. 387, is a similar case but the action was trespass.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">*There is, however, no difference in principle. Possession or right of immediate possession is not always necessary to maintain cases for an injury either to real or personal property. It will lie for an injury to a reversionary interest, in either personalty or realty, though in trespass, without the aid of the Ohio statute, the rule would be different.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">But it is said, the mach inery of the mill was not realty or fixtures, and did not pass with the mortgage; but tho evidence shows it was placed there for permanent use; that it was attached to the mill and tho freehold; and, in this case, the facts show, inevitable loss will probably result to the plaintiff, though permitted to recover in this action. Judgment for plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b615-7\">Birchard, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ab3O\">dissenting. This action should not be sustained. The plaintiff had no claim but that derived from the mortgage, and he was out of possession. By the uniform decisions of this court, the mortgagor in possession holds the legal title, as against all the world, except the mortgagee, and against him till the condition is broken. 2 Ohio, 223: 8 Ohio, 222.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">609</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>There was no such thing as a reversionary interest in the mortgagee. He had no rights save those to be worked oat under his mortgage deed. It is welL settled that, while out of possession, he can not maintain trespass. Equally well settled is it, that for an injury, immediate and direct, trespass, and not case, is the only remedy known to the common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Our statute giving the action of case where trespass would lie at common law, seems to break down old and established forms. It was enacted to place, as far as legislation could effect that object, the unskilled and ignorant upon an equality with men of experience and learning \u2014 not to create a right of action, which was before unknown, and which would give to one man a remedy that otherwise would belong to his neighbor.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">This is manifestly a case of first impression. It is a novelty. There is nothing like it in all the books. Nothing which will *boar a close analogy to it, when carefully examined. The mere fact that it is novel, however, would not be a fatal objection, in my opinion, if it wore the only one. There is something more serious than novelty to be overcome. The wrong for which this suit was brought, was the detaching of alleged fixtures. The injury complained of was direct, and done to the realty. The person in possession was the one who had the right of action. He, and he alone, should be allowed to prosecute; and he may tomorrow, sue for and recover damages to the full extent of all the injury done to the premises. The levy of an execution upon the real property, or upon fixtures \u2014 which, as savoring of the realty, would pass by deed conveying the land \u2014 could not be justified under the execution. The officer and the defendant treated it as personal chattels; and if it was not such, they were both trespassers <em>ab initio. </em>The proceedings upon execution will be no defense to a suit brought by the mortgagor, if the property sold was what the plaintiff claimed it to have been, and the. rule of damages can not be less than the amount of the whole injury that was sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">My brethren argue that this proceeding would be no bar to an action by the mortgagor. The claim, however,' that it would bar a recovery, so far as tho damages to the reversionary interest are concerned. As I have before said, there is no reversionary interest in the mortgagee. The owner of the land, the mortgagor, has the interest affected by the supposed trespass. It was his right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>to protect the property, pledged for the payment of his own debt, from waste; his right to have the whole of it, either to use in payment of his debts or otherwise, as might not be inconsistent with his own contracts, and no trespasser can gainsay that right.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">To make the matter apparent to any one, let me suppose the act complained of to have been done by a wanton trespasser; that the mortgagor in possession prosecutes for the injury, and proves the damages to be equal to half the original value of the land and its appurtenances. The rule of damages would be such sum as would be equivalent to the injury. This court *would direct the jury to assess that amount, at all events. The fact that the land was under a mortgage for more than its value, would not affect the rule. If the mortgage should be offered for such a purpose, it would be ruled out, and the trespasser would bo told that it was the privilege of his adversary to have his own property applied to the payment or security of his debts, and that it was as valuable to him for that purpose as for any other. The recovery, therefore, would be for the whole amount of the damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">Now, if <em>this </em>plaintiff\u2019s action is allowed, there is nothing in the case which I have supposed to prevent the mortgagee from prosecuting and recovering damages for the same injury. The mortgaged premises being of less value than the debt secured by it, and the only means of payment, the injury to the mortgagee must be held, under the theory of my brethren, co-extcnsive with the supposed trespass. Thus, there would be two actions, and two recoveries of full damages, in addition to smart money for the same matter, cause, and thing, by different plaintiffs. Such a thing would not be a mere novelty. It would be an absurd violation of justice \u2014 a wrong which would demand a now remedy; and if the legislature would not give it, the court would feel itself called upon to retrace its- steps, or to make such further advance as would meet an evil of its own creation.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">It is said that if the plaintiff has any remedy, it must be by this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">Cases to sustain it are cited from other states, in which, for like injuries, trespass has been maintained. It is admitted that, in all those states, the legal estate and right of possession are regarded as in the mortgagee, and that the different rule in Ohio renders case the proper action here.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">It may be that the plaintiff will have no remedy if this action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>could not be sustained. If so, he would be placed in the same .condition that many other creditors have been who took insufficient measures to secure the debts due them. Ho might have done better. There was no law to hinder him from contracting *for the possession or control of the property pledged to him as security. It was his own folly to leave it in the hands of his creditor.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">The cases quoted from other states violate no correct principle and lead to no absurdity. They give the legal action to him holding tho title and the possession, and, as a consequence, would deny it to the opposite party. They would send the latter, holding, as they do, that he had but an equity of redemption, into a court of equity to enforce any right belonging to him. That should be done in this state, under our decisions, by the mortgagee. One having but an equity, and no legal title or actual possession, should not be permitted to resort to a court of law and prosecute an action upon a mere equitable claim, contingent in its nature, and which at any moment may be utterly extinguished by the payment of the debt.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
