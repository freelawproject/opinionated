J.</author>\n<p id=\"AHCT\">The bill in this case states that Smith Webster was seized of certain lands in fee, in-lots No. 20 and 21, in Kings-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>ville, in the county of Ashtabula, on June 25, 1839, and, on that day, conveyed by deed in fee, absolute on its face, to Horace Luce, one of the defendants; that this conveyance was in fact a mortgage, in security to Luce for indorsing Webster\u2019s note. Webster afterward paid the note, and, at his request, in order to keep the land beyond the reach of creditors of Webster, Luce conveyed in foe to Webster\u2019s wife, without consideration, on April 13, 1840. On the 5th day of the succeeding May, the complainant recovered judgment, in the court of common pleas of Ashtabula county, against Webster, for $140.45, and on March 2, 1841, execution issued and was levied on the land in controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">The bill also states, that Jonathan Warner claims to have purchased the land, at a tax sale, in December, 1840, and received *the county auditor\u2019s deed, but that the sale was void for the want of a pertinent description, being only described as \u201ctwelve acres, in range 2, township 13, in-lots 20 and 21.\u201d That Mrs. Webster died without will, leaving minor heirs; that Webster has no other property, and that the debt on which the judgment was recovered was contracted before the conveyance to Mrs. Webster, and that the judgment remains unsatisfied and in full force.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">It is also stated in the bill, that before Warner obtained the deed upon tax sale, the complainant called upon him and offered to pay him the tax, interest, and penalty, which was a very small sum, but which Warner refused. The prayer of the bill is, that the deeds to Mrs. Webster and Warner be declared void, and that Luce and Warner release to Webster; that an account be taken of the judgment, taxes, interest, etc., and that the land be sold, and the judgment and taxes paid from the avails; and for further relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">Smith Webster has not answered. The minor heirs of Mrs. Webster answer by their guardian, and call for proof. Warner answers, admitting his purchase at the sale for taxes, but insists that he acquired a .good title, and denies that the complainant ever tendered him the amount of tax, interest, and penalty, as stated in the bill, but says he was once called upon by the complainant, who was desirous-of purchasing the tax certificate, but they could not agree upon the terms, and the complainant went away. A replication was filed and testimony taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">The depositions of Horace and Artemus Luce prove the corn<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>\u25a0plainant\u2019s case,'against all the defendants, except Warner, and, against them, there is no reason perceived by us why the complainant may not take his decree. <em>Warner, </em>however, occupies different ground. By the act, entitled <em>\u201can </em>act for the protection .of purchasers at judical and tax sales \u201d (44 Ohio L. 114, 115), it is provided that, whenever a sale for taxes shall be invalid, the purchaser shall have a lien upon the land for the amount paid, etc. Of this lien, therefore, if his *tax title be defective, he. can not bo divested, without, at least, an offer to refund to him the money advanced. The complainant\u2019s solicitor was aware of this, and the bill contains the necessary allegations; but has he not failed <em>entirely </em>in his proof?</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">There is no evidence but the answer of Warner, and that, in our opinion, falls very short of furnishing the necessary proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">\u201c <em>The complainant called upon the respondent to purchase his certificate of sale, hut they could not agree,\u201d and not a lip is heard of any tender or offer to pay. </em>Upon familiar principles, the complainant is not rightly in equity, until he has done that justice, or offered to do it, which he exacts from others. It is a condition procedent to any right to institute his suit, and for that reason alone, the complainant\u2019s bill must, as to Warner, be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">This view of the case renders if unnecessary to examine the tax \u2022 title; and sufficient for the day is the evil thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">Bill as to Warner dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
