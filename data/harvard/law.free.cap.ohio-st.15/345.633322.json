The case is very voluminous, much testimony having been taken as to whether the deceased, in fact, made a will; if so, what were its provisions, and whether it was revoked, lost, or destroyed; but as the court, in deciding the case, only passed upon the question of jurisdiction, it is not deemed necessary to furnish an abstract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-6\">For the same reason, only so much of the arguments of counsel as relate to that question are inserted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b291-7\">T. Ewing, for complainants:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b291-8\">I confine myself, in this case, to the question of jurisdiction, and contend:</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b291-9\">1. That a will, lost or destroyed, may be set up by the court of common pleas on bill in chancery.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b291-10\">1. It may be sot up. It is not known to our system of jurisprudence that a wrong-doer, by the spoliation of a paper, may destroy the title of another and vest his estate in himself. Our courts will not suffer a man to acquire property in the purse which he has got by robbery, or the horse which he has stolen: much less could it be suffered that, by destroying the more legal evidence of title belonging to another, he should *vest that title in himself; that, if he stole a will and destroyed it, he should thereby acquire title to the land passed by that will. In the case of larceny or robbery, the purse or the horse has, by the act, passed into <em>possession </em>of the felon; he lacks <em>only title. </em>In case of the spoliated will, the spoliator has not one-half this meritorious interest; he has neither <em>title </em>nor <em>possession, </em>unless the law will give him them as a consequence of his act. If this were so, a will might be snatched from the hand of a witness while on the stand proving its execution ; it might be burnt in the presence of the court, and thus transfer the title of land of the devisee to himself, as heir, and he might come in next day and sot up his title in that very court.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> Probato of a will, lost or destroyed, is taken by the ecclesiastical courts in England. -See cases in defendant\u2019s brief.\u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>I conclude, therefore, that a spoliated or lost will may be <em>set up. </em>The executors and devisees are not without a remedy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-5\">2. And it may be done in the court of common pleas.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-6\">Constitution of Ohio, art. 3, sec. 5. \u201c The court of common pleas, in each county, shall have jurisdiction of <em>all </em>probate and <em>testamentary </em>matters.\u201d Not <em>sole jurisdiction </em>or all jurisdiction of such matters, but jurisdiction of <em>all </em>such matters. Here is a full grant of power to the common pleas of jurisdiction. One branch of that jurisdiction was to set up a lost will, and take and present proof of it. That power, then, was conferred upon the court of common pleas. There is nothing here directing the mode of proceeding to be adopted by that court, or giving or taking away, an appeal to the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-8\">But the lost or spoliated will may be proved in the common pleas.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-9\">3. It may be done by bill in chancery. The first nineteen sections of the \u201cact relating to wills,\u201d which provide for <em>the probate, filing, </em>and <em>registry </em>of wills, suppose the will to be present in court, and it is not percoived that any provision is to *be found therein for the probate of a lost or spoliated will; and section 33 provides, \u201c That no will shall be <em>effectual </em>to <em>pass </em>real or personal estate, unless it shall have been duly admitted to probate or record, as provided in this act.\u201d Here lies the difficulty. Let us see if it is insuperable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-10\">Our court has repeatedly holden, that the estate passed by the will on death of the testator, and that a suit brought by a devisee of a foreign will, before record, or of a domestic will before probate, can be sustained if there be registry or probate before trial or hearing of the cause; but it is not effectual until it has had this judicial sanction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-11\">This provision touches the <em>legal </em>character of the instrument and its effect in a court of law. It can not apply to those cases where fraud or accident, which properly give jurisdiction to a court of equity, are concerned. The negative language is not nearly so strong as that in section 4 of the statute of frauds. And I need Lot suggest to your honors, what a multitude of cases are, by uniform construction, taken out of the provision of that statute. The restriction in section 33 of the act relating to wills, is analogous to the statute of frauds, and, like it, intended as a prevention, an i, like that, it will not be so construed as to countenance or encour<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>age fraud. Courts will not suffer the loss or destruction of a will to defeat the estate of the devisee; but they will require, to give effect to\u2019the will, some legal sanction, by tho appropriate tribunal, equivalent to probate in notoriety and solemnity. Everything should be done as far as, under tho circumstances, it may, in pursuance of the provisions of the statute. The court of common pleas has jurisdiction of all probate and testamentary matters. It has, also, common law and <em>chancery </em>jurisdiction. It is the forum designated by the constitution, in which these proceedings should have their initiation. But what should be the form of proceedings? <em>That </em>is the only question. The proper forum has been chosen; now for tho <em>form </em>of proceeding.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b293-5\">The law has made no provision in the case of a lost or spoliated will. There is no <em>\u201c </em>plain, adequate, and complete remedy *at law;\u201d the jurisdiction, therefore, belongs to the chancery side of that court. \u2022 \u2018</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b293-6\">It is the better and the more convenient mode of procedure. The ordinary probate of a will is not a subject of contest \u2014 there are no <em>parties </em>before the court \u2014 the witnesses, therefore, few in number, and to a single point (the execution of the will) are examined in open court, and their testimony reduced to writing. But where the points in question become numerous, as in the case of a spoliated will, involving the inquiry not only of its due execution, but its destruction, its contents, and the fact whether it was destroyed by the testator, or with his consent, it would be inconvenient to make the court perform the office of a master in examining witnesses and taking down testimony. And besides, such a proceeding ought to be <em>inter parties. </em>The heir should have an opportunity to defend ; and tho decision ought to have the solemnity of a judgment or decree \u2014 it should settle the question between the parties. Such is not the case on application to admit to probate, Chapman\u2019s will, 6 Ohio, 148; Hunter\u2019s will, 6 Ohio, 449; but such would be the effect of a proceeding in chancery.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b293-7\">Tho legislature has referred contested wills to tho chancery side of the court. In case of contest, the testamentary matter is settled there. The will is destroyed, or made valid \u2014 its probate annulled or confirmed, according to the decree of that court on issue found. Why, then, in 'a case of inevitable contest, of contest <em>ah </em>initio, where the will can not be produced and proved agreeably to the statute, \u2014 why resort to the semblance of a probate where it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>does not tend to protect the rights or guard the interest of any one, and where it will inevitably be a vain and idle procedure? The question, <em>devisavit vel non, </em>must be asked and answered in chancery. Why, then, should the same tribunal, the true forum for the determination of all the questions which arise, commence and carry on its investigation in an irregular form, when its action in such form could have no other effect than shifting the burden of proof on *tbefinal trial of the issue between the parties? It appears to me that the proceeding should bo in chancery, and that the tribunal charged with jurisdiction of the case, has chosen the most appropriate form of procedure.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b294-6\">We also insist that the Supreme Court has jurisdiction on an appeal from a decree of the common pleas, setting up or refusing to set up such will. If the Supreme Court have do jurisdiction of the <em>subject </em>matter, then the <em>appeal </em>must be dismissed \u2014 but not <em>thebill: </em>To this we make no particular objection, but at the same time suppose that there is no defect of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b294-7\">The common pleas has jurisdiction of <em>all </em>probate and testamentary matters. That does not mean <em>sole </em>or exclusive jurisdiction. Section 1 of article 3 <em>of the </em>constitution provides that, <em>\u201cthe </em>Supreme Court shall have original and appellate jurisdiction in such cases as shall be directed by lawand the law (Swan\u2019s Stat. 713, sec. 52), provides that a party may \u201cappeal from any final sentence or decree pronounced and made in any cause or suit in chancery.\u201d This provision embraces the present case.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b294-8\">J. R. Swan, J. W. Andrews, J. Milton Williams, and Bebb &amp; Campbell, for the defendants:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b294-9\">All original proceedings of a judicial kind, relating to probate and testamentary matters, the proof, establishment, recording, etc., of wills, belong exclusively to the court of common pleas, and are regulated by statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b294-10\">Upon this subject little light can be gathered from English decisions; for the only court of probate in England is the ecclesiastical court, and that court has no jurisdiction over a will devising real estate. Its jurisdiction is confined exclusively to wills, or such parts of wills as dispose of goods and chattels. As to real estate, devised in the same, or any other will, its <em>probate </em>is no evidence of the due execution of the will. Hence, in England, when a will is offered in evidence, in an ^action at law, to prove a devise of lands, the will must be proved in open court to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>jury before it will be received; and probate thereof duly authenticated, from the ecclesiastical court, will avail nothing. There is, then, no court of probate in England, for wills, devising real estate; such wills are established, or defeated by an action of ejectment, or other action at law, in which the question of title is involved. If there have been a multiplicity of suits establishing the will at law, the English chancellor will entertain a bill to quiet the title, after ordering an issue at law, etc. It will be perceived, that the mixed and confused jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical courts, courts of law and courts of chancery, in England, in regard to probate and testamentary matters, can have but little\u00bb if anything, to do with our system, as established by the constitution and statutes of Ohio. We are unwilling, however, to let the law \u2014 the English law, as quoted by the counsel on the other side, from Story\u2019s Equity Jurisprudence \u2014 pass, without, at the same time, making some farther quotations from the samo work.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b295-5\">2 Story\u2019s Equity Jur. 380, sec. 1445: \u201cIt has already been stated, in another part of these commentaries, that the proper jurisdiction as to the validity of last wills and testaments, belongs to other tribunals. Whore a will respects personal estate, it belongs to the ecclesiastical court; and where it respects real estate, it belongs to the courts of common law. But, although this is regularly true, and courts of equity will not, in an adversary suit, entertain jurisdiction to determine the validity of a will, yet, whenever a will comes before them, as an incident in a.cause, they necessarily entertain jurisdiction to some oxtent over the subject; and if the validity of the will is admitted by the'partios, or if it is otherwise established by the proper modes of proo^ they act upon it to the fullest extent. If either of the parties should afterward bring a new suit to contest the determination of the validity of the will so proved, the court of equity, which has so determined it, would certainly grant a perpetual injunction.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b295-6\">*Story, Eq. Jur. 832, note to sec. 1447 : \u201c The heir at law can not come into equity for the purpose of having an issue, to try the validity of the will at law, unless it is by consent, for he may bring ejectment. But, if there be any impediment to the1 propor trial of the merits on such an ejectment, he may come into equity to have them removed \u2014 courts of equity do not seem to have any direct, or original authority, to establish the validity of a will of real estate <em>per se, </em>but only as incidental to some other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>object; as carrying into effect a trust, marshaling assets, etc For, if no obstacles intervene, the devisee may sue at law, if ho has the legal estate. If, after repeated trials at law in such a case, the will is established by a satisfactory verdict and judgment, courts of equity will then interfere, and grant a perpetual injunction against the heir, to prevent endless litigation, as it does in other cases.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b296-5\">This court, after reading the above, will probably have a clear view of the jurisdiction of a court of chancery in England, to try the validity, etc., of wills; but we will, notwithstanding, submit some further English law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b296-6\">Pemberton <em>v. </em>Pemberton, 13 Ves. Jr. 290, was an issue out of chancery, <em>devisavit vel non, </em>and the principal question was-this; whether the alteration, etc., of one of the duplicates of a will, revoked both ? and, after two trials at law, a third was asked. A third -trial at law was granted by Lord Eldon, who says: \u201cMy opinion is not formed upon the supposition that the verdict is wrong or right; nor does it interfere with that conclusion, which, upon subjects of this nature, I take to be entirely with the jury, giving due attention to the topics of law, properly stated to them by the judge. That is particularly proper, in a case where a court of equity is dealing with a will; as to which, the administration is very different from that in other cases, upon most of which this court has jurisdiction, to determine upon influence of fact, as well as doctrine of equity. But the authority to declare what is, and what is not, a man\u2019s last will, is denied to this court.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ASWp\">*Tbe syllabus of the reporter in this case is thus : \u201cA court of equity has no jurisdiction to declare what is, or is not, a man\u2019s last will.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b296-8\">\u201cThere is one case in which fraud can not be relieved against, in equity, though a discovery may be sought; that is the case of fraud in obtaining a will, which, if of real estate, must be investi. gated in' a court of common law, and if of personal estate, in the ecclesiastical court.\u201d 2 Daniel\u2019s Prac. 29.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b296-9\">If the heir has stolen a will, or any one has stolen a deed \u2014 for spoliation means nothing less than robbery and pillage \u2014 courts of equity, in England, wi21 compel the redelivery of the will or deed, and enforce the most stringent decree possible, as to the property, -until the instrument is delivered up. But they do not \u201cprove, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>confirm, and record it,\u201d as is prayed in this case. A stolen will stands upon the same footing as a stolen deed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-5\">But we claim that, under the constitution and laws of Ohio, probate and testamentary matters come within the exclusive jurisdiction of the court of common pleas.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-6\">\u201c The court of common pleas, in each county, shall have jurisdiction of all probate and testamentary matters.\u201d Const, of Ohio, art. 3, sec. 5.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-7\">The statute relating to wills (Swan\u2019s Stat. 992), after pointing out the mode of proceeding in the court of common pleas, by which wills may be proved, and under what evidence they may be admitted to probate, and providing for their being recorded, enacts as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-8\">\u201cNo will shall be effectual to pass real or personal estate, unless it shall have been duly admitted to probate or record, as provided in this act.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-9\">Now, if a bill of chancery is filed to prove and establish a will, or an issue out of chancery is ordered, to try the validity of a will, and a decree made on the verdict, such suit and proceeding is a testamentary matter. What, then, becomes of the constitution ? Such decree makes the will effectual to pass real estate; but where is the admission to probate or record, according to the provisions of the statute relating to wills ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-10\">*But it may bo claimed that, if a will be lost, a court of probate has no jurisdiction. It would be a sufficient answer to this to say, that the subject matter is still testamentary, and the constitution and statutes make no exception, in case of a lost will.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-11\">\u2022 The English ecclesiastical court can not be supposed to have more enlarged powers than our court of common pleas. The ecclesiastical reports are full of cases in which probate of a lost will is granted, \u201c as contained in the depositions of the witnesses.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-12\">\u201c And, at' this day, it is quite clear that the contents of a testamentary instrument may be thus established, though the instrument itself can not be produced, upon satisfactory proof being given that the instrument was duly made by the testator, and was r.ot revoked by him ; for example, either by showing that the instrument existed after the testator\u2019s death, or that it was destroyed ir his lifetime, without his privity or consent.\u201d 1 Williams\u2019 Executors, 209.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-13\">So, in Massachusetts, Davis et al. <em>v. </em>Sigourney, 8 Metcalf, 187. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>The syllabus is thus: \u201cAlthough an unrevoked will, which is lost or destroyed, may be admitted to probate, upon parol proof of its contents, yet it will not be so admitted, unless the evidence of its whole contents is most clear and satisfactory.\u201d The case was an appeal from the decree of the judge of probate, allowing the will, etc.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-5\"><em>\u201cA </em>codicil, fraudulently destroyed, was established upon parol proof of its contents.\u201d Clark et al. <em>v. </em>Wright, 3 Pick. 67, syllabus.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-6\">So in Alabama, Apperson <em>v. </em>Cottrell, 3 Port. 51. Held: \u201cIf a will be wholly or partially canceled or destroyed by the testator, while of unsound mind, probate will be granted\u2019of it, as it existed in its integral state, that being ascertained.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-7\">So in Kentucky, Happry\u2019s will, 4 Bibb, 553: \u201cProbate may be granted of a copy of a will when the original can not be produced.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A4u\">*So in Graham <em>v. </em>O\u2019Fallen, 3 Miss. 507: \u201c A will being lost or destroyed, probate may be granted upon a copy; also, whore there is no copy, the contents of the will may be proven) and the will established by the subscribing witnesses, or others who have read it.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-9\">A court of probate generally hears witnesses, face to face, and the testimony is reduced to writing, under the eye of the court. A court of chancery acts upon testimony without seeing the witnesses, and without knowing anything about their oral statoments, or their manner upon the stand. Wo therefore suppose the probate court qu\u00edte as safe a tribunal to decide upon a lost or destroyed will as a court of chancery.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-10\">But it may be claimed, that this is not a ease in which a will has been lost, but a case for relief, where there has been pillage and robbery of the will by the defendants. This can not, we suppose, change the question as to jurisdiction. No such distinction, between spoliation and a lost will, is made by the constitution or laws of Ohio, nor should the jurisdiction of the courts depend upon such a distinction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-11\">In the case of Hunter\u2019s will, 6 Ohio, 499 ; Ewing et al. v. Hollister, 7 Ohio, 140, pt. 2; and Lessee of Swazey\u2019s Heirs <em>v. </em>Blackman et al., 8 Ohio, 5, the reasoning of the court is founded upon the recognition of exclusive jurisdiction being vested by the constitution, etc., in the court of common picas. So, the statute organizing the courts, and defining the limits and extent of their respective jurisdiction, gives expressly to the court of common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>pleas judicial power to \u201ctake tho proof of wills, and to hear and determine all causes of a probate and \u25a0 testamentary nature.\u201d Swan\u2019s Stat. 222, sec. 4.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-5\">It may, we think, be said of the experience of the bench and bar of Ohio, as it was by the Supreme Court of Massachusetts, in 1 Pick. 549, of the bench and bar of tho latter state, \u201cthat no instance had occurred of a will being attempted to be proved otherwise than by a decree of the probate court.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-6\">^Probate in the common pleas being conclusive (Bailey <em>v. </em>Bailey, 8 Ohio, 239), suppose the court entertain jurisdiction in this case, and dismiss the bill by'decree on the merits, and the will of Morningstar is afterward offered for probate, will the decree of this court oust the court of probate of jurisdiction? Does the pendency of this bill prevent the court of probate from now acting in the promises?</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-7\">Upon the questions presented, we refer the court to the case of Gaines et ux. <em>v. </em>Chew et ah, 2 How. 619, where tho subject is very fully discussed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b299-8\">Smitii <em>&amp; </em>Probasco, in reply:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-9\">The first point made by defendants\u2019 counsel is, that this court has no jurisdiction of the cause. Without waiving the objection as to the <em>time </em>at which this exception is taken, or the <em>manner </em>of making it, we will proceed at once to consider the argument on that point.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-10\">This assumption rests upon tho ground, that the whole jurisdiction in probate and testamentary matter is, by the constitution and laws of Ohio, vested in tho court of common pleas, sitting as a court of probate. To sustain this view, article 3, section 5, of tho constitution is referred to, which declares that the \u201ccourt of common pleas shall have jurisdiction of all probate and testamentary matters.\u201d Defendants\u2019 counsel seem to have adopted an extraordinary mode of construing the constitution, when they exclude every other part of the instrument. Leaving out the great leading rule of construction, which is t\u00f3 look to the whole instrument, they have, doubtless, been led into this error. Sections 2 and 3 confer upon tho courts of common pleas and Supreme Court chancery powers. What were these powers at the time of the adoption of the constitution? One of them clearly was to establish spoliated, suppressed, and destroyed wills. See 3 Atk. 360; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>1 Bay (S. C.), 464; Legare <em>v. </em>Ashe, 6 Wend. *173; 7 Dana. 90; 11 Wend. 227; 2 How. (U. S.), 619, and numerous other authorities.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b300-4\">Another of those powers was, to compel an account and distribution of a decedent\u2019s estate. These being matters of equitable cognizance, were never intended by the framers of the constitution to be taken from a court of chancery and settled exclusively upon the court of common pleas, as a court of probate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b300-5\">The common pleas having chancery jurisdiction, can not be divested of any portion of that power, unless by the use of expressions wholly inconsistent with the retention of that power. When the convention declared that the court of common pleas should have chancery jurisdiction, it meant such jurisdiction as was ordinarily exercised by such courts. Section 5 is, therefore, to be construed with reference to this previously conferred power; and although the comprehensive term \u201call\u201d is used, it can only mean <em>all powers </em>conferred upon other courts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b300-6\">This view of the constitution harmonizes its provisions. Again, section 5 declares that the common pleas shall have jurisdiction in matters of probate; but, upon the <em>mode </em>of its exercise, the section is silent. Had the legislature failed to direct the mode, that court, from its inherent power, might have prescribed the mode. It might have directed, in all cases where a will was offered for probate, that it should be by proceeding in chancery, or any other convenient mode. IfJ therefore, the power of the common pleas to admit all wills to probate, is exclusive, and, when the legislature fails to direct, may adopt its own mode, we submit to the court, whether the decree of the common pleas, admitting that will to.probate, is not binding upon all the parties, and whether the appeal from that decree, to this court, should not be dismissed ? This conclusion seems to follow legitimately from the premises assumed by the counsel on the other side.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b300-7\">That this court has not entertained such an opinion, in regard to the exclusion of ail other than probate courts from the *determination of testamentary matters, is manifest. If they agreed, in this respect, with defendants\u2019 counsel, we ask, upon what principle did this court entertain the case of Cram et al. <em>v. </em>Green, 6 Ohio, 429? The account and distribution, by executors, of a decedent\u2019s <em>estate, is, </em>without question, <em>a testamentary matter. </em>Being such, the probate court, according to the argument of defer dants\u2019 counsel, had exclusive cognizance of the matter, and no other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>tribunal could entertain it. That very numerous class of cases, growing out of the fiduciary relations of executors and administrators, have -all been improperly decided in equity, if the probate court is an exclusive tribunal. Having attempted to show that the jurisdiction of the probate court is not exclusive, we turn to the statutes, to prove that it has not been so considered in our legislative history. Thus, we have always had a statute providing for an issue of <em>devisavit vel non </em>out of chancery. If the courts of equity are forbidden to entertain jurisdiction of probato matters, how could they try questions of will or no will, by a jury? And how could the Supreme Court, on appeal, try the same question in the same manner?</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b301-5\">Again, if no other than a court strictly probate can decide questions of this kind, how did it happen that the learned gentleman who drew up our statute of wills, and the legislature which enacted it, should insert a provision that, if \u201cthere are not a sufficient number of disinterested judges of the court of common.plcas to 'determine upon the probate of a will, or to determine any other matter touching testamentary matters, intestates\u2019 estates, or the settlement of decedents\u2019 estates,\u201d the court shall certify the matter up to the Supreme Court, who \u201care directed to hear and determine the matter,\u201d and make orders in the premises ? See Statute of Wills (Swan\u2019s Stat.), 994, 995, secs. 17, 22-26, inclusive.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b301-6\">These provisions are legislative constructions of the constitution. The court will sustain them, unless they palpably infringe the provisions of that instrument. The mode of contesting a will, and the correctness and constitutionality of *that mode, have never been questioned. This court have uniformly taken jurisdiction of such cases without hesitation ; its jurisdiction to establish a will is necessarily involved in the statute referred to. If the court possesses jurisdiction in that case, its power in this can not bo questioned. Wo are not aware of any judicial decision under section 17, but we suppose that that section would be sustained.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b301-7\">Passing from this point, let us examine the second: That the court of common pleas, as a court of probate, <em>can take the probate and admit to record, under our statute a Lost or spoliated will.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b301-8\">This to us, we must confess, is untrodden ground. After some years\u2019 acquaintance with judicial proceedings in this state, we have never heard of such an attempt; and no member of the pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>fession with whom we have conversed can refer to an instance of the kind. The opinion seems to be settled and uniform that chancery is the only proper form for such a case. Three cases of <em>this hind </em>are now in the Supreme Court. This is a matter dependent very much upon statutory regulation. It is conceded that such a power is exercised by probate courts in some of the states, and by the ecclesiastical courts in England, in matters of personalty. It would seem, however, that before decisions to that effect in other states are considered as conclusive upon this court, it should be shown that their, statutes in relation to the probate of wills were similar to ours, and then only as an aid in construing our own statuto.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b302-5\">Does our statute contemplate the probate of a lost or destroyed will before the common pleas, <em>as a court of probate? </em>The eourc is restricted to the probate of two kinds of <em>wills </em>\u2014 written and <em>nuncupative. </em>It must be conceded that no <em>express power </em>is conferred by the statute to admit a will to record unless it be <em>produced. </em>Can such power be inferred from the language of the statute? The court <em>must decide </em>either that they, as a <em>court of chancery, </em>have jurisdiction to <em>establish this will, </em>or that a court of probate <em>has full and plenary power to do so. </em>If the latter, then an immense amount of labor \u2019tand expense has been incurred in this case unnecessarily, when during its whole progress, until the present term of this court, the question of <em>jurisdiction </em>has neither been mooted nor questioned. The statuto nowhere alludes to the probate and admission to record of the <em>substance </em>or <em>copy </em>of a will, but to the <em>will itself, </em>which is to bo <em>produced </em>and <em>proven </em>by the subscribing witnesses. If the will is <em>secreted, </em>process is pi-ovided for its production. It is to be <em>filed </em>in the clerk\u2019s office, and <em>recorded </em>with the testimony. A copy of the recorded will is evidence, but not the <em>copy of a copy. </em>Administration with the <em>will </em>annexed may bo granted, but not with a <em>copy.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b302-6\">The only provision for recording a copy of a will is where it has been proven in another state or territory, or where real estate, lying in a county other than the one in which it is proven, is devised by the will. It never could have been the intention of the legislature to render null or invalid wills lost or destroyed, before probate. This doctrine would not be claimed a moment by the learned counsel on the other side; and yet they have made no provision for their probate. They are left, where lost wills and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>spoliated wills were loft, with courts of chancery. In Alabama, 3 Port. 51, referred to in defendants\u2019 brief, the orphans\u2019 court have the right, by statute, to direct an issue and summon a jury to try it. Our court of probate have not that power ; and if, in Massachusetts, the statute is not express, it must result <em>ex necessitate, to </em>protect the rights of the devisees and legatees, there being no other court which can protect them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b303-5\">These views we have thought proper to submit, relative to the proof of a lost will under our statute, before the court of probate. <em>We </em>think we hazard nothing in saying, that the general, if not the <em>uniform </em>opinion of the profession is, that it can not be done, and that the opinion is as universal that chancery has the power, and is the appropriate tribunal to establish a <em>lost or spoliated will. </em>If the matter was doubtful <em>merely, </em>this court, after <em>answers and full proof, </em>no objection having *been made by demurrer to the jurisdiction, would entertain it. See Underhill <em>v. </em>Van Cortlandt, 2 Johns. Ch. 339 ; 1 Ohio, 127 ; Ludlow <em>v. </em>Simond, 2 Caine\u2019s Cases in Error. These cases sustain the principle, that if there be a <em>remedy at law, </em>and the defendant answers instead of demurring to the bill, and the cause comes on to be heard upon the merits, it is <em>too late </em>to object to the jurisdiction of the court, on the ground that complainant has a <em>remedy at law.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b303-6\">In arguing the question, as to the inability of a court of probate in this state to administer adequate relief in a case of this kind, we will not be understood, for one moment, as expressing a doubt of complainants having adequate remedy somewhere. Such a doctrine as that, no one will contend for. The learned counsel for defendants have not intimated any such ground of defense in their argument. Such a defense will not be set up. Their position is, that the court of probate has ample power and authority to administer relief to complainants on their making proper proof. Certainly, no judicial tribunal, and no lawyer, would doubt the proposition, that whore a testator makes a will, with all the requisite solemnities, disposing of his property, and that will has not been revoked, but has been lost, fraudulently spoliated, or destroyed, that such destruction or loss\" would not affect or impair the rights of the devisees under the will. A contrary doctrine would be an insult to public justice. A devise is as sacred an instrument as a deed, bond, or any other instrument conferring rights. No rule of public policy can exclude parol proof of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>contents, when lost or destroyed, any more than the contents of a deed or bond. Every authority, English and American, admit the rights of devisees under a lost or spoliated will, in the most direct and unequivocal terms. It is true that their rights are inchoate, and, in one sense, imperfect, until established before a judicial tribunal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b304-5\">The language of the court of appeals, in Kentucky, in George Payne\u2019s will, 4 Mon. 423, 424, is : \u201c In law, upon the death of the testator, the rights and interests of the ^legatees and devisees wore also completely vested at the instant of the testator\u2019s death, and before probate. The after-loss or destruction of the will, by accident or fraud, can not destroy and divest those vested rights and interests. In this, Wentworth, Swinbourne, Toller, and Powell, adjudged cases, ancient and modern, all agree. The rights and interests of the legatees and devisees are no more lost and destroyed than the rights of a creditor by the accidental loss of his bond, or of the purchaser, by the casual loss of his deed. <em>The devisees take'aspurchasers under a will.\"</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b304-6\">Article 1637 of the civil code of Louisiana declares, that \u201c no testament can have effect unless it has been presented to the judge of the parish in which the testator lived,\u201d etc. The judge shall order the execution of the testament after its being opened and proved. Neither the courts of Louisiana nor the Supreme Court of the United States, in 2 Howard, 619, doubt the rights of devisees under a will lost or destroyed; the only question is, before what tribunal shall the proof be made? We ask the attention of the court\u2019 to the authorities oh that point, referred to in this and our opening argument, and the decided language of the judge delivering the opinion of this court as to the rights of a party under a lost deed, in Lessee of Blackburn <em>v. </em>Blackburn, 8 Ohio, 81and with these remarks, as we are resisting a position not assumed on the other side, we dismiss this branch of the subject with this remark, that jurisdiction is also claimed under another rule, \u2014 that of <em>advancement and recognition of </em>title, <em>disposition by parol possession and improvements </em>by complainants; that the testato.r would have been, and defendants now are estopped, in equity, from sotting up a claim to the real estate described in the bill. See Buckingham et al. <em>v. </em>Smith &amp; Dille, 10 Ohio, 298; 1 Johns. Ch. 350, and cases cited in 10 Ohio.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b304-7\">Should the court be of opinion that, as a court of chancery, they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>have no jurisdiction to establish this will, they must say that a court of probate has; in which event, if in the opinion of the court we have not made a satisfactory case for a decree *on the other branch of the case, we ask the cause to be continued until the application shall be made to the court of probate to prove it. \"Wo do this for the reason that should such application fail, which we do not apprehend, this court may ultimately settle the rights of complainants as to improvements, etc.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b291-11\">Onr statuto attaches no penalty to the malicious destruction of a will \u2014 it is casus omissus.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b305-5\">Birchard, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A3g\">Preliminary to the consideration of any of the many questions which have been so fully litigated in this case, we are called upon to determine whether, in Ohio, a court of chancery has jurisdiction in matters of probate, and may entertain a bill, the sole object of which is to establish and prove a lost or spoliated last will and testament. For it is manifest that if no such po wer exists, it is not required, and would be improper to pass upon any of the facts mooted in this controversy. The sole object of the bill is to establish such lost or spoliated will. Upon this question of jurisdiction, we necessarily have to recur to the original source of all our power, the constitution of the state. Article 3, section 1, vests the judicial power of the state, \u201c both as to matters of law and equity,\u201d \u201cin a Supreme Court, in courts of common pleas for each county, in justices of the peace, and in such other courts as the legislature may, from time to time, establish.\u201d By section 2, the Supremo Court \u201chas original and appellate jurisdiction, <em>both in common law and </em>chancery, in such cases as shall be directed by law.\u201d By section 3, the courts of common pleas, within their respective counties, \u201c have common law <em>and chancery jurisdiction </em>in all cases directed by law.\u201d Section 5 is in these words: \u201c The court of common pleas, in each county, shall have jurisdiction of all probate and testamentary matters, granting administration, the appointment of guardians, and such other cases as shall be prescribed by law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">From one or the other of these several sections, the authority to entertain this bill must be deduced. If not contained there, or if the spirit of those sections and the legitimate legislation ^consistent with them have not conferred it, we shall be forced to say it does not exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">That section 5 authorizes a chancery proceeding in a case like this, is a position that can not be maintained. Its terms con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>fer jurisdiction of ail probate and testamentary matters upon the common pleas courts, and not a word is contained in the instrument in conflict with this general grant of power. <em>\u201c Expressio unius est exclusio atterius,\u201d </em>is a maxim clearly applicable to this section, so far as matters purely of a probate and testamentary char <em>ader are </em>concerned. The express grant of power forbids, by inference, an implied one in connection therewith. The jurisdiction is therefore exclusive as to all matters merely probate in their nature. This opinion is not new in this court. In pronouncing the decision in Hunter\u2019s case, 6 Ohio, 501, Wright, J., commenting upon these articles of the constitution, observes, that they indicate \u201ca determination to keep the ecclesiastical, common-law, and chancery jurisdictions as separate and distinct as our judicial system will permit.;\u201d and, again, that the probate of a will belongs neither to the common-law nor equity jurisdiction conferred upon the court of common pleas, but appertains to the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the English courts, which is specially conferred upon our courts of common pleas as courts of probate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">Again, in 8 Ohio, 19, this language is held : \u201cBy our law, a particular tribunal is appointed to receive probate of will. It does not signify that it is not by name a court of probate \u2014 that it is the court of common pleas, with a probate side to it. The same court has jurisdiction of both chancery and common-law controversies, and yet this mixture of powers would not avail, as an argument, to prove that its equity jurisdiction was different in kind from that of courts of chancery in England.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Consistent with these remarks, and article 3 of the constitution, is the \u201cact to organize the judicial courts.\u201d Sec. 4. \u201cThe court of common pleas shall have power to examine *and take the proof of wills, grant letters testamentary thereon, etc., and to hoar and determine all causes of probate and testamentary nature.\u201d All the chancery powers of that court are granted, in other words.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">The act relating to wills still keeps up and sustains the same separation of jurisdiction. The probate is of the original jurisdiction of that court, and so recognized by the act in which the proof is prescribed, the mode of proceeding, and the effect of the record. And in Swan\u2019s Stat. 996, sec. 33, it is declared, that \u201cno will shall be effectual to pass real or personal estate, unless it shall have been duly admitted to probate,\u201d etc., as provided by the act. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>act makes no mention of any method of establishing a will by a chancery proceeding. The probate is treated as a judicial act at law, binding upon all parties, and final and conclusive upon all parties. There is no appeal from the decision, no writ of error or bill of review; no way of vacating it, except the peculiar one provided by our statute. 9 Ohio, 96; 8 Ohio, 239.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">To test the propriety of encroaching, in any manner, upon a jurisdiction so peculiar, and which, from its nature, ought to be exclusive, let us anticipate some of the difficulties that might flow from entertaining this bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">1. A decree in chancery is not the probate of a will. Hence, a decree establishing a will can not operate to give it vitality, and is utterly powerless; or else section 33 of the statute relating to wills must be taken and held, <em>pro tanto, </em>repealed by the decree. The decree and the statute would speak different language on the same subject. One would say, the will of Morningstar is effectual to pass real and personal property, without admission to probate, as the act provides ; the other, that it is of no effect. The conflict is irreconcilable, and the weaker in the contest must give way.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">Again, what would be the effect, if, after rendering a decree either for or against the validity of the supposed lost will, a real and different will should be produced? Is the litigation a bar to its probate? Does it oust the court of common pleas *of jurisdiction. Might not the will then be called for, be produced, be proved and admitted of record, and would it not be effectual to vest titles according to the devises and bequests of the testator? We think it would, because the chancery proceeding would be regarded wholly <em>coram. non judice </em>and void, and because the statute would enforce its production, and is express as to the effect of the probate.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">But it is urged that the spoliation of the supposed will, with intent to destroy the alleged devises to complainants, affords grounds of equity jurisdiction ; that the power to establish spoliated, suppressed, and destroyed wills was one of the powers known to courts of chancery at the adoption of our constitution ; and sundry authorities are cited to sustain the position. A word as to these:</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">1. The New York cases, by inference at least, if not directly, make against the complainant, Section 63 of their statute (Re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>vised Code, vol. 2, p. 66), confers upon the court of chancery the same power to take the proof of the execution and validity of a lost or destroyed will, and to establish the same, as in the case of lost deeds; and the constitution of the State of New York contained nothing in conflict with the act. The grant of the power, however, shows that the jurisdiction was not then understood as being inherent in the chancery courts, otherwise we should have seen no such specific grant of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">All the other cases cited are commented upon, in the case of Gaines et ux. <em>v. </em>Chew et al., 2 Howard, 647. Those authorities, carefully examined, will show that a court of chancery has no inherent power, either in England or America, to establish a lost will. It is true that the United States Supreme Court did not, professedly, decide the point. They, however, did decide that a will must be proved before a title could be set up under it, and that, by the general law, a court of probate must take the proof (p. 646), and a discovery was oi\u2019dered in that ease, as it would seem, for no other purpose than to aid the appropriate probate tribunal in establishing the *lost will. If we have correctly comprehended the subject, there is no ground to sustain this bill. It is not framed for the purpose of a discovery, in aid of a probate court. Its only basis of relief is under a supposed title, which can not be made manifest in this court without showing the will itself, duly admitted to probate, which it seeks to have established, and which can not here be established; and should it ever become a matter of probate, there will then be no cause for sustaining the bill, inasmuch as the remedy at law in that event will be plain and adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">Again, it is further said that the remedy must be in chancery because the statute has pointed out no mode of proving a spoliated will; and we,are asked if there can be so great a wrong as the destruction of a paper divesting another of title, and vesting it in the fraudulent spoliator, without a remedy? In general, it may be said that there is no wrong without a remedy; and were we to say that this case was not without a remedy, it would not follow that this is that remedy. It may be that the court of common pleas, by the grant of power in article 3, section 5, of the constitution, is clothed with general powers adequate to give the appropriate relief; if not, the legislature can clothe those courts with ample power. It is sufficient for us to say that, in either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>event, this court will not have appellate jurisdiction, as from a court of probate, to revise their decision. Nor till after the will shall have been proved, approved, and admitted to record, can this court act in any manner touching or concerning its validity, and then only in the manner prescribed by statute. That mode of proceeding will not have for its object to establish the will, but to determine whether it may or may not have been improperly established by a competent court.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">As the question should have been presented by demurrer to the bill, the expense incurred by respondents has been made in their own wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">Bill dismissed, each party to pay their own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
