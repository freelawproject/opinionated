The object of the parties was to enable Kratzer to make a loan of this sum, and the makers were his sureties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b482-9\">Upon this note, Putnam brought a several action, on October 1, 1810, in the Fairfield common pleas, against Williamson, upon which he obtained a judgment in the Supreme Court for $2,781 and costs of suit, on July 18, 1814.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b482-10\">On January 28, 1817, Williamson paid $1,000, and on the 10th of April, in the same year, $200, upon this judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b482-11\">In November, 1836, Putnam revived the judgment against the complainants, who paid, on September 6, 1845, the said sum of $5,664.48, in part saoisfaction of the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b482-12\">All the parties to the note were dead at the filing of the bill. Neil, Hampson, Lynch, Kratzer and Elijah Friend died insolvent. David Rees died solvent: Charles Friend leaving 120 acres of land, which descended to his eleven children, who, in person or by their representatives, are made defendants, and was sold on proceedings in partition, and the proceeds, amounting to $2,244.21, equally divided between them, in August, 1831, which sum, added to the moneys received of the administrator on the final settlement of the estate, in 1831, makes the sum received by each of the eleven heirs to his estate amount to $204.42.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b482-13\">The estates of all the other signers to the note wore settled long prior to the filing of this bill, and were insufficient to pay the claims presented against them. No claim for contribution was ever prescnted to any of the obligors while living, nor ever *made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>against their estates prior to 1845, about the time this suit was commenced.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b483-5\">John T. Brazee, for complainants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b483-6\">Assuming that Williamson- and the six other signers of the note were accommodation makers for Kratzer, the payee, it can not be seriously contended that he, being the principal, would under existing circumstances, be protected by the statute of limitations or presumption of payment, Whenever a surety pays money for his principal, it is money paid for his use, and the surety has an immediate and present cause of action against his principal. Rodman <em>v. </em>Hedden, 10 Wend. 502.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b483-7\">The principal, therefore, could not avail himself of the statute of limitations or presumption of payment, as against his surety.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b483-8\">As to these co-contractors, the debt ought to be regarded as an entire thing, wholly indivisible, and if subsisting as to one, as to all; so that the compulsory payment by one would entitle him to contribution against the others. It has been long established as the law in England and the United States, that where there are a plurality of contractors, sureties or principals, joint or several, that the act of one of the debtors, in acknowledging the validity of the debt, or in promising to pay the debt, or in making . partial payments upon it, takes it out of the statute of limitations as to all the other parties to the liability.

The cause of action accrued while the statute of 1804 was in force, and under that statute there was no limitation to the action of debt on simple contract. Tupper\u2019s Ex\u2019rs v.

As to him, the cause of action accrued when ho paid the money in 1815. The liability of the others to contribute is founded in equity, and not upon contract.

Swayne submitted arguments for the various defendants, and contended:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b484-7\">That whether the action of debt could have been sustained by Putnam on this note, notwithstanding the statute of limitations, or not, was immaterial, inasmuch as chancery would, as well as courts of law, regard the statute as of binding force, and apply it to paper of this description after the lapse of fifteen years. This not being an action of debt, but a bill in chancery, the defendants might protect themselves by the statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b484-8\">They denied that the law was settled that the voluntary acknowledgment, either with or without a proviso to pay, by one joint contractor, interrupted the running of the statute as to the other co-contractors, and referred to the following authorities : *Kirby, 203; 1 Root, 502; 10 Johns. 216; Kirby, 174; 8 Pick. 122; 10 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 75, 81; 3 McCord, 340; 5 Har. &amp; Johns. 1; 6 Conn. 170, 174, 175; 5 Har. <em>&amp; </em>Johns. 51; 3 Cow. 623; 1 Esp.

This presumption of payment is a presumption of law, and stands ever as a perfect barrier between the \"person seeking to enforce the remedy and him against whom it is sought to be enforced \u2014 in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>case as well against Williamson as it would against Putnam himself. It would be absurd to hold them bound to pay a debt indirectly which they did not owe directly.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b485-5\">Whatever discharges the principal will discharge the contingent collateral liability of the surety. When Kratzer, the principal, ceased to be liable, by operation of the statute, or presumption of payment <em>ipso facto, </em>his sureties were discharged, and that discharge is as binding and operative upon all concerned as though they had been discharged by the direct act of the creditor himself. Theob. on Pr. &amp; Sur. 204; 3 Dana, 160.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b485-6\">Birchard, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AbL\">Several questions, growing out of the facts of this case, have been argued with much skill by counsel. In disposing of the subject we shall notice only those which seem to bo conclusive of the merits of the ease. And, first, can this bill be sustained on the ground that complainant has paid ^money for the use of the defendants .as co-surety or otherwise ? This depends upon the question whether, at the time of payment, any claim for a portion or the whole of the sum due could have been enforced by Putnam against either of them, for where there is no direct there can be no indirect liability. It seems that Putnam, in 1842, made the attempt to collect of Eees and Hampson, and went so far as to ascertain that the plea of the statute of limitations, passed in 1804, was not a bar, and, by a division of this court, that the subsequent statutes were not operative upon the claim. 12 Ohio, 21. The cases progressed no further.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">It remains for us to consider whether, upon the facts now in proof, any recovery could have been obtained, legally, against any of the parties. The obligation was due December 7, 1807, more than thirty-eight years ago. Putnam treated it as a several contract in 1810. The election he then made was conclusive upon him. As to him, and all claiming under him, from that time forward, the right which he had against each signor, was the same as if the name of each had been affixed to a separate note for the same amount. It was out of his,power, having thus elected to treat the contract as several, to come into court at any time thereafter, and sue upon it as a joint obligation. Without the aid of any statute, it seems to us that either Eees, Friend, or Hampson, might have relied successfully upon the great lapse of time, as raising the presumption that their obligation had been in some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>way discharged. At law, twenty years was sufficient to raise the presumption of payment. These presumptions are of such a character as naturally to increase in force, in proportion as the years increase during which they have run. And in this case it would, without the aid of evidence sufficient to rebut it, have been a complete bar eighteen years ago. Now, what is relied upon to do away the force of the legal presumptions that have been thus long increasing in strength ? \u2014 the fact that Williamson alone was sued, and judgment recovered, in 1814, and that this judgment against him was not paid off till 1845. Besides this there is '-^substantially nothing. But he had paid $1,200 in 1817, and after that more than twenty years elapsed before any of these parties were called on for payment. What caused such a delay? Why was the claim left sleeping till all those who, when living, knew the whole and true history of the transaction, were in their graves? The papers furnish no satisfactory answer, and, for want of that, a court of law should have said, \u201cLet the claim sleep on foreverthat \u201c the inference is, that if it had been prosecuted in due time, some of its cotemporaries would have been able to furnish evidence showing that it had been paid, discharged, released, or in some way arranged between the parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AcSf\">It may be that Williamson, for a good consideration, assumed the payment of the entire debt prior to 1810. If so, it could not bo expected that the administrators or heirs of his deceased coobligors, after thirty-six years, would be able to make it appear. It is contrary to all human experience to expect any proof from them, or to imagine that they could by any vigilance establish the fact. Yet the parties, while living, acted as we might expect them to act if such were the case. In this connection, let us see how conclusive against the presumption, arising from a lapse of time, would be the fact that the separate suit had been prosecuted against Williamson. Prom 1817, \u2014 the time of the last payment by him \u2014 no movement was made toward a further collection. Had a separate suit been instituted as early as 1828, the judgment and proceedings upon it would not have tended to weaken the legal presumption of payment. On the contrary it would, in our opinion, have added to its strength, by showing a sufficient reason why Putnam suffered the residue of that judgment to become dormant. Ho permitted to happen precisely what would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>happened on payment of the residue of the note by one of the other makers.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Wo hold, then, that in 1845, when the $5,661 was paid to Putnam, it was not paid on the account of the co-sureties, or on a then subsisting joint obligation; that all such relations between the parties bad long before become extinct and ceased *to exist; that the money paid was in discharge of' complainant\u2019s sole liability, and gave him no right to call upon respondents for contribution. Bill dismissed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
