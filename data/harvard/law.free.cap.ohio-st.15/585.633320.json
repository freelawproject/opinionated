The declaration contains the common counts, to which the defendant plead the general issue. The cause came on for trial at the September term, 1846, of the Supreme Court for Summit county; was *submittcd to a jury, who found a verdict for the plaintiff of $510, upon which the court rendered judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b493-6\">During the progress of the trial the following bill of exceptions was taken:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b493-7\">\u201cBo it remembered that, at the term aforesaid, this cause came on for trial to the jury, upon the pleadings on file. It appeared in evidence that, in the fall of the year 1840, Standart, Griffith <em>&amp; </em>Co., commission merchants of Cleveland, Ohio, contracted with the plaintiff, William Treat, who was a boat-builder at Euclid, in Cuyahoga county, Ohio, for two canal-boats, one to be called the Etna, and the other the Hope, to bo delivered to them, the said Standart, Griffith &amp; Co., at Cleveland, at and for the price of \u00a71,075 each. Under said contract the said boat Etna was delivered on April 24, 1841, and the boat Hope on May 4, 1841. It further appeared from the admissions of the plaintiff, as proved by the oath of one witness, that the contract was, that Standart, Griffith &amp; Co. should furnish whatever materials the plaintiff should want from their hardware store, and pay him \u00a7500 on the delivery of the boats. The balance was to be paid by Griffith, Standart &amp; Co. as the boats earned it, and plaintiff did not expect the whole of his pay that year; that they paid him, however, only $25 on the delivery of the boat Etna, and \u00a775 on the delivery of the boat Hope, and that there was still due, on both boats, more than \u00a7800; that Standart, Griffith &amp; Co. did furnish the materials out of the hardware store, as per agreement; that soon after the delivery of the boat Etna, as aforesaid, Standart, Griffith <em>&amp; </em>Co. sold and transferred her to the firm of Standart, Chamberlin &amp; Co., who wore millers at Akron, Ohio, and received their pay for the same, on July 31, 1841, at \u00a71,075, by charging that sum in account \u2014 Chamberlin being informed that the boat was not paid for. Standart and Griffith, of Cleveland, were also partners in the Akron firm of Standa-rt, Chamberlin &amp; Co., composed of Standart,. Griffith, P. Chamberlin, and S. *A. Wheeler. It further ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>peared that Standart, Griffith &amp; Co., from the delivery of the boats, as aforesaid, continued to make payments to the plaintiff until March 6,1848, when said payments amounted to $1,391.25. About this time the firm of Standart, Griffith &amp; Co. failed; and, on June 8, 1843, the plaintiff instituted the present suit. It further appeared that, on Juno 6, 1842, the firm of Standart, Chamberlin &amp; Co., being then indebted to one J. D. Cummins, in a large amount, for cash advanced for the purchase of wheat, executed a mortgage of said boat Etna, then in their possession, to secure to said J. D. Cummins the payment of $1,500. Afterward, and on May 24, 1843, the said J. D. Cummins commenced his suit at law, in the court of common pleas of Summit county, against said Standart, Chamberlin &amp;.Co., upon said claim; obtained judgment at the September term, a. d. 1843, on which he caused execution to be issued and levied upon said boat Etna, and purchased the same at sheriff\u2019s sale, on April 20, 1844. Upon this testimony it was claimed by counsel for defendant that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover, as no liability attached to the boat Etna, under the act entitled \u2018 an act providing for the collection of claims against steamboats and other water-craft, and authorizing proceedings against the same by name,\u2019 and requested the court to charge the jury accordingly. But the court instructed the jury that, if they found, from the evidence, that the plaintiff built the boat by contract for Standart, Griffith &amp; Co., at a specific price, and delivered her under that contract, a liability attached to the boat, in favor of the plaintiff, under the act aforesaid, and the plaintiff was entitled to recover in this suit.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-5\">To this opinion and instruction of the court, the counsel for defendant excepted, and now assigns for error the ruling of the court, as stated in the bill of exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AC6\">*R. P. Spalding, for plaintiff in error, insisted:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b494-7\">That the case did not come within the provision of the statute; that Treat himself was the owner of the boat, till delivered, and during the' process of building, and the labor performed by him was, in fact, done for himself; and that he no more had a lien or claim upon her than exists in all cases of a sale of a boat, \u2014 he referred to 6 Wend. 510.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b494-8\">S. J. Andrews and R. Hitchcock, for defendant, contended:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b494-9\">\u25a0 That this was one of the very cases intended to be reached by the statute, which was founded in principles of public policy, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>adapted to the wants and progress of a commercial state, and was designed to encourage ship-building, by furnishing for the builder ample security for his debt, and an efficient remedy for its collection, when due, thereby enabling him to give, and his employer to obtain, a more liberal credit than would otherwise have been admissible; and that the word \u201c owner \u201d should be construed to moan, as between the contracting parties, him who, on the completion of the vessel, was to be the owner. They denied that the case from Wendell was analogous to the case at bar.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b495-5\">Birchard, J.</author>\n<p id=\"At4B\">To understand the proper application of the act of February 26,1840, under which the action arises, it is necessary to take it as an entire thing, to construe its several provisions together, and, also, to have regard to the reason and objects of the law. In itself, it is a beneficial statute, deserving a liberal construction for the purpose of advancing those objects. But while considerations of this nature are borne in mind, it is equally the duty of the court to so far restrain their desire to promote its beneficial objects as to stop short of a construction so free as to lead to manifest absurdities. The claim *of the defendant in error was for the debt due for \u201c materials, supplies, and labor,\u201d expended in building the canal-boat Etna. The statute makes the boat liable for such debts, when contracted by the owner on account of the boat. These are the words :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-6\">\u201c That steamboats and other water-crafts navigating the waters within or bordering upon this state, shall be liable for debts contracted on account thereof, by the master, owner, steward, consignee, or other agent, for materials, supplies, or labor in the building, repairing, furnishing, or equipping the same,\u201d etc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-7\">Upon the trial, the court instructed the jury that \u201c if they found, from the evidence, that the plaintiff, Treat, built the boat by contract for Standart, Griffith &amp; Co. at a sjmeifie price, and delivered her under that contract, a liability attached to the boat in favor of said plaintiff, under .the act of February 26, 1840, entitled \u2018an act providing for the collecting of claims against steamboats, and other water-crafts, and authorizing proceedings against the same by name,\u2019 and the plaintiff was entitled to recover in this suit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">To test the accuracy of this charge, let us consider who was the owner of the Etna up to the time of the delivery. Treat had contracted to build her and deliver her at a particular time. Before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>tho delivery she was, undoubtedly, his property. He was the owner and had the absolute control of her. He might have broken her up at any moment, and a sale and transfer by him to any stranger would have vested in that stranger a valid legal title. If transferred without notice of the contract between him and Stand-art, Griffith &amp; Co., the purchasers would have had a perfect title to the boat \u2014 one that nothing could have affected, save the debts which Treat himself had contracted as <em>owner, </em>for supplies, etc., furnished in building the Etna. For those debts the boat was liable, and a transfer by Treat to any person, or under any circumstances, without notice of those debts or the assent expressly or tacitly given by them, would not have prevented Standart, Griffith &amp; Co., or the hands that Habored upon tho boat, in assisting to build her, from attaching and selling her under the statute, to satisfy their claims. The object of the act was to provide a remedy for those who otherwise might bo defrauded, hindered, or delayed in collecting their just claims, and to save them tho inconvenience of seeking out the owners and subjecting them to the payment of the debts contracted by their authority. Looking to this object and to the facts of the case, all difficulty about the law or its application vanishes. Treat could not recover. His claim was not for a debt contracted for labor, supplies, or materials in the building of the boat. A debt can not exist without a debtor and a creditor. It is something which grows out of a contract, and to every contract there must be two parties \u2014 the contractor who is to be bound by it, and the contractoe to whom he is bound. Treat could not contract with himself to furnish himself materials for his own boat, any more than he could sue himself for breaking such a contract. Both ideas arc absurd; one not more so than the other. His claim, then, is simply a claim for the price due upon the sale and delivery of the boat, and does not come within the letter or spirit of the statute. Hero I should stop but for the fact that different opinions, at times, have been held by other members of this court. As that difference may still exist, and tend to throw doubts upon the law, a further examination on my part, may subserve the public good.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">The statute presupposes that the person having a demand for work, labor, and materials against a boat, has a right of action at the same time, and co-extensive therewith, against somo third party, as owner, It provides that such party, on the soizure of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>the boat, by giving bond, may release the boat, and that after trial, and sale of the boat, if its proceeds are insufficient to satisiy the judgment, the balance shall \u201cremain to be collected on execution, as on other judgments.\u201d Swan\u2019s Stat. 210, secs. 5, 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">In this case let us suppose that after tho completion of the boat Etna, Treat had held her as his own from the fall of the *ycar until the opening of navigation in the ensuing M.ay, and then made tho delivery to Standart, Griffith &amp; Co. Where would have been the liability of the boat for his labor and materials in the meantime? It attached, if at all, the moment the labor was performed and tho materials were furnished. If it attached then, tho delivery or non-delivery could have had no effect upon it. Treat was then the owner, and he contracted the liability, if it existed, with himself, <em>as owner. </em>He could not contract with himself. The boat could not contract with him; it had no faculty that would enable it to do so. Not intimating that the notion I am combating is an absurdity too palpable to find advocates, let us suppose that, before the delivery of the boat, in the case I have supposed, Treat had attached it for the labor by him performed in building it, and proceeded, in the form prescribed by tho statute, to a condemnation and sale, and that the Etna had passed into the hands of a purchaser from the sheriff for ten dollars, leaving the residue of the judgment unsatisfied. Against whom would the balance of that judgment have \u201c remai ned to be collected on execution ?\u201d Not against Standart, Griffith <em>&amp; </em>Co. They were not to be fiable for anything until the boat was delivered to them; and in the supposed case there was no delivery. The plain meaning of the statute is, that tho balance shall bo a good judgment against the one who was, in fact, the debtor at the making of the contract for the labor and materials, that is, <em>Win. Treat, the owner of the boat. </em>So that upon the theory of Mr. Treat\u2019s counsel, he would be both plaintiff in execution and defendant in execution to the same identical execution. A construction of the statute that works such results will derive but slight support from the members of the profession, and, I- should hope, but little countenance anywhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">The charge of the court was therefore erroneous, and the judgment must be reversed. The claim was not for expenses incurred in building; it was for the balance of the contract price, and does not differ, in substance, from any balance that might be duo from</p>\n<p id=\"AV7q\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>any purchaser to the vendor on an ordinary *sale and delivery.of a boat. Such vendor can always secure himself before the delivery of the boat.</p>\n<judges id=\"b498-5\">Hitchcock, J., having beeen of counsel with Treat, took no part in this decision.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b498-6\">Read, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AVU8\">dissenting. I dissent in this case. The construction given to the statute by two judges of the court, in effect, destroys the main object of the statute. The largest interest intended to be secured under the statute is that of builders. But under the construction now given, a builder can never hold the boat liable; because it is said the boat is his up to the delivery, and the statute furnishes no remedy against himself. It is said the boat is the property of the builder, if built under a contract; and hence the builder can have no claim upon the boat underthis act. Now, the result is, that as against the person for whom the boat is built, no remedy for building, for materials furnished, or for labor, exists. If the right exists at all, it is against the builder. A builder nan never, in this view, have the remedy given by this act. To give him'this remedy, the person for whom the boat is built must be treated in fact as the builder; and the mechanic or builder must be treated as a mere laborer, and as such he may claim the remedy of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">Now, under this view, all the builders of steamboats and canal-boats, upon the rivers, lakes, and canals in our state, have no claim upon the boat under this act. Such never was the intention of the legislature. The legislature designed that the moment a claim sprung up against the person for whom the boat was built, materials furnished, or labor performed, the boat itself might be pursued under the act. The construction now given not only violates the plain object and intent of the act, but its very words ; for the act makes the boat liable to the builder, while under the construction given by two of the judges, a builder never can have any remedy under it. It is surprising that any one ever should have supposed that small ^claims, arising on account of the boat, aro carefully secured by this act, when the more meritorious and larger claims, for actually building the boat, \u00e1re not embraced.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">Such a construction does violence to the main object and intent of the act, and also to its express letter.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
