This position is believed to be abundantly sustained by the following authorities: 1 Chit. Crim.

The court erred in sending out the jury to consider of their verdict, without placing them under the care of a sworn officer. The matter is not mended by tho fact, that tho sheriff conducted the jury to their room, and then left them in charge of one constable, who, in turn, handed them over to another, but neither of whom was sworn.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b63-4\">It is no part of the official duty of the sheriff or a constable to take charge of juries while they are considering their verdict., They derive their power from the court, and act in obedience to its orders.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b63-5\">The custody and care of juries belong to the court; they may exercise their discretion as to the manner in which they shall be kept.

Swan\u2019s Stat. 395. The law presumes that, in the absence of such an oath, the jury will be tampered with, and it is for that reason that the oath is required. Can this presumption be rebutted by proof? We hold that it can not. But if it can, are <em>ex parte </em>affidavits to be taken as conclusive?</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b64-7\">We may deny the facts stated in the affidavits, and ask that the witnesses may be sworn \u201c to tell the whole truth.\u201d We demand an opportunity to cross-examine them; we offer evidence to contradict them; we demand compulsory process to compel the attendance of witnesses.

That the jury were allowed to separate during the progress of the trial.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b66-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>It seems to me this is not an open question since the ease of Sargeant <em>v. </em>The State, 11 Ohio, 472. The court held in that case that \u201c in both oivil and criminal cases the court may, in their discretion, during the progress of a trial, permit the jury to disperse for the purpose of obtaining food and rest; but in no case can the jury, after they have retired to consider of their verdict, bo permitted to separate and disperse until they have agreed.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_y\">*2. That the court erred in suffering the jury to retire to consider of their verdict, without placing them under the care of a sworn officer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b66-6\">There is no pretense of any misconduct on the part of the jury \u2014 of any separation, or of any access to them from without. On the contrary, it appears by affidavits made part of the transcript, that they were kept in their room up to the time of their agreement, and were then immediately conducted into the court and delivered their verdict.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b66-7\">As to the objection that no special oath was administered to the sheriff in relation to the custody of this jury, I am not aware of any practice of swearing a sheriff in such' cases. In some circuits it is usual to administer such an oath to the constable in attendance upon the court. This oath is in the old form of the English practice. We have no statutory provision which requires it. At the best it is but a mere form, as is said by this court in the State <em>v. </em>Engles, 13 Ohio, 492.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b66-8\">3. The remaining assignment of error is, that the court orred in passing a judgment of conviction against the said Martha Davis, who was proven to be in company with <em>her husband </em>at the time of the commission of the offense.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b66-9\">The only answer that need be given to this assignment is, that it assumes a fact not warranted by the transcript. There is no proof that Martha Davis was the wife of William Davis. The testimony relied upon by the counsel for plaintiffs in error to establish the marriage is thus summed up by him: \u201cIn the first place they have the same name; address each other as husband and wife\u201d <em>(videlicet, </em>she once called him <em>\u201cmy dear\u201d); </em>\u201cwere treated as husband and wife by the landlord in Port Jefferson, by the officer who arrested them, and the tavern-keeper where they stayed the night after the arrest, and by the sheriff from the time of their commitment until their trial.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b66-10\">But if such testimony even tended to establish the fact of mar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>riage, the supposed wife had all the benefit of it. No part of it was excluded by the court. It seems it did not satisfy the jury.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b67-5\">Lawrence, upon the same side:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b67-6\">1.

The refusal to grant a new trial is in the discretion of the court below, but is-not examinable on error. 2 Pet. Dig. 549, citing United States <em>v. </em>Gillies, Pet. C. C. 159. The case of McKinney <em>v. </em>Illinois, 3 Law Jour., No. 11, was decided under a statute of Illinois.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b67-7\">2. The judgment will not be reversed because the constables were not specially sworn. The authorities cited show that, without proof of misconduct on the part of the jury, their verdict will not be set aside, even where they disperse after having retired to consider of their verdict (as is said in a case referred to above)\u2014 even \u201cin a capital case, contrary to the directions of the court.\u201d If such separation of the jury will not, <em>per se, </em>set aside their verdict, the fact that a constable had charge of the jury without being specially sworn will not avoid a verdict without proof of misconduct. No statute requires them to be sworn; such is not the practice in Ohio; but our law (Swan\u2019s Stat. 39) recognizes them as officers of court. Besides, the record shows that the jury were \u201cin the custody of the sheriff,\u201d and he is the executive officer of the court, and *as such properly had charge of the jury. It is well settled that all presumptions of improper conduct on the part of the jury may be rebutted, and it is done in this case by the affidavits made part of the record.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b67-8\">3. This court will not review the discretion exercised by the common pleas in refusing a new trial, so as to permit Martha Davis to make more full proof of her marriage. New trials rest in the sound discretion of the court below, and its exercise in that court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>will not be reviewed. United States <em>v. </em>Grillies, Pet. C. O. 159. Nor can this court infer that there was no evidence rebutting the legal presumption that Martha Davis committed the crime under the coercion of her husband. It will bo presumed that the court and jury had that evidence and did their duty. 3 W. Law Jour. 491, No. 11. The whole evidence is not set out in the bill of exceptions. If Martha Davis proved her marriage, the jury found 'that the presumption of coercion was rebutted. If she did not prove it, and if it does not so appear here, there is nothing on which this court can act to grant a new trial. If that defense was not made, it is now too late to make it. Any other rule would encourage a defendant to hold in reserve apart of his defense, and would lead to endless new trials.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b68-5\">Read, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AgA\">The errors complained of are, in substance, a violation of law in the conviction of Martha Davis ; a non-observance of the rules of conducting a criminal prosecution ; and a refusal to grant her a new trial for the causes set forth in her affidavit. These errors look to the entire discharge of Martha Davis, and a new trial as to one or both.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">As to the entire discharge of Martha Davis. It is claimed that she was the wife of William Davis, and joined with him in the commission of the crime, and therefore was not guilty,.as the law presumes that she acted by the command and coercion of her husband. The legal principle claimed for her benefit is admitted; but the fact of coverture, necessary to bring her within its operation, was not established. The fact of her ^being the wife of William Davis, was submitted to the jury and found against her. Hence her conviction was legal. True, the facts and circumstances tending to prove her marriage, were objected to by the prosecuting attorney after being detailed in evidence, but the record does not show that they were ruled out or withdrawn from the consideration of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">As to the error in refusing to grant a new trial. New trials are granted for some error or misconduct in the conducting of a trial, or for facts or circumstances which lie without the record, but which, when established, induce the belief that the accused has not had a full and fair opportunity to disprove the charge, or to claim the benefit of those safeguards and principles secured by the law to every person upon trial for crime. Motions for new trials are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>said to be addressed to the sound discretion of the court, and its decision upon such motions will not be disturbed by a revising court. This depends upon the grounds upon which the motion for a new trial rests.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">If a new trial be asked because of error in the proceedings, which appear of record, and it be refused, it is error, and the judgment will be reversed. But if the grounds of the new trial are matters of fact which are extrinsic to the record, and are to be established by proof other than the record, the credibility of witnesses and the effect of the evidence is necessarily submitted to the court. If they find against the facts claimed, and refuse a new trial, such finding and refusal are the legitimate exercise of a discretion reposed, which is final, and can not be reviewed or reversed. Of such nature was the application of Martha Davis for a new trial, for the grounds set forth in her affidavit made after verdict, that she was a married woman, and could establish the fact if permitted the opportunity, on a new trial. The court undoubtedly were not satisfied that her statements were true, looking to the whole evidence as disclosed on the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">As to the errors claimed to have been committed in the mode of conducting the prosecution. It is claimed as error that the jury were permitted to separate and disperse during *the progress of the trial, and before verdict, and were not sent out in charge of an officer specially sworn, when they retired to consider of their verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">Whether jurors shall be permitted to disperse during the progress of a trial, is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the court. It is no longer an open question. This was decided in the case of Sargeant <em>v. </em>State of Ohio, 11 Ohio, 474; and also in the case of the State of Ohio <em>v. </em>Engles, 13 Ohio, 492. In the latter case it was decided, furthermore, that the jury might be permitted to disperse after they had agreed, and return a sealed verdict. The reasons for relaxing antiquated strictness are fully given by the court in those cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">It is said that the officer having charge of the jury when they retired to consider of their verdict was not specially sworn.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-9\">The jury retired under the charge of the sheriff. He is an officer sworn to discharge his duty \u2014 and to take charge of all juries constitutes a part of his duties. It is not necessary to administer to him an oath to discharge his whole duty, and a special oath to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>discharge each particular duty. One of the objects of administering the special oath to officers having charge of juries, in ancient times, appeared to be to secure an observance of those senseless and harsh measures which looked oftentimes to the compelling of a verdict by physical suffering, rather than a conviction of reason, which both officer and jury were disposed to disregard. That has passed away, and with it the means resorted to to enforce it. Jurors are now considered as honest men, disposed to discharge the obligations of their oath and do justice, and it is not going very far to presume that they would resist all efforts to corrupt them by improper influences, as much as a sworn constable.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">But in this case there appears to be nothing wrong, even in form. It is not claimed that there was, in point of fact. So far as the jury were concerned, it appears to be conceded that they acted honestly and fairly. The sheriff, who was the proper officer, took the jury in charge. The fact that he permitted a ^constable, who was in attendance on the court, to watch the door in his temporary absence, we do not think such a violation of principle as would demand a new trial. Besides, under the statute, the sheriff is entitled to the assistance of constables during the term of court, and when so acting he is bound by his official oath, and need not be specially sworn. Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
