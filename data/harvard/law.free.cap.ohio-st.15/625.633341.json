M.

We do not mean a tax in its litoral sense, but a chai'ge for the use of the streets paved, repaired and cleaned at the expense of the corporation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b527-9\">In this view, there is a perfect analogy to the case of City of Cincinnati <em>\u00b6. </em>Buckingham, 10 Ohio, 257. The power conferred as to markets was, \u201cto erect, establish, and regulate\u201d them. \u201cThe due regulation of a market,\u201d said Judge Lane, \u201cdemands the expenditure of money, and the levying of the tolls upon the sellers in market for the purpose of meeting these expenses, incurred mostly for their benefit, is practiced by all municipal corporations. . . . . The *sum exacted for the purpose by this ordi- . ,nance is called, by the defendant\u2019s counsel, a tax upon the sale of commodities brought to market; it is, rather, the price demanded for accommodations provided to the frequenters of the market by the city authorities.\u201d This very principle, <em>mutatis verbis, </em>ought to decide the present case. To regulate the drays of the city, and the streets, demands an expenditure of money; and a toll levied upon the owners of drays used in transportation for hire, is as \u25a0universal as tolls levied upon market people are. The draymsen, and cartmen, and hackney coachmen are those who wear out the pavements of Cincinnati, and cause the heaviest expense to the corporation and its citizens. The sum exacted upon a license is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>the sum chargod by the corporation for the accommodation of streets thus provided them, and justice requires that they should pay it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b528-5\">But the defendant was fined for using his dray to transport goods and receiving hire, without a license. Now, unquestionably, the city may demand, by this section of the charter, that no one shall so use hia dray without a license, else improper persons might engage in the business, which it is the very object of this section of the charter to prohibit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b528-6\">And we take it to bo equally so, that the corporation may require draymen to pay the expense of the licenses, if only to compensate the city for the cost of printed or written forms, and the time of the city officers employed, and for nothing else.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b528-7\">Now, if the sum charged for a license be more than necessary to defray those expenses, a <em>certiorari </em>to review the conviction of a man who never took out a license at all, is not the method to reach that question. The error complained of, upon a writ of <em>certiorari, </em>must affirmatively appear of record \u2014 not be made out by extrinsic proof, much less by suggestions of counsel or the court. Clements \u00bb. Benjamin, 12 Johns. 299. There is nothing here to show that more than a sum necessary for the very purpose mentioned, was over exacted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b528-8\">The defendant might have taken out his license, and afterward, in an action to recover the sum charged above the ^necessary expenses, the question might arise, but surely not in a proceeding of this kind.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b528-9\">And so, if the city has no right to demand a single cent, the defendant can not here contest the question; for as much of the ordinance as requires him to take out a license, is clearly authorized by the charter, and for violating that provision he was fined.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b528-10\">An ordinance may be good in part, though void as to the residue.

The powers of a corporation are to be strictly construed. 7 Ohio, 35, pt. 2. The act of incorporation is the law of the city. By the original charter, the city was called into being. By the amended acts, its vitality has been continued, and to them must wo look for a definition of the powers possessed by the city council. An ordinance of the city must be founded upon some power expressly granted therein, or its provisions must be necessary and proper to carry into effect the powers granted. This is a general rule of law, corresponding with section 38 of the act of March 1,1834, incorporating the city. The ordinance under consideration is neither justified by the words, nor is it necessary and proper to carry into effect any clause of the act. It can not be sustained under the powers conferred upon the city council by section 8. Those are general in their terms, such as are possessed by all cities, and not intended to reach an occupation like draying, which is neither pernicious nor immoral.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b529-5\">*Where specific reference is made to the subject in a subsequent portion of the charter, language so undefined will not confer more authority than the subsequent specific grant, nor, in fact, could this section be construed to embrace any other right than that which is contained in the clause upon the subject of drays.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b529-6\">We must turn, we suppose, to section 13, and upon this the counsel for the city has rested his claim. That section empowers the city council to \u201c license and regulate all carts, wagons, drays,\u201d etc. What is the meaning of these terms? The power to regulate drays is the power to prescribe the rules or laws by which drays are to be governed. Such is the common acceptation of the term, and such the definition given in Gibbons <em>v. </em>Ogden, 9 Wheat. 190, and Buffalo and Niagara Falls Railroad Co. <em>v. </em>Buffalo, 5 Hill, 211. The power to license drays is the power to permit or authorize drays to run. \u201c The word \u2018 license\u2019 means permission or authority, and a license to do any particular thing is a permission or authority to do that thing; and if granted by a person having power to grant it, transfers to that grantee the right to do whatever it purports to authorize.\u201d Gibbons <em>v. </em>Ogden, 9 Wheat. 213. The city council, therefore, can authorize drays to run, and prescribe tho rules by which they are governed when running. No power is given to exact money for their permission. If it is discretionary with thorn to withhold that permission, that discretion must be a sound one. They must act from convictions of right; should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>neither be quickened nor influenced by a payment of money, either to themselves or to the city.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b530-5\">We do not deny that incident to the power of license may be the right to charge reasonable fees for the labor of the different officers in issuing the certificate and license, as in 14 Wend 89; but the ordinance does not purport to provide for this ; the money does not go to the officers, and it is far more than they would have any right to demand. It passes into the city treasury, is received by the terms of the ordinance for the use of the city, and the sum charged for licenses, under the ^section we are considering, is more than sufficient to pay the salaries of all the officers of the city. It is, in fact, not a demand of a compensation for servicos rendered, not a police regulation, but a plan devised with the sole intent of swelling the revenues of the city.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b530-6\">The form in which this money is exacted does not change its character as a tax. Says Archer, J., in State <em>v. </em>Roberts, 11 Gill &amp; Johns. 506: \u201c Congress possessing power to lay taxes, under that power impose taxes by licenses. That a license is a tax is too palpable for discussion, unless there is something in the idea that it is a political or police regulation, intended to preserve, maintain, and regulate the lottery system. If it were purely so, there might be some weight in the argument, but if not, it still has the brand of tax. It must be conceded it is in part a tax, and if so, still it is a tax.\u201d Aud again he says, lb.: \u201cA license required to be obtained by payment of money is a tax.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b530-7\">These ordinances, with the \u201cbrand of tax\u201d upon them, can in no way be upheld. \u201c Where a charter of incorporation confers no right to tax, the right may follow as an incident; but where it confers the right, that right is limited, either by expressly denying it in some cases, or by.specifying where and upon what it is to be exercised.\u201d 1 Martin\u2019s La. The power to tax is one of the highest attributes of sovereignty \u2014 a right to interfere with the property of the subject, and appropriate it, to be returned to the community with no new value imparted to it in the meanwhile, or created from or through it. A municipal' corporation, with defined powers in this respect, has none other, either in regard to the purposes for which or the objects upon which it shall operate. The ordinance, and every part of it, raising a fund for a purpose unwarranted by the statute law, was held void in 3 Greenl: 191; 13 Mass. 278; and the want of power to derive revenue from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>subject of the tax was held fatal in <em>4 </em>Pet. 168, and 13 Mass. 278. The right to tax, its extent, the purposes for which and the objects on which it shall be exercised, are so *clearly spcci- \u2022 fied in the acts incorporating the city of Cincinnati, and its amendments, that no room can be left to imply that right in a non-enumerated case. The present provisions of the law are grouped together, for more easy reference, in appendix A. This very section 13 is explicit in all cases of power granted, to which was intended to be annexed a right to tax. It contains a clause raising money from a road tax, and its provisions in regard to the streets are followed, in section 13, by a grant of power to raise a tax for opening, etc., streets, etc.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b531-4\">The case of Mayor of Columbia <em>v. </em>Beasley, 1 Humph. 240, was for selling liquor, in 1839, without license from the town authorities. The court said : \u201cThe power to tax tippling houses must be derived from the direct taxing power conferred in the charter. <em>It can not be derived from the power to regulate and restrain them. </em>That must be done by ordinances preventing those houses from becoming disorderly, and imposing penalties for infraction of such laws.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b531-5\">In Collins <em>v. </em>City of Louisville, 3 B. Mon. 133, an ordinance of the city of Louisville, by which the seller of coal was charged a certain amount per bushel for measuring, it was held void. By the act of incorporation, the mayor and council of that city were authorized to appoint measurers of coal, and to affix a reasonable allowance to such measurer. But the court, throwing out of view all other questions, said that this was a tax upon coal, not to defray the charges of measuring, but to raise revenue, and that, as the charter conferred no power to tax coal or its sale, the ordinance was void. We ask for the application of similar reasoning.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b531-6\">In Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Bean, Thatch. Crim. C. 87, the complaint was under an ordinance of the city of Boston \u201cfor regulating the keeping of dogs in the city of Boston,\u201d to recover of the defendant a penalty of ten dollars for permitting his dog to go at large. The ordinance required a payment of five dollars to the city clerk before a dog was permitted to go at large. , The defendant not having paid this sum, the jury found him guilty. The ease came by appeal before the municipal court. *Thatcher, J., said: \u201c I do not see why, if the city is competent to impose a tax on owners of dogs, it may not do so also on owners of trucks and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>carts, etc. It is said this is a nuisance; if so, what right has the city to license it and derive revenue from it. This is the first time whore a town has undertaken to require from persons a sum of money for enjoying a privilege which they would otherwise be entitled to enjoy freely. The ease of Player <em>v. </em>Vere, Sir T. Raym. 288, 324, applies here. A by-law may be good in part and void in part.. But as the city can not require from owners of dogs going at large a sum of money for a license, it is substantially defective and invalid for this cause. The verdict must be set aside and the complaint dismissed.\u2019.\u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b532-5\">In Mayor and Aldermen of Mobile <em>v. </em>Yuile, 3 Ala. (N. S.), decided in 1841, the authorities of Mobile had power \u201c to license bakers-and regulate the weight and price of bread, and prohibit the baking for sale except by those licensed.\u201d The defendant, a baker, had been fined $20 under an ordinance of the city, which provided that no one shall carry on baking unless he obtain a license, for which he shall pay $20, and $1 to the clerk \u2014 that for carrying on baking without license, a fine not exceeding $50 shall be imposed, and that all bread shall be of a prescribed weight, marked and inspected, and the bad bread seized and forfeited. The court, on error, held the ordinance could not be supported, because the penalty must be reasonable; it must be a sum certain, and can not be left to the arbitrary assessment of the corporation court, to be determined according to the nature of the offense. They say further, \u201cwe also incline to doubt the propriety of that portion which forfeits bread, as also that portion which requires $20 to be paid by the baker for a license, unless the latter can be supported under the taxing power of the corporation, though doubtless it might require a fee for the issuing and registration of the license.\u201d The case of Player <em>v. </em>Vere, Sir T. Raym. 288, 324, above cited, Thatcher\u2019s Criminal Cases, and commented upon *and approved, 6 Pick. 191, was upon an ordinance of the city of London, passed in 1677, that the president and directors of Christ\u2019s Hospital should have the rules of cars and carts ; that no more than 420 shall be allowed to work for hire, and that a certain sum shall be paid for each oar-room, and that if any shall work one not so allowed, he shall forfeit 13s. 4d. In Hilary term, 31 and 32 Car. 2, after extended argument, it was \u201c adj udged by the whole court, <em>nemine contradicente </em>\u2014 that the by-law was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>good by reason of the fine and rent, but in all things else very good, and so a <em>procedendo </em>was denied.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b533-5\">These ordinances are void, because they are in restraint of trade.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b533-6\">The common law prohibits no man to exercise any trade or more trades than one.

These customs are against common right. They are allowed only from their antiquity, \u201c in consideration of the plenitude of the regal power at the time the places in which they prevail were incorporated, and the necessity of yielding encouragement to commerce, at that time almost exclusively confined to corporate towns,\u201d and have not experienced much favor in Westminster Hall. Wilcock on Mun. Cor. 74, 75. The by-laws made accordingly are good by way of custom, but not by grant, and therefore no corporation made within time of memory, can have such privilege, unless it be by act of parliament. 8 Co. 248.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b533-7\">Whether we examine the English or the American cases, we will alike be unable to discover any, where ordinances like the present have been supported, unless authority to pass them is clearly shown. We propose to refer briefly to all the American eases we have found.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b533-8\">Here; as in England, are certain police regulations, not repugnant to the charter, and framed for the protection of the inhabitants from nuisances or other evils. A by-law of Boston, prohibiting rapid driving in the streets, is valid. 3 Pick. 462. *Also, a by-law of Boston, out of regard to the security of the people, requiring owners and occupants of land bordering on streets, to clear the snow away from the adjoining sidewalks. 16 Pick. 504. And the city of Boston may fill up a creek which is a nuisance to those of the inhabitants dwelling near it. 12 Pick. 184. Cities may make rules for the occupation of the property of the city, as that none may stand in the market place without permission of the clerk of the market. 11 Pick. 168. In 6 Pick. 187, a by-law of the city of Boston, prohibiting any person not duly licensed therefor, by the mayor and aldermen, from removing the house dirt and offal from the city, was held valid, because it was the duty of the city to preserve tho health of the inhabitants; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>this they could best do by employing men over whom they have entire control. Here, it will be seen, the subject matter was a nuisance, and no charge was made for a license. In Boston <em>v. </em>Schaffer, 9 Pick. 418, the mayor and aldermen were authorized to license theatrical exhibitions, \u201con such terms and conditions as to them may seem just and reasonable.\u201d Under this general power, the court felt authorized, by a legislative construction of the act, such as the city of Cincinnati does not exhibit, to say a sum of money might be exacted for a license. The court then examined whether it is competent ,to the legislature to grant to a town or city power to assess a tax which is not general. The court say, that if the sum wore a tax, the objection would be valid, but that it was in the nature of an excise, whose constitutionality was not doubted, and was peculiarly proper in employments of that kind, which required to be watched. It will be noted, however, that we deny that the legislature here gave the power, as also that the constitution of Massachusetts contains a clause not to be found in that of Ohio, expressly providing power to lay an excise on occupations, etc., and that the peculiar nature of the occupation was dwelt upon. In Massachusetts, as in England and New York, it is held that a by-law must be <em>legi, fidei, rationi, </em>consona, and that an unreasonable by-law is void. 1 Met. 130; 6 Pick. 187; 16 Pick. 121; 7 *Paige, 263; and whether it is void for unreasonableness, is always a question for the court. 3 Pick. 462. In 16 Pick. 121, a by-law of the town of Charlestown, that no one should, without leave of the selectmen, bring into the town, or bury there, any dead body, was held unreasonable and void. It was declared that the right of property shall not be invaded, under the guise of a police regulation, and that a by-law being entire, if void in part, is void for the whole.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b534-5\">In New York, an ordinance that no person shall sell meat except in the public market place, has been sustained (8 Johns. 327; 10 Wend. 99), as being within a power to make by-laws relating to the public markets, and manifestly contemplated by it. In 10 Wend. 99, it is said \u201ca by-law, that no meat should be sold in the village, would be bad, being a general restraint, but that meat shall not be sold, except in a particular place, is good, not being a restraint of the right to sell meat, but a regulation of that right.\u201d In 7 Cow. 349, and 9 Wend. 571, the power of a city, to make ordinances for the removal of nuisances from harbors, and to au<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>thorize harbor-masters to regulate and station vessels, for the purpose of avoiding disorder and confusion, was recognized. Under an express power to prevent the interment of the dead within the city, a by-law to that effect was sustained, inasmuch as the city had \u201c power so to order the use of private property in the city as to prevent its proving pernicious to the citizens generally.\u201d 7 Cow. 604. The case in 14 Wend. 89, does not seem to have been well considered; it was of weighers of anthracite coal. In 5 Hill, 209, an ordinance entirely prohibiting the propelling of railroad cars, by steam, through any part of the city of Buffalo, was held good, under a power to regulate the running of cars, for it was said, \u201cunless conducted with more than human watchfulness, the running of the cars by steam may well be regarded as a public nuisance.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b535-5\">The only cas\u00e9 in New York similar to the present, is Dunham <em>v. </em>Trustees of Rochester, 5 Cow. 462. There it was ordained that none should keep a huckster\u2019s shop without *a license from the trustees of the village, and hucksters were taxed, for a license, from five to thirty dollars. The suit was brought for a fine imposed for keeping a huckster shop without license. The question was presented in the very same form as in this case. The act gave the power to make prudential by-laws, rules, and regulations, relative to taverns, gin shops, and huckster shop&gt;s, in said village. The court said it was not shown how huckster shops could be an evil, if conducted under proper regulations, nor could they see, judicially, that any restriction was necessary; that the corporation must show their power, else their proceedings were void; that their by-laws must be reasonable ; that by-laws such as these, against trade, were not allowed, except by particular custom ; that it was not intended that any man should depend, for the exercise of his business, on the will of the corporation, or that they may prohibit it altogether, or cripple it by heavy charges and grievous penalties ; that the right was not derivable from the taxing power, which was given in definite and specific terms. The court were of opinion that the ordinances wore void, both for want of jurisdiction and conformity to the general law. The court, in 10 Wend. 99, intimate that the right to carry on this business was guarantied by taking a license from the commissioners of excise of the town. But this was not the ground of the decision in 5 Cowen. The license, under the state law, was for the sale of gin and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>other spirituous liquors \u2014 the offense, that of being a huckster, for which no license had been taken from the commissioners of excise. The case in 5 Cowon stands unreversed, as an authority applicable to this case. In 10 Wend. 99, it is admitted to be law, and the ordinance is condemned as \u201cimposing a charge without any corresponding benefit.\u201d The present ordinance is of the same character. Upon a like jealousy of these restraints, in 8 Conn. 391, the power of a town to make by-laws to regulate the fishery of clams and oysters within its limits, is admitted; but that of prohibiting all persons, except its own inhabitants, from taking them, is denied.

It is said that, upon the circuit, this clause of the city charter was under investigation in the case of the City of Cincinnati <em>v. </em>Goodman. That decision is not binding upon this court as an authority. It has never been reported, and we can not judge what were the grounds upon which it was decided, whether from reference to the nature of the occupation, which is very lucrative and not in high repute, or for other causes. The case is said not to have been very fully argued. Wo are referred to Cincinnati <em>v. </em>Buckingham, 10 Ohio, 261. The legislature differed from the court in their view of that ordinance, and passed a special act preventing such in future. That was the case of an ordinance affecting what is peculiarly the property of the city, \u2014 the market-spaces ; and the ground taken by the court is, that the sum charged was \u201c the price demanded for accommodations provided to the frequenters of market, by the city authorities.\u201d There w;.s a <em>quid pro quo. </em>Here the drayman obtains no <em>\u201c </em>accommodation \u201d \u2014no standing-j&gt;Iace \u2014 no room for locomotion, which is not enjoyed by every other citizen. Moreover, he does not carry on a business, such as is in 6 Pick. 187, <em>\u201c </em>removing the house-dirt and offal,\u201d over which, as to time, etc., the council need exclusive control in order to preserve the health of the city. The ordinance is a general restraint, amounting to this, that no one shall, in any part of the city, or at any time, drive a dray for hire, unless upon terms to which, as we contend, ho ought not to be compelled to submit.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b537-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>Hart, in reply:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b537-5\">The citation of the City of Cincinnati <em>v. </em>Buckingham, 10 Ohio, 261, is disposed of by counsel very briefly. \u201c The legislature,\u201d wo are told, \u201cdiffered from the court in their view of that ordinance, and passed a special act preventing such in future.\u201d We should hardly admit the authority *of the legislature to overturn the decision of this court, but the remark is not pertinent; for the legislature acquiesced in the construction of the charter, and \u201cpassed a special act\u201d to alter that construction in future cases. The power of the city to tax the owners of market wagons was affirmed by the court, and admitted by the very action of the legislature. We care not about \u201ctheir view\u201d of the ordinance, for that is not the question to be discussed. Under a power to regulate markets, the city has power to tax the owners of market wagons: by perfect parity of construction, a power to \u201cregulate \u201d drays confers the power to tax the owners of them. And this entirely answers the argument, that in section 11 of the charter a special power to demand money upon a license to keep a tavern or coffee-house is conferred. The power to \u201cregulate\u201d carries the power of taxation, else this court erred grossly in the case of Buckingham.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b537-6\">There is no distinction between the cases; and this court must either reverse its own decision or reverse the decision of the court of common pleas.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b537-7\">We can not perceive, in most of the cases cited by the defendant\u2019s counsel any application to this question.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b537-8\">Gibbons <em>v. </em>Ogden, 9 Wheat. 190, 213, certainly does not, even by the statement of our opponents, decide aught against it.

And this answers the argument of the defendant\u2019s counsel, that here the amount of tax is unlimited, and the city council may, if it choose, suppress the draymen, and more to the same effect. An argument against the use of a thing, drawn from the abuse of it, is altogether frivolous. If the city council unreasonably exercise the power conferred by the charter, the ordinance will be void. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>Nothing here shows this ordinance to be unreasonable, for there is no proof at all upon the point.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AzE\">*The Mayor of Columbia <em>v. </em>Beasley, 1 Humph.

By the act of incorporation, the mayor and council of that city wore authorized to appoint measurers of coal, and to affix a reasonable allowance to such measurers.\u201d Why this case should be cited upon the question whether a power to regulate includes a power to tax or not, we are entirely at a loss to imagine.

And in regard to the extent of a power to license, we beg leave to borrow the case of the State <em>v. </em>Roberts, 11 Gill &amp; Johns. 506, from our opponents. \u201c That a license is a tax,\u201d said Judge Archer, \u201c is too palpable for discussion, unless there is something in the idea that it is a political or police regulation.\u201d Now, the defendant\u2019s counsel have stoutly asserted, upon the seventh page of their argument, that our ordinance is <em>not </em>\u201ca police regulation; \u201d to which we entirely agree. It is indisputable, therefore, that the grant of a power to license drays, in the charter, is a power to tax them by means of licenses. \u201c Congress,\u201d said Judge Archer, \u201cpossessing power to lay taxes; under that power impose taxes by means of licenses.\u201d And the delegation of a power to tax, in the terms of a power to. license, is clear, in the present instance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b539-7\">This proposition established, it is entirely unnecessary to argue the question whether this ordinance be or be not in restraint of trade.

The only restraint pretended, is the tax itself, and the' legislature has not regarded that a sufficient reason for refusing the power of taxation, in this particular, to the city council. It' did not regard the objection as forcible in the case of markets, and thereupon took away the power by an amendment of the charter. A.nd it may be observed, that in the English cases cited by our opponents, the municipal by-laws have no sanction from the legislature at all, and altogether stand or fall upon their own reasonableness or unreasonableness.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b540-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>When we turn from these to American cases, we find that bylaws depend for their validity solely upon the language of the charter.

The eouncilmen of Boston were empowered, by the charter to license theatrical exhibitions \u201con such terms and conditions as to them may seem just and reasonable,\u201d and it was decided that they could exact money for a license. A power so expressed is just the power to license and regulate, conferred upon the city of Cincinnati, and nothing else.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Al-\">Tho defendant\u2019s counsel, however, criticise this case to the effect, that the constitution of Massachusetts allows a tax upon occupations, which the constitution of Ohio does not. Now, we have to correct this by the remark, that the constitution of *Ohio has no power of taxation at all expressed; the only word in it upon the subject is, that poll-taxes shall not be levied. Our government, therefore, has no power to tax anything, or else every power except that of poll taxation. We prefer the latter doctrine, and insist that taxes upon trades, or excises, are constitutional in Ohio. And, in fact, wc have an act taxing lawyers and physicians, and this court has affirmed its validity. Why not tax tho privilege of a drayman, as well as tho privilege of the counsel who represents him ? We trow, the profession of the law, at least in the estimation of our opponents, is not one \u201c the subject mat-tor \u201d Of which is a \u201c nuisance.\u201d Yet they assert that only such species of trades and professions can be taxed.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b540-8\">In the case of The Village of Buffalo <em>v. </em>Webster, the former case of Dunham <em>v. </em>The Trustees of Rochester was distinguished from it, and declared to he a decision solely to the effect, that when a huckster had taken a license from the state commissioners, no municipal corporation could take away his privileges under that license.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b540-7\">Birchard, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AtU\">Our inquiry is directed to the validity of the ordinances adopted by the city council. Their powers are those expressly conferred by the act of incorporation, and such as are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>necessary to carry thorn into effect. By section 8 of the act passed March 1,1834, the council has \u201cpower to make and publish all such laws and ordinances, as to them shall seem necessary to provide for the safety, preserve the health, and improve the morals,order, comfort, and convenience of said city.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">By section 13 it is enacted thus: \u201c They shall have power to license and regulate all carts, wagons, and drays, and every description of two and four-wheeled carriages which may be kept in said city for hire.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">The objection to the ordinance rests solely on that provision which authorizes the demand of a fee, as a prerequisite to the licensing of a drayman. In general, the authority to license carries with it the power to impose the terms and conditions upon which it shall bo granted. It would seem that the right to license and regulate, and to provide by ordinance for the carrying into effect the powers expressly conferred upon them, are sufficient to justify all reasonable acts incident to the business.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">*As usually received by mankind, particularly when applied to a municipal corporation, \u201c to liconso and regulate\u201d dray-men, etc., implies the right of fixing the terms upon which they shall be permitted to exorcise their calling, and of forbidding the exercise upon any other than upon the terms and in the manner prescribed. Such appears to have boon the view of this court in Buckingham\u2019s case, 10 Ohio, 261, wherein it was held that, under the grant of a power to regulate the markets, the council had the right to exact a tax from the owners of the market wagon using the market. That case appears, in principle, not to bo distinguishable from this.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">In Boston <em>v. </em>Schaffer, 9 Pick. 419, suit was brought to recover $1,000, exacted for granting a license to theatrical exhibitions. The court said, \u201c if the $1,000 were to be regarded as a tax, it was not competent for the legislature to grant to the city of Boston the power to collect it.\" \u201cThat it was not a tax; it was in the nature of an excise on a particular employment.\u201d \u201c The levying of an excise has been practiced in regard to other occupations, and the constitutionality had never been doubted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">The court in that case held, that it was proper that towns, when put to expense by the exercise of particular employments, should be compensated. So in this case, the employment of drays, hacks, omnibuses, aud other heavy vehicles, upon their pavements, cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>no inconsiderable amount of expenditure to the city in the way of repairing the streets and alleys. It is manifest to every one, that, .in a large city, vehicles of this description cause great destruction to the public ways \u2014 far greater than the usual ordinary travel of citizens otherwise employed, There is therefore no injustice in exacting a reasonable portion of the expenses which such special occupations cause to the community; and those who enjoy the special privilege, can refuse to bear a reasonable portion of the burden but with an ill grace. But aside from all this, it is unquestionable that the power to license and regulate drays, etc., authorized the assessment and collection of a fine from any one ^running such vehicle without a license. It was for this offense that tho fine was assessed by the mayor.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Tho case made by defendant shows that he did not even ask a license. The city council had a clear right to exact all reasonable expenses; and if the ordinance provides for anything beyond what was reasonable under the circumstances, the fact should have so appeared affirmatively. It should not be left to be made out upon the inference of the court, as a matter of ingenious speculation, or upon the statements of counsel. It matters little by what name the sum to be paid for license is called, if it be but a reasonable charge; and if it were unreasonable, the appropriate and reasonable sum should have been tendered and the license demanded. Instead of doing this, the whole ordinance and city authority were set at defiance.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Bryson had no right to disregard those parts of the ordinance which were strictly legal, and which a court would enforce, even if some parts of it were illegal, and su'ch as a court might not enforce. His rule of construction is one that no court would adopt; for, in construing statutes, the rule is to enforce them so far as they are constitutionally made, rejecting ouly those provisions which show an excess of authority by the enacting power. The same rule of construction must govern in passing upon the validity of the ordinance duly enacted by the city council. Bryson might have paid the fee required of him, under protest, and have taken his license, and then contested the question, whether it was reasonable or unreasonable, in an action to recover back the three dollars thus paid. He chose to take the construction into his own hands, and assume, in the first instance, that tho city council had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>exceeded its authority, and that the entire ordinance was void; and he must abide the consequence of running his dray without any license in defiance of the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">But it is again urged that the whole ordinances are void, because they are in restraint of trade and levy a tax. If this were the true character of the ordinances, they could not be sustained. *We, however, do not view them in any such light. The employment gives the drayman or hackman special privileges, which ho enjoys to the prejudice of the city, in the injury necessarily done to her streets and pavements, to an amount far greater than any benefit to be derived from the price of the license, excluding the necessary burden of supervision. Nor does the case show that tbreo dollars is too much to pay as a reasonable fee for issuing the license, and the keeping the necessary registers.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">Judgment reversed, and the judgment rendered which should have been rendered by the court of common pleas.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b543-7\">Read, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Af8A\">dissenting. I can not concur in the opinion of the court just pronounced.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">The char tor itself fully establishes the distinction between the power to \u201c license and regulate,\u201d and the power to tax. Section 11 provides, that the city council shall have power to license theaters, taverns, auctions, and ferries on the Ohio river; and, in granting the license, the city council may \u201c exact, demand, and receive such sum or sums of money as they shall think fit and expedient.\u201d Section 14 provides, that to defray the current expenses of the city, the city council shall have power to levy and collect taxes on the real and personal property therein, as the same has been, or shall be appraised and returned on the grand levy of the state. Section 13 provides simply, that the city council shall have power to license and regulate all carts, wagons and drays, and every description of two and four-wheeled carriages, which may be kept in said city for hire. No power is given in this section, as is given by section 11, to exact \u201c such sum of money as they may deem fit and expedient.\u201d The <em>insertion </em>of that power in section 11, and the <em>omission </em>of it in section 13, is of itself sufficient to give a construction to the charter adverse to that claimed by the city council. I am of opinion that this construction is conclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>But there are two other objections to the decision of the court, viz:</p>\n<p id=\"A_H\">*1. That, independent of the aid derived from a comparison of the different sections of the charter above quoted, the power to \u201c license and regulate \u201d does not embrace a power to raise a tax; and,</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">2. If even the charter did propose to confer that power, it would be unconstitutional and void, as an infringement of the right of every citizen to earn a livelihood by honest industry.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">I hold that the words to \u201clicense and regulate,\u201d in the city charter, do not confer the power to impose a tax upon the owners of drays and other wheeled vehicles, or to raise a fund from such owners for general city purposes. These words barely confer a police power, and may authorize the city council to require such owners to register their names, and number their dray or other carriage, and to charge a reasonable fee for such entry or registration, but nothing more.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">The charge of three dollars upon draymen, imposed by the ordinance, is not in the nature of fees, but of revenue, to go into the treasury of the city for general purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">It is a tax upon employment, and not upon property. The property \u2014 the dray and horse \u2014 is assessed according to its value, as other property, apart from the three dollars imposed by this ordinance. But it is said that Bryson, in this case, is not resisting the payment of the three-dollar tax, but the penalty adjudged for not complying with the ordinance, requiring him to tako out his license as a drayman. That will not help the case, because if the city council had the power to compel every drayman to take out a license, and to impose a penalty for violation of the ordinance requiring such license, yet, if the city impose a condition precedent to the grant of such license, which is illegal and void, and refuse, under the ordinance, to issue the license unless such condition be complied with, the whole ordinance is void, and no penalty can be enforced for its non-performance. If'the city have no authority to require three dollars to be paid to obtain a license to exorcise the employment of a drayman or car tin an, .and refuse to grant a license ^unless such three dollars bo paid, it would be absurd to say that a penalty could be imposed for the non-payment of throe dollars and the not procuring a license. The city refuse to grant the license unless the sum of throe dol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>lars bo first paid; and if there be no authority to require the payment of three dollar\u2019s, for a license, the coupling a power which they have \u2014 to wit, to license \u2014 with a power which they have not \u2014 to wit, to chai\u2019go three dollars as a condition precedent to such license \u2014 renders the whole ordinance a nullity, and also all other ordinances, or parts of the same ordinances, which impose a penalty for its violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">This leaves the naked question, have the city the power, under their charter, to impose a tax upon the employment of draymen, cartmen, etc. ?</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">If the city have the power, it must be derived under the charter. Did the legislature intend, by the words to \u201c license and regulate,\u201d to confer upon the city council the general power to tax the employment of draymen and cartmen? Because, if the city have the power at all, it is a general power ; for the amount of the tax is not limited by the charter, but left to the discretion of the city authorities. Hence, if they may impose a tax of three dollars, they may impose a tax of three hundred. But it is said that it is a power to impose a reasonable sum. Who shall judge of the reasonableness or unreasonableness of the sum imposed? If the power exists at all, it exists to be exercised at the discretion of the city council. If they exercise a discretion which they possess, who shall control it ? What is the limit ? What is the rule ? Even could the exercise of this discretion be brought in review before the courts of the country, what would be the mode to determine whether the amount charged was too large? Nothing but the discretion of the court. So, at last, the matter, in some shape, would be left to discretion. And if three dollars might be charged, so might a larger or an indefinito sum. But the truth is, if the city council have the power to tax at discretion, the exercise of that discretion, on their part, is the end of the rnattei^ and it is not ^subject to review. The council, in such view,</p>\n<p id=\"Axh3\">are the judges of their own discretion. It has been said, by high authority, that the power to tax implies the power to destroy; and Whore the general power to tax exists, as in the state, I know of no limit to its exercise, except the discretion and judgment of those who are to-exercise it, and that it must be equal and operate upon all alike.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">Did the legislature intend, then, to confer any such jiowor upon the city council? We find that in all cases where the city is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>authorized to raise revenue, the charter imposes a limit to its exercise. The words to \u201c license and regulate,\u201d do not expressly confer the power to tax, but such power, if it exist, is implied. Now the power to tax is not necessary to the exorcise of the power to \u201c license and regulate,\u201d and hence, upon the well-settled doctrine of construing charters, should be denied. Nor can it be presumed that the legislature have conferred a power not expressly conferred, or absolutely necessary to the exercise of such power so conferred. In certain cases the courts of common pleas are.authorized to grant licenses; suppose such power to license was conferred upon the courts of common pleas, and the statute conferring such power fixed no sum to be paid for the grant of such license, would any man in his senses contend that the court would have the right to fix such amount as it saw proper, to be paid as a condition precedent to the grant of such license? The word \u201c license,\u201d then, does not confer the power to tax, nor is the power to tax necessary to the exercise of the power to license. We must infer, then, that the legislature intended merely to confer the power of police regulation, and not the power to tax or raise revenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">But it is said, it is reasonable to impose this tax upon draymen, cartmen, etc., because they wear out the streets. The suggestion is without force. The streets are not constructed or repaired out of the general funds of the city, but are a charge upon the owners of lots abutting upon such streets. Their property is only valuable in proportion as the streets are worn by use. Besides, the money raised by the tax imposed *upon the draymen, is not applied to the repair and preservation of the streets, but it is paid into the city treasury to swell the general fund. It is made a source of general revenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">It is suggested that the sum thus charged under this ordinance is to pay the expense of registration, etc., as fees. This is not only not true, but it is not even protended by the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">The truth is, it is a naked and barefaced effort to shift the burdens of the city expenses from property upon labor, and to levy a tax, not in proportion to the value of property owned, or the moneyed ability to pay, but upon employment. In this there is not a shadow of equity, because if the streets are never cut by drays, it is this very business that gives va'ue to property, and increases rents. Besides, it should not bo the-pocr draymen who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>should be taxed for the wear of streets, but the wealth and commerce which he is the humble instrument of transporting.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">I can not believe that the legislature intended to confer any such power, nor can it be inferred from any known rule of construction, but is in direct opposition to the well-established rules applicable to the construction of charters, and, beyond all this, in the direct face of the constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Hence, the legislature would have no authority to confer the power claimed. If there is a power to license, in the sense claimed, there is a power to prohibit. The legislature has no power to prohibit a man from exercising an honest employment. The right to labor is an inherent and natural, as well as constitutional right. The law has assigned an ownership to all that can aid man to live \u2014 to all that constitutes food or clothing. The only mode by which those born naked into the world can obtain support, by acquiring that which will preserve life, is by the consent of the legal holder, or through the provisions furnished to the destitute under the poor laws. Property seldom comes by gift; the poor obtain it by labor. The right to labor is coupled with the right of life, and is a necessary principle of self-preservation. Without labor, man would perish. It is the ^only mode in which shelter, and raiment, and food can be obtained. Good <em>v. </em>Zerche, 12 Ohio, 368.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">The constitution has declared that the right to acquire property is a natural, inherent, and unalienable right.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">Labor is the exercise of the right of acquisition. Hence, the legislature has no right to tax or interrupt such right. To talk of granting a license to a man for the privilege of pursuing honest labor, is an insult to the age, and belongs to a period of despotic barbarism, and is fit only to be addressed to vassals and slaves. Every person, by natural right and under our constitution, has the right to pursue honest labor without permission or license to do so from any source, except from that great and good God who gives him health and strength.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">But the monstrous assumption has not only been asserted, claimed, and exercised by the city to license the honest occupation of a drayman and cartman, and of the man who drives two and four-wheeled vehicles, as a means of obtaining a subsistence, and to charge them a sum of money for the grant of such license, but the city is maintained in this constitutional outrage by the decis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>ion of th'is court. It is not pretended that the man of wealth, who uses the streets for his pleasure, in his carriage, can be taxed for that privilege because he wears out the streets; but the man whoso necessities, for the support of himself, force him to pursue the occupations of a drayman or cartman, must buy the privilege, and pay a sum of money to be permitted to pursue such employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">But it is said that in Boston excise laws have been supported. If such be the case there, no such laws exist or can exist in Ohio. There is no power in the legislature to tax any honest occupation, trade, or industrial pursuit. If this were the case, any particular class of men could be utterly ruined by the majority imposing upon them the whole burdens of the state. Our constitutional mode of taxation is, to assess each man according to the property he owns. This is the only protection to each class. In this all find security, as a whole community will not be likely to ruin itself by taxation. But if one class *of men may be taxed, it will be the interest of the majority to impose such tax to escape themselves. If you may tax draymen and cartmen, you may blacksmiths and carpenters, and so on, until property shall be relieved from taxation, and the whole burden fall upon industry. The lawyers were the first to fall victims to this violation of principle. Now draymen, cartmen, etc., and who next, is to be seen. We are yet a young state, and unless these outrages upon the constitution and natural rightbe resisted and checked, they will grow into precedent, which, in the end, will sap the foundations of our liberties and overthrow our free institutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">It will be endeavored to withdraw this case from a tax upon employment. It can not be done. It is nothing else. It is a charge upon the occupations of draymen, not as fees, but as revenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">I hold, therefore, that the ordinance is a nullity, unconstitutional, and void.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
