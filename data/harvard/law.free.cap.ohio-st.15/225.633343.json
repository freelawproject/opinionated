Upon the hearing, the defense relied upon was, that the defendant was a Jew, and conscientiously observed the seventh day of the week as a Sabbath. This fact was admitted, as appears by the transcript from the mayor\u2019s court. The mayor did not consider this as any defense, but found the defendant guilty, and assessed a fine against him of ten dollars, for which judgment was rendered, together with costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-5\">To reverse this judgment, the defendant removed the case to the court of common pleas by <em>certiorari, </em>in which court the judgment of the mayor was reversed, and judgment entered against the city for costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-6\">To reverse this latter judgment this writ ef error is prosecuted, and the error assigned is, that the court of common pleas erred in reversing the judgment of the mayor\u2019s court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b190-7\">Samuel M. Hart, for plaintiff in error :</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b190-8\">I. The first question arises upon the phraseology of the ordinance, whether the defendant was a common laborer, as *appoars by this record, within its true intent and construction. His counsel argued that the term \u201ccommon labor\u201d meant a man\u2019s usual occupation, of what kind soever it might be; and that the ordinance should be construed just as though it had said, \u201ctrading, bartering, or soiling or buying any goods, wares, or merchandise ; or any other common labor.\u201d Against this interpretation, however, there are many reasons to protest:</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b190-9\">1. The terms \u201clabor\u201d and \u201claborer\u201d have meanings well ascertained in law, applicable to occupations and men, quite different from the occupation of the defendant and from himself. In Blackstonc\u2019s chapter \u201c of the civil state,\u201d we find not only the degrees, but the occupations of all private citizens marked out as the law has fixed them. \u201c The rest of the commonalty,\u201d says Sir William, \u201care tradesmen, artificers, and laborers, who, as well as all others, must, in pursuance of the statute of 1 Henry V, chap. 5, be styled by the name and addition of their estate, degree, or mystery, and the place to which they belong or where they have been conversant, in all original writs of actions, personal appeals, and indictments, upon which process of outlawry may be awarded, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>in order, as it should seem, to prevent any clandestine or mistaken outlawry, by reducing to a specific certainty the person who is the object of its process.\u201d 1 Bla. Com. 407. Therefore, to describe Jacob Rice as a \u201c laborer \u201d and not as a \u201c tradesman,\u201d in an indictment where description is required, would be bad upon a plea of abatement. Arch. Crim. PI. 26. Nor is this distinction made by the common law a whit plainer than that existing in the very nature of things. If one were to call a man, whose business is merely buying and selling, <em>a </em>laborer, it would shock any (the most ignorant) man\u2019s sense of propriety. And to prevent the least doubt, the ordinance speaks not of \u201clabor\u201d only, but of \u201ccommon labor\u201d \u2014 that in which we may suppose the vast majority of mankind to be habitually engaged, as distinguished from, mechanical or other labor, requiring the exercise of intellect and skill.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b191-5\"><em>*2. </em>Although the term \u201c common labor,\u201d in the act of February 17, 1831 (Swan\u2019s Stat. 255), should be supposed to embrace all sorts of employment, the term can not have that extensive signification in the ordinance; for the ordinance itself specifies bartering, trading, selling, etc., as quite distinct from common labor; and \u201call words,\u201d as Lord Bacon says, \u201cwhether they be in deeds or statutes, or otherwise, if they bo general, and not express and precise, shall be restrained unto the fitness of the matter and the person. Bacon\u2019s Maxims, Regula X. And Blackstone tells us to resort to the context whenever the phrase is doubtful, \u201cwith which (the context), it may be of singular use to compare a word or a sentence, whenever they are ambiguous, equivocal, or intricate. 1 Black. Com. 60.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b191-6\">3. If we so construe this ordinance as to insert the word \u201c other \u201d before the words \u201ccommon labor,\u201d thus torturing its language to make bartering, trading, selling, otc., common labor, we shall turn the whole ordinance into ridicule. For, be it observed, that when we have <em>thus </em>converted bartering, trading, selling, etc., into common labor, we have converted sporting, rioting, quarrelingj hunting, shooting, etc., into common labor likewise. Let him that runs, read :</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b191-7\">\u201c That any person of the ago of fourteen years or upward, who shall be found, on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday, sporting, rioting, quarreling, hunting, fishing, shooting, trading, bartering, or selling; or buying any goods, wares, or mer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>chandise; or at any [other] common labor, works of necessity and charity excepted, shall be fined in any sum <em>not exceeding twenty </em>\u2022dollars.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b192-5\">The plain rules of grammar do not admit the interpolation, without entirely destroying the sense of the section.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b192-6\">4. If, by \u201c common labor,\u201d the city council meant any business in which a man is ordinarily, from day to day, employed, as our opponents argue, then a lawyer, a physician, a steamboat captain, a music master, or a circus actor, is a common laborer in Cincinnati, though certainly nowhere else. We need not dwell upon the manifest absurdity of this notion, *but call attention to section 2 of the ordinance, which, according to Blackstone, will be \u201c of singular use \u201d to explain section 1. That declares, \u201c if any \u25a0tavern, coffee-house, or restaurant-keeper shall sell or barter any spirituous liquors on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday (except to travelers on a journey), such tavern, coffeehouse, or restaurant-keeper, or other person so offending, shall, for the first offense, be fined any sum not exceeding twenty dollar\u2019s, with costs of suit; and for a second offense shall, moreover, forfeit his license.\u201d Now, if the city council had, by the words \u201ccommon labor,\u201d intended the ordinary occupation of any man, it is obvious that the keepers of taverns, coffee-houses, and restaurants, would themselves <em>be common laborers; </em>and as there is no ex. empfion made for an Israelite in those employments, section 2 o. the ordinance would be inconsistent with the first.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b192-7\">Upon the whole, we can see no pretense of argument for any such interpolation as our opponents desire, nor for any construction of the ordinance which amounts to such an interpolation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b192-8\">II. The second pi\u2019oposition of the defendant\u2019s counsel is that this ordinance contravenes the act of the legislature, for the prevention of certain immoral practices,\u201d passed February 17, 1831. Swan\u2019s Stat. 255.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b192-9\">That declares, \u201c that if any person of the age of fourteen years, or upward, shall be found on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday, sporting, rioting, quarreling, hunting, fishing, shooting, or at common labor (words of necessity and charity only excepted), he or she shall be fined in a sum not exceeding five dollars, nor less than one dollar; provided nothing herein contained shall be construed to extend to those who conscientiously do observe the seventh day of the week as the Sabbath; nor to pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>vent families, emigrating, from traveling; watermen from landing their passengers; superintendents or keepers of toll-bridges from attending and superintending the same; or ferrymen from conveying travelers *over the waters, or persons moving their families, on such days.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b193-5\">Section 2 declares, \u201c that if any tavern-keeper, or other person, shall sell or barter any spirituous liquors on the first day of tho week, commonly called Sunday (except to travelers on a Sunday), such tavern-keeper, or other person, so offending, shall be fined in a sum not exceeding five dollars.\u201d Swan\u2019s Stat. 256.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b193-6\">In reference to this matter, it was argued below that, wherever the state had legislated, the city could not legislate. We might admit, for the purpose of this, case, so much of the ordinance as follows the terms of the statute to be void; and thus we should leave trading, bartering, buying, and selling upon Sunday, as offenses not created by the statute, and not therefore exempted from city legislation. One part of an ordinance may be void, and the remainder effectual. Rogers <em>v. </em>Jones, 1 Wend. 260 ; Rex <em>v. </em>Faversham Fishermen\u2019s Co., 8 Term, 356; 2 Kyd on Corp. 155.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b193-7\">But we assert that an ordinance is not void merely because the state may have enacted a law upon the same subject. In Roger <em>v. </em>Jones, the Supreme Court of New York decided the very question, per Woodworth, Justice, delivering the opinion of the court: \u201c It is said, that the by-law of a town or a corporation is void, if the legislature have regulated the subject by law. If the legislature have passed a law regulating as to certain things in a city, I apprehend the corporation are not thereby restricted from making further regulations. Cases of this kind have occurred, and never been questioned on that ground; it is only to notice a case or two out of many. Tho legislature have imposed a penalty of one dollar for servile labor on Sunday, the corporation of New York have passed a by-law imposing the penalty of five dollars for the same offense. As to storing gunpowder in New York, the legislature and corporation have each imposed the .same penalty. Suits to recover the penalties have been sustained -under the corporation law.\u201d 1 Wend. 261. Our very case, it will be observed, is here cited as an illustration.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b193-8\">*And this power must belong to a municipal corporation, bjT tho very nature of its establishment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b193-9\">Til. But it was argued in the common pleas, although the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>legislature might pass a law to prohibit people from trading on Sunday, the city council has no such power.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b194-5\">Upon the contrary, we maintain that this subject of Sabbath observance, this prohibition of trade on particular days, is peculiarly within the province of municipal government. It is a part of the minor morals, if we may indulge the term, which can never be wisely controlled by a legislature, overrun with more important businoss, and unacquainted with tho temper of people in different neighborhoods. And if any line of distinction can be drawn between powers of general legislation and of municipal legislation, that line will leave this subject to such bodies as the city council. But we need no speculation upon principles here. Section 8 of the charter of Cincinnati declares: \u201cThat the said city council shall have power, and it is hereby made their duty to make and publish, from time to time, all such ordinances as shall be necessary to secure said city, and the inhabitants thereof, against injuries by fire, thieves, robbers, burglars, and all other persons violating the public peace; for the suppression of riots and gambling, and indecent and disorderly conduct; for the punishment of all lewd and lascivious behavior in the streets and other public <em>places of </em>said city; and <em>for </em>tho apjmehension and punishment of all vagrants and idle persons. They shall have power, from time to time, to make and publish all such laws and ordinances, as to them shall seem necessary, to provide for the safety, preserve the health, promote the prosperity, and improve the morals, order, comfort and convenience of said city, and the inhabitants thereof.\" Digest of Ord. 10, 11. <em>We </em>can scarcely imagine a larger delegation of power over subjects of this character. Under terms far loss extensive, the Supreme Court of the United States decided that the city of Philadelphia could accept a devise for the purposes of education (Vidal <em>v. </em>Girard\u2019s Ex\u2019rs, 2 How. 187, 189, 190) ; and education upon a peculiar and questionable system.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ArH\">*IY. Lastly, it was contended below, that this ordinance violates the constitution of Ohio.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b194-7\">And in this place we are referred to section 3 of article 8. Wo there find, in our bill of rights, the declaration, \u201c that all men have a natural and indefeasible right to worship Almighty God according to the dictates of conscience; that no human authority can, in any case whatever, control or interfere with the rights of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>conscience; that no man shall-be compelled to attend, erect, or support any place of worship, or to maintain any ministry, against his consent; and that no preference shall ever be given by law to any religious society or mode of worship, and no religious test shall be required as a qualification to any office of trust or profit.\u201d Swan\u2019s Stat. 35.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b195-5\">Now the ordinance in question clearly does not violate a Jew\u2019s right to serve God according to his own judgment. How it should have this effect, one can easily see ; for although the Israelite\u2019s religion teaches him not to buy and sell on Saturday, surely there will be no attempt to say that it enjoins him to buy and sell on Sunday. His conscience forbids him to violate the Sabbath of his people, but it does not compel him to violate the Sabbath of others. In the Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Wolf, 3 S. &amp; R. 50, it was indeed urged that there maybe Jews who \u201cmake it a point of conscience to show by plain, open, unequivocal acts, that the Christian institution'of Sunday is abhorrent to their minds.\u201d But the court answered that \u201c the invaluable privilege of the rights of conscience\u201d was never designed to shelter those persons who took pleasure in showing \u201c their contempt and abhorrence of the religious opinions of the great mass of the citizens;\u201d and a very proper answer it was.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b195-6\">But we are told that we have, by means of this political regulation, given a religious preference. To test the charge, let us consider similar cases, and cases of municipal legislation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b195-7\">Mayor of New York <em>v. </em>Slack, 3 Wheeler\u2019s Criminal Cases, 237. Cities may forbid, by penalty, burials of the dead within their corporate limits; even in ancient burial grounds. Now*we all know that some religious sects consecrate their places of interment, and deem it wrong ever to use the ground for other purposes. But these sects must yield to a sanitary regulation, and abandon theold graveyard, with all its holy attributes and recollections, for some new place of the dead. Moreover, burial grounds may be, and have been, appropriated to public use, for squares and streets, under our constitution. Yet how absurd would it be to argue that, in either of these examples, a political regulation had given the preference to religious societies which do not consecrate their places of interment, over those which do!</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b195-8\">Permoli <em>v. </em>The First Municipality, 3 How. 589. Cities may forbid, by penalty, the exposal of a corpse, at public prayers for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>the dead, within their corporate limits. This regulation was enacted by the council of New Orleans, as early as 1827, to prevent tho spread of contagious diseases; and all the Catholics were compelled to carry the bodies of their deceased relatives to the Obituary Chapel, outside of the city, for the last rites of their church. But shall we be told that here is a preference, by political regulation, to those sects which have no prayers for the dead over those which have ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b196-5\">We might here stop. The proposition can not be enforced more strongly than its own terms enforce it, by ever so many arguments and illustrations. No preference has been given to the Christian Church, nor to the Christian mode of worship at all; and no preference has been given to the individual Christian over tbe individual Jew, which could be avoided in the nature of things. For if Saturday had been chosen, the Jewish professor would have been preferred ; if Friday, the follower of Mohammed. And so through all the days of the week; for travelers tell us that each day is holden sacred by some sect or people on earth. But some day must be chosen, and why not tho Sabbath of the vast majority of our citizens? The fact that the Jew, if he abstain from work both Saturday and Sunday, will have fewer days in which to amass wealth than the Christian, proves nothing to this question. For the Catholic *has his holidays, by the observance of which he also is prevented in the race to get rich. It would, at most, furnish an argument that Saturday, as well as Sunday, should be kept sacred by the whole people, a point-to which we have alluded already, but can not now discuss.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b196-6\">Brough &amp; Zinn, and E. R. Norton, for the defendant:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b196-7\">It is argued for the city that the exemption only extends to common laborers, and not to common labor, and that defendant, being a tradesman, is not exempted, although a conscientious Sabbatarian, etc.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b196-8\">We set out with the proposition that the court should endeavor so'to construe this ordinance as to make it harmonize with natural justice, and with the constitution and laws of the state. Acts <em>in pari materia </em>are to be construed together, and in such manner as, if possible, to give effect to each. Dodge <em>v. </em>Gridley, 10 Ohio, 176 ; Ib. 452; 2 Mass. 143; 9 Cow. 437.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b196-9\">And the construction which we suggest, and upon which we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>respectfully insist, is- that which distinguishes the acts specified into two classes, thus:</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b197-5\">1. Pastimes and offenses. Sporting, rioting, quarreling, hunting, fishing, and shooting.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b197-6\">2. Lawful avocations. Trading, bartering, selling, buying, etc., or any common labor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b197-7\">That the phrase \u201cany\u201d has relation to trading, etc., and has the same signification as though the word <em>other </em>occurred directly after it. \u201c Trading,\u201d etc., or any other common labor, etc.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b197-8\">That the words \u201ctrading, bartering,\u201d etc., are but so many specifications of <em>kinds </em>of common labor, and the words \u201c or at any common labor \u201d thrown in to save time, as it were, by grouping all under the generic phrase.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b197-9\">The exception -in section 2 is, then, as broad as the enacting clause, and is pertinent and sensible, and the law harmonizes *with itself, and with the higher law of the constitution and the state legislature.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b197-10\">On the other hand, the\" construction for which the counsel for the city contends, as being that upon which the judgment of the \u25a0 mayor undoubtedly was grounded, is, that the acts enumerated should be classified into:</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b197-11\">1. Pastimes and offenses, and lawful avocations; thus, sporting, - rioting, quarreling, hunting, fishing, shooting, trading, bartering, buying, or selling, etc.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b197-12\">2. Common labor. And that t-he latter alone is excepted by the proviso, and <em>all </em>of the former class indiscriminately swept within the operation of the penalty.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b197-13\">Before considering the objections to this view, we beg leave to quote another general rule, of the highest authority, as to the construction of statutes. It is in the language of Chief Justice Marshal, in United States <em>v. </em>Fisher et al., 1 Cond. S. C. 425.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b197-14\">Where rights are infringed, where fundamental principles are overthrown, where the general system of the law is departed from, the \u201clegislative intention must be expressed with irresistible clearness,\u201d to induce a court of justice to suppose a design to effect such objects.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b197-15\">There is not a word in this lucid passage but is pregnant with meaning and force in respect to the argument we are about to submit. If we can show that rights are infringed \u2014 that fundamental principles are overthrown \u2014 that the general principle of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>the law is departed from in the construction contended for on tho opposite side, will not this court, too, say the legislative intention must be expressed with irresistible force, before we can suppose such an intention ? And is it so expressed in the view they present? Place the emphasis upon the word \u201c any \u201d \u2014 \u201c or at <em>any </em>common labor\u201d \u2014 and the reading we insist upon is, in point of fact, the plain, natural, and common-sense reading of the clause.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b198-5\">It is admitted by plaintiff\u2019s counsel that the term \u201ccommon labor,\u201d in the act of 1831, may embrace all sorts of employment; *yot it can not have that extensive signification in the ordinance, because that enumerates \u201cbartering, trading,\u201d etc., before using the comprehensive phrase. If the greater includes the less, then the enumeration here spoken of is mere surplusage \u2014 it is merged in the comprehensive phrase. On the other hand, if the enumeration is used with the intent to take it out of that phrase, then it is an infringement of rights, an infraction of fundamental principles, and a departure from tho general system of the law; and, therefore, not only is the intention to be most clearly manifest, but the power so to legislate must be equally apparent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b198-6\">As to the extent of this phrase \u201c common labor,\u201d let it, in the language of Lord Bacon, \u201c be restrained unto the fitness of the matter and the person.\u201d The proposition of plaintiff\u2019s counsel is that \u201c common labor \u201d is that in which we may suppose the vast majority of mankind to be habitually engaged, as distinguished from mechanical or other labor requiring the exercise of intellect or skill; and that such <em>\u201c </em>common labor \u201d is protected under the proviso. According to this argument, a dozen wood-sawyers, or as many street-pavers, might pursue their avocations, in the immediate vicinity of a place of worship, on the first day of the week ; and, if they had conscientiously observed the preceding day, they would be justified in so doing. Nay, further; the defendant himself, and others of his persuasion, might do the same thing, although their usual avocations on other days of the week were widely different, and rest themselves with perfect security upon the saving clause of the city ordinance. Yet if one of them, instead of this, pursues his ordinary avocation on that day, without infringing upon the rights or consciences of others, he becomes amenable to the penalty of the law. Now, to what result does this reasoning lead us ? \u201c Common \u201d labor upon the first day of the week is protected. Why so ? Because he who performs it, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>conscientiously observes the seventh day of the week as the Sabbath, and the constitution will not permit his right of conscience to bo restrained. All very well. But the Israelite, whose ordinary avocation is ^merchandising, may not pursue it on the first day of the week. Why ? Does he not conscientiously observe the seventh day ? Certainly. Can you restrain his right of conscience? No. What then? Why, his <em>ordinary avocation, </em>in the eyes of the city fathers, is not \u201c common labor; \u201d and though he have a conscientious right to saw wood or pave streets on that day, he has no such right to pursue his ordinary avocation, if it be any other than such <em>common </em>employment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b199-5\">The proposition wo submit is, that the phrase \u201ccommon labor \u201d is to be construed in reference to the <em>man </em>himself, and that the \u201c common labor \u201d of every one is that which pertains to his ordinary avocation. The drayman, the mechanic, the farmer, the clerk, the merchant, the physician, the attorney, the judge, and the divine, all labor in their respective callings. It is <em>all </em>labor, and we are all laborers. Whether it be physical labor alone, or of the physical and intellectual powers combined, it is ptill labor \u2014still the result of the primeval sin and curse, \u201c In the sweat of thy brow shalt thou eat tby bread.\u201d And it is all \u201ccommon labor,\u201d because it is labor common to our respective pursuits in life. And this, wo contend, is the correct construction of the phrase \u201c common labor,\u201d as well in the ordinance as in the statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b199-6\">The argument, which is based upon the relative provisions alike of the first and second sections of the ordinance and the statute, and a comparison between the keeper of a tavern or coffee-house, and a merchant or mechanic, following his usual occupation, is utterly unsound. The one is exercising a calling which the law has claimed and exercised the right and power to control, from the very organization of the state; one in which he has no rights save what he acquires from the law itself, and in which he may bo restricted; the other is in the enjoyment of a natural and indefeasible right. True, that in the exercise of it he is subject to the well-settled and defined principles of law that govern the intercourse of men; but his calling can not be singled out and struck down because it is not sufficiently \u201c common \u201d or menial in its character.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b199-7\">*But, it is asked, what is the office of the word \u201c common,\u201d prefixed to \u201clabor,\u201d if it be not thus to distinguish between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>classes and grades of employment. The answer is, that as the statute describes an offense and affixes a punishment, it contemplates the existence of a motive to do evil in the transgressor. The man who observes the seventh day of the week, and quietly goes about his ordinary avocations on the first, is not \u201c in motive or design,\u201d which is the language of the criminal law, a transgressor, and this, because he is engaged in that which is, with him, \u201c common labor.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b200-5\">Again, the inquiry is made, why, if the city council intended to include the ordinary occupation of a citizen, in the words \u201ccommon labor\u201d used.in the proviso, did they insert the prohibition against bartering, selling, etc., in the first section? We answer, that the office of the whole ordinance, taken together, is to prohibit all from either buying or selling, who are not protected by the saving clause. Though under the statute and ordinance both, as we construe them, the Israelite is permitted, on account of his religious faith, to vend his wares on the first day of the week, and there is no power to prohibit him from so doing; yet it is perfectly competent to prohibit a traffic with him on that day, by any others than those who hold a like religious faith. His right to sell, if that be his usual occupation, \u2014 his \u201c common labor,\u201d and the right of others, holding to like faith and observances, to buy, are matters which can not be restricted. The right of others to vend merchandise on that day, even as an ordinary occupation, is restrained by the statute; but the traffic of those not Israelites, and so amenable to the general laws in regard to the Sabbath, with such as are permitted to vend, is not restricted by the statute; and the office of the prohibition is to remedy this omission, and nothing more. To this end it is competent; beyond this, it has no power.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b200-6\">The ground we assume as to the relative positions of the ordinance and the statute, are not fully or fairly stated by plaintiff\u2019s counsel. We submit this proposition, and conceive it to be well-settled law, that where the act of a corporation, either *by express words or necessary implication, contravenes the letter or spirit of a statute law of the state, upon the same subject, it is necessarily void. Marietta <em>v. </em>Fearing, 4 Ohio, 432.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b200-7\">The policy of this statute is to require a due observance of tho first day of the week as a Sabbath. Yet it is marked by a great and distinctive principle, and that is, that its provisions shall not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>be operative upon those who conscientiously observe the seventh day instead.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b201-5\">For the purpose of the argument, let it be conceded, that within the policy of the law, a municipal corporation has the power within its jurisdiction, to legislate upon the same subject, and in so doing, to increase the punishment, or embrace other offenses against the Sabbath than those which are named; does it follow, by parity of reasoning or correct legal conclusion, that such corporation has also a right to infringe the principle of the law, by substituting a saving clause widely different, and far more restrictive than that which the statute contains ? Most assuredly not. Such a doctrine is too absurd in theory to be maintained by the courts, as it would be too dangerous in practice to be submitted to by the citizen.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b201-6\">The counsel for the city has labored to controvert, this position, by a citation of authorities, all of which fall within the first, without impairing the latter point. In Rogers <em>v. </em>Jones, 1 Wend. 260, it was held, that the legislature of New York, having fixed a fine of one dollar for servile labor on Sunday, the corporation of the city of New York might increase it to five dollars; and this is said to be a case in point. Not so. The increase was within the policy of the law; and we are not advised that any rights were impaired. In like manner, the ordinance now under consideration increases the maximum penalty of the statute from five to twenty dollars; but that is not adduced as a violation of the statute. So as to penalties for storing of gunpowder, cited in the same case. The legislature had never acted upon the subject. The principle is not shaken.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b201-7\">*But the learned counsel lays stress upon the phraseology of the statute. <em>\u201c </em>Nothing herein contained shall be construed,\u201d etc. \u201c A simple exemption from the force of that statute, not from liability under any other statute, or any municipal ordinance.\u201d The technicality is a mere grasp at a straw ; a quibble unworthy the case or the counsel. Is not the statute an existing law of the state ? Does it not, by its very exemption, declare a great principle, and fix the rights of the citizen under it? And may a municipal corporation restrict the one and infringe the other, because not prohibited in express terms from so doing? Most certainly not.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b201-8\">We submit, then, that if the construction which is claimed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>the city be put upon the ordinance, that it is in letter and in spirit repugnant to and contravenes the general law of the state; not because the corporation has legislated upon the same subject, but because in so doing it has undertaken to restrict the proviso of the statute, and limit the rights of the citizen, which the constitution has guarantied, and the statute confirmed unto him; and that insomuch as it does so, it is null and void.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b202-5\">Hitchcock, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"A7um\">The complaint which was the foundation of the proceedings in this case, was based upon an ordinance of the city of Cincinnati, \u201c for the prevention of certain immoral practices.\u201d Section 1 of this ordinance is as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-6\">\u201c Be it and it is hereby ordained by the city council of Cincinnati, that any person of the age of fourteen years or upward, who shall be found, on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday, sporting, rioting, quarreling, hunting, fishing, shooting, trading, bartering or selling, or buying any goods, wares, or merchandise, or at any common labor, works of necessity and charity excepted, shall be fined in any sum not exceeding twenty dollars.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">In section 2 i's found a proviso as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-8\">\u201c Provided nothing contained in section 1 of this ordinance, in relation to common labor, shall be construed to ^extend to those who conscientiously do observe the seventh day of the week as the Sabbath.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">It may, for present purposes, be admitted, that the city council^ under the general proviso delegated in the city charter, had power to pass this ordinance, provided the same does not contravene the constitution or some positive legislation of the state. But it is insisted by defendant\u2019s counsel, that, by a proper construction of the ordinance, a man whose ordinary business is to sell and buy goods, wares, or merchandise, arid who transacts such business on the first day of the week, is within the proviso, if he conscientiously observes the seventh day as a Sabbath. That, in thus transacting his ordinary business, he is but in the performance of \u201c common labor.\u201d It is further argued, that unless such be the proper construction, the ordinance does, in fact, contravene a positive law of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-10\">The words of the ordinance are, \u201ctrading, selling, or buying any goods, wares, or merchandise, or at any common labor,\u201d pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>vided that the prohibition \u201cin relation to common labor shall not be construed to extend,\u201d etc. Taking the phraseology of section 1, together with the proviso, it might, perhaps, be concluded that it was intended to make a distinction between \u201ctrading, buying, or selling,\u201d and ordinary or <em>\u201c </em>common labor.\u201d And, in construing the by-laws or ordinances of a corporation, or in construing a statute, it is generally safe to adopt the most obvious meaning of the law to be construed. But if such construction will defeat the operation of some other existing statute, such other construction should be adopted, if it can be done without doing violence to the language, that both may have effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">In section 1 of the \u201c act for the prevention of immoral practices,\u201d it is enacted, \u201c that if any person of the age of fourteen years or upward, shall be found on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday, sporting, rioting, quarreling, hunting, fishing, shooting, <em>or at common labor, </em>works of necessity or charity only excepted, he or she shall be fined in a sum not exceeding five dollars, nor less than one dollar: ^provided, nothing herein contained shall be construed to extend to those who conscientiously do observe the seventh day of the week as the Sabbath,\u201d etc. Swan\u2019s Stat. 255. It will be seen that the city ordinance, before referred to, is upon the same subject matter with this section of the statute, and it is an exact transcript of the same, with the interpolation of the words \u201c <em>trading, bartering or </em>selling, <em>or buying any goods, wares, or merchandise,\u201d </em>previous to the words \u201c or at common labor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Now, how is this general law of the state usually understood and construed? Does it admit or license \u201ctrading, bartering, or selling, or buying any goods, wares, or merchandise,\u201d on the first day of the week, while ordinary labor is prohibited? Can the merchant keep open his store, and vend his goods on this day, while the farmer is compelled to abandon his ordinary occupation ? Such has never been understood to be the meaning of the law. But, if trading or merchandising is prohibited on this day, it is only because the transaction of this description of business is considered to be within the meaning of the term \u201c common labor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">It seems to be admitted by counsel for the plaintiff in error, that, in giving a construction of the general law of the state, and in carrying that law into effect, \u201ctrading, bartering or selling, or buying goods, wares, and merchandise,\u201d must be held to be corn<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>mon labor; and such is, undoubtedly, the proper construction of the statute. But it is claimed that, when the same words are used in an ordinance of the city of Cincinnati, they should be held to have a different meaning. There may be force in this reasoning, but it seems to me, if adopted, it will lead us into difficulty.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Here we have a general law of the state, in which it is admitted that the phrase \u201ccommon labor,\u201d includes within its meaning, \u201ctrading, bartering or selling, buying,\u201d etc. We then have a city ordinance, in which these identical words are used, and we are called upon to say, that they are not included in the term \u201c common labor,\u201d because, in connection with them, ^these latter words are introduced. It-sems to me that it will not do; that although, by giving the construction to this ordinance contended for by plaintiff\u2019s counsel, we may shut up the shops of the Jewish merchants in Cincinnati, on the first day of the week, we shall open the shop-doors of the whole mercantile community in every other part of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">Besides, by giving the ordinance the construction which seems to me to be the proper one, that ordinance is rendered perfectly unobjectionable, as there can be no pretense that it is contrary to a statute law of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">The judgment of the court of common pleas is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
