The writ bears date on June 7, 1840; declaration was filed the 12th day of July following. At the November term of the court of common pleas of Pickaway county, judgment was entered by default against the defendants for 85,402.55, damages and costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b243-10\">To reverse this judgment this writ of error is prosecuted, and the errors assigned are :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b243-11\">1. That the writ of summons against the said John Walke and others is not signed by the clerk of the court of common pleas of the said county of Pickaway and State of Ohio, and that said writ is void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b243-12\">2. That the return of the sheriff upon said writ of summons issued against Anthony Walke, one of the plaintiffs in error, does not show that a copy of said writ of summons was served personally upon said Anthony Walke, or left at his usual place of residence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b243-13\">3. The precipe filed in said cause, and the indorsement upon said writ of summons against the plaintiffs in error, specifies only, as the cause of action, a bill of exchange, without the addition of the common counts, or any of them, while *the declaration adds the common counts in full; and the judgment is taken by default, without any actual appearance of the plaintiffs in error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b243-14\">_J. H. Geiger, and Swan &amp; Andrews, for plaintiffs in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b243-15\">1. The test of the writ, and the signing by the clerk, are dis^ tinct requirements of the statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b243-16\">The statute of March 8, 1831 (practice act), section 1, provided that, \u201c all writs and process issuing from the Supreme Court, shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>bear test by the chief judge thereof; and all writs and process issuing from courts of common pleas, shall bear test by the president of said courts;' which said writs and process shall be under the seal of the court from whence they issue, and be signed by the clerk thereof; and all writs and process shall run in the style of the \u2018State of Ohio,-county, ss.,\u2019 and shall be dated of the day on which the same may issue.\u201d 29 Stat. 58.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b244-7\">This act was repealed April 1, 1837, by an act passed March 14, 1837, in which it was provided, that \u201call writs and process issuing from the Supreme Court, or courts of common pleas, shall be under the seal of the court from whence the same shall issue, and shall bear test and be signed by the clerk of the court issuing the same ; and all writs and process shall run in the style of the \u2018State of Ohio,-county, ss.\u2019 and shall be dated of the day on which the same may issue.\u201d Swan\u2019s Stat. 690.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b244-10\">Thus it appears that the test and signature are substantially different things, and neither can bo dispensed with.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b244-11\">2. The deputy, as such, can not sign process, except in the name of the principal. <em>1</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b244-12\">The statutes in relation to the powers of clerks and sheriffs\u2019 deputies are identical. . See Swan\u2019s Stat. 284,285, of which section 3 reads as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b244-13\">\u201c The sheriff of any county may appoint one or more deputies, to be approved by the court of common pleas, or associate ^judges of such county ; and the clerks of the supreme court, and courts of common pleas, may each appoint a deputy, to be approved by their respective courts.\u201d And it is provided by sections 4 and 5, \u201c that the appointment of every such deputy shall bo evidenced by a certificate thereof, signed by his principal, and shall continue during the pleasure of the principal; and <em>every </em>principal may take such bond and security from his deputy as he shall deem necessary to secure the faithful discharge of the duties of his appointment; and the principal shall, in all cases, be answerable for the neglect of duty, or misconduct in office, of his deputy;\u201d and \u201cthat every such deputy shall, previous to entering on the duties of his appointment, take oath or affirmation faithfully to perform all the duties of his appointment; and when so qualified, the deputy may do and perform any and all of the duties appertaining to the office of his principal.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b244-14\">That the sheriff\u2019s deputy as such can not sign except in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>name of tho principal, is fully settled in the case of the Lessee of Anderson <em>v. </em>Brown et al., 9 Ohio, 151; in which it was held, that although a deputy sheriff could make a deed in the name of his principal, yet a deed executed by a deputy, <em>in Ms own name as deputy, </em>and not in the name of his principal, was void, and on the general ground that where delegated authority is exercised, it must be exercised in the name of the principal. We suppose this case to be identical in principle with the one before the court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b245-5\">So the return to a writ by a person who signs himself \u201c deputy sheriff,\u201d is erroneous for the same reason. Seo Ryan <em>v. </em>Eads, Bre. 168, where it is held that a return to a writ \u201c by a person who signs himself deputy sheriff,\u201d is \u201cclearly erroneousfor \u201c a deputy sheriff can only act in the name of his principal.\" Also see Gil-man\u2019s Dig. 637.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b245-6\">So also in Simonds <em>v. </em>Catlin, 2 Caine, 61, where a return had been made by a deputy sheriff, in his own name as deputy sheriff, the court hold that \u201c when a man acts in contemplation of law, by the authority and in the name of another, *if he does an act in his own name, though alleged to be done by him as attorney, it is void. In the case of Frontin <em>v. </em>Small, the attorney executed a lease in her own name, although stated to be made for and in the name of the principal, and the lease was held to bo void, because made in her own name. This case was recognized as good law so late as the case of Wilks <em>v. </em>Back. This return, therefore, is not an act of the sheriff, of which we can take notice.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b245-7\">3. The next question is as to the sufficiency of a sheriff\u2019s return, when it-does not show a personal service, or that a copy was leit at the usual place of residence of the defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b245-8\">It is very evident that, in this case, the return of the sheriff may bo true, and yet the statute may not be complied with. This identical question was decided in Franklin county, by the Supreme Court, ip the case of Ingram <em>v. </em>Wilcox, in the year 1826; present-, Judges Pease and Hitchcock. The return in this ease was, that the process was \u201cserved by leaving a copy at tho defendant\u2019s house.\u201d The statute then in force required that it should be left at his \u201cusual place of abode.\u201d A certified copy of the record in this case will be produced on the hearing.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b245-9\">4. The precipe filed in this case, and the indorsements upon the writs, show one cause of action, to wit \u2014 a bill of exchange. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>The declaration not only embraces this, but also other causes of action, by adding the common counts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b246-5\">If this can be done, a party apprised of one cause of action, by the indorsement upon the writ, and willing that judgment should go against him by default, for that cause of action may, without having received any notice whatever of any other cause of action being involved in the case, find a judgment by default taken against him, not only for the cause of action specified upon the writ, but upon as many other causes of action as the plaintiff may see fit to offer in evidence, and can so offer under the common counts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AF5\">^Supposing that the object of the statute in requiring the cause of action to be stated in the precipe and indorsed upon the writ, is to give the defendant notice of the cause of action on which the plaintiff relies, we think the declaration can not introduce any other.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b246-7\">H. H. Hunter, for defendant:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b246-8\">The two first errors assigned aro precisely the same in effect, one with the other, viz: that the writs of summons are not <em>signed by the cleric.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b246-9\">The statute (Swan\u2019s Stat. 690, sec. 152), provides \u201c That all process shall be under the seal of the court, etc., and shall bear test, and be signed by the clerk,\u201d etc. \u2022 .</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b246-10\">These writs are signed and sealed as follows :</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b246-11\">\u201c Witness, Wm. P. Darst, clerk of,\u201d etc., \u201cJune 7, 1842. [l. s.] \u25a0\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b246-12\">\u201c Geo. W. Jones, <em>Deputy </em>Glerlc.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b246-13\">The objection is, that this is not <em>signed </em>by the clerk, Wm. P. Darst. But is it not a signing by him in legal effect?</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b246-14\">It will hardly bo protended that process may not be issued, signed, and sealed in the name of the clerk, by his deputy. If it should be so contended, I would still think it unnecessary to disprove so absurd a proposition by argument.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b246-15\">The objection intended is, I suppose, that the signature, \u201c Goo. W. Jones, deputy clerk,\u201d is not a. signing by \u201cWm. P. Darst, clerk; by Geo. W. Jones, deputy.\u201d Even that might be admitted, if the name of the clerk did not appear, but it does.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b246-16\">The rule relied upon is, that the act must appear to be that of the principal, and not of the deputy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b246-17\">I say the act <em>does </em>appear to be the act of the principal. What else can be said of these terms: \u201cWitness, Wm. P. Darst, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>clerk?\u201d Will it be said that this is what is meant in the statute by the test of the writ ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b247-5\">*If so, I answer that the statute does not provide that the name of the clerk shall constitute a part of the test. It is all a matter of form, without any substance whatever, provided it be, in fact, the act of the proper officer, or his legal deputy; and that this was so, in fact, is not denied. The question is upon <em>form. </em>Now* I say this would be a very good form under the statute:</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b247-6\">\u201c Tested this-day of-, a. d. 18 \u2014 .</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b247-7\"><em>\u201cBy </em>Wm. P. Darst, <em>Clerk.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b247-8\">Geo. W. Jones, <em>Deputy.\u201d</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b247-9\">What difference is there, except in the order in which the words are written down, between this and the writ complained of? \u2014 viz:</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b247-10\">\u201c Witness Wm. P. Darst, clerk, this - day of-, A. d. 18 \u2014 .</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b247-12\">[l. s.] \u201c Geo. W. Jones, <em>Clerk.\u201d</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b247-13\">But, at the most, this can only be called \u201can irregularity.\u201d The writ is under the seal of the court; has all the necessary substance about it to notify the defendants by whom the suit is brought \u2014 in what court, for what cause of action, and the time and place they are required to appear, etc.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b247-14\">If, therefore, they had any matter of defense upon the merits, they need not to have lost the privilege of making it, by reason of their not being fully advised of all essential things by the writ. For all useful purposes, they were just as well advised by the writ, even if this were, upon <em>very </em>technical principles; an irregularity, as they could have been by the most formal writ. What, then, was their duty, according to all the authorities, if they wished to take advantage of this formal defect, if it be one? Why, appear at the very first term of the court thereafter, and move to quash or set aside the writ for. the irregularity; and if they failed to do that, they \u201c waived the irregularity.\u2019.\u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b247-15\">I shall be loth to learn that this court will, after the time which elapsed between this supposed irregularity and any motion *on the part of the defendants to take advantage of it, become instrumental in aiding in the commission of such gross injustice, as may follow a reversal of this judgment for this cause. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>Several years intervened between the judgment and prosecution of the writ of error.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b248-5\">2. The second error is, that the sheriff returned the writ against Anthony Walke \u2014 \u201c served by copy at his residence,\u201d and not \u201c at his <em>usual </em>place of residence.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b248-6\">I hope to be excused from arguing this proposition.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b248-7\">3. That the indorsement on the writ of the cause of action is a bill of exchange only; whereas, the declaration is not only upon a bill of exchange, but has in it the common counts also.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b248-8\">How is the party injured by this? It does not appear that the judgment was rendered for one cent more than it ought to have been upon the bill of exchange.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b248-9\">But I suppose it would have been perfectly regular for the plaintiff, on this indorsement on the writ, to have declared in the money counts above. Surely, the bill of exchange could be given in evidence under the money counts; and doubtless they wero put into the declaration from prudential motives, merely to avoid the difficulty in case of a variance between the bill and special count.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b248-10\">Henry Stanbery, attorney-general, upon the same side:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b248-11\">In addition to what is said by my associate, Mr. Hunter, I have only a word to say upon the point \u2014 that the signing of the summons by the deputy clerk does not appear to have been done in the name of the clerk.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b248-12\">1. If such a ministerial act must be executed in the name of the principal, we say this act was so executed. \u201c Witness, W. P. Darst, clerk, etc., George W. Jones, deputy clerk,\u201d fulfills the strictest requirements of the law of mere principal and agent. *2. If the writ were simply signed by the deputy clork; in such form as not to purport to be the act of the clerk, we claim it would be sufficient.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b248-13\">The deputy clerk is something more than the mere agent of the clerk. He is an officer of the law; must be appointed by the clerk; that appointment be ratified by the court, and must then take an oath to perform the duties of his appointment. All this being done, it is declared by the statute, <em>\u201c </em>that when so qualified, the deputy may do and perform any and all of the duties appertaining to the office of his principal.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b248-14\">This statutory grant of power to a deputy distinguishes this ease from Anderson\u2019s Lessee <em>v. </em>Brown et al., in which the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>only considered the relation in which a deputy sheriff stood to the sheriff, at common law.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b249-5\">Swan &amp; Andrews, in reply:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-6\">The testing aDd signing are different acts, and, before the act of March 14, 1837, were requirod to be performed by different persons. After the passage of this act, they were both directed to be done by the same person \u2014 to wit, the clerk.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-7\">There can be no doubt that the writ in this case is tested by the clerk and signed by the deputy clerk. The statute does not dispense with the signature of the clerk, because the writ is tested by the clerk; the counsel on the other side expect the court to do it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-8\">Our position is, that the writ can not be signed by the deputy clerk in his own name.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-9\">The statute relating to deputies does not authorize deputies to act in the name of their principals; but, by its tenor and language, recognizes the relation of principal and deputy throughout. There is nothing, therefore, in the statute which changes the common law. The case of Anderson\u2019s Lessee <em>v. </em>Brown et al., 9 Ohio, 151, is as applicable to deputy clerks as to deputy sheriffs; and the language of the court in that case \u2014 \u201cwhere delegated authority is exercised, it must be exercised *in the name of the principal; the deputies of a sheriff compose but one office, and they have no authority except that exercised in the name of the principal \u201d \u2014 is equally applicable to deputies, as well since, as before the statute relating to deputies was passed; unless, indeed, it bo held that deputies do not, under our statute, hold delegated powers, appointed as they are, and liable as their principals are for their conduct.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-10\">It is not claimed that usage \u2014 the general custom over the state \u2014or anything peculiar in reference to deputy clerks, should influence the court in this case. It is simply a question whether delegated power, exercised in the name of the delegate, is, in law, the act of the principal?</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-11\">2. As to the sufficiency of the sheriff\u2019s return, we beg leave to refer to the record in the case of Ingram <em>v. </em>Wilcox, decided some years since in the Supreme Court of Fraknlin county. If the \u201cresidence\u201d for the time being, and \u201cusual place of residence \u201d of the citizens of this state, in their various occupations and callings, be the same, then there is nothing in this assignment of er<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>ror. But if a citizen can have a <em>residence </em>at one place, while his <em>usual place of residence </em>is at another place, the legislature meant something by superadding to the word \u201cresidence,\u201d the words, \u2018\u00a1the usual place\u201d of residence. One of the counsel in this case .remarks, that such an assignment was sustained in the opinion announced in the case of Ingram <em>v. </em>Wilcox.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-5\">3. As to the last point, we deny that the common count can be added to a declaration where the precipe and indorsement upon the writ set forth simply a bill of exchange as the cause of action. What additional matter may have been proven under such a declaration the court can not know on error.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-6\">If this thing can be done, a thousand causes of action may be offered in evidence, and judgment taken upon them, which are not indorsed upon the writ. We have not supposed that this could be done.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AqOq\">\u2019\u00a1'-Hitchcock, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AtP\">The exceptions to the record in this case will be considered in the order in which the errors are assigned; and, first, as to the summons:</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">The record shows that a summons was issued under the seal of the court of common pleas, in due form, and attested and signed as follows: \u201cWilliam P. Darst, clerk of said court, this 7th day of June, in the year of our Lord 1842. George W. Jones, deputy clerk.\u201d It is supposed by the. counsel for plaintiffs <em>in error, </em>that this writ was void, because it does not purport to bo signed by the clerk, but only the deputy clerk. Formerly, all writs bore test in the name of the president judge of the circuit, or, in case of a vacancy in that office, then in the name of the senior associate judge; but it was necessary that they should be signed by the clerk. By the act of April 1, 1837, this law was changed, and it is provided, that writs shall \u201c bear test and be signed by the clerk of the court issuing the' same.\u201d Under this act, different modes of testing and signing writs, in different parts of the state, have been adopted. But, in the case before the court, there is no pretense but that the writ is properly tested \u2014 the only objection is, that it is not signed by the clerk, and the question presented is, whether a writ bearing tost in the name of the clerk, and signed by the deputy, is a void writ?</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">The act of February 17, 1831, for the appointment of certain officers therein named\u201d (Swan\u2019s Stat. 284), provides: \u201cThat the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>clerk of the Supreme Court and courts of common pleas may each appoint a deputy, to be approved by their respective courts.\u201d It is further provided, that \u201csuch deputy shall, previous to entering on the duties of his appointment, take an oath or affirmation to perform all the duties of his appointment; and, when so qualified, the deputy may do and perform all the duties appertaining to the office of his principal.\u201d Under this law, a practice has grown up in many parts of the state, for deputy clerks to sign writs, as was done *in the case now under consideration. It is one of the duties of clerks of courts to sign writs ; and the act expressly provides, that the deputy may do and perform all the duties appertaining to the office erf his principal.\u201d Such being the provision of the statute, it is not surprising that such a practice should have been adopted. It would have been more technically correct to have signed, in this case, as follows: \u201c Wm. P. Darst, clerk, by George <em>W. </em>Jones, deputy clerk.\u201d But, as it is, the statute is literally complied with, and no injury is done. For such cause, we should not feel ourselves justified in reversing a judgment. It may be supposed that this opinion contravenes the decision of this court in the case of Anderson <em>v. </em>Brown and others, 9 Ohio, 151, but wo think not. In that case it was held, that a deed upon a sale upon execution, in 1799, might be executed by a sheriff\u2019s deputy, in the name of his principal, but that the acknowledgment of such deed, made by the deputy after the death of his principal, is void. In 1799, there was no written law of the state authorizing a sheriff to appoint a deputy, but the court held, that by the common law, such appointment might be made ; but said that, whore delegated authority is exercised, it must be exercised in the name of the principal. The deputy sheriff, in that case, was, in truth, the mere agent, the attorney in fact of the sheriff. But a deputy clerk, under the law of 1831, is, in effect, the officer of the court. He can not be appointed without its approbation, and takes the same oath of office which is administered to the clerk. Still we think, as before said, that it would be more correct for him to sign process in the name of his principal, although we do not hold it to be indispensable.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">The next error assigned is, that there was no service upon one of the plaintiffs in error. If this be so, the judgment must be reversed. The record shows, that service was made \u201cby leaving a true copy of the summons at the residence of the party named.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>The law authorizes service to be made by leaving a copy at \u201cthe usual place of residence.\u201d Now, if *there is any substantial difference between the \u201cresidence \u201d of a person and his \u201cusual place of residence,\u201d the service in this caso may have been defective. But, not being able to perceive such difference, we can not say there was no service. A case is cited where it is sa'id that this court held, that service by copy left at the house of a defendant, was not good. There is a material difference in the two cases. A man may have two or more houses, and may not reside in either of them. But he can hardly have two places of residence, or two residences at one and the same time.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">It is next assigned for error, that the indorsement on the writ is, that the suit is brought upon a bill of exchange, whereas the declaration contains not only a count upon the bill of exchange, but also the common counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">If there be any error in this, it is rather late to take advantage of it. The plaintiffs in error, having been served with process, were in contemplation of law, in court. The proceedings against them were regular, or if not so, the time to take advantage of any irregularity was during the pendency of the suit.
