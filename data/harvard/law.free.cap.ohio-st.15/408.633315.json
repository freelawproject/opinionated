O\u2019Noil\u2019s survey, No. 913, of which the plaintiffs\u2019 lessors claim nine undivided seventeenth parts of ninety-nine acres. The de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>fendants, or heirs of Thomas Morris, claim title to the whole interest in the land. Or, if they have not the title, they then claim that they are in possession, with a legal right to maintain it, at against the plaintiffs\u2019 lessors. Both parties claim title under Amos Haines.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b344-5\">To sustain the action, the plaintiffs\u2019 lessors prove, first, that on September 1, 1817, Amos Haines, then the legal owner of the land, by title bond sold the same to Edward Barton, *Sen.; that Barton went into possession at that time, and remained in possession until his death, in the.year 1836. On the day of purchase he paid $1,100, by note of Mr. Wilson, and was to pay the balance in fifteen months, from May 1,1818; and it is shown that, on May 30, 1823, the balance of the purchase money was paid to James T. Johnston, administrator of Amos Haines, deceased, and, on proving the names of the heirs of Barton, he claims he shows a right to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b344-6\">To defeat this title by descent, the defendant shows that, when the balance of the purchase money was paid, Johnston, who was then administrator, and who was authorized to close up the estate and to sell the property, by defective powers of attorney as it appears, deeded the title, by direction of Edward Barton, Son., to Edward Barton, Jr., by deed dated May 30, 1823. This deed is signed by James T. Johnstoii, attorney in fact, for the heirs of Amos Haines. The deed contains the names of J. T. and Mary Johnston, as grantors, and who, for the consideration of $670.50, grant, bargain, and sell the land in controversy, by metes and bounds, and covenant that they are the true owners of the land ; that they have authority to convey in fee simple; and that they will warrant and forever defend the title against all claims whatsoever.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b344-7\">This deed was duly executed and acknowledged before a justice of the peace, in May, 1823, and recorded on November 19, 1823. Defendants also proved that Amos Haines died in 1819, leaving Lafayette Haines, his sole heir, and his widow, Mary, who intermarried with James T. Johnston. That Lafayette Haines died in -without issue; and that Margaret Canby (wife of Joseph Canbj7), Noah Haines, Nathan Haines, Robert Haines, and Mary McKay were the heirs of Lafayette Haines, in whom the naked legal title vested at his death. Deeds, with covenant of warranty against the grantors of those claiming under them, were executed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>to James T. Johnston, in 1825, by Robert, 'Nathan, and Noah Haines, and also by Margaret and Joseph Canby. That Edward *Barton, Jr., claimed all the equity in the land after the deed was executed in 1823, and that in 1837 ho executed a deed to Thomas Morris, the ancestor of the defendant, in due form, convoying to him the title which he had acquired.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 lessors, to rebut this, offered proof that, since the conveyances by the heirs of Lafayette Haines to James T. Johnston, the plaintiffs\u2019 lessors have procured them to execute conveyances, by which any title that remained in the heirs of Edward Barton, Sen., and of Amos and Lafayette Haines, is claimed to be vested in the plaintiffs\u2019 lessors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-6\">Sundry records are also in evidence, which, with the other facts, will bo found noticed in the opinion of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b345-7\">John Jollier\u00ae, for plaintiffs:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-8\">I. We trace, by direct evidence, the possession of the heirs of Edward Barton, Sen., and of the widow, down to May, 1836. Unless there be proof to the contrary, the law will presume that the possession continued until the twenty-one years were fulfilled. Bayard\u2019s Lessee <em>v. </em>Colefax et al., 4 Wash. C. C. 41; Phil. Ev. by Cow. &amp; Hill, 295, and cases there collated; 1 Stark. Ev. 36; Greenl.

To avail themselves of such title, they must first surrender possession to the co-heirs and then bring ejectment.\u201d Philan et ux. <em>v. </em>Kelly, 24 Wend. 389; see also 7 Cow. 637; 3 Adol. &amp; Ellis, 188; 2 lb. j 5 Johns. Ch. 407.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-10\">*111. The lessors of the plaintiff hold the legal title to the several shares for which they sue.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-11\">1. We then claim that we ought to recover upon an actual, notorious, and adverse possession, for upward of twenty-one years before the commencement of this suit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-12\">2. As parceners, whose right to recover the defendant can not dispute, until ho shall have-previously established his legal title <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>to the whole land, by a verdict and judgment in ejectment in his favor upon that legal title.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b346-5\">3. Because we hold the legal title under the deeds of such of Edward Barton (Sen.) 's heirs, under whom we claim, who, before they conveyed to the lessors of the plaintiff, had got in the legal title of all of Haines\u2019 heirs, except Madison McKay. But if these deeds passed nothing to us by reason of previous deeds to John\u2022ston, then, under the deed from Johnston, united with the deeds from Barton\u2019s heirs, we claim the legal title in the same manner as if Johnston had conveyed it to Barton\u2019s heirs before they convoyed to the lessors of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b346-6\">4. Even the possession of Mrs. Barton and her children, after the death of her husband, claiming, as they did claim, title to their respective shares, would be sufficient to enable the plaintiffs to recover, unless the defendants have shown a better title. 3 Ohio, 240, 388. The possession of one or more coparceners is the possession of all.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b346-7\">Either of these grounds is sufficient to enable the plaintiff to recover.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b346-8\">IV. The defendant claims his title under the deed from James T. Johnston and wife, made to Edward Barton, Jr.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b346-9\">1. This deed passed nothing more than the interest of Johnston and his wife. It did not pass any part of the interest of Haines\u2019 heirs. See Combs\u2019 case, 6 Co. 18; Strange, 705 ; Frontin <em>v. </em>Small, Paley on Agency, 152; Wilks <em>v. </em>Pack, 2 East, 142; 4 Mass. 595; Fowler <em>v. </em>Shearer, 7 Mass. 14; Sumner <em>v. </em>Williams, 8 Mass. 162; 1 Ohio, 349; 2 Wheat. 56.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AW9e\">^Johnston, at the time he made this deed, had a power of attorney from <em>part </em>only of the heirs of Amos Haines. It is signed by Joseph Can by and wife, Noah Haines, Nathan Haines, and Robert Haines, and is dated May 21, 1823.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b346-11\">The acknowledgment of Mrs. Canby is not sufficient. 2 Chase\u2019s Stat. 1139, sec. 2, 1140, sec. 6; 6 Ohio, 358. There is no acknowledgment by Robert Haines. 2 Chase\u2019s Stat. 1140, sec. 6. The power of attorney has never been recorded in Clermont county, whore the land is situated. 2 Chase\u2019s Stat. 1140, see. 7; Taylor <em>v. </em>McDonald\u2019s Heirs, 2 Bibb, 423. It has never been signed by Mrs. McKay, or any of her heirs. It has but one subscribing witness. Lessee of Patterson <em>v. </em>Pease et al., 4 Ohio, 190; Courcier <em>v. </em>Graham, 1 Ohio, 330.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b347-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>The deed from Johnston and wife to E. Barton, Jr., was a mere inullity, except so far as it conveyed the interest of Johnston and his wife. All the title of Haines\u2019 heirs remained as it was before it was made.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b347-5\">T. The defendant contends that by the deed of Noah Haines and wife, Nathan Haines, and wife, and Margaret H. Oanby and her husband, dated April 5, 1825, and the deed of Robert Haines, dated June 9, 1824, the parties conveyed to James T. Johnston, their interest, title, etc., to the land sold by Amos Haines to Edward Barton, Sen.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b347-6\">These deeds convey no title to the Barton farm, and were not intended by tho parties in any manner to affect that farm.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b347-7\">1. The deed from Robert Haines is of \u201cthe estate, real or personal, of which Amos Haines was <em>possessed </em>at his decease \u2014 to have and to hold the above estate or estates, with all the privileges and appurtenances, he and his heirs and assigns for ever.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b347-8\">Both the grantor and grantee had actual personal and positive notice that E. Barton, Sen., was in actual possession of the farm in question; that he had bought and paid for it, and, therefore,' held it by title adverse to Haines; and this deed applies *only to land of which Amos Haines had the <em>possession </em>at his death, either actual or constructive.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b347-9\">2. The deed from Oanby and wife, Noah Haines, and Nathan Haines, does not pass the legal title of Mrs. Canby, because the. statute (2 Chase\u2019s Stat. 1139, see. 2), required that upon the private examination, the wife should acknowledge the signing and sealing of the deed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b347-10\">Here the certificate does not state that she acknowledges tho \u201csealing\u201d of the deed, nor is there equivalent words. In Connell <em>v. </em>Connell, 6 Ohio, 358, it is held, \u201cthat before the rights of tho wife to lands are affected, the second section requires an acknowledgment that she voluntarily sealed and delivered\u201d the deed. As this is not done, her title did not pass. She had but a naked legal title, unaccompanied with the right of possession. Her husband had no interest; his only right being to take the rents, issues and profits \u2014 none of which could exist in this case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b347-11\">3. As to Nathan and Noah Haines, the certificate to the acknowledgment has no <em>seal. </em>It is dated June 6,1825, and governed by the act of February 24, 1820. 2 Chase\u2019s Stat. 1139. Section 1 of this act requires tho justice to subscribe his name and affix his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>seal to the certificate of acknowledgment. The act of December 29,1825, first page of the third volume of Chase\u2019s Statutes, provides, that it \u201c shall not be necessary to the validity of any deed or other instrument of writing hereafter to be executed, that a seal shall be affixed to the certificate of the officer before whom the acknowledgment shall be taken.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b348-5\">From May, 1818, until the act just quoted, a seal was required to the acknowledgments of all deeds in Ohio. See Paine et al. <em>v. </em>French, 4 Ohio, 318; Swan\u2019s Stat. 269, note <em>a. </em>At the time this deed was made, it did not pass the legal title of Noah and Nathan Haines to the land in dispute. Johnson took nothing by it in that land. The case comes within the rule in Good <em>v. </em>Zercher, 12 Ohio, 366.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b348-6\">Independently of the constitutional guaranty, it is beyond *the compass of legislative powers to take the title of one and confer it upon another, without trial, process, or compensation.

Where any interest whatsoever passes <em>from the party </em>making a deed, there can bo no estoppel against him.

This can not possibly be so; or the proof is, that Edward Barton, Sen., occupied the farm until his death, in May, 1836, taking to his own use all the profits of it, paying all the taxes, and three times demanded of Edward the deed from Johnston to him. At his death, Charlotte Barton and five of the children wore on the farm and remained upon it for some time thereafter, when the defendant obtained the possession. In Paine\u2019s Lessee \u00bb. Skinner et ah, 8 Ohio, 166, the court decided, that <em>\u201c </em>the possession under which a person claims to be protected by the act of limitations, must be continued, exclusive, and adverse.\u201d Here Edward Barton, Jr.-, had no possession of any kind, till after May, 1836.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b350-6\">A trustee of the legal title can not urge the lapse of time against his <em>cestui que trust. </em>Trustees of Lexington <em>v. </em>Heirs of Lindsay, 2 Marsh, (Ky.) 445; Redwood <em>v. </em>Riddick and Ex., 4 Munf.

If, however, I am mistaken in the views I have already presented, still the question left undecided in Lessee of Avery <em>v. </em>Defrees et al., 9 Ohio, 145, remains.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b350-9\">The defense is, that the present defendant holds the title of part of Haines\u2019 heirs, through Edward Barton, Jr. By the contract of sale and the payment of the purchase money, Haines\u2019 rights to the land itself was divested. He held, after that, but a naked legal title. I ask the attention of the court to the remarks of Chief Justice Marshall in Blight\u2019s Lessee <em>v. </em>Rochester, 7'Wheat, 535. Robert Haines, the agent of the -owner, know that Barton went into the possession about the time of the purchase, and no opposition to his taking possession appears to have been made by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>any person. He took possession, at least, by the acquiescence of the owner (see 7 Ohio, 99, pt. 2) ; and, after full payment of the purchase money and acquiescence for upward of twenty-one years, by the vendor, his heirs, widow, and administrator, surely a per. son claiming under the vendor can not be permitted to enter and avail himself of that title against the purchaser and those claiming under him. The vendee, even under a parol contract, may maintain trespass against the vendor, whore he has the possession. 1 Ohio, 252, and cases there referred to by the court.

Because Edward Barton,\"the purchaser, went into possession with the assent of Amos Haines, the owner; that he complied with his contract by paying up the purchase money, and that, therefore, he had a right to retain that possession, and was not \u00e1 wrong-doer; that no ejectment could be brought by Haines, the vendor, to terminate the purchaser\u2019s rights of possession, until the latter had made default in his contract, and possession had been demanded by the vendor; that the vendee had a license to enter, which is sufficient in an action of ejectment. And such appears to be the opinion of Mr. Jolliffe, in his argument.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b351-12\">2. I claim they can not recover because barred by the statute of limitations. The elder Barton, under whom we claim, and under whom the lessors of the plaintiff also claim, took possession of this property, in 1817, as his own. That the statute had commenced running against Haines and his son, and, of course, did not afterward stop for any subsequent disabilities, and had run out before August 3, 1843, when this suit was brought. It is true, the administrator, Johnston, claimed there was a balance of about fifty dollars due in 1823, when he made the deed ; but that was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>doniod by Barton, although he paid the balance rather than not have the deed made. If I recollect aright, the land was sold by the acre, and Johnston contended that, at that rate, there was this balance due. I claim, therefore, that the possession was, in fact, adverse, before that deed was made, and that it ought to be hold; and, if the court think so, the statute is a bar.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b352-5\">In the next place I claim, that whatever title was vested in the heirs of Haines was passed to James T. Johnston by their deed made in 1824 and 1825, and being so conveyed to Johnston, ^operated to the benefit of Edward Barton, the younger, and those claiming under him, by the doctrine of estoppel; and that the subsequent deed made by Johnston to JoIIiffe and Charlotte Barton, in 1838, conveyed nothing; because, the moment the heirs of Haines conveyed to Johnston, the title vested in the persons to whom he had previously convoyed it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b352-6\">The deed from Johnson,purports to convey a foe-simple estate. Johnston covenants he has a title to the property, and that he will warrant that title. He therefore could not recover against his own solemn deed; and if he could not, it is clear JoIIiffe and Charlotte Barton, who claim under him, can not recover.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b352-7\">It is claimed by Mr. JoIIiffe that the deeds from the heirs of Haines and Johnston do not cover this land, and that they were not intended to convey it. He claims he has a right to show that the parties did not intend to convey this land.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b352-8\">Although the deeds purport to convey all the right, title, interest, property, and demand which the parties have in and to the real or personal estate, as legal heirs \u00f3f M. de Lafayette Haines, minor, etc., or to the estate, real or personal, of which Amos Haines was possessed at his decease, yet Mr. JoIIiffe' says the deeds do not cover this land. Again, the grantors warrant that they will not claim or demand any right or title <em>to any of the estate </em>of the said M. de Lafayette Haines, or of the estate of his father, Amos Haines. See Robert Haines\u2019 deed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b352-9\">Oanby and wife, Noah Haines, and Nathan Haines, convey all their right, title, claim, interest, property, and demand in and to all real estate which has fallen or may fall to us, or either of us, as heirs and legal representatives of M. de Lafayette Haines, deceased, or of Amos Haines, to have and to hold <em>all such lands, </em>tenements, and real estate, as we could or might claim title to as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>heirs, etc.; and in this deed is a covenant to defend all persons claiming under them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b353-5\">But Mr. Jolliffe claims that Johnston\u2019s deed will not estop him, or those claiming under him, because, in the first place, ^Johnston made <em>a mistake </em>in-inserting a clause of warranty. He supposes it was an unnecessary warranty. But it appears to me it was necessary to insert this warranty; and I presume Barton thought so at the time, for he had paid a good price, and was entitled to a warranty deed. If we look at the real transaction, we shall see the parties really intended to convey a good title. Johnston had a power of attorney, which, he thought, authorized him to make a deed. He made one, and, it appears, his title was not thert perfect. But the heirs afterward vested a good title in him. Now, this is the very case to which the doctrine of estoppel is intended to apply. The party intended to convey the whole title, but he did not carry his intention into effect. He afterward acquired-a perfect title, and the law steps in and says it shall accrue'to the benefit of the grantee, and thus carry into effect the original intention of the parties. The doctrine of estoppel is a part of the moral policy of the law, intended to promote justice. It is not just that a man who has conveyed a title should be permitted to say he had no title to convey.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b353-6\">Mr. Jolliffe also claims the dood can not operate by estoppel, because a very small interest passed, viz: the interest of Johnston\u2019s wife, as widow of Amos Haines, deceased. \u2022 He seems to think that if a man sells the whole of an estate, as his own, and covenants to defend the title, and he subsequently finds he only owned one-seventh part of what he conveyed, he can then go and buy up the six-seventh part, and recover of his own grantee against his own deed. This proposition can not be met by argument. The cases cited by Mr. Jolliffe, so far as I have examined them,, give no countenance to his proposition. In the case in 11 Ohio, 332, the court admit the doctrine I contend for, although they say, in that case, a prior equity attached, which, in equity, would overreach a legal title.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b353-7\">I admit the vendor or his heirs were implied trustees of the title for the benefit of the purchaser or his assigns. But in this case Johnston actually conveyed to the person selected by the purchaser; he had therefore executed the trust according to *tho directions of the purchaser. There was no breach of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>trust. The question of notice or no notice, therefore, about which Mr. Jolliffe has said so much, has nothing to do with the case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b354-5\">Upon the whole, therefore, I claim the plaintiff has made out no title under the heirs of Haines. Can he recover on the title set up under the heirs of Barton? I think not.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b354-6\">First, because Barton himself never had a legal title. He had a good equitable title, which might have ripened into a legal title, but the elder Barton died before the title had so ripened. He had not, therefore, a legal title to vest in his heirs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b354-7\">And, in the next place, I claim that this question has been so settled by the decrees rendered between the younger Barton and his -brothers and sisters. In those cases, the very point and pith of the controversy in the first case was, as to whether the complainant had any equitable right; for as to the legal title, they then admitted it was in Edward Barton, Jr. In the last case, however, it was asserted the legal title had been outstanding in the heirs of Haines; that the complainants had purchased that title, and being in possession, and having the legal title, thoy sought to be quieted. The only question in litigation was, whether the complainants had the legal title. That question was decided against those under whom these lessors claim, and I maintain it as a final determination of the question as to the legal title, and it can not be again litigated between the same parties, or those claiming under them, either at law or equity. The statute has authorized a party in possession, claiming title, to have the validity of that title determined in a particular way. If he is not willing to wait until his adversary asserts a claim in court, he may, by becoming a plaintiff, compel a decision on his title merely. After having selected the tribunal thus pointed out to determine the question, I claim the decision of the court on that question is conclusive. It certainly would be if the decree had been for the complainant; it must be equally conclusive on the part of the defendants. If *1 am right in this position, it shows that the,plaintiff can npt recover under either title which ho has set up.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b354-8\">The plaintiff, however, insists that this deed was made by Johnston to the younger Barton, at the request of the elder Barton, in order to defraud the creditors of the latter, and that it is therefore void. There are two answers to this objection:</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b354-9\">1. We do not know that there were any creditors to defeat <em>\u2022 </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>none have complained of the transfer as affecting their interests, and I suppose the heirs can not complain on that account. 1 Ohio, 469.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b355-5\">In the next place, the grantor, Johnston, did not make the deed to cheat his creditors, and I take it none but the creditors of the grantor could insist upon the deed being absolutely void. Suppose Barton had assigned his title-bond without consideration, this might have been avoided in equity by the creditors; but surely Barton and his heirs could not avoid it on that account, any more than they could set aside a will made by their ancestors. There is nothing, therefore, in this objection.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b355-6\">Upon the whole, I claim the plaintiff has shown no title to recover in this action.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b355-7\">Birchard, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aur\">Several questions of interest have been presented for our consideration in the argument at bar, and in the briefs of counsel. We shall notice them severally, especially those that seem to us conclusive of'the rights of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">One subject of great diversity of opinion among counsel is presented by the deed of Canby and wife, executed in 1825. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel contend that it is defectively executed, inasmuch as the certificate of acknowledgment is insufficient. Were this so, it is difficult to see how it could effect this action. While Canby, the husband, lives, the right of possession to the lands of the wife is in him; and his deed, if valid, passed whatever right of possession the wife had. No proof of his decease has been adduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">' *But we will notice the deed. The substantial portion of the certificate of acknowledgment is in these words : \u201cPersonally came Joseph Canby and Margaret H. Canby, the within grantors, and acknowledged severally the. signing and sealing of the within deed of quitclaim to be their voluntary act and deed, for the uses and purposes therein contained. And the said Margaret being by me made known to the contents, and examined separate and apart from her said husband, declared that she signed the same without fear or coercion of her said husband, and of her own free will and accord.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-10\">The statute required that on the separate examination, the wifo should acknowledge the signing and sealing of the deed, and that this should bo certified by the magistrate. 2 Chase\u2019s Stat. 1139. Brown <em>v. </em>Farren, 3 Ohio, 140, is an authority recognized in Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>nell <em>v. </em>Connell, 6 Ohio, 353, and is at this time the law of the stale. The doctrine established there is that words used in the certificate of acknowledgment, which are equivalent to the'words of the statute, are sufficient. Let us consider, then, whether this deed, and the certificate, do not show that every requisite of the statute has been complied with, in substance and in fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">The signing and sealing, and delivery, were all done at the same time. This appears from the testatum clause of the deed, and from the attestations of the subscribing witnesses. The signing and sealing are one act, done at the same time. The signature adopted the seal already prefixed, and made the same the seal of the grantor; so that, in point of fact, there could bo no separation. If the signing was done voluntarily, it is impossible the sealing was not equally so. What does the certificate show? That Mrs. Canby united with her husband and acknowledged both the signing and sealing. When separately examined, she said the act thus done was her voluntary act and deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">It is easy to see how all this actually occurred, and to understand what it all meant. No man unlearned in the law, if of sound sense, reasoning fairly, and untrammeled by technicalities, *would ever come to the conclusion that Mrs. Canby did not mean to acknowledge the execution of the deed, or that the magistrate had not so certified. Apart from legal subtleties, and guided\u2019 by the lights of sound logic, every man would come to the same conclusion, and would assert, that by no possibility could any evil arise from holding such a certificate to be a full compliance with the statute \u2014 full evidence that the sealing, as well as the signing, was acknowledged. We think the deed is well executed to pass the title of Mrs. Canby, and will next consider whether the descriptive words of the instrument embrace the land in controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">The land is thus described : \u201cAll our right, title, claim, interest, property, or demand, of, in, and to all real estate which had fallen, or may fall to us, or either of us, as heirs or legal representatives of Marquis do Lafayette Haines, deceased, or of Amos Haines, deceased;\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">Numerous authorities have been adduced, in the hopo of satisfying us \u201c that this deed is so general in its terms that it embraces no land whatever, and is therefore void for uncertainty, and can not be made to pass title to any lands, without extrinsic evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>is resorted to. The terms of the deed aro ample. They are such as may be readily comprehended, and speak an intention on tho part of the grantor that admits of no doubt. Whatever title, legal or equitable, descended to the grantors or heirs of the two Haines, passed by the conveyance. Plainer words, of more apt to express that intention, could not be found. Extrinsic evidence in'such a case can only be to identify the land embraced by the description. It should show lands to which either of the decedents had an equity. The deed transferred it. So, if tho deceased had, as in this case, a naked legal title, that also passed. <em>Bight, title, claim, interest, or property, </em>are words of a most comprehensive meaning. Here they are disjunctively connected, and embrace everything that came by descent to the grantors.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">One more objection to this deed remains to be disposed of. It is said that the magistrate, in taking the acknowledgment of Noah *and Nathan Haines, has not affixed his seal. If this were so, the deed would be well executed under the existing state of tho law. Section 2 of the statute (Swan\u2019s Sfcat. 269) declares that the deed shall be hold sufficient to pass the legal title, notwithstanding the omission. The words are, \u201cshall be good and valid in law and equity.\u201d The statute purports to act retrospectively \u2014 not to create a title whore none existed before, but to make that a good title which the parties themselves meant to make good, by dispensing with a part of the form required of the officer, and by him carelessly and negligently omitted. This statute has been repeatedly under tho examination of this court upon the circuit, and has received the sanction of all its members, as a law of binding force. It violates the obligation of no contract, divests no vested right; but, on the contrary, supports a contract fairly and honestly made, and such a one as a court of chancery would have enforced. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">Again, does this question of law arise upon this deed? The magistrate commences the certificate of acknowledgment thus: \u201c The State of Ohio, Warren county, ss. Personally,\u201d etc. [Seal.] And at tho conclusion signs his name. The law has not made it the duty of the officer to place his seal at the end of the certificate, immediately after his signature; and, I take it, the seal placed as this is is his seal; so that, in point of fact, no such question as the one last disposed of could have been forced upon us, or would have been decided, but for the desire of the parties to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>settled every question which, by possibility, can be raised upon plausible grounds, touching this title. It has been much litigated already, and they have no reason to expect peace until they have a decided opinion upon every question agitated in the cause. The deed of Robert Haines is not objected to, except so far as the description is concerned. In this respect, it is like the deed of Noah and Nathan Haines, and of Canby and wife. Four-fifths of the legal title, then, by *these deeds, became vested in James T. Johnston. Before the title so vested, he had conveyed to Edward Barton, Jr., with the usual covenants of warranty. Upon principles of established law it would be held, under ordinary circumstances, that this after-acquired title would inure to the benefit of the prior grantee, and vest in Edward Barton, Jr., a good title by the doctrine of estoppel. Johnston could not recover against him and defeat a title that he had covenanted to defend against all claims whatsoever; and, if he could not, neither can the plaintiff\u2019s lessors, claiming under subsequent deeds from him. <em>We </em>must, then, look to the arguments relied upon to exempt this case from the operation of the general rule. In the first place, it is said Johnston undertook to convey as the attorney of Haines\u2019 heirs, and the warranty was mado by mistake. The mistake consisted in this only: He supposed the authority executed to him by the heirs of Haines, placed the title in him; and the dower estate of his wife being in him, that he had the power to vest in Barton, Jr., a sufficient title in foe, and that his deed effected that object. He was mistaken in supposing that an invalid instrument was good for something \u2014 mistaken in the legal effect of his conveyance. He was under no mistake in supposing Barton entitled to a good and sufficient warranty deed. This is shown by the title bond of the elder Haines, upon which full payment had then been made, and by direction of the elder Barton, to make the deed to his son. If the deed, therefore, by operation of law, under the circumstances, passes the title and vests it in Barton the younger, it only carries into effect the intention of the parties, including grantor, grantee, and owners of the legal as well as of the equitable title. The mistake, for this reason, must be laid out of view. Again, it is said that the doctrine of estoppel does not apply, because the after-acquired title of James T. Johnston was received by him as trustee for the heirs of the elder Barton, and that the case is within the principle of the decision in Birchard <em>,v. </em>Hubbard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>et al., 11 Ohio, 316. Now, I admit, that after a contract of sale and the payment of the purchase money, *the holder of the legal title holds it as trustee for him who is entitled to the deed in fee. That person was Edward Barton, Jr. The case in 11 Ohio is also admitted to be good law. But their application to the state of facts now before us is not so very palpable as plaintiffs\u2019 lessor, in his .argument, professes to believe. Barton the elder was the original contractor for the land; he purchased and paid for it, and, when his right to a deed was perfect, directed the conveyance to be made to the son, Barton, Jr.; and it was so made, in execution of the trust,'by order of the <em>cestui que trust. </em>Now, in all soberness, wherein was there a violation of the trust? Had not the real owner of the land a right to order the deed to be made to the son, or to any one else? When his order or his request has been complied with, does it lie in his power or in the power of his heirs to complain that the trustee has violated the trust? The heirs, and those claiming under them, could take no greater or other equitable or legal right than their ancestor proposed. He possessed none; for he had, in 1823, given up his bond for the use of his son. The statement of the proposition is sufficiently plain to show what must be the law .of the case. It needs no other illustration.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">The next objection shall be stated in the words of plaintiff\u2019s lessor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-6\">\u201cIf E. Barton, Jr., obtained any interest, however small, under this deed, there is no estoppel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-7\">\u201c For the present argument, then, I assume that nothing passed to E. Barton, Jr., under the deed from Johnston and wife to him. That deed is dated May 30,1823. Under that, Edward Barton, Jr., obtained no interest whatever in the land. On June 10, 1824, Robert Haines made the deed to James T. Johnston. Here, then, for upward of a year after the making of the deed, Edward Barton, Jr., held no interest whatever in the land. The deed, during all time, was inoperative as a conveyance. The proof is \u2014 and on this subject there is no dispute, and never has been \u2014 that *the deed was made to defraud the creditors of Edward Barton, Sen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-8\">\u201cAnd the question now is, does the doctrine of estoppel apply so as that the law will give lile and power to such a deed, by 1 perfecting\u2019 the title of the grantee, or will the law leave the parties where it found them ?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">To this point a vast number of authorities have been referred to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>and read. Without controverting the authority of any one'of the cases, we will give a direct answer to the question here propounded; and one that is consistent with every case of sound law to be found in the books of reports, as well those cited, as others that might have been. Wherever a conveyance has been made to defraud creditors, of either an equitable interest in lands or of a legal estate in lands, the law will leave the parties just where they have placed themselves. It will not permit either to be heard; to avoid the fraudulent act, by showing his own fraud ; nor will it permit the heir to avoid tho act of his ancestor, by proving the fraud of the ancestor, under whom he claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Let us apply the above prineiple'to the facts of this case. The elder Barton fraudulently gave over his contract, by which he held an equitable title, and caused Johnston to convey the land to his son, by warranty deed; whereas if he had been an honest man, and taken the conveyance to himself, he now would have had a good title, by operation of law. Johnston was not a party to the fraud. He did as ho was directed ; and what the father should have received, the son, by his fraudulent directions, took. The law leaves both where it found them, and operates upon their acts the samo as if good faith and honesty had governed their conduct throughout the iniquitous transaction. By so doing we do not sanction the fraud; wo merely-prohibit the heirs from taking advantage Of the sins of their ancestor. The fraud was directed against creditors ; they are not before us. Were we to permit the fraud to defeat the estoppel, then we should ho liable to the charge of having interfered *in aid of one of tho parties, but not otherwise. Another ground taken by plaintiff\u2019s lessor is, that a fraudulent conveyance is void, under our statute, as between the parties. It is admitted, in argument, that this point has repeatedly boon ruled to the contrary. It may be due to the counsel to notice it, however. Suppose, as he contends, that tho settled rule of construction encourages the fraudulent grantee to cheat his grantor; the answer is, that as between tho parties, the deed must be hold valid ; for a contrary rule would enable the fraudulent grantor to come into court to establish bis own crime, in avoidance of the deed. Against which practice we have seldom seen a stronger array of authorities and argument, than has been furnished us in .this very case by the plaintiff\u2019s lessor.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">It only remains for us to consider the nature of the title, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>possession. Edward Bar-ton, Sen., was placed on the land in 1817, in virtue of a contract, which was complied with by payment. Since that time his possession, and the possession of those who have claimed under him, has never been tortious. In 1825, he caused the conveyance, before spoken of, to bo made to his son, Edward, Jr. While living, he treated him as the owner \u2014 as having succeeded to all of his rights; and recognized him as tho landlord, himself as the tenant. To all of his rights the heirs of Morris have succeeded. This makes for them a possessory title of upward of twenty-one years, prior to 1843, upon the principles claimed on behalf of the plaintiffs\u2019 lessor. For it is in proof that Edward, Jr., was on the land, and that his father recognized him as the owner of whatever rights he once had under the Haines contract, from the day that J.' T. Johnston executed, pursuant to his directions, the defective conveyance, in 1823. This was established on the trial at law, and by the decree dismissing the bill, which was filed to enjoin Morris\u2019judgment in the action of ejectment. Shall the naked legal title, now outstanding in the heirs of Mary McKay, bo allowed to defeat this long possession of the equitable owners, and of those under whom they claim, even if the statute of limitations is not a bar? We answer in the ^negative. The possession taken under the title-bond was lawful, not tortious. Nothing has occurred to take away this right, which is in the heirs of Morris, and out of the plaintiffs\u2019 lessors. They can not recover upon a naked legal title, without a legal possessory right. To sustain this point the authorities cited are ample.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 lessors, however, claim that this last principle, properly applied to the facts before us, would entitle them to recover an undivided portion of the land in controversy, under the deeds from McKay\u2019s heirs. We do not expect to bo able to convince them of their error at present; but in order that our view may be fairly understood, I make a brief ro-statoment, which may enable them to see how far we go with them, and to comprehend the points where, and the ground upon which we separate.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">To this end we will examine, with some minuteness, the extent of the equitable title held by the heirs of the elder Barton. He, in his lifetime, with a view to defraud his creditors, delivered over his contract, and directed a conveyance of the entire title, both legal and equitable, to be made to his son. This act bound <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>him daring life: though fraudulent as to creditors, it was good and binding between the parties. It said efficiently for him, \u201cI have transferred <em>my </em>equity in this land to my son and had he lived, he would never have been permitted to gainsay it. His residence upon the land afterward, were there no other fact in the case, would be regarded as tho occupancy of tho son. As between the father and son, he must have been hold the tenant of the son, occupying by his permission and sufferance; because this would be the result of such conduct on their part, assuming that both acted honestly, and because the court would not listen to proof offered by either to show that the transaction was fraudulent. As between tho two Bartons, tho father has done an act in his lifetime which estops both him and those holding under him as heirs, from denying that, at his death, all the equitable interest in the land was vested in the son. His heirs hold just as their ancestor *held, and can claim nothing which he could not have claimed. The deeds from the heirs of McKay, passed to them nothing more than a naked legal title, subject to the equities arising under the contract, and the long-continued possession of those entitled to that equity, or who in law represented it. It is very evident that the plaintiffs\u2019 lessor has been undor a great mistake in the application of the facts to the law of his case. While he states tho latter generally with much accuracy, there is a strange misapplication of the former. He even assumes that the plaintiffs\u2019 lessor, claiming under the heirs of the older Barton, held a title by adverse possession since 1828, the date of Johnston\u2019s deed, up to the time the heirs were ejected by Morris under the deed from tho younger Barton, in 1836 ; and throughout his argument upon this part of the case, overlooks entirely the fact that, in 1823, Edward Barton, Sen., gave up his contract to Johnston, surrendered thereby the equity to his son, treated his son as the owner, and, supposing Johnston authorized to convey the legal title, directed him to convey to the son; that he did convey; and tho son, to the time of the father's death, refused to release or re-convey, although he permitted the father to remain on the land while he lived. He also assumes that all the equitable title remained in Edward Barton, Sen., after his fraudulent surrender, and the conveyance made by his direction; while wo hold that he can not show a particle of equity without showing the fraud; andj <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>as a matter of law, counsel admit that to permit him to do that would be grossly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">I have endeavored to make our views known.
