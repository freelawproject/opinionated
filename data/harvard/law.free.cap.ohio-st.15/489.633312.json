It was proved that a Mr. Maltitz and the plaintiff below, Bervellier, as the witness believed, came to his father, Jesse Justice\u2019s office; that Maltitz acted as interpreter for the plaintiff, who was a German, and proposed selling the draft in question to Jesse Justice. The latter said he had no correspondents in New York, but he would see if ho could sell it for him; that his father, Jesse Justice, wont out, and came back and told the parties that Ellis would take the draft and pay $200 down and the balance as soon as he could got advice of its payment in New York; that he had received the $200 of Ellis, and told Maltitz the plaintiff, Bervellier, must indorse the draft; that, after conversation between Maltitz and the said Bervellier, in a language which the witness could not understand, Maltitz signed Bervellior\u2019s name on the draft, the plaintiff being then standing close by the said Maltitz. After the name was signed, Jesse Justice asked if it was all right, to which the plaintiff nodded assent, and the money was counted out to the plaintiff; but whether ho or Maltitz took the money out of the office, he could not tell. He says Jesse Justice was not to charge anything for his services in the business.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-6\">The defendants below, now plaintiffs in error, then offered Jesse Justice as a witness to prove that he sold the draft in question to Ellis for the plaintiff, and at his request, and as his agent; that he did not and was not to charge anything for his services, but merely did it as a friendly act.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-7\">The introduction of Jesse Justice was objected to, because he had put his own name on the draft and was therefore liable to Ellis as indorser. The witness was rejected by the court,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"APp\">^although Ellis &amp; Yallette executed a release to Justice from all liability to them for costs incurred or to be incurred by the suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-9\">The error assigned is, that the court of common pleas erred in rejecting the testimony of the witness.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b413-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>Charles Eox, for plaintiffs in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b413-5\">I maintain that Justice stood perfectly indifferent in this case. Having indorsed the draft to Ellis, he would, it is said, be liable to Ellis, on his indorsement, as a warrantor in case the suit went against him; but, if Bervellier lost the suit, he would have had the right to recover against Justice, so that the .latter stood perfectly indifferent as to the result of the suit. He could neither gain nor lose by the event. The record, in this case, could not be used for or against Justice in a suit by Bervellier <em>v. </em>Justice; and there can be no doubt but what Bervellier could maintain a suit against Justice and against all parties who converted the draft, if he could maintain it. against Ellis &amp; Yallette \u2014 so that, according to my apprehension, Justice stood perfectly indifferent, as to interest; and this, I take it, is the test as to the competency of a witness. The case of Canal Bank <em>v. </em>Bank of Albany, 1 Hill, 289, cited by Messrs. Brough &amp; Zinn, establishes the principle for which I contend.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b413-6\">As to the liability of Justice, as an indorser merely, the court perceive Justico is not even liable at all in that capacity, because the bill was paid. He could only be made liable indirectly, by a protest and notice. The only interest, therefore, which he could possibly have in tb'e matter, is on account of the implied warranty of title.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b413-7\">In 9 Pick. 182, it is held a party is not incompetent on the ground of his liability as a warrantor, if he would be liable to others, to the same extent, notwithstanding the result of the suit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b413-8\">*In 5 Pick. 447, in an action against an attorney for money collected, the debtor was admitted as a witness to prove he had paid the debt to defendant, because he was liable to the plaintiff . whether he succeeded in that suit or not.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b413-9\">In the case of Larbalestier <em>v. </em>Clark, 1 B. Adol. 899; 20 Com. L. 899, a witness, who had sold the wine to the defendant, was excluded on the supposed ground of his liability as warrantor; but afterward a new trial was granted because of the error of the court in excluding the witness. The argument was, that, if the plaintiff recovered, the witness would be liable to pay not only the value of the goods, but also the cost of the action; but the court said he would not be liable for costs unless he had been guilty of fraud, and they say such has been the law since Jones <em>v. </em>Brooke, 4 Taunt. 460; cited also in Greenleaf\u2019s Ew, note to 444.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b414-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>Now the court will perceive the reason why a warrantor, like a surety, is rendered incompetent, is because he is liable, not only to the value of the article sold, but also to the costs of the suit. Hence, if this liability is removed by a release for the costs, he stands perfectly indifferent; for ho is as much liable to the real owner as he is to the person to whom he has warranted, and where the interest is balanced, the witness is competent. Greenl. Ev. 445, sec. 399.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b414-5\">Where the witness was liable for costs, but said he was indemnified for the costs and considered he had ample security, ho was held competent; so where he has funds to indemnify him. Greenl. Ev., sec. 420; 7 Cow. 358.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b414-6\">Now, in this case, all right to recover any costs for which Justice could be liable in this case, was released by Ellis &amp; Yallette, 30 that he was as much liable to the plaintiff as to the defendants, and the witness stood as liable to one party as to the other, and was therefore disinterested.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b414-7\">In Cutter <em>v. </em>Rathbun, 3 Hill, 577, a person had bought goods, representing himself to be the agent for Bennett, and made a note in Bennett\u2019s name without authority. In an action of replevin for the goods, Bennett was held a competent witness *to show he gave no authority, because the record could not be used by him as a bar, or used in a suit against the witness on the note.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b414-8\">So, in 4 Taunt. 18, a witness was held competent to prove that he received the property from the plaintiff, as security for money due, and that, according to an agreement with the plaintiff, he sold the property to the defendant, because the verdict could not be used for or against him. This is a case directly in point. 4 Barn. &amp; Ald. 410.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b414-9\">So, in this case, Justice was a mere agent for the plaintiff. Ho sold the bill for the plaintiff, and as his agent, without any compensation, or expectation of any; and the plaintiff confirmed the sale by receiving the money, or part of it. This was the fact offered to be proved. \\</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b414-10\">The court also erred in supposing Justice was liable as indorser. There was not, and could not be any liability as indorsor, because the draft was paid. The liability as indorser, o.riginally, was contingent, depending on the fact whether the draft was paid. In this case.the draft was paid, and this was the ground of the action, that Ellis &amp; Yallette had obtained the money for the draft, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>which was the conversion complained of. He could not bo liable as indorser, because to be liable in that capacity the draft must have been protested, and he notified of the fact.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b415-5\">But even admitting that Justice was liable on the draft, and this had been an action on the draft by the holder, and there had been affirmative proof that he had been made liable by notice, still, I maintain, the mere fact of his being liable as indorser would not have prevented him from being a competent witness. This doctrine is now well settled both in England and America. This doctrine is reviewed and settled in the Farmers and Mechanics\u2019 Bank of Michigan <em>v. </em>Griffith, 5 Hill, 476. The court say: \u201cPerhaps it might be doubted whether the witness ought to be excluded, even if his liability as indorser had been shown, for, by fixing the debt upon the defendant, he does not discharge himself. If he is liable, the ^plaintiff may prosecute him as well as the defendant, and prefer to take execution against him; or the maker may be insolvent, so that his interest would be contingent.\u201d 5 Wend. 181; 19 Com. L. 256; 3 Hill, 577.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b415-6\">Again, is it certain that an indorser of a draft does, in fact, warrant all the previous indorsements not to be forgeries? I know it is held that the indorser does, in fact, guaranty the bill shall be paid by the acceptor. But is there any guaranty operating after the bill is, in fact, paid? I know it is in general laid down, in the elementary books, that the indorser guaranties the genuineness of the previous indorsements; and yet I believe this question is not so well settled as is sometimes supposed. On the contrary, in the East India Co. <em>v. </em>Tritton, 3 Barn. &amp; Cress. 280; 10 Com. L. 82, the court held that an indorser does not warrant the genuineness of the previous indorsements; and, in this case, they deeidod there could be no recovery, by the acceptor, against the party who had indorsed the bills and received the money, as they only acted as agents of their principal, although their name was, in fact, on the back of the bill. The bills had been paid in that, as in the present case. If this decision is a correct exposi-, tion of the law, there could be no recovery at all against Justice, by Ellis &amp; Tallette, and, of course, he was a competent witness.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b415-7\">Brough &amp; Zinn, for defendant in error :</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b415-8\">In the language of the bill of exceptions, the witness was offered to prove \u201c that he sold the bill in question to the defendant Ellis, for the plaintiff, and at his request, and as his agent.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>We submit that he was clearly incompetent for this purpose, for that:</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b416-5\">1. The indorsement of the witness being unconditional \u2014 the fact of agency nowhere appearing upon the paper \u2014 and there being no ambiguity, parol testimony is inadmissible to vary the legal impoi\u2019t of the instrument. Stackpole <em>v. </em>Arnold, 11 Mass.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AnJp\">27; Shankland <em>v. </em>Corporation of *Washington, 5 Pet. 390, 394; Stone <em>v. </em>Vance et al., 6 Ohio, 246.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b416-7\">2. That a party to a negotiable instrument, though he may be called to prove facts subsequent to the indorsement, and which destroy the title of the holder, is not competent to prove any circumstance preceding or concurrent with the indorsement, in order to work such a result. Stone <em>v. </em>Vance et al., 6 Ohio, 246.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b416-8\">3. That the witness was incompetent from interest.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b416-9\">He is an unconditional indorser of a bill of exchange; and therefore a new drawer \u2014 a warrantor of title in himself, and impliedly so of the genuineness of all preceding indorsements. Chitty on Bills, 636; Story on same, 247, sec. 225.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b416-10\">It is scarcely necessary to multiply authorities to a point so well settled, and to shake which the counsel for plaintiff has cited but a single case, \u2014 East India Co. <em>v. </em>Tritton, 3 Barn. &amp; Cress. 280; 10 E. C. L. 82. And this case, the court will observe, is widely different from the one at bar. It was an action of assumpsit, by the acceptors, to recover of the party to whom money was paid, upon the ground that the indorsement to the payee was not regularly made. That indorsement had boon made by virtue of a power of attorney, which was subsequently adjudged insufficient for the purpose. In deciding a case where money was paid under a mistake of law, a doubt is expressed as to the liability of preceding indorsers, and nothing more. This will scarcely suffice to unsettle the general principle, which the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel admits runs through all the elementary books.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b416-11\">It is claimed, however, that if such liability exists, it is terminated by the payment of the bill, and that such payment, in this case, has been made. It is true that Rogers &amp; Co. paid the bill, and to that extent, as between Justice and Ellis &amp; Yallette, the undertaking of the former is performed. But his warranty of title, and of the genuineness of Bervellier\u2019s indorsement, is not thereby released. The counsel for plaintiff appears to overlook the fact that the bill has been paid on a forged Undorse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>ment; that it is, therefore, not a legal payment, and that, instead of releasing the indorser upon his implied warranty, it is the very thing that goes to fix it upon him. The books hold but one language on this subject. Chitty on Bills, 286, and cases cited; 32 E. C. L. 94; 1 Hill, 287.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b417-5\">If the principle for which counsel contends bo true, as between Ellis &amp; Yallette, it is equally so between the latter and Bervellier; and, in that event, the plaintiff below had no right to maintain his action against the defendants. The argument requires only to be stated to demonstrate its absurdity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b417-6\">If, then, the witness was liable to the defendants below, in the event of a recovery against them, was he incompetent, from interest, to testify in their behalf?</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b417-7\">\u00a5e adopt the general and well-settled principle, that the true test of the interest of the witness is, that he will either lose or gain by the direct legal operation or effect of the judgment, or that the same will be legal evidence for or against him in any other action. 1 Greenl. Ev. 434, and cases cited; 5 Ohio, 283.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b417-8\">It is not proposed to review at length the cases cited by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel. They are all cases in contract; and this being an action of tort, they are not applicable to it. In this case, the witness occupies a very different position from any that is.put in the authorities quoted \u2014 one that excludes him, as well from interest as upon sound principles of legal policy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b417-9\">The servant is not a witness for his master, in a case for damages caused by the negligence or misconduct of the former. 4 Mass. 349; 12 Ib. 163.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b417-10\">The pilot can not be called for the captain, who is sued for running down a vessel. 3 Car. &amp; Payne, 305.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b417-11\">The guard of a coach is incompetent, in a like charge, against proprietors. 4 Car. &amp; Payne, 383.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b417-12\">A broker can not be called' by his principal, in an action for misconduct, in the purchase of goods made through the broker. 6 Esp. 71. See also the general rule, and cases cited in 1 Greenl. Ev. 439, sec. 394.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b417-13\">*The action here proceeds upon the ground, that defendants below committed a tort to the plaintiff. They reply not guilty. If they be guilty, Justice is liable to them; and the record in this case, if it went no farther, would be evidence to fix tho amount of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>that liability, and for that reason, by the whole current of authority, he is excluded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b418-5\">But further, the liability of Justice to Ellis &amp; Yallette is to be determined by a recovery against them in this action, and that rests upon the fact, whether the signature of the plaintiff below, which Justice has impliedly warranted, is forged or genuine. If the former, his liability is fixed; if the latter, it is removed; and, to determine this point, he is called as a witness.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b418-6\">In Herrick <em>v. </em>Whitney, 15 Johns. 244. the payee of a promissory note was held incompetent in an action against the maker, although he had transferred it without recourse, and for the reason, as the court say, that he was liable upon his warranty that the note was not forged. \u201cHe has a direct interest in establishing the fact which he is called to prove.\u201d 5 Wend. 184; 6 Cow. 471; Ib. 484 ; 16 Johns. 201; and 3 Cow. 252, are cited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b418-7\">Equally so has Justice a \u201c direct interest \u201d in this case to prove that the signature of Bervellier is genuino, or attached in such manner as to be binding upon him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b418-8\">It is claimed, however, that the witness being released, as to costs, has a balanced interest; that ho stands perfectly indifferent between the parties, which, if it is the fact, renders him competent, and the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel goes into an elaborate examination of authorities to sustain this position. The general principle is not controverted, but the assumption that the witness is within it is denied. \u201cJustice having indorsed the draft to Ellis,\u201d says the counsel for plaintiffs, \u201c would, it is said, be liable to Ellis on his indorsement as a warrantor; but if Bervellier lost the suit, he would have the right to recover against Justice.\u201d Not so. If Bervellier recover against Ellis and Yallette, he may. also have his action and recover against ^Justice; but he can have but one satisfaction. But if he fail in this action, his right to recover of Justice fails with it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b418-9\">The action is trover, and the defendants below put in issue the title of the plaintiff to the bill of exchange, claiming that he was legally divested of it, and that it was in themselves. A verdict for the defendant, upon the pleadings and the testimony, must find this fact if it find anything. It must find that the indorsement of Bervellier, if not made by himself, was put there in his presence, and with his knowledge and consent, in such a manner as legally to pass his title to the property; for this is the fact in issue</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b419-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>What, then, would bo the effect of the record in this case, in a subsequent action by Bervellier against Justice, as a prior indorser of the same bill ? Would it not, either pleaded or offered in evidence, effectually estop the plaintiff?</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b419-5\">\u201c If the title to the property was set up by the defendant in the first action, and it was found for him, it is clearly a bar to a second action for the same chattel, even though brought against one not a party to the former suit, but an accomplice in the original undertaking.\u201d 1 Greenl. Ev. 571, sec 533, and cases cited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b419-6\">\u201cIt is not necessary to the conclusiveness of the. former judgment, that issue should have been taken upon the precise point which is controverted in the second trial; it is sufficient if that point was essential to the finding of the former verdict.\u201d 1 Greenl. Ev. 572, sec. 534; see also same authority, page 568, note 1, and authorities cited,</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b419-7\">Birchard, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AI5\">Our first inquiry is, was the interest of Jesse Justice such as to render him an incompetent witness for the plaintiff? To solve this, it is necessary to consider whether he could derive any advantage from a determination of the suit in favor of Ellis &amp; Vallette. As he was an indorser of the obligation to them, the most that can be claimed on behalf of defendant is, that he might be made liable in the event of a recovery against Ellis &amp; Yallette, for the amount of the bill *of exchange, and for no more. The release which was executed and delivered to him, would exonerate and discharge him from any claim for costs by the plaintiff in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">How stands the interest in the event of a recovery by them ? If the position assumed on behalf of Bervellier be correct (and he was not at liberty to deny its correctness), his failure to recover of Ellis <em>&amp; </em>Yallette would not defeat his right to recover the amount of the bill against Justice. He was the indorser \u2014 had negotiated the paper; and if the name of Bervellier was a forgery, the act of Justice was an unlawful conversion, for which trover against him could be maintained, and the recovery would still be the amount of the bill. This state of the case so placed him, that he could neither gain nor lose by the event of the suit, and shows that his interest was equally balanced, and that he ought to have been permitted to testify, unless there shall be found some other obstacle. What, then, are the remaining reasons offered to sustain the ruling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>of the court of common picas? The first, in point of importance, is, that the indorsement by Justice being, on its face, unconditional and unambiguous, parol evidence is inadmissible to vary or contradict the legal import of the instrument. In answer to this, it is sufficient to say that his testimony was not offered to vary or alter the effect of his indorsement. The object was not to change the contract made and supposed <em>to </em>subsist between him and Ellis &amp; Yallotto. A like answer may be given to another position, which counsel insist upon, that he could not give evidence to destroy the title of the holder, by proving facts or circumstances preceding or concurrent with the indorsement. We reply, that he was not offered to establish a fact inconsistent with his indorsement, and which tended to destroy its force. On the contrary, the evidence sought from him was perfectly inconsistent with and tended to sustain it.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Another argument is, that in a suit by Bervellier against the witness, the record in this case, showing a recovery against Bervellier, would be a bar. It would be strange, indeed, if one ^having a good cause of action in trover against A., should lose it entirely by attempting and failing to recover of B., against whom he had no right of action. The only authority cited in support of this singular doctrine is from Greenleaf\u2019s evidence, which is misapplied, and by no means sustains it, and will be seen by recurring to and carefully examining the reported cases referred to by that author. Judgment reversed <em>and cause remanded.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
