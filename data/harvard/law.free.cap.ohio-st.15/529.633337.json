When the land was located and patented, the elder Pierce was to convey to each warrant-holder his proportion ; and for these services he was to receive one dollar and fifty cents for each hundred acres. He located these warrants on section 2, of township 4, in range 17, of the United States military lands in Delaware county, containing *4,000 acres. This location was accordingly patented to Enoch Pierce, the father, in his lifetime, who died in 1803 or 1804.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-8\">Moses Byxbee, from whom the complainants derive their title, commenced purchasing the rights of the warrant-holders before Pierce\u2019s death, and in 1805, purchased from the widow and the administrator of Pierce the elder, the deceased, and his ten children, all their right, title, and interest in the section. These conveyances were executed in Massachusetts, where the Pierce family then resided. The consideration paid by Byxbee to the widow, administrator, and heirs, was \u00a71,000. Throe of the children were then minors, who are now, in consequence thereof, claiming three-tenth's of the land so entered and patented. These three children are the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-9\">It is claimed in the bill, and the depositions of Root and others show this to be the fact, that the elder Pierce had no interest iu the land except his locating fee \u2014 one dollar and fifty cents per one hundred acres; that he merely held the land and patent in trust for the warrant-holders; and that Byxbee, soon after the location o\u00ed the land, was engaged in purchasing up the rights of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>warrant-holders. It appears, from the papers on file, he purchased up all the warrants, at or about that time, except 600 acres out of 4,000, and it does not appear but that he might have purchased up the 600 also. Who has actually the right to the warrants covering these 600 acres does not appear.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-5\">The complainants, as purchasers from Byxbee, have been in possession ever since 1804-05, claiming title, and in the undisturbed possession upward of thirty years. The youngest of the defendants arrived at majority in the year 1812, and never set up any claim to the land until 1837 \u2014 twenty-five years after the youngest heir arrived of age, and thirty-three years after the complainants have been in the peaceable <em>possession. </em>The defendants have recently brought an aetion of ejectment to recover the land. The bill seeks to enjoin them from proceeding at law, and to quiet the title.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AJq\">*T. W. Powell, for complainants :</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b446-7\">It is claimed by the complainants, that after such a lapse of time, during all which they have been in possession of the premises, the law will presume they hold by legal conveyances. In relation to presumption, the following maxims have been established:</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b446-8\">1. Presumption is only made in favor of him who is in possession. 11 Ohio, 477.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b446-9\">2. That whatever was done, was right.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b446-10\">3. That what should be done, was done.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b446-11\">4. That after a lapse of time, courts will not permit the manner in which a thing was done to be called in question.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b446-12\">5. That it applies to intermediate parties, whether privies or not. See 1 Fonb. Eq. 258; 1 Phil. Ev. 124, n. <em>a, </em>old ed.; 1 Caine, 89, <em>n. a; </em>3 Stark. Ev. 1220, 1227 ; Matthews\u2019 Pres. Ev. 5, 6, 221. In 1 Pow. Mort. 398 (Hillary <em>v. </em>Waller, 12 Ves. 238), Sir W. Grant says: \u201c There was much occasion for presuming conveyances of legal estates when, from the length of time, it had become impossible to discern in whom the legal title was invested.\u201d Ib. 401, n. 2; Matthews\u2019 Pres. Ev. 221. \u201cBut although time alone be not sufficient, in eases of this description, to afford an inference that the legal estate has been conveyed, yet it does not seem necessary, in order to establish such supposition, that direct testimony of the fact should be adduced. The courts are satisfied with reasonable probability, and will receive circumstantial evidence as equally conclusive in this respect with positive. Thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>the long and frequent exercise of such acts of ownership, by the party beneficially entitled, as make it probable that the legal interest was vested in him, will enable the court to entertain the presumption.\u201d See also 3 Stark. Ev. 1227; see an instructive note, 1 Phil. Ev. 124, n. <em>a; </em>also in 1 Caine, 2 ed. 89.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b447-5\">Another principle which comes in aid of raising a presumption is, the rule of law by which all things done are presumed *to be legally done, unless the contrary appears (see note to 1 Caine, 89), <em>omnia rite acta esse </em>(3 Stark. Ev. 1249), and also that after a lapse of time, courts will not inquire very strictly for the evidence of the means by which a right was acquired, but will presume those acts to have been done which are consistent with the possession or claim all along set up, the length of time depending upon the character of the acts to be presumed, and the situation of the parties. If it is a'deed or legal conveyance, a longer period; if an assignment of an equity, or a chose in action, or payment of money, a shorter period will suffice, and the period' is shorter in proportion to the liability of losing the evidence, or the solemnity upon which the act depends. Presumption thus raised will require a shorter period in cases where the evidence of the existence of the fact to be presumed is more liable to be lost or destroyed. This presumption, thus based upon circumstances and lapse of time, is applicable to all human affairs and all claims to property, whether real or personal, corporeal or incorporeal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b447-6\">The following authorities conclusively establish the position that this presumption may be raised without regard to the statute of limitations, and in cases of corporeal property: Clark <em>v. </em>Furnace, 4 Pick. 245; Jackson <em>v. </em>McCall, 10 Johns. 380; Moore <em>v. </em>Jackson,4 Wend. 63: reversing the case in 6 Cow. 706, in which the court says, \u201c A release to the <em>cestui que trust </em>would be presumed after such a lapse of time\u201d (thirty-two years); Jackson <em>v. </em>Murray, 7 Johns. 5; Vandyck <em>v. </em>Van Buren, 1 Caine, 84 ; England <em>v. </em>Slade, 4 Term, 683; Jackson <em>v. </em>Wolsey, 11 Johns. 450 ; Jackson <em>v. </em>Hudson, 3 Johns, 386 ; Corwin <em>v. </em>Graham, 1 Ohio, 330.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b447-7\">These are all cases at law where a title was raised by presumption in relation to land, and no incorporeal right in question. And it will be raised at a longer or shorter period, depending upon circumstancos. Phil. Ev.; 1 Caine, <em>supra. </em>\u201cAs to the time, the jury may be directed to presumo a surrender or conveyance in much less time than twenty years.\u201d Per Kenyon, *Ch. J., Eng<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>land <em>v. </em>Slade, 4 Term, 683 (eighteen years); Jackson <em>v. </em>McCall, 10 Johns. 377 \u2014 a re-entry presumed in fourteen years; J. <em>v. </em>Demarest, 2 Caine, 382; J. <em>v. </em>Stewart, 6 Johns. 34. Where the heirs had been in possession of the purchase under a sale by an administrator for twenty years, it was presumed the administrator had taken the necessary steps previous to the sale. Gray <em>v. </em>Gardner, 3 Mass. 399; see also Coleman <em>v. </em>Anderson, 10 Mass. 105. Presumption of an exception made in the previous deed, as to a drain, after sixteen years (Bergen <em>v. </em>Bennett, 1 Caine\u2019s Cas. in Error, 1) ; so possession of crown land commenced by encroachment fifty-five years ago, if continued down within seven years, a grant will be presumed, unless it appears that, by statute or otherwise, the crown could not grant. Goodlittle v. Baldwin, 11 East, 488; Clark <em>v. </em>Furnace, 4 Pick. 245. Twenty years\u2019 possession, connected with other circumstances, was considered sufficient to raise a presumption of a conveyance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b448-5\">Where, on a perpetual lease reserving rent, none had been demanded for. forty-four years, an extinguishment by some act or deed of the party was presumed. Livingstone <em>v. </em>Livingstone, 4 Johns. Ch. 294. Non-claimer of a right to cut timber for thirty years raised a similar presumption. 1 Johns. Ch. 362; Cox <em>v. </em>Smith, Ib. 271; Harn <em>v. </em>Schuyler, Ib. 7. From these cases it will appear that a presumption of the execution of a deed or the ex-tinguishment of a claim will be raised at all periods, depending on other facts in the case, upon which a probability may rest. In most instances twenty will do. That period will create an easement, presumo the payment of a mortgage, bar a right of redemption ; and short of thirty years the execution of deeds has frequently been presumed. N\u00b0w'&gt; i*1 this case, it is not at all necessary to raise the presumption of a deed; all that is necessary is to presume an assignment of the residue of the rights of the warrant-holders to Byxbeo, or that at the ti me when he was purchasing up their claims and purchased most of them, he purchased all. For this purpose the most simple act would be sufficient. A *vorbal contract and payment of consideration, or the most informal writing, would be sufficient as between these parties.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b448-6\">It is suggested by the opposite counsel that there should be a privity between those who claim the benefit of the presumption and those from whom the title would be derived by such presumption. There is nothing in any case that would sustain this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>position, while there are many cases in opposition to it. Where a person had been in possession seventy years, and showed an old lease from the lessor\u2019s ancestor to a third person, the court presumed the intermediate assignment. 1 Phil. Ev. 124, n.; Earl <em>v. </em>Barter, 2 W. Black. 1228; 3 Stark. Ev. 1220. So in the case of Moore <em>v. </em>Jackson &amp; Erwin, 4 Wend. 63. That case was this: The elder Erwin and three others purchased a large tract of land, for the benefit of twelve persons, including themselves, and took an absolute conveyance to themselves, so that they held four-twelfths in their own right and eight-twelfths in trust for the others. The elder Erwin purchased one-twelfth of the outstanding,equities. The plaintiff in ejectment claimed under Erwin, and claimed that the original grant covered the land in possession of Moore, the defendant, who claimed the land by a title derived from an entirely different source, so that there was no more privity in that case than in this. The questions in the case are two: 1. Did the grant to the elder Erwin cover the land in controversy? 2. Could the plaintiffs claim, as heirs of Erwin, an interest in the seven-twelfths which was held in trust, or were they confined to one-twelfth which Erwin held in his own right, and one-twelfth the outstanding equity which he purchased ? l-12-j-l-12=2-12. Erwin purchased in 1790 ; Moore purchased in 1793, but when he took possession does not appear. As the case is reported in 6 Cow. 710, it is said :</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b449-5\">\u201cNo claim was ever made to any portion of the land included in the gores, by any person in those townships, from 1791-to the commencement of the suit in 1816,\u201d being twenty-five years. Upon the second point the court say, (4 Wend. 63), \u201cwhether any part of the legal estate in those seven-twelfths *of the premises conveyed descended to the heirs of Erwin, it is not necessary now to inquire. If it did so, a release to the <em>cestuis que trust </em>would probably be presumed after such a lapse of time.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b449-6\">Here this presumption was made in favor of Moore, where there was no privity between him and <em>cestuis que trust. </em>Such presumptions are made for the sake of quieting possessions of long standing, rights long exercised.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b449-7\">It is claimed that a presumption may as well be raised in favor of the defendants, that they have extinguished the outstanding claims, as in favor of the complainants. But this would be entirely contrary to the principles upon which presumptions in these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>cases are raised. These presumptions are only raised in favor of those in possession of the property, or who have for a long time claimed and exercised a right consistent with the presumption. They are raised for the sake of giving peace to those who have for some time exercised a right, when the evidence of such right may have been lost by time or accident, but never in favor of those who claim-adversely to such right or possession. \u201cWhere the possession is old and has gone according to the right set up, a deed, necessary to the title will be presumed.\u201d 1 Caine, 89, n.; 1 Vent. 257; see also 1 Fonb. Eq. 330, n. <em>g. </em>Lord Ellenborougk said \u201c that he would presume anything capable of being presumed, in order to support a long enjoyment.\u201d 11 East, 280; Roe <em>v. </em>Ireland, 3 Stark. Ev. 1220. No case can bo found where a presumption is raised in favor of a naked title, where the claimant has not been in the enjoyment of such right. A surrender, conveyance, .or any other act, may be presumed for the purpose of supporting such possession, but never against it or to destroy it; otherwise it would be more difficult to raise such presumption against third persons, than it would be against persons whom it was presumed had executed the conveyance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b450-5\">Take the case of Earl <em>v. </em>Baxter above recited, where the intermediate assignments from the original lessee were presumed to have been made, in a case brought by the lessor against a ^tenant who had been in possession seventy years. Here there was no privity, except upon the hypothesis of the assignment having been made. So in the case now before the court, though there is no privity independent of the presumption ; yet when that presumption is raised, there is the same privity as in the last-mentioned case, and the same that always subsists between the vendor and vendee.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b450-6\">S. Finch, for respondents:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b450-7\">The doctrine that certain facts being proved, and other facts in harmony with them, and so connected with them that, without supposing the existence of the latter, the former could not be reasonably accounted for, may be inferred or presumed from the facts proved, is as old as the common law, and as well founded in reason as any other doctrine in it, and is nothing more or less than the doctrine of presumption; and it may be used either to establish or defeat a right, or claim of right; and it is conceded that different kinds of facts, and facts of different degrees of potency as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>evidence, are required to constitute the foundations for inferring or presuming the existence or abandonment of different claims.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b451-5\">One of the most common grounds set up for the presumption of the satisfaction, abandonment, or release of claims, is the fact that the claimant has neglected for a long time to assert his claim, though he knew another was in possession and holding adversely the thing claimed by him; and this is reasonable, because a man will naturally claim and enjoy his <em>known </em>rights, or, at least, will not for a long series of years neglect to make a claim for what he knows to be his own, unless the expense and trouble of asserting his rights bear too great a ratio to their value. But as reason itself fixes no exact period beyond which a man ought to be presumed to have abandoned or released his claim, the legislature has, both in England and this country, stopped in, and, by positive enactments, called statutes of limitations, fixed various exact periods when this presumption *shall be considered sufficient and conclusivo as to different classes of claims, and, as this presumption originally rested on the fact that this lapse of time and adverse possession were <em>known </em>to the claimant who is to be barred, has made exceptions in favor of different classes of persons so circumstanced as probably not to have that knowledge ; for instance, infants, insane persons, and persons residing out of the county or state where the thing claimed is situated. And though these statutes apply, in terms, only to the assertion of claims in courts of law, yet courts o.f chancery, and particularly those of our own state, act not merely in analogy but in obedience to these statutes. See Tuttle <em>v. </em>Wilson, 10 Ohio, 26. But as those enactments are positive, the law on the one hand does not permit any one within the statute and not within any of its exceptions, to avoid the operation of the statute by showing that he is not within the principle on which the rule is predicated ; so, on the other, it does not allow any mere laches, that do not amount to a bar by the statute, to be used as evidence against him at all, whether it be set up to defeat his claim or to establish the claims of his opponent. Stark\u2019s Lessee <em>v. </em>Smith, 5 Ohio, 455; 3 Johns. Ch. 129; 1 Ohio, 330 ; Angell on Limitations, 341; 10 Ohio, 104, 498. And this is true even where it appears that the adverse possession was known to the claimant: much less, then, is it admissible where the law presumes a want of this knowledge, as in case of infancy, insanity, or non-residence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b452-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>In order, if possible, to avoid the confusion and uncertainty in which the doctrine of presumption of extinguishment of grants and conveyances is involved in many of the books (and to some extent in the gentleman\u2019s argument), I will attempt a classification of the different cases in which the courts apply this doctrine, and of the different principles and rules that govern them in its application, etc.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b452-5\">1. If a claimant who is within the statutory bar comes into either a court of law or equity to assert his claim, whatever it is, the presumption is by statute made conclusive.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZF5\">*2. If his claims are easement only in land, or other matter lying in grant, which is not within the provisions of the statute, the common law has fixed upon twenty years\u2019 possession as furnishing aground sufficient, <em>prima facie, </em>to raise the presumption of a grant; but even in this case \u2014 and <em>a fortiori </em>in cases where <em>title </em>to lands comes in question \u2014 this presumption is predicated on knowledge of that possession. Daniel <em>v. </em>North, 11 East, 362, cited in 1 Caine, 90, in which it was decided that, <em>\u201c </em>even after twenty years\u2019 enjoyment of lights, a grant will not bo presumed against a landlord not in possession, unless knowledge of lights having been made is brought home to him.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b452-7\">3. If the claim be a title, either at law or equity, to land, then .(as the statute applies and furnishes a positive rule on the subject) courts have no discretion, and possession is an absolute title, or it is, by itself, nothing. But when possession is connected with other facts, of themselves evidence of conveyance, and that possession is known to the claimant, then all these facts and possession are to be fairly weighed by court or jury like any other case of circumstantial evidence; and if the inference of the execution of a deed, etc., b'e a reasonable one, or, in other words, if the evidence is sufficient to convince a reasonable mind that such deed has, in fact, been made, then such presumption is to be drawn, otherwise not; and, in this case, a greater degree of circumstantial evidence is necessary than is required to sustain a grant of easement.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b452-8\"><em>4. </em>There is another class of cases of a somewhat different nature, in which courts, in order to prevent fraud and injustice, resort to the legal fiction of presuming a grant or conveyance, when they do not, and have no reason to believe such grant or deed was in fact ever made. And this doctrine, though in principle wholly distinct from that of presumption proper, is, in the books, so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>mingled and involved with this doctrine, that it is very difficult to separate and distinguish between the cases, so as to say on which of these doctrines each case turned; and in some case3 both doctrines are applicable, and *both were actually applied, under the name of presumption only. And hence it is that, in some of the cases, it is said that the facts are to be left to a jury, and they are to determine whether the evidence is sufficient to convince them that such deed has, in fact, been made or not; and in some of the cases, and in the elementary books, it is sometimes said that the court presumes the grant or conveyance, to support the possession, without believing, or having reason to believe, that any such conveyance has, in fact, been made. As an instance of this kind, suppose two men to own and live upon adjoining lands, and one of them, by mistake, commences building over the division line, on the land of the other, and the other, knowing the fact, makes no objection, and gives no notice of the encroachment. A court of chancery, and perhaps of law, would not permit him, who has been thus guilty of the fraudulent silence, to come forward, after the improvement was finished, and take from the other the land which he has allowed that other to use and expend money upon as his own; for, otherwise, this silence would operate as a fraud on the other party, and the law will not allow him to profit by his own wrong, and, to prevent this, resorts to a common device in such cases, and raises the fiction of a conveyance. And there are other cases where it is evident that wrong and injustice would be done by allowing possession to be disturbed, and that, too, when there is no probability whatever of the existence of a deed, etc.; and in such cases, and such only, can there be a rightful resort to this fiction of presumptiou, without or against probability.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b453-5\">5. Another principle adopted by courts of equity, and somewhat connected with the doctrine of presumption, as above defined, is, that they will consider that to have been done which ought to have been done ; and the obligation to grant or convey, etc., coupled with a long and undisturbed possession, in accordance with such right, frequently furnishes good ground for a presumption of conveyance in fact. And the principal cases cited by the gentleman are of this kind, to wit: Hillary <em>v. </em>Wilier, 12 Ves. 239, cited in 1 Pow. on Mort. 398; 1 *Caine, 89, 90; 11 Wend. 59, 63; 7 Johns. 5; 4 Term, 68. And although the doctrine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>of presumption is, by some of these cases, carried further than our courts allow \u2014 sec 5 Ohio, 455, where a right in equity to a conveyance of fee is decided to be inadmissible as evidence of, and furnishing ground for, a presumption of such deed \u2014 yet, for the purposes of this argument, their authority is not disputed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b454-5\">6. Cases are cited by the gentleman, which come under another principle but slightly analogous to the doctrine of presumption of conveyance, etc. That principle is, that where anything has been done, nothing appearing to the contrary, the law or courts presumo, after a long time has elapsed, that <em>omnia rite acta </em>esse\u2014 that the legal forms have been observed. Such are the following cases, cited by the gentleman: Jackson <em>v. </em>Woolsey, 11 Johns, 446 ; 3 Mass. 399; 10 Mass. 105. These cases have, if any, a very remote bearing on the ease before the court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b454-6\">7. It is to be remarked, that courts of equity will frequently refuse their aid to a party complainant, when they would not interpose actively against him, were he defendant, but would leave the parties to their legal rights and remedies.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b454-7\">8. It will be found, if we examine its origin- \u2014 and it is so laid down in the books \u2014 the very ground and foundation of the doctrine of presumption of grants, deeds of conveyance, etc., is the difficulty of accounting for the possession and enjoyment without presuming a grant, etc. See 2 Stark. Ev. 670.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b454-8\">Let us now examine the principal cases, etc., quoted by the gentleman, to illustrate the principles on which such presumptions are raised, and see how far they sustain them in'this case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ALh9\">The first, Hillary <em>v. </em>Wilier, 12 Ves. 239. This was a bill for specific performance of agreement to purchase land, by defendant. Defendant set up want of title in complainant, and the difficulty suggested was this: that, one hundred and forty years before, the land had been deeded to a trustee, to indemnify a third person, for purchasing of other property upon trust; *that if the purchaser should not be evicted out of the estate purchased, within eleven years next after the death of certain tenants, then the trustee was bound to reconvey, etc. Held, that this was not such defect of title as excused defendant for not performing his part of the contract, and that on the ground that as he ought to have re-convoyed, and so long a time had elapsed without claim, the presumption was that he had done so.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b454-10\">So as to authority quoted from 1 Powell on Mortgages, 401. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>This was a question between mortgagor and mortgagee; and it is admitted that, after twenty years, and no payment or demand of principal or interest, <em>prima facie </em>presumption of payment, satisfaction, and release, arises \u2014 the presumption of payment from absence of demand, and of reconveyance from payment, because it is the duty of mortgagee to reconvey, or was so formerly, at common law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b455-5\">The case in 1 Caine, 89, 90, decides that, where a conveyance might have been claimed and enforced, and possession had gone along with it for fifty years, and this possession, too, known to the other party, a deed, in pursuance of such right, might be presumed. And note <em>a, </em>to this case, shows that it is a rule in cases of presumption, that the facts relied on to sustain the presumption, must be so connected, with the facts to be presumed, that the presumption shall be a legitimate inference from those facts. The words are : <em>\u201c </em>There must bo some fact in consequence of, or in harmony with which the presumption may be made; and that if, on the contrary, the facts appearing contravene the presumption, it can not be drawn, as, whore an insufficient deed to make a tenant to the precipe is shown, a good one shall not be presumed.\u201d 2 Stra. 1267.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b455-6\">4'Wend. 59, 63: Is this, after a lapse of thirty-two years, a release to <em>cestui que trust </em>from his trustee will be presumed, and this is all of the case, so far as any principle was decided.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b455-7\">Jackson <em>v. </em>McCall, 10 Johns. 377, 380: This was an action of ejectment, in which the plaintiff claimed over the division lino and fence between plaintiff and defendant, after *forty-one years\u2019 possession on each side up to said line, and when the ancestor of lessor of plaintiff (when under the proof the court presumed he was in possession) admitted that the line, as it then stood, was right, and that he was present when the king\u2019s surveyor fixed it, where it had always since continued to be. Held, the line could not bo disturbed ; and this was really all decided in the case. The court, to be sure, in argument say, that they might, or the jury might havo presumed from: 1. An order of the council recognizing the survey. 2. An original survey by government for Provoost, in 1664. 3. A subsequent recognition of the allotment and survey made in the patent to McKinsey, in 1665, of adjoining lands, etc. 4.

Ev. 124, note: Of this ease we know nothing but what-can be gathered from these few words: \u201cAn original lease, for a long time, being produced, and proof given of possession for seventy years, it will be left to the jury to presume the \u2018 mesne assignments.\u2019 \u201d This is all we know of the ease, and is certainly too meagre an account of it to be set up as authority for anything; and all the features of the case not expressed in these words, from which the gentleman seeks to draw conclusions, have been supplied by his imagination.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b457-7\">And now, on a review of all the cases quoted by the complainant, it will be found that'in no caso has a presumption of conveyance, etc., been sustained, except where the party presumed to have conveyed was aware of his right, or of the possession and claim of the party to whom the conveyance was presumed to have been made, and, in most of the cases, both circumstances were united. Such was the ease in 4 Wend. 63, so much relied on by the gentleman, and the release was from trustee to <em>cestui que trust, </em>who was entitled to it. The gentleman says it was in favor of Moore, but it is sufficient to reply, that it was to <em>cestui que trust, </em>and if Moore was in a situation to avail himself of a release to another, that circumstance does not affect the principle on which the presumption is founded. If any inference could be drawn from that case, affecting the present, it would be that a presump<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>tion arose in this case that E. Pierce had released to the outstanding warrant-holders; but this could not affect complainant, for he is not in a situation to avail himself of it, as he does not in any way connect himself with these warrant-holders.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b458-5\">Birchard, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aiu\">In this case, our great difficulty has been to ascertain the facts which are controverted in the bill and *answer. After the lapse of half a century, it is remarkable that a living witness has been found, by either party, capable of throwing much light upon a transaction so ancient. Upon subjects of ordinary occurrence, the memory of few men is to be trusted after the lapse of forty years. The patent of the United States, executed in 1802, purports to vest in the elder Pierce the entire legal and equitable estate in the 4,000 acres of land, which is the subject of this litigation. These complainants assert that he was the mere agent of the persons entitled to the warrants, and held the legal title as trustee for them. The fact is denied in the answer, which was, that respondent\u2019s ancestor was the owner of both the legal and equitable estate in the entire tract. We must rely upon the proof for our own conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">Azariah Root, the only witness that speaks from any direct knowledge upon the subject, testifies to conversations which occurred in 1798 or \u201999. He states, in' substance, that Pierce said he had no interest in this and another four-thousand-acre tract, except for location fees and expenses; that he had not purchased any warrants at that time; and that he claimed one dollar and fifty cents, or two dollars, for locating each hundred acres, or two hundred acres for locating each quarter township of four thousand acres. This statement of itself, after so long a period has elapsed, would be of little weight were it uncorroborated by other facts and circumstances. But when we consider that, at that time, there was no way provided for satisfying the bounty land-warrants issued for military services during the war of the revolution, save by uniting enough to entitle the patentee to a quarter township ; and that the President of the United States refused to issue the patents so as to show the respective interests of each warrantee in the premises; there is to be found in the nature of the transaction that which would tend to fix, in the memory of one dealing in lands and warrants, a statement like the one made to Root by Pierce, even if nothing were to be gathered from the notorious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>fact, that nearly every patent that was issued for a quarter township, although absolute on its face, was held by the grantee in trust ^either for himself and others, or entirely for others. This patent was indisputably so held. The fact is established by the recitals of the elder Pierce in sundry deeds which are in evidence-A deed executed October 16,1801, by E. Pierce, to the heirs of Moses Ashley, deceased, contains this recital: \u201c Whereas, I, Ebenezer Pierce, .... did, on the 4th of March, 1800, .... as agent for a number of persons, locate army land-warrants, among which was one in the name of Moses Ashley, late of Stockbridge, .... for four hundred acres, being No. 11, and one other for one hundred acres, being No. 4,580 ; one other, in the name of Peter Maynard, for one hundred acres, being No. 4,683; and one other, i-n the name of Samuel Phipps, for one hundred acres, being No. 4,120 ; all which warrants are located in my name, in the second section of the fourth township in the seventeenth range, in the tract of land appropriated to satisfy army warrants.\u201d This deed further recites conveyances of all the above warrants to Moses Ashley, which had been issued for other than his own military services; that, at his death, the whole descended to his three children\u2014 Moses Eobert, Eichard Henry, and Thankful, \u2014 as heirs-at-law, and that they are the legal owners; that their mother, the widow Thankful Ashley, had paid S10.50, as their natural guardian, in full satisfaction of and for his trouble and expense. In consideration of which he granted, with the usual covenants, to warrant and defend the title, etc. Similar recitals and covenants are contained in other deeds, embracing in all fifteen hundred acres of the land in controversy. They tend to corroborate the evidence of Boot; and are sufficient, in connection with it, to overthrow that part of the answer which denies <em>in toto </em>the trust alleged in the bill. The fact being established that E. Pierce hold only a naked legal title, coupled with an equity equal to one dollar and fifty cents upon each hundred acres, it bv no means necessarily follows that the whole of the remaining equity is in these complainants, and that they are entitled to a decree. All of these recitals and the testimony may be consistent with the hypothesis assumed by respondents\u2019 counsel: That the outstanding equities of the ownei\u2019s of the ^warrants were, in some instances, oxtinguished by purchases, and became vested in E. Pierce alter the locations were made, or after the patent itself was issued to him. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>That course was frequently pursued by locators of this class of land-warrants; and, if not pursued in this case, it is quite clear that no one can interfere with the legal title vested in the trustee save those who represent the trust estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">We come, then, to consider the extent of interest which the complainants have shown by purchase, occupancy or otherwise, by either direct or presumptive evidence. They show title to whatever interest Moses Byxbee had in the tracts claimed by them respectively, under deed from him. Byxbee\u2019s title is, 1. A defective tax deed and possession since 1804. 2. A deed from the heirs of E. Pierce, dated December 24, 1806, by which he acquired seven-tenths of the entire four thousand acres, or seven-tenths of all the interest in the whole tract of which E. Pierce died seized. Byxbee under the deed from the heirs of Ashley, acquired the right to the lands embraced in warrants 11, 4,580,4,683 and 4,120, amounting to seven hundred acres...............700 acres.</p>\n<p

To an undivided *three-tenths of this only, equal to one hundred and eighty acres, can the defendants in any court claim title, provided the principles of law are such as to sustain the several conveyances above mentioned. Some of these conveyances, however, are defectively executed, and others are not fully proved, as for instance, that in the name of Thomas Marshall, for five hundred acres. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>The conveyance in this instance was by persons representing themselves to be the executors of Thomas Marshall, who assumed to convey, forty-throe years since, under a power conferred upon them by the last will and testament of said Thomas; and the will itself is not produced, although the deed and possession have remained with Byxbee since its date. Defects of other descriptions exist as to others of them \u2014 .old conveyances, some of which were made under powers of attorney, but in the name of the attorney instead of the name of the principal, \u2014 ^but possession of title, papers, and lands have continued over forty years in him.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">In reference to all these who hold that time has cured the defects, and in support of possession of such long standing, we will presume enough in their favor to sustain the titles of the occupants to all the lands which they purport to convey. It is not to be presumed that any of those persons who were once entitled to the warrants, and who, forty-three years ago, attempted to transfer their rights to Byxbee and who have never since set up any claim to these lands, have yet any remaining interest therein. There is nothing in the case tending to show that any of the per: sons who are to be affected by this presumption against their equities, were ignorant of their rights, or under any disability which prevented them from asserting them in due time, or which would operate to prevent the running of the statute of limitations in an analogous case at law. Wo hold, therefore, that possession and time united, have vested in the complainants a perfect title in equity to all the rights which the holders of the warrants ever had to the land in controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">But, on the part of the complainants, it is further urged, that this presumption should be extended so far as to secure them *in their entire possession \u2014 that we may presume that Byxbee purchased up all the rights outstanding, from the fact that he purchased so large a proportion of the whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">This would be pressing the doctrine of presumption far beyond what would bo warranted by the law and the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">The respondent has already recovered, in ejectment against one of the complainants, an undivided three-tenths part of the land, which he occupies; and the complainants, by their counsel, admit that the 'statute of limitations would not bar the claim of the three minor heirs, whose interests are represented by re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>spondont, Piorce, by reason of their continued absence from the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">The same absence, together with their' infancy and ignorance of their rights until the year 1835, when they first began to assert them, prevents the lapse of time from defeating their claim. 'And again, the deed of 1806, from the adult heirs to Byxbee, necessarily raises a presumption that, at its date, the heirs of the elder Piorce held an interest in some of the warrants that were merged in the patent to their ancestor '; else why should Byxbee at that day offer to pay the sum of $500 for a conveyance of their title? If the whole equity was in the warrantors, save the locator\u2019s lien, the heirs were bound to convey, on the payment of the expenses of E. Pierce in making the location and the production of the assignments. In the conveyances made by Pierce in his lifetime, his uniform charge for locating was one dollar and a half for each hundred acres. He had conveyed, in his lifetime, fifteen hundred out of the four thousand acres to the owners of warrants at that rate, and an equal charge for the residue would have left, at the date of Byxbee\u2019s purchasers from the warrant-holders, a sum not exceeding fifty dollars, as the extent to which the heirs of E. Piorce had any claim for location fees. Why should Byxbee have given more, but for the reason that he then knew that Pierce held, as to an undivided portion of the land, both the legal and equitable title? It seems to us that the inference is, that-he would not otherwise have paid that sum; that he would have ^tendered the fees due and demanded a deed, and if not voluntarily executed, that he would have enforced in chancery a conveyance. The presumption arising from this portion of the evidence is, not that Byxbee had purchased in the rights of the warrant-holders to the remaining six hundred acres, but that Pierce had made such purchases after procuring the patent or making the locations. The presumption is supported by the patent and the absence of any claim by any person under the warrants of Parker, Barnard, Jackson, and Winchell, who were entitled to the six hundred acres for which Byxbee had no title. The course commonly pursued in locating this class of' warrants was for a person owning one or more warrants to induce the owners of others to unite with him, until the whole would be sufficient to entitle them to a tract of four thousand acres, when the patent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>would bo issued in the name of one authorized to surrender the warrants, also strongly sustains this presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Under these views the complainants are entitled to a decree for an undivided interest of all the four-thousand-acre tract, except one hundred and eighty acres, which, reduced to fractions, will give to Pierce an interest in each tract owned by each complainant separately, equal to nine two-hundredth parts of the whole, or at the rate of four acres and one-half in each hundred acres, subject, however, to the claims of the several complainants as occupying claimants for the value of their improvements and the taxes which they have paid, after deducting the value of any rents and profits they may have derived from the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\"><em>A </em>decree may be drawn up accordingly, referring the case to a master.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
