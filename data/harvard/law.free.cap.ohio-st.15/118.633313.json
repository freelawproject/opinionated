They are not, apparently, relied upon by the counsel for the plaintiffs in error, as they arc not alluded to in their argument.

We can see no distinction in principle. Bank notes are not money, nor do they necessarily import a certain sum in money; for, though current, they are often below par.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b100-9\">We are aware that a devise of all one\u2019s money has been held to include bank notes, but this is but carrying out the intention of the devisor. 1 Roper, 3.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b100-10\">In England, it has been decided that an action for money had and received, will not lie against the finder of bank notes, unless he has actually converted them into money. Chitty on Bills, 556, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b100-11\">But the precise question now before the court has been decided in the courts of several of the states, and such paper held not to be negotiable, and for the reason that, being made payable in bank notes, they were not for a sum of money certain. Jones <em>v. </em>Falos, 4 Mass. 245 ; Leiber <em>v. </em>Goodrich, 5 Cow. 186 ; Large <em>v. </em>Kahn, 1 McC. 115; McClarren <em>v. </em>Nesbit, 2 N. &amp; McC. 519; Collins <em>v. </em>Lincoln, 11 Va. 268 ; Irving <em>v. </em>Lowry, 14 Pet. 293.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AIY\">*T. W. Bartley and Franklin Barker, for defendants in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b100-13\">The question for the consideration of the court is, whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>note declared on by the plaintiffs in the court below, which is payable in the sum of $200, in current Ohio bank notes, to S. H. Newcomb or order, is a <em>negotiable instrument? </em>.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b101-5\">The statute making certain instruments negotiable, requires, it is true, that, to make them so, they must be drawn for a \u201csum, or for sums of money certain.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b101-6\">The law on this subject has been settled by decisions of the highest authority, and it is not presumed that this court will introduce uncertainty in the law by overruling them. The case of Morris <em>v. </em>Edwards, 1 Ohio, 189, settles the question, that a contract payable in current bank notes is a contract payable in money, in the ordinary transactions of business.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b101-7\">This decision is sustained by the decision of Lord Mansfield, 1 Burr. 457; also, by Keith <em>v. </em>Jones, 9 Johns. 120, and Judah <em>v. </em>Holmes, 19 Johns. 144.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b101-8\">Wood, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AyC\">The consideration of the fifth assignment of error involves the whole inquiry necessary to be made, in order to determine whether any error intervened in the overruling the demurrer, admitting the instrument in evidence in support of the common courts, and the judgment which followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">In other words, and to be more precise, is the instrument in question a negotiable promissory note? If it is, the action is well brought in the name of the indorsees; the declaration is in all respects sufficient, and the ruling and judgment of the court of common pleas is without <em>legal </em>fault, and should be sustained by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-10\">The negotiability of paper is a subject within the province of legislation, and the statute of this state has made all bonds, promissory notes, etc., drawn for any <em>sum or sums of money *certain, </em>and payable to any person or order, or any person or bearer, etc., negotiable by indorsement thereon. This instrument is clearly within both the letter and spirit of the statute, <em>if it is payable in a sum of money certain. </em>The counsel for the plaintiff in error, however, claim that $200 <em>in current Ohio bank notes, </em>is not $200 <em>in money certain ; </em>because bank notes are not money, but promises for money. They are not'a legal tender, it is true ; they are neither silver nor gold ; but current bank notes are the representatives of both. By the business community they are considered as cash in hand by those who have them in possession, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>Ask A. for a loan of $1,000 \u2014 he counts it to you in <em>bank paper. </em>If you promise \u2022 to pay $1,000 in money, you count it to your creditor in bank paper. The sense and understanding of business and moneyed men, is that, for ordinary purposes at least, it is money or cash. By a devise of all his money, the bank notes in the testator\u2019s safe pass to the legatee. 1 Roper, 3. The Supreme Court of this state have, on the circuit, repeatedly held that a note payable in current bank notes, was payable in money, and negotiable. Morris <em>v. </em>Edwards, 1 Ohio C. 85. The same rule has been laid down by the Supreme Court of New York. 9 Johns. 120; 19 Johns. 144. And in Pennsylvania it has been decided, that a note payable in <em>foreign </em>bank notes is not negotiable; while one payable in the notes of that state would be, if current, within the rule. A different course of decision has prevailed in some of the states, and in England, but the authority of our own court for many years should not be departed from, when no evil is seen to grow out of its adjudications on this subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Judgment affirmed. \u2022</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b102-6\">Read, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AJh\">dissenting. It is admitted that the legislature might convert an equitable into a legal right, and in all cases permit the assignee of a chose in action to maintain a suit at law in his own name. But this has not been done. Both under our own statute and the law merchant, a note or bill, to become *negotiable, so as to clothe the assignee with the legal right in such note, must be payable in money. This is not disputed. The only question is, <em>are current Ohio bank notes money f </em>The instrument on which this suit is brought, is made payable in current Ohio bank notes. A majority of the court hold that such an instrument is a negotiable note, payable in money under the statute \u2014 that current Ohio bank notes are money. This is a most extraordinary conclusion. Bank notes are not money. They do not purport to be money. They are only promises to pay money on demand. They, in law, are never treated as money \u2014 they are not a legal <em>tender. </em>The whole legislation of the state respecting bank bills or notes, treats them as such, and not as money. In the criminal laws punishing the stealing or counterfeiting of such paper, and in the civil remedies prescribed where banks and bankers are parties, bank bills or notes are not treated as money, but as evidence of indebtedness \u2014 precisely what they claim to be them<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>selves. I am aware that decisions are to be found where such instruments have been held negotiable, but the weight of authority is the other way, as well as the most manifest reason. It is true, that bank bills are sometimes treated as money; as where they have been accepted in payment of a debt, or where they have been demised as money, and such was the intent of the testator. This results from the act, or agreement of the parties themselves. It is not even necessary, to effect that end, that bank notes are to be held money; because any article, received in satisfaction of a debt, is sufficient in law to discharge it, and the intention of a testator will govern in a will.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">\u201c Current bank notes \u201d does not signify a sum of money certain. The terms <em>current </em>and <em>bankable </em>are well understood. Paper is regarded as current which will circulate in the ordinary transaction of business, and may vary five, ten, fifteen, or twenty per cent., according to the folly or good nature of the community. In this sense, then, this instrument is not negotiable. But the great error is in giving countenance to the idea that bank notes *are money. No man can affirm that a bank note is money. It is too clear for argument. Nor can mere usage be permitted to take the place of the statute.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
