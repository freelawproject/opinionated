Two days afterwards the plaintiffs sued out an attachment against Martin, which was levied on a stock of goods in the possession of Allison, the assignee, and which had belonged to Martin. Martin traversed the plaintiff\u2019s affidavit, upon which the attachment was sued out, and Allison filed an interplea claiming the goods attached as assignee under the deed of'assignment. Both issues were tried before the court. That part of the deed of assignment material to the case reads as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b356-11\">\u201cI, John A. Martin, do\u2019hereby grant, bargain, and sell to T. J. Allison, assignee in trust, for the benefit of all my creditors, the goods, wares, merchandise, and property hereto attached in Schedule A, made a part of this conveyance, to have and to hold to him in trust as aforesaid forever; I conveying also to the said T. J. Allison, assignee, for the use aforesaid, all notes, books, accounts, and every class and character of evidence of debt to me belonging, or relating to my business in any manner whatever, with full authority in said T. J. Allison, assignee, to collect the same and apply them to the uses of this trust in manner and form as is by law prescribed in that behalf. The said T. J. Allison, assignee, shall proceed to collect and dispose of goods, wares, merchandise, and property, and choses in action, and apply the same to the payment of my creditors, share and share alike; provided, that no creditor herein provided for shall participate in the assets herein assigned, unless he accepts the same in full of his claim.

M. d G. B. Rose, </em>for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b357-5\">The deed is void for the following reasons:</p>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b357-6\">1. It exacts releases and by implication reserves the surplus to the grantor. <em>Malcolm </em>v. <em>Hodges, 8 </em>Md. 418; <em>Whidbee </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>40 Md. 414; <em>Ingraham </em>v. <em>Wheeler, </em>6 Conn. 277; Bump, Fraud. Conv. 430; Burrill, Assignm. \u00a7 207.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b357-7\">2. No time is specified within which creditors are to accept and release. Bump, Fraud. Conv. (2d Ed.) 433; Burrill, Assignm. \u00a7 197; <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Bliss, </em>8 Ind. 100; 2 Kent, Comm. 533.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b357-8\">3. The Schedule A mentioned in the deed not having been attached thereto, the assignment was ineffectual to convey the property intended to be embraced in the schedule. <em>Barkman </em>v. <em>Simmons, </em>23 Ark. 1; <em>Moir </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>14 Barb. 39.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b357-9\">4. The assignment took effect as to the choses in action at the time of its delivery. <em>Clayton </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>36 Ark. 406. At the time of the levy it was, therefore, a partial assignment, exacting releases, and void. Burrill, Assignm. (4th Ed.) 273; Bump, Fraud. Conv. (2d Ed.) 492; <em>In re Wilson, </em>4 Pa. St. 430; <em>Graves </em>v. <em>Ray, </em>13 La. 454; <em>Hennesy </em>v. <em>Bank, </em>6 Watts &amp; S. 300; <em>Clayton </em>v. <em>Johnson, supra.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b357-10\">5. The provision that the assignment shall be closed up under the direction of the creditors assenting to the same makes the assignee the mere agent of those creditors. The assenting creditors are by this clause invested with plenary powers over the estate, and yet they are governed by no law, give no bond, take no oath, and are answerable to no one for an abuse of these powers. Nor would the assignee be responsible for obeying their orders to the prejudice of the rights of other creditors, because one of the conditions of his bond is that he \u201cwill execute the trust confided to him * * * according to the terms of the assignment,\u201d one of which is that he shall close it up,under the direction of the assenting creditors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b357-13\">Section 43 of the bankrupt act (section 5103, Rev. St.) authorized three-fourths in value of the creditors who had proved their debts to \u201cwind up and settle\u201d the bankrupt\u2019s estate by trustees appointed by them. These words were held to be large enough to embrace the entire control and management of the bankrupt\u2019s estate, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>direction of the committee of creditors to the trustee in regard to the settlement of the estate was held to -be conclusive and binding on the bankrupt court and all other creditors. <em>In re Dorby, </em>4 N. B. R. 211; <em>In re Jay Cook &amp; Co. </em>11 N. B. R. 1. And if this deed is held valid, the clause in question has the effect to deprive the assignee of all control over the administration of the trust. The clause is not only without any statute authorizing it, but is in derogation of the statute, which points out specifically how the assignee shall discharge his trust. It is not for the debtor to assume that he can devise a better mode of administering the trust than that prescribed by law. Whenever he has attempted to do so, the assignment has been adjudged void. <em>Raleigh </em>v. <em>Griffith, </em>37 Ark. 150; <em>Teah </em>v. <em>Roth, </em>M. S. opinion, Nov. Term, 1882; <em>Schoolfield </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>11 Fed. Rep. 297.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b358-4\">6. The statute prohibits the assignee from taking possession of the property assigned until he has filed the inventory and given the bond required by law. Parties cannot defy the law with impunity. The object of the statute was to put it out of the power of an irresponsible or dishonest assignee selected by the debtor to defraud the creditors. The prohibition is addressed to the debtor as well as the assignee. An act knowingly done in violation of an express command of a statute, enacted to prevent fraud, is itself a fraud in law. No inquiry is permissible to show the statute was violated through ignorance, or for a good purpose.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b358-5\">7. The case of <em>Clayton </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>does not decide that the deed in that case was a valid deed. Objection to the introduction of the deed was not made in the court below; but after it was introduced an instruction was asked that the deed be disregarded because it contained a clause exacting releases. This was the only question of Jaw reserved, and, of course, the supreme court could not pass upon any other point. \u25a0 It is clear that the deed was bad <em>for </em>several reasons, and that it must have been so held if the points had been raised in the trial court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b358-6\"><em>Josevh W. Martin, </em>for defendant and interpleader.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b358-7\">1. The deqd was inoperative for any purpose till the transaction was completed by attaching Schedule A to the deed as contemplated by the parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b358-8\">2. This deed is a literal copy of that in <em>Clayton </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>36 Ark. 406, except this clause, \u201cThe said Johnson shall proceed to sell said goods, etc., on the best terms he can in his direction,\u201d which is omitted. That deed was held valid. True, the main question in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>that case was the validity of the clause exacting releases; but before the court could render the judgment they did, they had to find the deed was not constructively fraudulent for <em>any reason.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b359-4\">3. There is no such resulting trust or implied reservation of the surplus to the debtor as will render the deed void. <em>Brashier </em>v. <em>West, </em>7 Pet. 615; <em>Skepwith </em>v. <em>Cunningham, </em>8 Leigh, 271; <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Cannon, </em>18 Grat. 394; <em>McFarland </em>v. <em>Birdsall, </em>14 Ind. 129; 11 Ill. 503; 3 Watts, 198; 8 Watts &amp; S. 304; 5 Watts &amp; S. 223; 8 Grat. 457; 58 Ala. 659; 1 Paige, 305; 17 Ala. 659; 1 Ired. 453; 4 Wash. C. C. 232.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b359-5\">4. The clause providing that the assignment shall be closed up under the direction of the creditors assenting tb same does not render the deed void. <em>Kellog </em>v. <em>Slawson, </em>15 Barb. 56. It does not authorize the creditors to exercise any power inconsistent with the rights of all the creditors and the duties of the assignee and tho rules of law. The creditors and the assignee alike would be bound to observe the law. The courts should give instruments that construction which will render them lawful. <em>Julian </em>v. <em>Rathbone, </em>39 Barb. 102; <em>Cardigan </em>v. <em>Kenneth, </em>2 Cowp. 432; 1 Story, Eq. Jur. \u00a7 258. It would be a strained construction to say this clause was designed to perpetrate a fraud; it has no tendency to such a result. The court will not assume that the creditors might attempt to exercise their powers unlawfully, but will rather indulge the presumption that they would act according to law and for the best interest of all.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b359-6\">Caldwell, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aj3\">It will be observed that the deed on its face does not purport to convey all the assignor\u2019s property. The property conveyed is limited by the terms of the deed to that mentionod and described in Schedule A, and to tho choses in action which are assigned by an independent clause in the deed, and as to which the deed took effect on its delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">The failure to attach the schedule renders the deed inoperative and void as to all property intended to be embraced in the same, and not otherwise described than by a reference to it. <em>Barkman </em>v. <em>Simmons, </em>23 Ark. 1; <em>Moir </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>14 Barb. 39. This being so, it results that the deed of assignment, at the time of its execution and delivery, conveyed only a part of the assignor\u2019s property. The supreme court of this state, in <em>Clayton </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>36 Ark. 406, hold that a deed of assignment containing a stipulation that no creditor shall participate in the proceeds of the property assigned unless he accepts the samo in full satisfaction of his debt, is valid. But a deed containing such a stipulation, to be valid, must convey all the debtor\u2019s property. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>is held in <em>Clayton </em>v. <em>Johnson, supra, </em>and is the doctrine of most of the courts which maintain the validity of such a stipulation. \u201cIt is held,\u201d says Mr.Burrill, \u201calmost without exception, that such a stipulation in an assignment of part of a debtor\u2019s property is fraudulent. \u201d Burr. Assignm. (4th Ed.) 273.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">The deed, therefore, stipulating for a release and conveying only a part of the debtor\u2019s property, is fraudulent and void. It imparted no title to the assignee as against an attaching creditor, and justified the plaintiffs in attaching the assignor.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">The conclusion arrived at in this point is decisive of the case, and renders it unnecessary to decide the other questions so ably argued by counsel.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
