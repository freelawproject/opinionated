The penalty was claimed in double'that amount. It appeared that the bank credited the plaintiffs with the net proceeds of the accommodation paper at the time of tlieir discount, &gt; and charged them with the face amounts at their maturity, and again crediting them with the net proceeds of the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>newals, until after the plaintiffs\u2019 failure, when the accommodation paper (none of which had been paid by the plaintiffs) was taken up and paid by plaintiffs\u2019 indorser, one Otto. It also appeared that plaintiffs made cash deposits with defendant, and drew checks thereon, a small balance being due plaintiffs at the date of their failure.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b352-4\">The defendant proved that among the business paper discounted by plaintiffs at defendant\u2019s bank were two notes of Snyder Brothers, amounting to some $1,200, and indorsed by plaintiffs, the proceeds of which were passed to the credit of plaintiffs. These notes were not paid at maturity, and the amounts due on them at the time of the trial was about $830, a payment having been made the bank by plaintiffs\u2019 assignee since the commencement of the action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b352-5\">The defendants offered in evidence the following charters of banks in Pennsylvania, which charters, it was alleged, authorized the banks incorporated thereunder to tak\u00a7 and receive a rate of interest or discount equal to or' greater than that charged by the defendant in this case:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b352-7\">M\u00c1A\u00cdE.

The jury should ascertain the whole amount of discount received by the bank, from which they should deduct the discount on the last renewal of the accommodation paper which was paid by their indorser, Otto; 'from that balance they should deduct the amount due the bank on the Snyder notes, and twice that remainder should be the amount of their verdict.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b353-5\">Verdict for the plaintiffs for $3,085.34, whereupon the defendant, obtained this rule.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b353-6\">From the deposition of a juror, it appeared that the jury, in making up their verdict, deducted the Snyder notes, after doubling the whole discount less the discount on the last renewals paid by Otto, the indorser, and that they put the amount of these on the Snyder notes at $750.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b353-7\"><em>C.

The Snyder notes were shown to be $1,200, less the payment of $370 in March, 1880, and this evidence was not contradicted. The balance due on these notes should have been deducted before doubling the discount. This deduction is not asked as an offset to a penalty, but as showing that to their extent the discount on the accommodation paper had not been paid to the bank by the plaintiff, they having been credited with the net proceeds of the accommodation paper, and charged with the face of such notes at their maturity, carrying them forward by renewals until their payment by Otto, plaintiffs\u2019 indorser; the bank having credited them with the net proceeds of the Snyder notes which still remain unpaid. <em>Swearingen </em>v. <em>Birch, </em>4 Yeates, 322; <em>Steimetz </em>v. <em>Curry, 1 </em>Dallas, 234; <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Whitaker, </em>5 Phila. 358; <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Bruner, </em>6 Phila. 204; <em>Flemming </em>v. <em>Maine Ins.
