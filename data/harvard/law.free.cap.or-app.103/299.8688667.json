We vacate the order and remand for further findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">While on parole, defendant Randall Nelson was assigned to Parole Officer Hickey. On November 30, 1988, Hickey went to Randall\u2019s home to look for him. Randall\u2019s brother, defendant M\u00e1rk Nelson, answered the door. Hickey testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-6\">\u201cQ And can you tell the Court the conversation that ensued between you and Mr. Nelson at that point?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-7\">\u201cA Yes, I asked Mr. Nelson \u2014 at that time I didn\u2019t know who he was. I asked Mr. Nelson if Randy was home, and he said \u2018Yes, just a minute, I\u2019ll get him.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-8\">\u201cQ Okay, and did he leave the door open, or did he \u2014 what happened at that point?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-9\">\u201cA I believe the door had already been closed by that point, and Mr. Mark Nelson went into a bedroom where he said that Randy was in bed, and he came back out into the living room and sat down in a chair. Before he sat down, I saw a bindle of what appeared to be a controlled substance on the chair, and as Mr. Nelson sat down, he put his leg over the bindle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">Hickey seized the bindle.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The parties agree that Mark Nelson allowed Hickey to enter and that the door was closed behind Hickey. No other evidence was presented as to how Hickey got into the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-11\">At the hearing on the motion to suppress, the state argued that Hickey was authorized to enter the home, either because Mark Nelson invited him in or because of a condition of Randall Nelson\u2019s parole.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The trial court did not address the first issue. On the second, it held that the parole period had expired on November 9, 1988, and that Hickey was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>lawfully on defendants\u2019 premises. The state does not challenge the court\u2019s holding that the parole period had expired, but argues that Hickey was lawfully on the premises by consent and observed the bindle in plain view.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">Defendants argue that the court\u2019s conclusion that Hickey was not lawfully on the premises is a finding that is binding on appeal under <em>Ball v. Gladden, </em>250 Or 485, 443 P2d 621 (1968). We disagree. That is not a factual finding; it is a legal conclusion, which we may review. 250 Or at 487.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\"> Hickey was entitled to approach the house and knock on the door, as any visitor might do. <em>State v. Ohling, </em>70 Or App 249, 253, 688 P2d 1384, <em>rev den </em>298 Or 334 (1984). If Mark Nelson invited him in, then Hickey\u2019s presence in the house would have been lawful, and the seizure of the bindle would have been lawful under the plain view doctrine. <em>State v. Handran, </em>97 Or App 546, <em>777 </em>P2d 981, <em>rev den </em>308 Or 405 (1989); <em>see State v. Olney, </em>97 Or App 310, 775 P2d 914 (1989). One could infer from Hickey\u2019s testimony that Mark Nelson invited him in, but that inference is not required by the testimony. Because we cannot say that Mark Nelson consented to the entry as a matter of law, we remand to the trial court to make that determination. Specifically, the court should make findings on the existing record relating to the question of whether Mark Nelson consented to Hickey\u2019s entry and make appropriate conclusions based on those findings. <em>See State v. Maskell, </em>101 Or App 521, 792 P2d 106 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">Suppression order vacated; remanded with instructions to make findings of fact whether entry was consensual, and if it was, to deny motion to suppress and, if not, to re-enter order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b333-12\"> Defendants were indicted in one indictment, and the motions to suppress were heard jointly. We consolidated their appeals on the state\u2019s motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b333-13\"> Hickey contacted the police, who searched the house. The state does not argue that the evidence found in that search should not have been suppressed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b333-14\"> The parole agreement states: \u201cParolee is to submit person, residence, vehicle and property to search by a parole officer having reasonable grounds to believe such search will disclose evidence of parole violation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
