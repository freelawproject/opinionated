J.</author>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">Petitioner owns and conducts farming operations on a 54-acre parcel in an exclusive farm use zone. LUBA affirmed Clackamas County\u2019s denial of his application to build a non-farm dwelling on a seven-acre part of that parcel.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He seeks review and we affirm. The county made its decision under a provision of its zoning ordinance that parallels ORS 215.283(3)(d)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and denied the application on the basis of its conclusion that the proposed dwelling would not be situated on land that is generally unsuitable for the production of farm crops and livestock. The seven acres on which petitioner seeks to locate the dwelling are unsuitable for farm use, but the remaining 47 acres are suitable. The question is whether the suitability determination under ORS 215.283(3)(d) may be based only on the seven acres or whether the suitability of the parcel as a whole is the proper consideration. LUBA reached the latter conclusion and explained, <em>inter alia:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-5\">\u201c[W]e seriously question whether the legislature intended the generally unsuitable standard to be applied in a manner that potentially would allow large parcels that are suitable for farm use, but happen to include smaller areas that may be generally unsuitable for farming purposes, to be developed with non-farm dwellings. * * * [S]uch an interpretation is at odds with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>the legislative policy expressed in ORS 215.243(2) to preserve existing large parcels of agricultural land in large blocks.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">We have never decided the precise issue that this case presents, but we have considered related issues. In <em>Lemmon v. Clemens, </em>57 Or App 583, 646 P2d 633, <em>rev den </em>293 Or 634 (1982), and <em>Meyer v. Lord, </em>37 Or App 59, 586 P2d 367 (1978), <em>rev den </em>286 Or 303 (1979), we concluded that the determination of agricultural suitability under Goal 3 must be based on an entire tract in common ownership, rather than on the particular part of the tract for which a non-agricultural use is proposed. <em>See also 1000 Friends of Oregon v. Wasco County Court, </em>299 Or 344, 703 P2d 207 (1985); <em>Denison v. Douglas County, </em>101 Or App 131, 789 P2d 1388 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">In <em>Hearne v. Baker County, </em>89 Or App 282, 748 P2d 1016, <em>rev den </em>305 Or 576 (1988), the issue was whether \u201cgeneral unsuitability\u201d under ORS 215.283(3)(d) requires a determination that a majority of the area in a parcel is unsuitable. However, we made a statement that has apparent bearing on the different issue here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-6\">\u201cUnder LUBA\u2019s decisions here, the county was required to consider the general suitability of the parcels as a whole. Only then could it consider the suitability of the specific parts of the parcels where the dwellings were to be located, and the dwellings could not be placed on land which was suitable for agricultural use.\u201d 89 Or App at 287.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">The county regards that statement as decisive in favor of LUBA\u2019s and its interpretation of the statute. We do not. It was a description of LUBA\u2019s holding in that case, not a statement of our own conclusion. Moreover, to say that the suitability of the entire tract must be <em>considered </em>is not the same as saying that the determination must be <em>based </em>on the entire tract rather than on the part on which the nonfarm use is to be located. <em>See Endresen v. Marion County, </em>15 Or LUBA 60, 63 (1986).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b408-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>Petitioner makes three arguments that call for further discussion in support of his contention that LUBA\u2019s interpretation of the statute is wrong. First, he contends, the legislative history of the statute requires the opposite interpretation. He points to the statement of Senator MacPherson, who played a major role in the adoption of Senate Bill 101 in 1973:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-4\">\u201cAnd I think that this is the kind of thing that gets farmers up tight. If their son wants to live out there and we have some land, perhaps the land has been cut off by a road. Maybe there\u2019s an acre there. Maybe there\u2019s a rocky knoll. This kind of thing. And I think we\u2019ve got to have a little escape valve here whereby we can allow a small amount of single family residential dwelling within an exclusive farm use zone.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">MacPherson\u2019s statement lends some support to petitioner\u2019s view, but not much. As the county notes in its brief, the statement is \u201conly a single piece of testimony from one legislator (albeit an important player in the land use arena at the time).\u201d Moreover, the statement does not directly support petitioner\u2019s interpretation of the statute. Although what Mac-Pherson said is consistent with the general statutory policy of allowing nonfarm dwellings on unsuitable land, he did not purport to describe how unsuitability should be determined. The legislature has met several times since we decided <em>Meyer v. Lord, supra, </em>and <em>Lemmon v. Clemens, supra. </em>Although those cases relate to Goal 3, there is enough overlap between the suitability issues under the goal and under the statute to make the legislative inaction in the light of those cases somewhat probative. The legislative history is not dispositive, one way or the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">Petitioner\u2019s second argument is that LUBA\u2019s interpretation is contrary to the statutory language. The criterion is that the dwelling be \u201csituated upon generally unsuitable <em>land </em>* * *, considering,\u201d <em>inter alia, </em>\u201csize of the <em>tract.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.) Petitioner maintains that the emphasized words are part of one provision and presumptively do not mean the same thing; hence, \u201cland\u201d must refer to the specific site of the dwelling, while \u201ctract\u201d refers to the entire property within which the \u201cland\u201d is located.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">The word \u201cland,\u201d in the context of the statute, is not a locational term, but refers to the generic thing on which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>houses stand. \u201cTract\u201d describes a quantum of land or a type of unified ownership. The two words do not mean the same thing, but neither do they mean what petitioner asserts. If they did, the statute would be nonsensical. If the suitability inquiry were limited to the site of the proposed dwelling, it would be pointless for a county to have to consider the size of the tract in which that site is located. Although the size of a tract may have <em>some </em>bearing on <em>its </em>suitability for agriculture, that will seldom be relevant to whether a particular part of the tract is independently unsuitable. <em>Compare Clark v. Jackson County, </em>103 Or App 377, 797 P2d 1061 (1990); <em>Denison v. Douglas County, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">Petitioner\u2019s remaining argument challenges LUBA\u2019s conclusion that the general unsuitability test of ORS 215.283(3)(d) should be fashioned to accord with the preservation objective of ORS 215.243. Petitioner explains that ORS 215.283(3)(a) requires a finding of consistency \u201cwith the intent and purposes set forth in ORS 215.243\u201d; hence, if that intent and purpose is also determinative of how the general unsuitability standard of subsection (d) is to be applied, one or both of the subsections become redundant or meaningless. We disagree. The fact that the proposal must satisfy both criteria does not mean that the two criteria must serve totally independent purposes. The agricultural lands statutes were meant to be interrelated in their objectives and applications. <em>See McCaw Communications, Inc. v. Marion County, </em>96 Or App 552, 773 P2d 779 (1989). We agree with LUBA that the ORS 215.243 policy of preserving \u201clarge blocks\u201d of agricultural land is possibly the strongest single reason for requiring general unsuitability to be measured against an entire commonly-owned tract rather than only the part of it on which the proposed dwelling would be located. Petitioner\u2019s reading of ORS 215.283(3)(d) would promote the kind of balkanization that ORS 215.243 precludes.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">We recognize that, if the entire tract must be generally unsuitable for any part of it to qualify as the location of a nonfarm dwelling, the sites that can qualify in EFU zones will probably be few and far between. However, ORS 215.283(3) was not intended to facilitate nonfarm dwellings on agricultural land. It creates \u201crigorous criteria\u201d for allowing them. <em>Hopper v. Clackamas County, </em>87 Or App 167, 171, 741 P2d 921 (1987), <em>rev den </em>304 Or 680 (1988). We agree with LUBA that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>nonfarm dwelling is not permissible on any part of a tract that is generally suitable for farm use.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b406-6\"> The county also denied petitioner\u2019s application to divide the seven acres from the rest of the parcel. That denial is not presented as a separate issue by the parties\u2019 arguments here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b406-7\"> ORS 215.283(3) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-8\">\u201cSubject to ORS 215.288, single-family residential dwellings, not provided in conjunction with farm use, may be established, subject to approval of the governing body or its designate in any area zoned for exclusive farm use upon a finding that each such proposed dwelling:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-9\">\u201c(a) Is compatible with farm uses described in ORS 215.203(2) and is consistent with the intent and purposes set forth in ORS 215.243;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-10\">\u201c(b) Does not interfere seriously with accepted farming practices, as defined in ORS 215.203(2)(c), on adjacent lands devoted to farm use;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-11\">\u201c(c) Does not materially alter the stability of the overall land use pattern of the area;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-12\">\u201c(d) Is situated upon generally unsuitable land for the production of farm crops and livestock, considering the terrain, adverse soil or land conditions, drainage and flooding, vegetation, location and size of the tract; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-13\">\u201c(e) Complies with such other conditions as the governing body or its designate considers necessary.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-14\">In the main, LUBA\u2019s decision and the parties arguments discuss the statute rather than the ordinance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b407-8\"> LUBA said in <em>Endresen:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-9\">\u201cWe agree that the county must consider suitability of the whole parcel for farm use under this criterion. <em>See Lemmon v. Clemens, </em>57 Or App 583, 646 P2d 633 (1982); <em>Flurry v. Land Use Board of Appeals, </em>50 Or App 263, 623 P2d 671 (1981); <em>Meyer v. Lord, </em>37 Or App 59, 586 P2d 367 (1978), <em>rev den </em>(1979). This review is only a threshold inquiry, however. If it can be shown that a portion of the property is not suitable for farm use \u2018considering terrain, adverse soil or land conditions, drainage and flooding, [and] location and size of the parcel,\u2019 then the county may consider this criterion as satisfied even though the <em>majority </em>of parcel is suitable for farm use.\u201d 15 Or LUBA at 63.
