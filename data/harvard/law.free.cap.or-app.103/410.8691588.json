ORS 137.010(7) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-11\">\u201cWhen a person is convicted of an offense and the court does not suspend the imposition or execution of sentence or when a suspended sentence or probation is revoked, the court shall impose the following sentence:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-12\">\u201c(a) A term of imprisonment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-13\">\u201c(b) Afine;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-14\">\u201c(c) Both imprisonment and a fine; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-15\">\u201c(d) Discharge of the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>A trial court has no authority to impose conditions of parole, including the one imposed here. <em>State v. Kipp, </em>52 Or App 1011, 630 P2d 394 (1981). The state urges us to construe the court\u2019s orders precluding contact with the victims as recommendations to the parole board for a special condition of parole. We decline to do that. On remand, the court may, if it deems it appropriate, make an express recommendation to the parole board for a special condition of parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">Remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b448-16\"> We consolidate the two cases for opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b448-17\"> Defendant\u2019s other assignments of error are without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
