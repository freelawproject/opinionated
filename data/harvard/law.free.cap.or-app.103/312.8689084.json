ORS 165.013. He contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence seized during a warrantless search of his vehicle. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Officer Berchard stopped defendant for driving with expired license plates and asked for his driver\u2019s license. Defendant replied that he had no driver\u2019s license and volunteered that it had been suspended. Berchard arrested defendant for failing to present a driver\u2019s license and placed him in the patrol car. When asked for his name, defendant said that it was Tracy Banks. When asked if he could confirm that identity, defendant said that he had no identification, but that the car was registered in his name and that his passenger could identify him. Berchard-asked the passenger to identify defendant; the passenger replied that he thought defendant\u2019s first name might be Tracy and that he did not know defendant\u2019s last name. While talking to the passenger, Berchard saw the car\u2019s registration attached to the windshield visor and noticed that the car was registered to Carol Cloud, not to Tracy Banks.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">Suspecting that defendant had given a false name, Berchard searched the car for identification. He found a black nylon bag that contained marijuana and drug paraphernalia. He also discovered a wallet that contained the driver\u2019s license and identification of \u201cRobert Wilkinson.\u201d Defendant initially claimed that the bag and wallet belonged to a hitchhiker that he had picked up, but later admitted that they were his. It was later determined that the wallet had been stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">The trial court held that the search for identification was proper as a search incident to defendant\u2019s arrest for failing to produce a driver\u2019s license. Under <em>State v. Nelson, </em>102 Or App 106, 792 P2d 486 (1990), and <em>State v. Towle, </em>102 Or App 643, 796 P2d 1208 (1990), that conclusion was erroneous.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Evidence of identity is not an element of the offense of failure to present a driver\u2019s license. ORS 807.570. Accordingly, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>search for identification was not \u201crelevant to the crime for which defendant was arrested.\u201d <em>State v. Caraher, </em>293 Or 741, 653 P2d 942 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">Nevertheless, we uphold the search.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> ORS 807.570(4) permits an officer to detain a person arrested or cited for failing to present a driver\u2019s license \u201cfor such time as reasonably necessary to investigate and verify the person\u2019s identity.\u201d In this case, during the lawful detention, defendant told Bur-chard that his name was Tracy Banks. When asked to confirm that identity, defendant claimed that the car was registered in his name. When that claim proved to be untrue, Burchard had probable cause to believe that defendant had given him a false name. Because evidence of identity is relevant to the offense of providing false information to a police officer, <em>State v. Fesler, </em>68 Or App 609, 685 P2d 1014 (1984), Burchard was justified in conducting the search of the vehicle for identification.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b346-8\"> Both cases were decided after the trial court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b347-6\"> Defendant does not challenge the scope of the search.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b347-7\"> Defendant relies heavily on <em>State v. Scheer, </em>99 Or App 80, 781 P2d 859 (1989), in which we rejected the state\u2019s argument that an officer may search for a driver\u2019s license under circumstances similar to those in this case. Defendant\u2019s reliance, however, is misplaced. In <em>Scheer, </em>the officer had probable cause only to believe that the defendant had committed the crime of failure to display a driver\u2019s license.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
