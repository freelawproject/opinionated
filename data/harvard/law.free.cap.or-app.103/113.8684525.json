We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">At approximately 10 p.m. on October 2,1988, Officer Donaca saw defendant illegally riding his bicycle without a headlight. Donaca stopped him and asked for identification. Defendant produced a driver\u2019s license, and Donaca ran a check on it. Before he received a reply, he asked defendant if he could search a small back pack that was strapped to the bicycle. Defendant said that he could, unzipped the pack, pulled out a poncho and a paper bag and said, \u201cSee, that\u2019s it.\u201d Donaca did not then examine the bag or its contents further.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">Shortly thereafter, the records check revealed that defendant was wanted on two burglary warrants in Texas. Donaca conducted a pat-down before taking defendant into custody on those warrants. He testified that he was searching for \u201canything that can either be used against me or help him get out of the handcuffs. * * * In particular if I feel something small I\u2019m looking for anything along the lines of a paper clip or fish hook or a handcuff key that somebody altered or shortened.\u201d He said, \u201cI know from prior training that razor blades and handcuff keys * * * many times are taped inside a pocket or taped to the inside of the leg and it is accessed by a hole in the pocket.\u201d After the pat-down, Donaca reached inside the pocket of defendant\u2019s trousers with two fingers and felt a \u201csmall lumpy object.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He removed the object, saw that it was a plastic baggie and suspected that it contained hashish. He then placed defendant in the back of the patrol car and returned to search the pack attached to defendant\u2019s bicycle, where he found a small paper bag containing 1.64 ounces of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">In denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, the trial court held that Donaca, incident to the arrest, was entitled to \u201cthoroughly search the defendant\u2019s person for items which could be used to harm the officer, or to aid the defendant in an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>escape\u201d and that, when he found any item on defendant\u2019s person, he was entitled to examine it to determine whether it could be used to cause harm to him or aid defendant in escaping. It justified the search of the pack on the bicycle, because defendant had consented and had not revoked his consent or because it was incident to defendant\u2019s arrest for possession of hashish.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">1. The dispositive issue is whether the search of defendant\u2019s pocket exceeded the permissible scope of a search incident to arrest. In <em>State v. Caraher, </em>293 Or 741, 653 P2d 942 (1982), the Supreme Court considered whether officers had the right to search a purse incident to its owner\u2019s arrest. The court observed that there are two traditional reasons for permitting a search incident to arrest:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-5\">\u201c \u2018first, * * * to protect the arresting officer <em>and to deprive the prisoner of potential means of escape, </em>* * * and, secondly, to avoid destruction of evidence by the arrested person.\u2019 \u201d 293 Or at 758. <em>(Quotinq United States v. Rabinowitz, </em>339 US 56, 71-72, 70 S Ct 430, 94 L Ed 653 (1950); emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">It noted that, under Oregon\u2019s constitution, the justification for searching the person of an arrestee incident to an arrest had been \u201cexpanded * * * beyond considerations of the officer\u2019s safety and destruction of evidence.\u201d Thus, the police could search the defendant\u2019s purse if it was relevant to the crime for which she was arrested and was reasonable under the circumstances. 293 Or at 759. The court did not limit an officer\u2019s right to make a reasonable search of an arrestee\u2019s <em>person </em>for items that could be used to harm the officer or to effect an escape.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">In <em>State v. Owens, </em>302 Or 196, 200, 729 P2d 524 (1986), the Supreme Court reiterated the holding in <em>Caraher:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-8\">\u201cUnder the Oregon Constitution, a warrantless search of the arrestee\u2019s person incident to arrest was traditionally justified to protect the officer and to preserve crime evidence from destruction or concealment. In <em>State v Caraher, supra, </em>this court reshaped the second justification for searches incident to arrest (to preserve evidence) in several important respects. Under Article I, section 9, a search incident to arrest for crime evidence is limited to a search for evidence of the crime for which the arrestee is arrested. In order to justify a search, incidental to an arrest, the arrest must be for a crime, evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>of which reasonably could be concealed on the arrestee\u2019s person or in the belongings in his or her immediate possession at the time of the arrest. Thus, for example, if the person is arrested for a crime which ordinarily has neither instrumen-talities nor fruits which could reasonably be concealed on the arrestee\u2019s person or in the belongings in his or her immediate possession, no warrantless search for evidence of that crime would be authorized as incident to that arrest. Of course, a pat-down or limited search for weapons to protect the officer or to prevent escape would be justified whenever a person is taken into custody.\u201d 302 Or at 200. (Footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">Like <em>State v. Caraher, supra, Owens </em>involved the scope of the second justification, <em>i.e., </em>preservation of evidence. Thus, it did not narrow the circumstances in which an officer can search an arrestee for purposes of protecting himself or preventing escape. Other than recognizing that an officer\u2019s pat-down for weapons in an arrest is <em>always </em>justified to protect himself or to prevent escape, it said nothing about the type of objects for which an officer can search in order to prevent an escape.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Under <em>Caraher </em>and <em>Owens, </em>therefore, the traditional rules regarding a search of an arrestee\u2019s <em>person </em>remain intact. That is, an officer continues to be entitled to search an arrestee for any weapon, tool or implement that could aid in his escape. The only limitation on that right is that the search must be reasonable in time, scope and intensity in view of all the facts.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>State v. Caraher, supra, </em>293 Or at 759.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>In <em>State v. Baker, </em>100 Or App 31, 784 P2d 446 (1989), we considered whether a search that was justified on the basis of \u201cprotection of the officer\u201d met that standard.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-4\">\u201c[t]here was nothing to suggest that defendant might be carrying a dangerous weapon that [the officer] could not detect by a patdown. Neither the blotter of LSD nor the marijuana could feel like a weapon from the outside. Defendant was cooperative throughout the arrest and search and had no history of violence.\u201d 100 Or App at 34.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Accordingly, we held that \u201c[i]t was not reasonable to search defendant\u2019s pockets for the officer\u2019s protection.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 100 Or App at 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">Defendant\u2019s situation is different in important respects. Donaca had just arrested him on two warrants for burglary. He specifically testified that the purpose for searching was not only to confiscate any weapon that defendant might have, but also to deprive him of any means of escape. He indicated that it was not always possible to feel a razor blade or handcuff key through an individual\u2019s outer clothing during a pat-down and that defendant\u2019s trousers were made of \u201c[h]eavy material, army type.\u201d Moreover, he knew that he would have to transport defendant to jail in the back of his patrol car, at night, alone. As the prosecutor noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-7\">\u201cFor an officer to place a defendant in the back of the patrol car without looking in his pocket to see what he has and was only doing a cursory pat-down search, I think that officer may be asking for a short career.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">Under the facts of defendant\u2019s case, Donaca\u2019s search was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">Having lawfully discovered the hashish, Donaca had probable cause to believe that defendant had committed the crime of unlawful possession of a controlled substance. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>Because he reasonably believed that the pack on defendant\u2019s bicycle might also contain hashish, he was justified in searching it incident to defendant\u2019s arrest for that crime. <em>State v. Caraher, supra, </em>293 Or at 759.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b143-8\"> Donaca initially testified that he felt the object during the pat-down. On cross-examination, however, he stated that he felt it only after reaching into defendant\u2019s pocket.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b145-6\"> The dissent\u2019s concern that we have gutted <em>State v. Caraher, supra, </em>is unfounded. Contrary to its understanding, our holding does not grant an unqualified right to search an arrestee\u2019s person incidental to an arrest. Rather, it permits an officer to search for items with which an arrestee could escape only (a) when the officer articulates a concern about the possibility of escape and (b) the search is reasonable under all the circumstances. That rule achieves the proper balance between an arrestee\u2019s right to be free from unreasonable intrusions into his privacy and an officer\u2019s right to protect his own safety and to prevent the arrestee\u2019s escape. By contrast, the dissent\u2019s rule would prohibit an officer from searching for items that could be used to escape under <em>any </em>circumstances, <em>e.g., </em>even when he knew that the arrestee had used small implements to escape in the past.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">The remainder of the dissent\u2019s analysis simply begs the question. First, the fact that the officer \u201cdid not say that he believed that object was a weapon\u201d has nothing to do with the issue before us, which is whether he could search for implements of escape. Second, it is obvious that an officer will not always be able to feel small items such as paper clips or keys through heavy clothing during a pat-down search. The issue in this case is whether he nevertheless has a right to search for them, when he expresses a reasonable concern about the possibility of escape. Thus, the fact that Officer Donaca \u201cdid not even feel the \u2018small and lumpy\u2019 object in defendant\u2019s pocket during the pat-down\u201d is irrelevant. 103 Or App at 121.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b146-10\"> The dissent\u2019s assertion that we have overruled <em>State v. Baker, supra, </em>is groundless. <em>Baker </em>involved neither a search for implements of escape nor an officer\u2019s testimony that he was looking for such items.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b146-11\"> To similar effect is <em>State v. Boyd, </em>101 Or App 649, 792 P2d 462 (1990), in which the trial court justified a search of the defendant\u2019s shirt pocket on the basis of officer\u2019s safety. We held that the search was not done to insure officer safety, because \u201c[the officer] testified that defendant was cooperative, and that she did not feel threatened.\u201d 101 Or App at 652.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b147-5\">BUTTLER, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Azg\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">In <em>State v. Florance, </em>270 Or 169, 527 P2d 1202 (1974), the court decided that, for the sake of simplicity, Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution should be interpreted in the same way that the United States Supreme Court interpreted the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. In that case, it adopted the rule enunciated in <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>414 US 218, 94 S Ct 467, 38 L Ed 2d 427 (1973), relating to searches incident to arrest. The court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-7\">\u201c[U]nder the <em>Robinson </em>rule the items which may properly be seized upon the making of a search as an incident to a lawful custodial arrest include not only weapons and other articles which may be used to either threaten the life of the arresting officer or to effect an escape, and \u2018instrumentalities\u2019 of the crime for which the person was arrested and evidence of that crime, but also contraband evidence of other crimes.\u201d 270 Or at 185.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">In <em>State v. Caraher, </em>293 Or 741, 653 P2d 942 (1982), the court overruled the holding in <em>State v. Florence, supra, </em>that the Oregon courts must follow the United States Supreme Court\u2019s rulings in search and seizure cases. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-9\">\u201cOne of the protections derived from the Oregon Constitution includes a recognition that a valid custodial arrest does not alone give rise to a unique right to search.\u201d 293 Or at 756.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-10\">The court reiterated the Oregon rule in <em>State v. Owens, </em>302 Or 196, 201, 729 P2d 524 (1986):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-11\">\u201c[The <em>Robinson] </em>federal rule permitted full searches of the person incident to any lawful custodial arrest, based upon the rationale that the right to search flowed automatically from a lawful custodial arrest because the arrest itself had so thoroughly involved the arrested person\u2019s privacy that further intrusions had no independent constitutional significance. Our decision in <em>Caraher </em>made it clear that, under the Oregon Constitution, the fact of arrest does not grant an unqualified right to search an arrestee\u2019s person for crime evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>If the present majority is correct, the Supreme Court accomplished nothing in <em>Caraher, </em>because the majority resurrects the rule laid down in <em>United States v. Robinson, supra, </em>by permitting a full search of an arrestee\u2019s person and all items immediately associated with his person incidental to an arrest. It would also overrule our very recent decisions in <em>State v. Baker, </em>100 Or App 31, 784 P2d 446 (1989), and <em>State v. Boyd, </em>101 Or App 649, 792 P2d 462 (1990), although it attempts, unsuccessfully, to distinguish them. 103 Or App at 118, n 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">In denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, the trial court held that Donaca, incident to defendant\u2019s arrest, was entitled to \u201cthoroughly search the defendant\u2019s person for items which could be used to harm the officer, or to aid the defendant in an escape\u201d and, \u201cupon discovering any item on the defendant\u2019s person, the officer was entitled to examine the item and to make a determination of whether the item could be used to cause harm to the officer or to aid the defendant in an escape.\u201d It justified the search of the pack on defendant\u2019s bicycle, either because defendant had consented and had not revoked his consent or because the search was incident to defendant\u2019s arrest for possession of hashish.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">The trial court overstated the permissible scope of a search incident to arrest, apparently applying the federal law as Oregon courts had been applying it before <em>State v. Caraher, supra, </em>was decided. The majority agrees. It is clear from both <em>Caraher </em>and <em>Owens </em>that a search incident to arrest is limited to a search for evidence of the crime for which the person was arrested and to \u201ca <em>pat-down </em>or <em>limited </em>search for <em>weapons </em>to protect the officer or to prevent escape * * <em>State v. Owens, supra, </em>302 Or at 200. (Emphasis supplied.) That is to say that a pat-down or limited search is permissible for weapons that could be used against the officer or in effectuating an escape; that search is only for <em>weapons, </em>not for a handcuff key, a paper clip, a fish hook or a piece of wire.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">If the trial court\u2019s and the majority\u2019s understanding of the rule is correct, the limits imposed by <em>Caraher </em>or <em>Owens </em>have no meaning, because any time that a person has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>arrested, the officer could make a full search of the person.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That rule was expressly rejected in <em>Caraher. </em>In fact, in order to search for crime evidence, the search must be limited to a search for evidence of a crime for which the arrestee is arrested and, as pointed out in <em>Owens, </em>if the person is arrested for a crime that ordinarily has neither instrumentalities nor fruits that reasonably could be concealed on the arrestee\u2019s person, no warrantless search for evidence of that crime would be authorized incident to that arrest. 302 Or at 200. In <em>Car-aher, </em>the court approved the test applied in <em>State v. Chinn, </em>231 Or 259, 373 P2d 392 (1962), that a search incident to arrest must not only be close in time and space, but its intensity must be \u201ccommensurate both with the crime and what was known of the criminal[.]\u201d 231 Or at 273.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">Here, the officer did not even pretend that he was searching for evidence of the crime for which defendant was arrested, and there is no evidence that the search was necessary to prevent destruction of evidence. Neither is there evidence that the officer believed defendant to be armed or an escape threat or that the officer felt threatened. The officer\u2019s search, not only for weapons, but for any item that might aid defendant in picking the lock on the handcuffs is not within the permissible scope of a search incident to an arrest. The majority apparently believes that the scope of the search is extended automatically if, but only if, the officer states that he is looking for paper clips or fishhooks. <em>Compare State v. Jones, </em>103 Or App 123, 796 P2d 670 (1990). That is an unusual talismanic quirk. To the contrary, under <em>Caraher </em>and <em>Owens, </em>Donaca was entitled to make a <em>limited pat-down </em>for weapons. However, he did not even feel the \u201csmall and lumpy\u201d object in defendant\u2019s pocket during the pat-down, so he had no authority to reach into the pocket; when he did feel it after reaching inside the pocket, he did not say that he thought that it was a weapon. Accordingly, he had no authority to remove it. <em>State v. Baker, supra. </em>Evidence seized from defendant\u2019s person must be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">If that evidence had been lawfully obtained, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>search of the pack on defendant\u2019s bicycle might have been justified, if Donaca had reasonably believed that it also contained hashish. <em>State v. Caraher, supra. </em>Because the first search was unlawful, the subsequent search cannot be justified as incident to defendant\u2019s arrest for possession of hashish.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">The question remains whether defendant\u2019s earlier \u201cconsent\u201d survived the intervening events that resulted in his arrest pursuant to the two outstanding warrants. Passing the question of whether the officer, after making a valid stop of defendant for a traffic infraction<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and obtaining his identification, which the officer did not question, had any authority to use the occasion to ask defendant\u2019s consent to search his small bike pack, there is no evidence that the consent was a continuing one. In response to the officer\u2019s question, defendant unzipped the pack, pulled out a poncho and a paper bag and then said, \u201cSee, that\u2019s it.\u201d That was the scope of both the consent and the search. Any further search by the officer, given the intervening events, required a new consent. None was requested or given, because Donaca justified that search as incident to defendant\u2019s arrest and for the officer\u2019s safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">I would reverse and remand for a new trial.
