Cronin\u2019s estate. The city contends that the commission erred by making the award because Cronin was aware that he suffered from an occupational disease over two years before his estate filed for death benefits and, therefore, pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.2-406(A)(5), the statute of limitations barred his estate from receiving compensation. We agree and reverse the commission\u2019s award.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-10\">Cronin served as a firefighter for the City of Alexandria. In October 1989, Cronin\u2019s physician, who was treating Cronin for hypertension (also an occupational disease), diagnosed Cronin as suffering from heart disease and recommended in a letter to Cronin\u2019s superior that Cronin be medically retired because of his heart disease. Soon afterwards, Cronin filed with the city for service-connected disability retirement, which pays more benefits than non-service-connected disability retirement. In support of his application, Cronin presented his physician\u2019s October 1989 letter to the division chief of the benefits and systems division of the city\u2019s personnel services department.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-11\">On February 1, 1990, Cronin was medically retired from the city\u2019s fire department based upon a \u201cpartial disability-service <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>connected\u201d and, accordingly, was awarded benefits. Two days earlier, Cronin signed a form captioned \u201cRetirement Income Notice, Disability Income Notice\u201d acknowledging and certifying that his disability for which he was retiring was service-connected. The city\u2019s retirement plan requires that in order for an employee to be eligible for service-connected disability benefits, his or her injury must also be compensable under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">On February 22, 1992, Cronin suffered a massive heart attack and died. A claim for benefits was filed by Cronin\u2019s estate for his death on May 18, 1992. The city defended the claim on the ground that the estate was barred by the statute of limitations because Cronin had been informed that he suffered from an occupational disease over two years before his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">At the hearing, the parties agreed that Cronin received a formal diagnosis of coronary heart disease in October 1989, but disputed whether Cronin was informed that his disease was work related. The decedent\u2019s widow and brother both acknowledged that Cronin was aware of his heart condition and that there had been discussions with the city\u2019s personnel services department about the payment of his medical bills for this condition. However, both denied that Cronin ever mentioned his condition\u2019s compensability under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. A September 24,1993 letter from Dr. Richard Schwartz, who reviewed Cronin\u2019s medical records, states that the records do not show that Cronin was \u201ctold by any health care provider that he had a coronary heart disease related to his employment as a firefighter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">The city\u2019s risk manager in charge of claimants receiving benefits testified that she met with Cronin extensively from December 1990 through February 1991. The risk manager informed Cronin, who was under the misimpression that he was already receiving workers\u2019 compensation indemnity payments, that were he to receive such indemnity benefits, they would, under the terms of the city\u2019s pension plan, cause a dollar-for-dollar reduction in his disability retirement pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>ments, and he would have to undergo vocational rehabilitation and return to work if possible. After learning he would achieve no net gain in receiving the indemnity benefits and that he would be subject to the vocational rehabilitation program, Cronin opted not to seek an award from the commission, but applied for service-connected disability retirement benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">On the estate\u2019s death claim, the commission found that Cronin had \u201capplied for service-connected disability and knew he could receive an award from the commission for his heart disease,\u201d but that the evidence fell short of establishing the requisite communication to Cronin of his occupational disease under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. The commission ruled that while Cronin \u201cbelieved his condition was work related,\u201d the estate was not barred by the limitations period because Cronin was not \u201cmedically advised that his condition was causally related to his work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Code \u00a7 65.2-406(A)(5) which provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-7\">A. The right to compensation under this chapter shall be forever barred unless a claim is filed with the Commission within ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-8\">5. For all other occupational diseases, two years after a diagnosis of the disease is first communicated to the employee\u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">In this case, Cronin filed for service-connected disability retirement benefits based on a treating physician\u2019s letter recommending that he be \u201cmedically retired\u201d because of such condition, but the letter did not specifically state that Cronin\u2019s condition was work related.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b553-10\">The commission\u2019s ruling that Cronin did not receive the requisite communication because he was not \u201cmedically ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>vised [by a physician] that his condition was causally related to his work\u201d extends the breadth of existing case law to a point of requiring proof of a physician\u2019s direct communication to the employee that the disease from which the employee suffers is work related. Under this interpretation of the law, benefits would be available even if compelling and unrefuted evidence proved the employee\u2019s knowledge of the compensability of his disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">By interpreting the statute as requiring proof of a communication by a physician of the employee\u2019s occupational disease, the commission ignores the fact that, while many employees may receive a diagnosis of his or her disease from a physician, the claimants may receive the communication that such a disease is a compensable occupational disease from someone other than a physician, often an attorney or someone in charge of personnel or administering benefits. The commission\u2019s ruling overlooks practical experience under the Act and the fact that the compensability of an occupational disease is a creation of the legislature. A physician\u2019s diagnosis of an employee\u2019s condition is not dispositive on the issue of compensability and physicians often reach different conclusions about a condition\u2019s origin.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-5\">[0]nce an employee receives a communication of an occupational disease, it is incumbent upon that employee to file a claim. Once a claim is filed, it is the duty of the Commission to determine: (1) whether the disease is in fact an \u201coccupational disease\u201d as defined in Code \u00a7 65.1-46, and if so, (2) whether that occupational disease is compensable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1q\"><em>Parris v. Appalachian Power Co., </em>2 Va.App. 219, 225-26, 343 S.E.2d 455, 458-59 (1986) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Neither this Court nor the Supreme Court of Virginia has interpreted Code \u00a7 65.2-406(A)(5) as requiring a communication from a physician to trigger the running of the limitations period. We hold that Code \u00a7 65.2-406(A)(5) does not require that an employee receive from a physician a communication that his disease is work related; rather, the statute only requires that the employee, simultaneously with or sometime <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>after the diagnosis of his condition, learn that the condition is an occupational disease for which compensation may be awarded. <em>See Ratliff v. Dominion Coal Co., </em>3 Va.App. 175, 349 S.E.2d 147 (1986) (where we held that a 1979 letter from the Department of Labor was \u201ca medical determination of total disability due to pneumoconiosis,\u201d so as to trigger not only the running of the three year limitation period under the federal law but also under the Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Act). In <em>Ratliff, </em>we rejected the claimant\u2019s argument that a letter from the Department of Labor was an administrative or legal determination, not a \u201cmedical determination.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Here, we have not only evidence of the physician\u2019s diagnosis of Cronin\u2019s heart disease, but evidence that Cronin was aware of its connection to his employment. He filed for service-connected retirement benefits based on the diagnosis more than two years before his death and before his estate filed a claim with the commission. Having applied for and received disability benefits based upon this diagnosis, Cronin, like Ratliff, was medically informed that his heart condition was an occupational disease for which he could receive benefits under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Indeed, the record establishes and the commission specifically found that Cronin believed his heart disease was work related and knew he could receive an award from the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">We are not persuaded by the claimant\u2019s argument that the statutory language which refers to the time of the \u201cdiagnosis\u201d by definition requires a communication from a physician. We distinguish this case from <em>Garrison v. Prince William Co., </em>220 Va. 913, 265 S.E.2d 687 (1980), in which the Supreme Court of Virginia held that a deputy sheriff who had been diagnosed with hypertension in 1975 and filed claim for the same in 1978 was not barred from receiving compensation because he had not received \u201ca diagnosis that he suffer[ed] from an \u2018occupational disease\u2019: one arising out of and in the course of employment.\u201d 220 Va. at 917, 265 S.E.2d at 689. That Garrison might have successfully brought a claim at an earlier date due to the statutory presumption set forth in Code \u00a7 65.1-47.1, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>Court said is \u201cirrelevant\u201d to the resolution of whether the limitations period applied. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">Unlike <em>Garrison, </em>Cronin was not an unsuspecting employee who filed with the commission late only after having learned of the relatively new statutory presumption under then Code \u00a7 65.1-47.1. Rather, Cronin received a medical diagnosis of his heart condition and acted upon such diagnosis to receive service-connected disability benefits. This action proved that Cronin was informed for purposes of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">Accordingly, we reverse the commission\u2019s award.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b553-11\">.
