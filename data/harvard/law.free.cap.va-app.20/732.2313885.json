Howell. The trial court ruled that \u201cHowell\u2019s 1986 DUI conviction under the Chesterfield County ordinance 14.1-1 is [ ] invalid insofar as it conflicts with Code \u00a7 15.1-132 by providing a lesser punishment than that prescribed by general law.\u201d We hold that when the County adopted its DUI ordinance, it incorporated, by reference, the penalty provisions for a Class 1 misdemeanor in Code \u00a7 18.2-11 and, therefore, the ordinance did not conflict with Code \u00a7 15.1-132. Thus, because Howell\u2019s 1986 DUI conviction was valid, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">Under Code \u00a7 46.1-188, localities were given the authority to \u201cincorporate appropriate provisions of Article 2 (\u00a7 18.2-266 <em>et seq.) </em>of Chapter 7 of Title 18.2 into such ordinance by reference.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-266 makes it unlawful for any person to operate a motor vehicle while intoxicated. Code \u00a7 15.1-132 provides that localities, when adopting DUI ordinances, may prescribe fines or other punishments for violations of such ordinances that are \u201cthe same penalties for violations thereof as are provided by general law for similar offenses,\u201d but not lesser punishments for such similar offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">At the time of Howell\u2019s DUI conviction, Code \u00a7 18.2-270 provided that a DUI conviction was a Class 1 misdemeanor, but defined no punishment for such a violation. The penalty for a Class 1 misdemeanor was set forth in Code \u00a7 18.2-11 (not contained in Article 2 (\u00a7 18.2-266 <em>et seq.)). </em>The Chesterfield County ordinance, \u00a7 14.1-1, under which Howell was convicted for his first DUI did not further define the penalty for the offense but specifically adopted all of Article 2 (\u00a7 18.2 <em>et seq.) </em>of Chapter 7 of Title 18.2 of the Code of Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-8\">The trial judge found that because Code \u00a7 18.2-11 was not incorporated by reference into the Chesterfield County Code, Chesterfield County Code \u00a7 1-6, the ordinance defining the penalty for misdemeanors where no specific penalty was otherwise given, applied to Howell\u2019s conviction. Thus, because the penalty contained in \u00a7 1-6 was less than that provided in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>Code \u00a7 18.2-11, the trial judge found that \u00a7 14.1-1 was invalid insofar as it conflicted with Code \u00a7 15.1-132 by providing a lesser punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">We hold that the trial judge erred by ruling that since Chesterfield County Code \u00a7 14.1-1 did not prescribe a penalty, the penalty prescribed by Chesterfield County Code \u00a7 1-6 controlled the case by default.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> By adopting <em>all of </em>Article 2 (\u00a7 18.2 <em>et seq.) </em>of Chapter 7 of Title 18.2, Chesterfield County incorporated, by reference, the definition of the term \u201cClass one misdemeanor\u201d found in Code \u00a7 18.2-11. Article 2 includes Code \u00a7 18.2-270, which is the penalty provision for violations of Code \u00a7 18.2-266 (DUI). At the time Howell was convicted for the questioned offense, Code \u00a7 18.2-270 provided that a first time violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-266 was a Class 1 misdemeanor, which was defined in Code \u00a7 18.2-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">The intended meaning of a term used in a statute is to be \u201cascertained from the act itself when read in light of <em>other statutes relating to the same subject matter.\u201d Campbell v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 33, 38, 409 S.E.2d 21, 24 (1991), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>14 Va.App. 988, 421 S.E.2d 652 (1992) (en banc), <em>aff'd, </em>246 Va. 174, 431 S.E.2d 648 (1993) <em>(quoting Robert Bunts Eng\u2019g &amp; Equip. Co. v. Palmer, </em>169 Va. 206, 209-10, 192 S.E. 789, 790-91 (1937)) (emphasis added). The two cases cited by the Commonwealth, <em>Stevenson v. City of Falls Church, </em>243 Va. 434, 416 S.E.2d 435 (1992), and <em>Dickerson v. Town of Christiansburg, </em>201 Va. 342, 111 S.E.2d 292 (1959), clearly demonstrate that the term \u201cClass 1 misdemeanor\u201d did not lose its meaning when that section was incorporated by reference into the County Code. Moreover, this Court has recognized that the penalty for a Class 1 misdemeanor defined in Code \u00a7 18.2-11 was inherent in the provisions of Code \u00a7 18.2-270, when we held that a Fairfax County ordinance was invalid because it violated Code \u00a7 15.1-132 \u201cby providing for a lesser punishment <em>than Code \u00a7 18.2-270.\u201d Commonwealth v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number><em>Holtz, </em>12 Va.App. 1151, 1152, 408 S.E.2d 561, 563 (1991) (emphasis added). If the penalty were not inherent in the terms of Code \u00a7 18.2-270, we would have referred to the punishment provided in Code \u00a7 18.2-11 instead.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">In adopting all of Article 2 (\u00a7 18.2-266 <em>et seq.), </em>Chesterfield County should not be punished for failing to specifically mention what was then inherently recognized by reference to other sections, which prescribed the penalty for the offense in question. Chesterfield County was given the authority to adopt the same penalties as those prescribed in Article 2. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 15.1-132. By incorporating all of Article 2 by reference, Chesterfield County Code \u00a7 14.1-1 should be construed as providing for the same penalties as those set forth in Code \u00a7 18.2-11 via Code \u00a7 18.2-270.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b781-7\">. Code \u00a7 1-6 provided the penalty for violations if no other penalty was provided.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
