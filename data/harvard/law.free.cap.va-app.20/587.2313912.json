Chanin contends (1) that credible evidence does not support the commission\u2019s finding that her multiple chemical sensitivity syndrome (MCS) was an aggravation of a pre-existing ordinary disease of life, and (2) that her health and medical treatment prior to September 2,1992, does not establish by a preponderance of the evidence that she suffered MCS prior to that date. We consolidate these contentions into one overall issue: whether credible evidence supports the commission\u2019s finding that Dr. Chanin failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that her disease (MCS) arose out of and in the course of her employment with Eastern Virginia Medical School (EVMS). Finding no error, we affirm the commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">EVMS employed Dr. Chanin as Director of the Gerontology Institute located at DePaul Medical Center, beginning Sep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>tember 1, 1992. She spent four hours that day in her office, where she smelled a \u201cmusty, moldy chemical odor.\u201d From September 1 to November 4, 1992, she developed progressive respiratory problems. During that time, her office was moved four times. She was examined by several physicians, who diagnosed her with MCS, but none identified the chemical causing the sensitivity.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">On February 28, 1994, a deputy commissioner found that Dr. Chanin had not proved a compensable occupational disease because medical evidence showed that she had suffered from pre-existing symptoms, that there was no detectable level of \u201ctrigger mechanisms\u201d at DePaul, and that she was exposed to toxins outside of her employment. The deputy commissioner stated, \u201c[a]t best, Chanin\u2019s exposure at DePaul merely aggravated a pre-existing ordinary disease of life.\u201d On August 15, 1994, the full commission found that Dr. Chanin had failed to prove she suffered from a compensable ordinary disease of life.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Dr. Chanin concedes that MCS is an ordinary disease of life because it is a disease to which the general public is exposed outside of employment. For an ordinary disease of life to be compensable under \u00a7 65.2-401,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-6\">[Chanin] must establish by \u201cclear and convincing evidence, to a reasonable medical certainty\u201d that the disease (1) arose out of and in the course of employment, (2) did not result from causes outside of the employment, and (3) follows as an incident of an occupational disease, is an infectious disease or contagious disease contracted in the course of employment, or is characteristic of employment and was caused by conditions peculiar to the employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-7\"><em>Island Creek Coal v. Breeding, </em>6 Va.App. 1, 11, 365 S.E.2d 782, 788 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">Dr. Chanin contends that she met this burden. She argues that the evidence proved that she suffered from MCS and that the cause of the disease was injurious exposure to toxins at DePaul. She argues that her disease and its employment-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>related cause were proven by the testimony of Drs. Ziem, Baker, Heuser, Cullen, and Lieberman. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">\u201cDecisions of the commission as to questions of fact, if supported by credible evidence are conclusive and binding on this Court.\u201d <em>Manassas Ice &amp; Fuel Co. v. Farrar, </em>13 Va.App. 227, 229, 409 S.E.2d 824, 826 (1991). \u201cWhether a disease is causally related to the employment and not causally related to other factors is such a finding of fact.\u201d <em>Breeding, </em>6 Va.App. at 12, 365 S.E.2d at 788 <em>(citing Watkins v. Halco Engineering, Inc., </em>225 Va. 97, 101, 300 S.E.2d 761, 763 (1983)). \u201cThe fact that contrary evidence may be in the record is of no consequence if there is credible evidence to support the Commission\u2019s findings.\u201d <em>Russell Loungewear v. Gray, </em>2 Va.App. 90, 95, 341 S.E.2d 824, 826 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">The commission\u2019s decision denying Dr. Chanin disability benefits is supported by credible evidence. First, the commission found that the opinion of Dr. Ziem, Dr. Chanin\u2019s treating physician, was \u201cbased on an incorrect understanding of the facts of the claimant\u2019s work environment.\u201d Dr. Ziem based her diagnosis on the supposition that gasses were emitted by new carpet and renovations at DePaul. Neither condition existed. Furthermore, Dr. Ziem was unable to identify any substances in the DePaul environment that could have caused Dr. Chanin\u2019s MCS.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">Second, the commission found that Dr. Chanin spent only fifty percent of her time at DePaul. Dr. Cullen, a professor of medicine at Yale University and a respected authority on MCS, reviewed Dr. Chanin\u2019s medical records. He concluded that she had MCS, but that it could not have been caused primarily by her exposure to the DePaul environment. Dr. Cullen stated, \u201cthe hallmark of MCS is development of the disease after repeated low-level chemical exposures or a single high level chemical exposure.\u201d Dr. Chanin worked only four hours at DePaul before the symptoms began. Thereafter, she spent only fifty percent of her time at DePaul. She has been exposed to aggravating chemicals in her home and in her neighborhood, both in New York where she lived previously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>and in Norfolk where she lives presently. She has not proved that her MCS \u201cdid not result from causes outside of the employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\">Third, the commission found that no doctor isolated the chemical(s) causing the sensitivity. While the statute does not require that a single source of the claimant\u2019s disease be pinpointed, it does require that the \u201cprimary source [be] determined by \u2018reasonable medical certainty.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ross Laboratories v. Barbour, </em>13 Va.App. 373, 377, 412 S.E.2d 205, 208 (1991). Such a determination must be based on evidence that \u201cit is at least more probable than not that the disease arose out of and in the course of employment.\u201d <em>Westmoreland Coal Co. v. Campbell, </em>7 Va.App. 217, 224, 372 S.E.2d 411, 416 (1988). Dr. Chanin offered no evidence of chemicals in DePaul\u2019s environment. Because no evidence exists of chemical exposure in Dr. Chanin\u2019s employment environment, we cannot find that she met her burden of proving by \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d to a reasonable medical certainly that her disease arose out of and in the course of her employment at DePaul, as required by Code \u00a7 65.2-401.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Fourth, Dr. Chanin admitted that symptoms of MCS may be instant or delayed. Thus, we cannot determine where or when the exposure occurred. Therefore, no evidence proved to a reasonable medical certainty that the environment at DePaul was the proximate cause of Dr. Chanin\u2019s disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">The judgment of the commission is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
