Wholesalers challenged the termination as a violation of the Act and petitioned the Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Board (the Board) for relief. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 4.1-407, -409. A panel designated by the Board ruled that termination of such agreements was permitted by the Act only for \u201cwholesaler deficiency\u201d or \u201csituations of like character,\u201d circumstances not proven by Brown-Forman. On appeal by Brown-Forman to the Board, the Board adopted the panel decision. Brown-Forman sought judicial review pursuant to the Virginia Administrative Process Act, Code \u00a7 9-6.14:1, <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">The trial court disagreed with the Board\u2019s construction of the Act but reached the same result, concluding that BrownForman had failed to establish \u201csufficient good cause to terminate.\u201d Before this Court, Brown-Forman contends that the evidence justified termination as a matter of law. Although we concur in the trial court\u2019s construction of the Act, we reverse the disposition and remand the proceeding to the Board for reconsideration of the issue of good cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">The parties proceeded by \u201cStipulated Facts.\u201d Wholesalers distributed several \u201cbrands of ... wines\u201d within \u201cestablished territories\u201d throughout the Commonwealth under exclusive agreements with Brown-Forman, as supplier/winery. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 4.1\u2014404. Incidental to a \u201cmajor reorganization of its sales organization,\u201d Brown-Forman determined that marketing of its products by \u201cfewer wholesalers over broader geo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>graphical areas\u201d would increase \u201cmarket penetration, sales ... and profits for both Brown-Forman and [its] wholesalers\u201d and, therefore, \u201cview[ed] consolidation from eighteen [Virginia] wholesalers ... to four as a material benefit\u201d to \u201cits own economic ... interest.\u201d Accordingly, Brown-Forman terminated existing distribution agreements with wholesalers, intending to thereafter \u201cappoint and contract\u201d with \u201cfewer wholesalers over broader geographic areas.\u201d <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 4.1-407.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">The parties agreed that Brown-Forman\u2019s decision was not prompted by the \u201cdeficiency\u201d of any wholesaler but, rather, a \u201cgood faith exercise\u201d of Brown-Forman\u2019s \u201cbusiness judgment,\u201d calculated to promote its \u201cself interest.\u201d Consequently, the parties stipulated that \u201cthe sole issue presented ... is whether the good faith exercise of business judgment by [Brown-Forman], absent any evidence of deficiency in the performance of the [wholesalers], is \u2018good cause\u2019 pursuant to the [Act] for [Brown-Forman] to terminate unilaterally its agreements with [wholesalers].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">The Wine Franchise Act regulates the business relationship of the parties, as winery and wholesaler, through a comprehensive statutory scheme intended:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-6\">1. To promote the interests of the parties and the public in fair business relations between wine wholesalers and wineries, and in the continuation of wine wholesalerships on a fair basis;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-7\">2. To preserve and protect the existing three-tier system for the distribution of wine ...;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-8\">3. To prohibit unfair treatment of wine wholesalers by wineries, promote compliance with valid franchise agreements, and define certain rights and remedies of wineries in regard to cancellation of franchise agreements with wholesalers;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-9\">4. To establish conditions for creation and continuation of all wholesale wine distributorships____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>Code \u00a7 4.1\u2014400. The Act \u201cshall be liberally construed and applied to promote [these] underlying purposes and policies.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">In furtherance of such \u201cpurposes and policies,\u201d the Act permits a winery to terminate an agreement with a wholesaler only upon \u201cgood cause,\u201d Code \u00a7 4.1-406, and in accordance with Code \u00a7 4.1-407.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Unless expressly excused by statute, Code \u00a7 4.1\u2014407(F), a winery must provide a wholesaler timely written notice of its intention to terminate an agreement which \u201cstate[s] all the reasons\u201d for such action. Code \u00a7 4.1-407(A). Thereafter, the wholesaler is assured an opportunity to rectify the \u201ccondition\u201d cited by the winery, if possible. Code \u00a7 4.1-407(B). If the \u201creason relates to a condition which may not be rectified by the wholesaler,\u201d or remediation is in dispute, the wholesaler may request a hearing before the Board to determine if the winery acted upon \u201cgood cause.\u201d Code \u00a7\u00a7 4.1-407(C), -407(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">In a proceeding before the Board on this issue, \u201cthe winery shall have the burden of proving the existence of good cause.\u201d Code \u00a7 4.1-407(E). The statute specifies that \u201c[g]ood cause shall <em>not </em>include the sale or purchase of a winery,\u201d a transaction governed by Code \u00a7 4.1-405, but expressly <em>\u201cshall </em>include,\u201d though <em>\u201cnot </em>limited to,\u201d several enumerated circumstances, termed \u201cwholesaler deficiencies\u201d by the parties, none of which occurred in this instance. Code \u00a7 4.1-406 (emphasis added). Termination without the requisite \u201cgood cause\u201d may result in reinstatement of the agreement or in payment by the winery to the wholesaler of \u201creasonable compensation for the value of [the] agreement\u201d determined in accordance with the statute. Code \u00a7 4.1-409.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">In addressing the instant dispute on the stipulated facts, the Board, by reference to the earlier panel decision, concluded that \u201c[t]he act contains no language that permits a winery\u2019s unilateral cancellation of agreements with wholesalers in order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>to consolidate its distributors and to enhance its economic interests <em>in the absence of wholesaler deficiency </em>\u201d (emphasis added). Applying the doctrine of <em>ejusdem generis, </em>the Board concluded that the several specific examples of \u201cgood cause\u201d set forth in Code \u00a7 4.1-406 manifested a legislative intent to permit termination only upon wholesaler deficiency and \u201csituations of like character,\u201d irrespective of Brown-Forman\u2019s \u201cself interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">On judicial review, the trial court concluded that the Board\u2019s construction was unduly restrictive and that statutory \u201c \u2018good cause\u2019 does not require in every instance a showing of wholesaler deficiencies.\u201d The court reasoned that the specific statutory exclusion from \u201cgood cause\u201d of \u201cone situation\u201d not involving wholesaler deficiency, the sale or purchase of a winery, \u201csuggests that there are ... actions by the winery which could\u201d constitute statutory good cause, although unrelated to wholesaler deficiency. Nevertheless, the trial court determined that the \u201cbusiness judgment exercised by BrownForman <em>in this case ..., </em>without more[,] ... is not sufficient \u2018good cause\u2019 under the statute\u201d and affirmed the decision of the Board. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Judicial review of \u201c[a]ll proceedings under [the Act] shall be held in accordance with the Virginia Administrative Process Act (\u00a7 9-6.14:1 et seq.).\u201d Code \u00a7 4.1\u2014410; <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 9-6.14:16. \u201cThe burden shall be upon the party complaining of agency action to designate and demonstrate an error of law subject to review by the court.\u201d Code \u00a7 9-6.14:17. The reviewing court must accord considerable deference to an agency\u2019s resolution of factual issues, \u201cascertaining [only] whether there was substantial evidence in the ... record upon which the agency as the trier of the facts could reasonably find them to be as it did.\u201d <em>Id.; see EDF v. State Water Control Bd., </em>15 Va.App. 271, 277-78, 422 S.E.2d 608, 611-12(1992) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">\u201cIn contrast, judicial review of a \u2018legal issue\u2019 requires \u2018little deference,\u2019 unless it ... \u2018falls within an agency\u2019s area of particular expertise.\u2019 \u201d <em>EDF, </em>15 Va.App. at 278, 422 S.E.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>612 (quoting <em>Johnstom-Willis, Ltd. v. Kenley, </em>6 Va.App. 231, 243-46, 369 S.E.2d 1, 8 (1988)). This distinction \u201crecognizes the \u2018special competence\u2019 of the judiciary to decide issues of \u2018common law,\u2019 \u2018constitutional law5 or \u2018statutory interpretation\u2019 \u201d and a concomitant responsibility not to \u201c \u2018merely rubber-stamp an agency determination.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cWe are required to construe the law as it is written\u201d and \u201c \u2018[a]n erroneous construction by those charged with its administration cannot be permitted to override the clear mandates of a statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth v. May Bros., Inc., </em>11 Va.App. 115, 119, 396 S.E.2d 695, 697 (1990) (quoting <em>Hurt v. Caldwell, </em>222 Va. 91, 97, 279 S.E.2d 138, 142 (1981)). The intention of the legislature must always control. <em>Last v. Va. State Bd. of Medicine, </em>14 Va.App. 906, 910, 421 S.E.2d 201, 205 (1992) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">It is well established that \u201c[t]he province of [statutory] construction lies wholly within the domain of ambiguity, and that which is plain needs no interpretation.\u201d <em>Winston v. City of Richmond, </em>196 Va. 403, 408, 83 S.E.2d 728, 731 (1954). \u2018Words are ambiguous if they admit to \u2018being understood in more than one way[,]\u2019 refer to \u2018two or more things simultaneouslyt,]\u2019 are \u2018difficult to comprehend,\u2019 \u2018of doubtful import,\u2019 or lack \u2018clearness and definiteness.\u2019 \u201d <em>Diggs v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 300, 301-02, 369 S.E.2d 199, 200 (1988) (quoting <em>Brown v. Lukhard, </em>229 Va. 316, 321, 330 S.E.2d 84, 87 (1985)). If \u201cthe words of [a] statute are clear and unambiguous,\u201d we \u201cgive them their plain meaning,\u201d and the \u201cgeneral rules of statutory construction\u201d are unnecessary.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Diggs, </em>6 Va.App. at 302, 369 S.E.2d at 200; <em>see May Bros., </em>11 Va.App. at 118, 896 S.E.2d at 696. The judiciary may not \u201cchange or amend [legislative] enactments under the guise of construing them.\u201d <em>Winston, </em>196 Va. at 407-08, 83 S.E.2d at 731.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Here, we find nothing complex or unclear in the term \u201cgood cause\u201d as it relates to termination of a distribution</p>\n<p id=\"b477-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>agreement under the Act. Considered together and in proper context, the words simply mean a \u201cwell-founded\u201d \u201creason.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary </em>527, 217 (1989). This very ordinary definition of plain words, used nontechnically, comports perfectly with a statutory scheme intended at once to protect wholesalers from \u201cunfair treatment ... by wineries\u201d and \u201cpromote ... fair business relations between ... wholesalers and wineries, and ... the continuation of ... wholesalerships on a fair basis.\u201d Code \u00a7 4.1-400. In the event of dispute, the Board has statutory responsibility to \u201cdetermine if there is good cause\u201d to terminate in such instance, with the burden of proof on the winery. Code \u00a7 4.1-407.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">Contrary to wholesalers\u2019 contention, the statutory references to circumstances which expressly do or do not constitute the contemplated \u201cgood cause\u201d introduce no ambiguity to the analysis. Rather, the legislature simply elected to specifically exclude \u201cthe sale or purchase of a winery\u201d from the broad sweep of \u201cgood cause\u201d and to include certain specific instances of wholesaler deficiency. These express inclusions and exclusions embrace diverse and unrelated circumstances and clearly impose no limitation on one another or any unmentioned good causes for termination under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">Accordingly, we concur with the trial court that the Board erroneously restricted statutory \u201cgood cause\u201d to instances of wholesaler deficiency. However, mindful that the Act reserves a determination of disputed good cause to the Board, we remand these proceedings to it for reconsideration of that issue consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See Virginia Supermarkets v.
