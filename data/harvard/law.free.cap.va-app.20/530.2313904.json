Vaughn appeals his conviction for violating \u00a7 421 of the Newport News City Code, which prohibits \u201coutside storage of goods, materials and equipment.\u201d Vaughn argues that because \u201cgoods, materials and equipment\u201d are not defined in \u00a7 421, the statute is unconstitutionally vague and overly broad.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">While Vaughn correctly contends that the Newport News City Code does not define \u201cgoods, materials, and equipment,\u201d a fair reading of \u00a7 421 in its entirety and in conjunction with the language in the city\u2019s zoning ordinance shows that \u00a7 421 is reasonably definite in its scope as to the prohibited conduct and, therefore, not unconstitutionally vague. For this reason, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">The pertinent facts which are not disputed are that Vaughn had numerous items, including appliances, pieces of wood, pipes, and other miscellaneous items, stored outside on his business property. Vaughn, whose property is zoned Retail Commercial, received a written notice of and notice to correct the violations within fifteen days. More than two months later, he received a summons for failing to abate the violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">The void-for-vagueness doctrine requires that a legislative enactment define a criminal offense with sufficient definiteness and certainty that \u201cordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited and in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\u201d <em>Kolender v. Lawson, </em>461 U.S. 352, 357, 103 S.Ct. 1855, 1858, 75 L.Ed.2d 903 (1983). This Court has further explained that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>\u201c[although absolute precision is not required, a law must afford a reasonable degree of certainty so that a person is not left to guess at what conduct is prohibited.\u201d <em>Turner v. Jackson, </em>14 Va.App. 423, 433, 417 S.E.2d 881, 888 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">While \u00a7 421 does not define \u201cgoods, materials and equipment,\u201d it permits outside storage of goods, materials and equipment as a matter of right <em>only </em>in manufacturing zoning districts and, with the issuance of a special exception, in a C2A zoning district. Vaughn\u2019s property is zoned neither Manufacturing nor C2-A. Section 421 further delineates exceptions to the section\u2019s provisions and lists a number of situations where outside storage of goods, materials, and equipment is legislatively declared as <em>not </em>to be included within the term \u201coutside storage.\u201d Thus, \u00a7 421 affords an individual reasonable notice as to what is and what is not prohibited by the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Moreover, \u00a7\u00a7 402, 412, and 1402 provide that the prohibition of \u201coutside storage\u201d would not extend to any \u201cgoods, materials, and equipment\u201d that would ordinarily be associated with permitted uses, as an \u201caccessory use,\u201d in other zoning districts. Section 1402(C) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-6\">Accessory uses. Any use customarily incidental or accessory to any of the above uses is permitted in this district when clearly established as an accessory use to a permitted use.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1C\">This language or similar language is included in every other zoning classification in the city\u2019s zoning ordinance. Accordingly, stock or inventory could be stored in the rear of Vaughn\u2019s premises because it is zoned Retail Commercial. Contrary to Vaughn\u2019s contention, a swing set would not be prohibited in the backyard of a residence, because swing sets are incidental to residential use. However, appliances, pieces of wood, pipes, and the other miscellaneous items located on Vaughn\u2019s property are not accessory to any permitted use of his property.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">Vaughn\u2019s argument overlooks the inclusive nature of the statutory scheme of the city\u2019s zoning ordinance, i.e., that only where exceptions are made within \u00a7 421 or where \u201coutside storage\u201d of other objects is made to fall outside the purview of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>\u00a7 421 via other sections in the ordinance, can such \u201cgoods, materials and equipment,\u201d be stored outside of one\u2019s premises. Put simply, the city\u2019s zoning ordinance prohibits the outside storage of anything except as otherwise stated within its sections. By negative inference, the statutory scheme creates a prohibition which allows the ordinance\u2019s primary purpose to be carried out without specifically enumerating every single item which the city did not want stored outside. Vaughn\u2019s argument, were it accepted, would put in doubt all similar zoning ordinances which are inclusive in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">Section 402 states that \u201c[n]o land shall be used except for a purpose permitted in the district in which such land is located.\u201d The ordinance makes clear that only uses specifically enumerated within a zoning district are permitted without a special use permit. The Supreme Court of Virginia has approved inclusive zoning ordinances which specify uses which are permitted in the respective zones and do not specify those uses which are prohibited therein. <em>Board of Supvrs. v. Gaffney, </em>244 Va. 545, 549-50, 422 S.E.2d 760, 763 (1992). Vaughn\u2019s property is not in a manufacturing zoning district. He has no special exception for the subject parcel and he has not argued that the goods stored on his property are \u201caccessory\u201d to a permitted use.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">In conclusion, we hold that \u00a7 421, taken as a whole and in conjunction with the language in the city\u2019s zoning ordinance, affords a reasonable degree of certainty and is not unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
