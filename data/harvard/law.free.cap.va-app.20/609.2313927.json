He contends on this appeal that (1) the child\u2019s refusal to respond to questions from his counsel was a denial of his Sixth Amendment right to cross-examine the child, and (2) the evidence was insufficient to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. For the reasons that follow, we affirm his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">The evidence proved that Crump lived with the child\u2019s mother in the same residence with the child and two of the child\u2019s siblings, one of whom was Crump\u2019s child. The child, who was eight years old at the time of the trial, testified that when she returned home from school on May 13, 1993, only Crump was at home. The child testified that Crump entered her bedroom, pulled down her underwear, and made her bend over a chair. He then pushed his \u201cprivate part\u201d into her \u201cprivate part.\u201d She testified that it hurt her and that she felt \u201c[w]et stuff\u2019 on her after Crump stopped. Crump went into the bathroom and later left the home. The child testified that she did her homework and waited for her mother. When her mother came home, the child told her what had happened. The child also testified that the next day Crump took her into the bathroom and told her to \u201c[t]ell ... that my uncle did it ____ [b]ehind the house.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">On cross-examination, the child again testified that Crump entered her bedroom, \u201cpulled [her] pants down,\u201d and \u201ctold [her] to bend over.\u201d When Crump\u2019s trial counsel asked what happened after this, the child did not answer his question. In response to further questioning, the child answered that she felt \u201c[w]et stuff running down my leg\u201d and said that Crump then \u201cstopped and went to the bathroom.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b657-9\">When the child would not elaborate upon \u201cexactly what happened after [she] bent over,\u201d Crump\u2019s trial counsel objected to the child\u2019s unresponsiveness and moved that her direct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>testimony be stricken. The trial judge denied the motion. On recross-examination, the child testified in response to defense counsel\u2019s further questioning that Crump \u201cput his private part on [her] private part,\u201d and she \u201cfelt wet stuff coming down [her] legs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">The mother testified that when she returned home on May 13 the child told her that Crump \u201cchild molested\u201d her. The mother bathed the child and noticed that her genitalia was \u201cred.\u201d She also observed that the child had \u201cwhite stuff\u2019 in her genital area and on her clothes. The mother testified that she angrily confronted Crump and began hitting him. Crump said nothing, slammed the door as he left, and went to his mother\u2019s house. When Crump returned the next day, the mother testified that she again confronted him. The mother also testified that she saw Crump and the child in the bathroom and heard him tell the child to say that the child\u2019s uncle did it.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">The evidence also proved that when the child first spoke to police about the incident, she reported that her uncle had raped her. The child\u2019s uncle was arrested and charged with rape. After investigation, the uncle was released and Crump was arrested. The mother testified that she did not inform the police of Crump\u2019s actions until two months after the child\u2019s complaint because she was afraid of Crump and believed he would kill her if she informed the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">The Confrontation Clause in the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States guarantees an accused the right to cross-examine witnesses in criminal proceedings. <em>Pointer v. Texas, </em>380 U.S. 400, 403-04, 85 S.Ct. 1065, 1068, 13 L.Ed.2d 923 (1965). Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution of Virginia also guarantees this right. <em>Moore v. Commonwealth, </em>202 Va. 667, 669, 119 S.E.2d 324, 327 (1961). Relying upon the decisions of the Supreme Court, this Court has stated that, \u201c \u2018[generally speaking, the Confrontation Clause guarantees an <em>opportunity </em>for effective cross-examination, not cross-ex-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>animation that is effective in whatever way, and to whatever extent, the defense might wish.\u2019 \u201d <em>Nichols v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 426, 429, 369 S.E.2d 218, 220 (1988) (quoting <em>Delaware v. Fensterer, </em>474 U.S. 15, 20, 106 S.Ct. 292, 294, 88 L.Ed.2d 15 (1985)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-5\">The Confrontation Clause includes no guarantee that every witness called by the prosecution will refrain from giving testimony that is marred by forgetfulness, confusion, or evasion. To the contrary, the Confrontation Clause is generally satisfied when the defense is given a full and fair opportunity to probe and expose these infirmities through cross-examination, thereby calling to the attention of the factfinder the reasons for giving scant weight to the witness\u2019 testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-6\"><em>Fensterer, </em>474 U.S. at 21-22, 106 S.Ct. at 295.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">On appeal, Crump\u2019s counsel concedes that Crump\u2019s trial counsel was given the opportunity to cross-examine the child. Crump contends that his right to confront the child in cross-examination was denied, however, \u201cbecause his efforts to address material issues introduced in direct examination were thwarted by the [child\u2019s] refusal to answer questions put to her during cross-examination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">The transcript of the child\u2019s testimony reveals that throughout direct and cross examinations the child frequently moved her head in response to questioning. Neither the prosecutor nor defense counsel sought a verbal response on the many occasions when, as the transcript indicates, the child \u201cnods head in affirmative\u201d or \u201cshakes head in negative.\u201d For example, the child testified on cross-examination as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-9\">Q Okay. Well, now, tell me the truth about what happened. Who was it that touched your privates?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-10\">A Jonathan [Crump].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-11\">Q Okay. Who told you to say that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-12\">A Nobody,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-13\">Q Nobody told you to say it was Jonathan [Crump]? Nobody told you to say it was Jonathan [Crump]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>A No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-6\">Q Now, when did you tell somebody that Jonathan [Crump] did it? Okay, the day this happened, okay, let\u2019s go back to that for a minute. Who did you tell? Did you tell anybody the day it happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-7\">A (Witness nods head in affirmative.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-8\">Q Who did you tell?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-9\">A My mama.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-10\">Q Okay, and what did she do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-11\">A Wait until the next day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-12\">Q She waited until the next day and then what did she do? Did she call the police?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-13\">A (Witness shakes head in negative.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-14\">Q How long was it before [your mother] called the police? A She didn\u2019t call them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-15\">Q She didn\u2019t call the police, okay. Did you tell her that Uncle Willie did this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-16\">A (Witness shakes head in negative.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-17\">Q You told her Jonathan [Crump] did it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-18\">A (Witness nods head in affirmative.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-19\">Q Why did you do that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-20\">A Because he did it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-21\">Although trial counsel may not have elicited the answers that he was seeking, the transcript reflects that the child was thoroughly cross-examined and substantially responded to trial counsel\u2019s questions. Crump\u2019s claim of deprivation relies in large measure upon the child\u2019s initial failure to respond to his trial counsel\u2019s attempt to have her repeat the testimony she gave on direct examination concerning the actual penetration. In particular, she balked when questioned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-22\">Q Come on, you can do it. What happened after he asked you to bend over, told you to bend over? Do you remember what happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-23\">A (Witness nods head in affirmative.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>Q Well, then, spit it out and tell us. Come on, ... we\u2019re almost done. Just tell us what happened. I need to hear it from you, you can tell me what happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-5\">... you were doing good there for a while. Like I said, we\u2019re almost done here. Just tell me what happened at that point after he told you to bend over.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-6\">Okay, I\u2019ll come back to it in a minute. Let me go to the day when Jonathan [Crump] hit you, okay. Do you remember that one clearly?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-7\">A (Witness nods head in affirmative.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-8\">Q You\u2019re sure?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-9\">A (Witness nods head in affirmative.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-11\">Q Okay. Now, back to your favorite subject again, back to the day after school when he came in your bedroom and he told you to bend over. Tell me what happened after that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-12\">Are you going to answer me? If I stay here until darkness falls and you all get hungry, are you going to answer me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-13\">THE JUDGE: ..., you understand what Mr. Morrison is asking you, so tell us what happened after he told you to bend over. Do you understand?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-14\">A (Nods head in the affirmative.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-15\">THE JUDGE: Do you know what happened after he told you to do that? Do you know what happened. You do, don\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-16\">A (Nods head in the affirmative.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-18\">THE JUDGE: You couldn\u2019t see him. What did you feel? A Wet stuff running down my leg.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-19\">THE JUDGE: Proceed....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-20\">Q Can you tell me? You must like the Judge* a lot better than me. Can you tell me what happened? Now, you say after you bent over, then a little while later you felt wet stuff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>A (Witness nods head in affirmative.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-5\">Q Now, start from when he had you bend over and tell me what happened through the wet stuff and afterwards.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-6\">A He stopped and went to the bathroom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-7\">Q I didn\u2019t catch that, say it again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-8\">A He stopped and went in the bathroom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-9\">Q That was afterwards?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-10\">A (Witness nods head in affirmative.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-11\">Q What happened before then?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-12\">When the child failed to respond to the last question, trial counsel moved to strike her testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-13\">We conclude that the trial judge did not err in refusing to strike the testimony. When the child failed to respond, she had been extensively and repetitively questioned by two lawyers and the judge. She was only eight years of age. \u201c[W]here a witness refuses to answer only one or a few questions on cross-examination, the right to confrontation is not necessarily violated.\u201d <em>Nichols, </em>6 Va.App. at 430, 369 S.E.2d at 220. Moreover, although the transcript obviously does not reflect the tone in which questions were asked, the transcript does suggest that the child was being questioned in a manner that did not reflect a sensitivity for her age. Her responsiveness could not have been enhanced by being told to \u201cspit it out,\u201d to go \u201cback to your favorite subject again,\u201d or \u201cyou must like the judge a lot better than me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b662-14\">Furthermore, the child made the following responses on recross-examination by Crump\u2019s trial counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-15\">Q When Jonathan [Crump] told you to bend over, you -remember that part, right, you told us about that earlier, what happened right after that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-16\">A He put his private part on my private part.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-17\">Q He put his private part on your private part?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-18\">A (Witness nods head in affirmative.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-19\">Q Okay. Now, did you look at him when he did this or were you looking away from him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-20\">A I won\u2019t looking at him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>Q Okay. Now, how do you know it was his private part?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-5\">Can you tell me that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-6\">A No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-7\">Q What happened when he put his private part in your</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-8\">private part, what happened next?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-9\">A I felt wet stuff coming down my legs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b663-10\">The record clearly establishes that Crump was afforded a full opportunity to conduct an effective cross-examination and that the child substantially responded to the questioning. Upon this record, we do not know what information he was trying to elicit from the child that he did not elicit. Thus, the trial judge did not err in refusing to strike the child\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-12\">\u201c[T]he Due Process Clause protects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which [the accused] is charged.\u201d <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 364, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 1073, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970). Thus, when the question of the sufficiency of the evidence is raised on appellate review, we must determine whether a reasonable fact finder could have found from the evidence before it that guilt had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Furthermore, when reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting all reasonable inferences fairly deducible from the evidence. <em>Higginbotham v. Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 349, 352, 218 S.E.2d 534, 537 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-13\">Crump argues that the evidence in its totality was inherently incredible. He contends that the child\u2019s testimony that he urged her to blame her uncle was contradictory and, therefore, unreliable. In support of this contention, he notes that the evidence established that when the rape was reported, the child initially named her uncle as the perpetrator. Crump also contends that significant portions of the evidence were contrary to human experience. In particular, he points <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>to the child\u2019s testimony that Crump never spoke to her during the act, that she began doing her homework following the incident, and that she did not try to run away and call anyone. Crump also notes that the evidence shows that the child and her mother continued to live in the house with him for over two months before the crime was reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">In addition, Crump contends that the mother\u2019s testimony fails to corroborate the child\u2019s testimony and only serves to render it more incredible. He argues that the mother\u2019s testimony that the child used the phrase, \u201cchild molested,\u201d was unbelievable. Crump also argues the mother\u2019s reasons for waiting two months to report the rape and her inaction when the child\u2019s uncle was charged for the crime rendered her testimony incredible.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">The child\u2019s testimony established beyond a reasonable doubt the facts necessary to uphold the conviction. The child testified with apparent difficulty but without contradiction that Crump raped her. The child testified that she was penetrated and that she experienced pain. She also described manifestations of sexual intercourse. \u201c[T]he child\u2019s testimony alone, if believed by the [trier of fact], was sufficient to support [Crump\u2019s] conviction, even in the absence of corroborating physical or testimonial evidence.\u201d <em>Love v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 84, 90, 441 S.E.2d 709, 713 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">The mother\u2019s testimony, however, corroborates parts of the child\u2019s account. The mother\u2019s testimony concerning the child\u2019s use of the term \u201cchild molested,\u201d the mother\u2019s failure to earlier report the incident, and the mother\u2019s response to the uncle\u2019s arrest were all matters that affected her credibility. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number><em>Gray v. Commonwealth, </em>233 Va. 313, 344, 356 S.E.2d 157, 174, <em>cert. denied, </em>484 U.S. 873, 108 S.Ct. 207, 98 L.Ed.2d 158 (1987).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>It is [the fact finder\u2019s] function to judge the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of their evidence. The [fact finder] has the opportunity to observe the witnesses\u2019 demeanor while testifying, to consider their interest in the outcome of the case, and to determine from all the circumstances of the case which witnesses are more believable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>The inconsistencies in the child\u2019s testimony and the mother\u2019s testimony are not such as to render the evidence incredible as a matter of law. The child consistently testified to the facts which establish the crime, and the trial judge believed her testimony. <em>See Pugliese v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 82, 92, 428 S.E.2d 16, 24 (1993). Furthermore, we cannot say that the child\u2019s account of Crump\u2019s behavior or her response to that behavior presented an account of events contrary to human experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">For these reasons we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
