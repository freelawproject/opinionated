The sole issue presented by this appeal is whether the trial court erred when it denied appellant\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence of the cocaine found in her possession at the time of her arrest. Finding no error, we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-11\">In an appeal of a trial court\u2019s ruling on a suppression issue, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party below. <em>Miller v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>977, 979, 434 S.E.2d 897, 899 (1993). We will not disturb a trial court\u2019s refusal to suppress evidence seized in a warrant-less search unless the holding is plainly wrong or unsupported by the evidence. <em>Commonwealth v. Grimstead, </em>12 Va.App. 1066, 1067, 407 S.E.2d 47, 48 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">A reliable informant, whose prior tips had resulted in arrests and convictions of persons for unlawful cocaine transactions, telephoned Special Investigations Unit Virginia Beach Detective John Tosloskie (Tosloskie) and told him that the informant had been in appellant\u2019s apartment and was told by an unnamed occupant of that apartment that appellant was \u201cmaking the rounds\u201d delivering cocaine from a Bronco truck, bearing Virginia license plate number \u201cCHUXX.\u201d In the past, the informant had provided Tosloskie with tips that resulted in arrests and convictions. Some of these tips were based not upon the informant\u2019s personal knowledge but upon information that the informant had received from others. The informant also advised Tosloskie that appellant would be accompanied by a black male known as \u201cJunie\u201d who was 5'5\" tall and weighed 150 pounds. Tosloskie knew \u201cJunie\u201d as Thomas Lee White (Junie) through having previously arrested him for possessing a firearm after having been convicted of a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">Approximately 30 to 40 minutes after Tosloskie received this information from the informant, he saw the Bronco truck with the license plates \u201cCHUXX.\u201d Tosloskie stopped the truck, which was occupied by appellant, Junie, and Hattie Beale. Junie was arrested for driving without a driver\u2019s license, and a search of his person incident to that arrest produced a small quantity of marijuana. Tosloskie told appellant that he suspected she was in possession of cocaine. He asked her to step out of the truck and asked her permission to search her person for drugs. She consented, and crack cocaine was found in a plastic Ziploc baggie tucked into the waistband of her pants. She was also in possession of drug paraphernalia and additional quantities of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">Prior to making the stop, Tosloskie had confirmed that appellant was in the area indicated by the informant and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>traveling in a Bronco bearing license number \u201cCHUXX,\u201d accompanied by a person (Junie) meeting the description given by the informant, and bearing a name known by Tosloskie as someone he previously had arrested. Thus, prior to the stop, Tosloskie had confirmed a substantial part of the information given by the informant that had been received from an unnamed person. The suspect was traveling in a motor vehicle and there was no time to procure a warrant.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-5\">The [United States] Supreme Court has held that when a police officer verifies innocent facts which have been furnished by an anonymous informer, verification is a factor that may be considered in determining whether the officer had reasonable suspicion to warrant a temporary stop and inquiry of the suspect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-6\"><em>Boyd v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 179, 189, 402 S.E.2d 914, 920 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">Evidence in the record supports the following finding made by the trial court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-8\">[W]e got information coming from an unknown person that is verified to a certain extent. This unknown person tells the police that someone is holding drugs, and they are riding in a certain type of vehicle with a certain license plate and with a certain individual. Police verify that there is a vehicle on the road that fits the description with that license plate and it does have this Junie in it, so they have verified three of the things that have been said by this unknown person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">Tosloskie also testified that, in the past, the informant had given Tosloskie information that had been given to the informant by an anonymous person, which had led to arrests and convictions of persons unlawfully engaged in drug transactions. For that reason, Tosloskie had reason to believe the informant\u2019s tip in this case would prove reliable. It is clear that the informants, known and anonymous, provided Tosloskie with predictive information that he was able to corroborate.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>In a case bearing remarkable similarity to the one before us, United States Supreme Court Justice White said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-5\">When significant aspects of the caller\u2019s predictions were verified, there was reason to believe not only that the caller was honest but also that he was well informed, at least well enough to justify the stop.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-6\">Although it is a close case, we conclude that under the totality of the circumstances the anonymous tip, as corroborated, exhibited sufficient indicia of reliability to justify the investigatory stop of respondent\u2019s car.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-7\"><em>Alabama v. White, </em>496 U.S. 325, 332, 110 S.Ct. 2412, 2417, 110 L.Ed.2d 301 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">For the reasons stated, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b590-10\">BENTON, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ApY\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-11\">Only if an anonymous \u201ctip\u201d contains sufficient quality and quantity of detail to overcome the inherent unreliability that flows from the anonymity of its source does the \u201ctip\u201d rise to the level of reasonable, articulable suspicion, the standard required to conduct a <em>Terry </em>stop. <em>Beckner v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 533, 536-37, 425 S.E.2d 530, 532-33 (1993). When, as in this case, an informant relays to the police information from another unidentified person, the source of the \u201ctip\u201d is anonymous and has no inherent reliability. \u201c\u2018It simply \u201cmakes no sense to require some indicia of reliability that the informant is <em>personally </em>reliable but nothing at all concerning the <em>source </em>of his information.\u2019\u201d\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 533, 536-37, 425 S.E.2d at 532.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-12\">\u201cAn important element in establishing the reliability of an anonymous tip is the predictive nature of the information.\u201d <em>Hardy v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va.App. 433, 435, 399 S.E.2d 27, 28 (1990). The Supreme Court of the United States, in \u201ca close case,\u201d <em>Alabama v. White, </em>496 U.S. 325, 332, 110 S.Ct. 2412, 2417, 110 L.Ed.2d 301 (1990), concluded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>[T]he independent corroboration by the police of <em>significant aspects of the informer\u2019s predictions </em>imparted some degree of reliability to the other allegations made by the caller.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-5\">[It is] also important that, as in <em>[Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983)], \u201cthe anonymous [tip] contained a range of details relating not just to easily obtained facts and conditions existing at the time of the tip, but to <em>future actions </em>of third parties ordinarily not easily predicted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-6\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">The \u201ctip\u201d that the police received regarding O\u2019Toole was not of a quality that would have imparted an intrinsic belief that the anonymous source was operating upon a basis of knowledge and not a hunch. Nothing contained in the tip allowed the trial judge to conclude that the anonymous source had \u201cinside information [or] a special familiarity\u201d with O\u2019Toole\u2019s activities or affairs. <em>Id. </em>The fact that the police saw a vehicle that matched the description given by the anonymous source means only that the police verified \u201ceasily obtained facts and conditions existing at the time of the tip.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Indeed, anyone who had seen O\u2019Toole \u201ccould have \u2018predicted\u2019 [those] fact[s] because [they were] a condition presumably existing at the time of the call.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, the mere fact that O\u2019Toole was in the vehicle did not verify the uncorroborated statement that O\u2019Toole was making rounds to deliver cocaine. <em>See Hardy, </em>11 Va.App. at 435, 399 S.E.2d at 28 (seeing a person is not verification that a person is carrying an object). <em>See also Carter v. Commonwealth, </em>9 Va.App. 310, 387 S.E.2d 505 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">In <em>White, </em>the police were told the current location of the suspect, the time of the suspect\u2019s intended departure, the vehicle the suspect intended to use, the suspect\u2019s intended destination, and the description of the valise in which the suspect would be carrying cocaine. 496 U.S. at 327, 110 S.Ct. at 2414-15. In this case, the anonymous tipster gave neither a time nor a specific destination for O\u2019Toole\u2019s activities. The \u201ctip\u201d only indicated that she would be \u201cmaking the rounds.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>Thus, the critical deficiency in this case, and the significant factor which distinguishes this case from <em>White, </em>is the lack of facts predicting future behavior which would indicate \u201ca special familiarity\u201d with O\u2019Toole\u2019s affairs. <em>Id. </em>at 332, 110 S.Ct. at 2417. <em>See also State v. Bullington, </em>165 Ariz. 11, 795 P.2d 1294, 1297 (Ct.App.1990); <em>Brown v. U.S., </em>590 A.2d 1008, 1023-24 (D.C.1991); <em>Commonwealth v. Lyons, </em>409 Mass. 16, 564 N.E.2d 390, 393 (1990); <em>State v. Bedolla, </em>111 N.M. 448, 806 P.2d 588, 592 (Ct.App.), <em>cert. denied, </em>111 N.M. 416, 806 P.2d 65 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">The facts relied upon when the police made the stop were not qualitatively more than an \u201cinchoate and unparticularized suspicion or \u2018hunch.\u2019 \u201d <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 27, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 1883, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-6\">If a hunch is not enough for a police officer to effectuate a stop, it follows that the hunch of an unnamed informant, albeit an informant with some indicia of personal reliability, is also not sufficient. The fact that the informant\u2019s hunch is conveyed to the police officer does not raise the hunch to the level of reasonable suspicion. \u201cManifestly, this conduct falls below activity necessary to justify a reasonable suspicion that a violation of law had occurred or was occurring.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AAv\"><em>Beckner, </em>15 Va.App. at 537, 425 S.E.2d at 533 (quoting <em>Zimerman v. Commonwealth, </em>234 Va. 609, 612, 363 S.E.2d 708, 710 (1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">Because the tip \u201cfalls short of providing the \u2018minimal level of objective justification\u2019 \u201d required to conduct a <em>Terry </em>stop, <em>Brown, </em>590 A.2d at 1023, I would hold that the trial judge erred in refusing to suppress the evidence. I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
