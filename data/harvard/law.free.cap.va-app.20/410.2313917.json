Appellant contends: (1) an habitual offender who is granted a restricted privilege to drive pursuant to Code \u00a7 46.2-360(2) does not remain an habitual offender subject to prosecution under Code \u00a7 46.2-357 for driving in violation of the restrictions; and (2) there was insufficient evidence to prove that appellant\u2019s driving \u201cof itself\u2019 endangered the life, limb, or property of another in violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-357(B)(2). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>Because the trial court committed no error, we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">On January 9, 1989, appellant was declared an habitual offender by the Circuit Court of Northampton County, pursuant to Code \u00a7 46.2-351 (formerly Code \u00a7 46.1-387.2). As a result, appellant\u2019s driving privileges were revoked for ten years. In 1992, appellant petitioned the same court for restoration of his driving privileges pursuant to Code \u00a7 46.2-360. The court entered an order on September 18,1992, specifically finding that appellant met the criteria of Code \u00a7 46.2-360(2). Pursuant to this section, the court determined that appellant no longer constituted a safety threat to himself and others with regard to the driving of a motor vehicle. The court thereafter allowed appellant to operate a vehicle to and from his place of employment and to and from the mandatory Virginia Alcohol Safety Action Program (ASAP).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">On April 22, 1993, Virginia State Trooper Alan Gladden observed appellant\u2019s vehicle parked at a restaurant at approximately 11:15 p.m. Gladden knew not only appellant\u2019s status as an habitual offender but also the restrictions on appellant\u2019s driving privileges. After Gladden observed appellant leave the restaurant and enter his car, he followed appellant for approximately one mile. Gladden testified that appellant weaved within his lane of travel and over the left line of the lane. Because he suspected appellant of driving under the influence of alcohol, Gladden pulled appellant\u2019s vehicle over to the roadside and administered field sobriety tests. Gladden also administered a blood alcohol test, which revealed that appellant was driving with a blood alcohol level of .14. Appellant was arrested at 11:47 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">Appellant was indicted upon a charge of operating a motor vehicle after having been declared an habitual offender in violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-357. He was also charged with operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-266. A jury trial held on November 15, 1993 resulted in a mistrial on the charge of driving under the influence, but resulted in a felony conviction on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>habitual offender charge of Code \u00a7 46.2-357. Appellant was sentenced to twelve months in jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">HABITUAL OFFENDER STATUS</p>\n<p id=\"AqN\">The facts show that appellant was an habitual offender as defined in Code \u00a7 46.2-351 and that his driving privileges had been revoked for a period of ten years. Despite his status, the trial court, on September 18, 1992, entered an order finding that appellant met the criteria of Code \u00a7 46.2-360(2)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and allowed appellant to operate a vehicle for limited purposes on a restricted license<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in accordance with the procedures of Code \u00a7 18.2-271.RE). As Code \u00a7 46.2-360(2) states, \u201c[a]ny violation of the restrictions shall be reported to the court, and the court may then modify the restrictions or revoke the license.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">We affirm the trial court\u2019s ruling that the Commonwealth properly charged appellant with a felony violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-357(B)(2) after arresting him for driving while intoxicated on April 22, 1993. According to Code \u00a7 46.2-357, it is unlawful for an habitual offender to drive a motor vehicle \u201cwhile the order of the court prohibiting such operation remains in effect.\u201d An habitual offender who is found operating a vehicle on the Commonwealth\u2019s roadways shall be guilty of either a misdemeanor or a felony. A <em>misdemeanor </em>charge is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>appropriate where the habitual offender\u2019s driving, \u201cdoes <em>not, </em>of itself, endanger the life, limb, or property of another.\u201d Code \u00a7 46.2-357(B)(l) (emphasis added). On the other hand, the habitual offender may be charged with a <em>felony </em>if his or her driving, \u201cof itself, <em>does </em>endanger the life, limb, or property of another.\u201d Code \u00a7 46.2-357(B)(2) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">In reaching' our conclusion, we reject two contentions proposed by appellant. First, we do not believe that because the trial court found that appellant no longer constituted a threat to himself or others with regard to operating a motor vehicle, appellant was no longer an habitual offender. Code \u00a7 46.2-360(2) specifically states that any violation of driving privileges may lead to a modification of the court order or a subsequent revocation of the habitual offender\u2019s driver\u2019s license. The continuing authority of the court to modify or revoke the license belies appellant\u2019s assertion that his adjudication as an habitual offender was no longer valid. As the Commonwealth contends, the trial court granted a restricted license under subsection (2) of Code \u00a7 46.2-360, not subsection (1), the subsection granting a full restoration of driving privileges. Appell\u00e1nt\u2019s status as an habitual offender continued despite his limited driving privileges, and he was properly charged under Code \u00a7 46.2-357 because he operated a motor vehicle during times not authorized by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Second, we reject appellant\u2019s assertion that prosecution for a violation of his driving privileges must be pursuant to Code \u00a7 46.2-301, an alternate section, dealing with unlicensed driving, which provides for a misdemeanor conviction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>instead of a felony conviction. Appellant contends that Code \u00a7 46.2-360(2), the section allowing the grant of a restricted license, states that a restricted license is issued pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-271.1(E), which in turn provides that \u201c[a]ny person who operates a motor vehicle in violation of any restrictions imposed pursuant to this section shall be guilty of a violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-301,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which is a Class 2 <em>misdemeanor.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">While Code \u00a7 46.2-360(2) references Code \u00a7 18.2-271.1, this reference is for the limited purpose of using the latter\u2019s procedures for <em>issuing </em>a restricted permit, not for using its punishment provisions, which are part of the Code sections dealing with DUI offenders, not habitual offenders.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In our view, appellant was violating restrictions imposed pursuant to Code \u00a7\u00a7 46.2-360 and 46.2-357, not Code \u00a7 18.2-271.1. \u201c[W]hen one statute speaks to a subject in a general way and another deals with a part of the same subject in a more specific manner, the two should be harmonized, if possible, <em>and where they conflict, the latter 'prevails.\u201d Virginia Nat'l Bank v. Harris, </em>220 Va. 336, 340, 257 S.E.2d 867, 870 (1979) (emphasis added); <em>see also Penton v. City of Norfolk, </em>16 Va.App. 141, 428 S.E.2d 309 (1993). Thus, the punishment provisions of Code \u00a7 18.2-272 are superseded by provisions directly related to cases involving habitual offenders\u2014the provisions contained in Code \u00a7 46.2-357 under which appellant was charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"AcX\">We also hold that sufficient evidence proved that appellant was driving in violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-357(B)(2). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>standard for appellate review of criminal convictions is well-established. \u201cWhen a defendant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence, we are required to review the evidence \u2018in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth and give it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u2019 \u201d <em>Collins v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 177, 179, 409 S.E.2d 175, 176 (1991) (quoting <em>Higginbotham v. Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 349, 352, 218 S.E.2d 534, 537 (1975)). \u201cThe conviction will not be reversed unless it is plainly wrong or -without evidence to support it.\u201d <em>Id.; see </em>Code \u00a7 8.01-680.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">The evidence shows that Trooper Gladden, who was following appellant in a police car, observed appellant weaving within his lane of traffic and even \u201cover the left line.\u201d As we recently stated in <em>Bishop v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 206, 211, 455 S.E.2d 765, 767 (1995):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-6\">The distinction between negligent driving and reckless driving is the critical element in determining punishment under Code \u00a7 46.2-357. In defining the conduct that gives rise to felony punishment under Code \u00a7 46.2-357(B)(2), the legislature used the phrase, \u201cdriving [that] ... endanger[s] the life, limb, or property of another,\u201d language virtually identical to that found in the statute defining reckless driving. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 46.2-852 (\u201cdriving ... at a speed or in a manner so as to endanger the life, limb, or property of any person shall be ... reckless driving.\u201d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">Because appellant was weaving within his own lane and into the other lane, the circumstances support a finding that his driving \u201cof itself ... endangered] the life, limb, or property of another.\u201d Code \u00a7 46.2-357(B)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">The facts of this case are unlike <em>Bishop, </em>where <em>no </em>evidence proved that the actual manner in which Bishop drove his vehicle endangered the life, limb, or property of another. In <em>Bishop, </em>this Court held that the driver\u2019s intoxication does not constitute <em>per se </em>proof that the driver endangered life, limb, or property, and \u201cthe inference drawn solely from Bishop\u2019s intoxication, <em>without more, </em>was insufficient to support imposition of felony punishment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 210, 455 S.E.2d at 766. In this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>case, sufficient evidence proved that appellant\u2019s driving was dangerous to the life, limb, or property of another.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">For these reasons, we affirm appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b460-8\">. This statutory section states that a court may grant an habitual offender a restricted driving permit if the court is satisfied that (1)' at the time of the previous convictions, the offender was addicted to or psychologically dependent on the use of alcohol or other drugs; (2) at the time of the hearing on the petition the offender is no longer addicted to or psychologically dependent on the use of alcohol or other drugs; and (3) the offender does not constitute a threat to the safety and welfare of himself and others with regard to the driving of a motor vehicle.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b460-9\">. The limited privileges granted in this case conform to the privileges enumerated in Code \u00a7 18.2-271.1(E), which include limited privileges such as driving to and from work and to and from an alcohol treatment program. Code \u00a7 46.2-360 also gives a court the option of restoring <em>full </em>driving privileges to an habitual offender. Code \u00a7 46.2-360(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b461-7\">. Code \u00a7 46.2-357(B)(2) added the language \"If such driving, of itself, does endanger the life, limb, or property of another, such person shall be guilty of a felony\u201d effective July of 1993. Before this time, there was no misdemeanor-felony classification; a violation of this section resulted in a felony conviction.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-8\">This amended section became effective over two months <em>after </em>the offense was committed but before appellant went to trial. However, the issue over which version of the statute to proceed under was not preserved on appeal, nor does it appear in the parties\u2019 briefs. It appears from the Commonwealth\u2019s brief that the Commonwealth acquiesced in proceeding under the 1993 amended version.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b462-8\">. This section was amended in July 1993 and substituted \"Code \u00a7 18.2-272\u201d for Code \u00a7 46.2-301.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b462-9\">. Furthermore, Code \u00a7 18.2-271.1 states, if the offender \"operates a motor vehicle in violation of any of the restrictions <em>imposed pursuant to this section,\" </em>he or she shall be guilty of violating Code \u00a7 46.2-301 (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
