The court suspended forty-seven years of these sentences on several conditions, including restitution of $27,000 to the Circuit Court of Hanover County and $23,000 to the victim of the offenses and supervised probation for an unspecified term. The court further ordered that defendant pay court costs of $1,611.50.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">On November 25, 1992, the Commonwealth moved the trial court to order the \u201cjudgment\u201d for restitution and court costs docketed in the \u201cJudgement [sic] Book of Hanover County.\u201d Following an <em>ore terms </em>hearing on January 27,1993, the court granted the motion with respect to the restitution and \u201c[o]rdered, as provided in ... Code \u00a7 8.01-446, and ... \u00a7 19.2-305.2(B), that restitution ... be docketed in the Judgment Book of the Hanover Circuit Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">On appeal, defendant contends that docketing of the restitution as a \u201cjudgment against a person has serious adverse consequences for that person\u201d which \u201cchanged the terms and conditions of the restitution obligation specified in the sentencing order\u201d in violation of Rule Iff.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendant also complains that the disputed order was not docketed \u201cwithout delay\u201d in accordance with Code \u00a7 8.01-446. Finding no error, we affirm the disputed order.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">In imposing sentence for a criminal offense, trial courts are vested with \u201c \u2018wide latitude\u2019 and much \u2018discretion in matters of suspension and probation ... to provide a remedial tool ... in the rehabilitation\u2019 \u201d of offenders. <em>Deal v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 157, 160, 421 S.E.2d 897, 899 (1992) (citations omitted). The court may \u201csuspend the sentence in whole or part,\u201d \u201csuspend [its] imposition,\u201d and \u201cin addition ... place the accused on probation,\u201d subject to specified \u201cconditions.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-303. \u201cAmong such conditions, restitution for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>\u2018damages or loss\u2019 caused by the offense\u201d is a well established sentencing component, intended to benefit both offender and victim. <em>Deal, </em>15 Va.App. at 160, 421 S.E.2d at 899; <em>see </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-303, -305, -305.1, -305.2. Sentencing statutes must be liberally construed, <em>Deal, </em>15 Va.App. at 160, 421 S.E.2d at 899, and those \u201cdealing with restitution ... \u2018should be read, construed and applied together\u2019 \u201d to promote their intended purposes. <em>Alger v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 252, 256, 450 S.E.2d 765, 767 (1994) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">Code \u00a7 19.2-305.1(A) provides, <em>inter alia, </em>that \u201cno person convicted of a crime, ... which resulted in property ... loss, shall be placed on probation or have his sentence suspended unless such person shall make at least partial restitution for such ... loss.\u201d The \u201camount [of restitution] to be repaid by the defendant and the terms and conditions thereof\u2019 shall be determined by the court \u201c[a]t the time of sentencing\u201d and specified in the \u201cjudgment order.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-305.1(0; <em>see Russnak v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 317, 321-22, 392 S.E.2d 491, 493 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">\u201cAn order of restitution may be docketed as provided in \u00a7 8.01-446 when so ordered by the court or upon written request of the victim and may be enforced by a victim named in the order to receive the restitution in the same manner as a judgment in a civil action.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-305.2(B). Code \u00a7 8.01-446 prescribes, in pertinent part, that \u201c[t]he clerk of each court of every circuit ... shall docket <em>without delay, </em>any judgment for money rendered in his court\u201d in \u00e1 \u201cjudgment docket\u201d book established and maintained for that purpose. (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">Defendant urges that we view an order of restitution pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-305.1 apart from a related, dependent order under Code \u00a7 19.2-305.2(B), which provides for docketing and enforcement of the award. When considered in this perspective, she argues that the later order adding enforcement remedies to the original restitution order modified the sentence by enhancing the punishment. However, this construction would subvert the salutary purposes of rehabilita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>tion for defendant and recovery for the victim. Clearly, collection through enforcement is inherent in an order of restitution for the right to have any remedy, and, to that end, Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-305.1, -305.2(B), and 8.01-446<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> must be read and considered together. <em>See Alger, </em>19 Va.App. at 256, 450 S.E.2d at 767. Thus, any additional burden on defendant attendant to enforcement was obviously contemplated by the legislature when it enacted these companion statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">Defendant also complains that the docketing order failed to comply with Code \u00a7 8.01-446, which requires that judgments \u201cshall [be] docket[ed] without delay.\u201d However, defendant misunderstands the statutory scheme. Code \u00a7 19.2-305.2 authorizes the trial court to order the restitution order \u201cdocketed as provided in \u00a7 8.01-446 ... in the same manner as a judgment in a civil action.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-305.2. Code \u00a7 8.01-446 directs the clerk of each circuit court to \u201cdocket, without delay, any judgment for money rendered in his court\u201d in a \u201cjudgment docket\u201d book \u201cmaintained for that purpose.\u201d Thus, the promptness directed by Code \u00a7 8.01-446 does not relate to entry of the docketing order by the court, but, rather, to the clerk\u2019s responsibility to comply.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">Because the record here does not reflect the time that the clerk actually docketed the restitution order, we are unable to review compliance with Code \u00a7 8.01-446. <em>See Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 630, 635, 432 S.E.2d 2, 6 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">Finally, defendant argues that court costs were also improperly subject of the docketing order. However, a review of the order discloses no mention of court costs and, therefore, this is not an issue before the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">Accordingly, we affirm the docketing order of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b767-8\">. Rule 1:1 states, in pertinent part, that \"[a]ll final judgments, orders, and decrees, irrespective of terms of court, shall remain under the control of the trial court and subject to be modified, vacated, or suspended for twenty-one days after the date of entry, and no longer.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b769-10\">. Code \u00a7 8.01-446 was amended during the 1995 session of the General Assembly to expressly address an \"order of restitution docketed pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-305.2.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b770-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>BENTON, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Aue\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">The narrow issue presented by this appeal is whether the trial judge had jurisdiction to enter an order allowing the docketing of a judgment for restitution. The record establishes that when the trial judge entered an order permitting docketing of the final order pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-305.2(B), more than twenty-one days had elapsed after entry of the final order. I would hold that Rule 1:1 did not bar entry of the order docketing the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">\u201cAfter the expiration of 21 days from the entry of a judgment, the court rendering the judgment loses jurisdiction of the case, and, absent a perfected appeal, the judgment is final and conclusive.\u201d <em>Rook v. Rook, </em>233 Va. 92, 95, 353 S.E.2d 756, 758 (1987). Notwithstanding that general rule, the Supreme Court has recently held that \u201cRule 1:1 does not preclude the entry of an order ... [that] does not alter the substantive provisions of [a] final judgment\u201d and that merely aids in the execution of the final judgment. <em>Davidson v. Commonwealth, </em>246 Va. 168, 171, 432 S.E.2d 178, 179-80 (1993). Even though a final order has been entered, a judge of the court rendering that judgment \u201c \u2018may still enter such decrees and orders as may be necessary to carry the decree into execution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Leggett v. Caudill, 247 </em>Va. 130, 133, 439 S.E.2d 350, 351 (1994) (quoting <em>Lee v. Lee, </em>142 Va. 244, 250, 128 S.E. 524, 526 (1925)). The order that is at issue in this case was not a modification of a substantive provision of the final order; it merely aided' execution of the final order. Accordingly, I concur in the judgment affirming the order of the trial judge.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
