Rawlings appeals a decision of the circuit court reducing the child support obligation of her former husband, Philip W. Rawlings, during the pendency of his participation in a legal union strike against his employer. Mrs. Rawlings asserts that Mr. Rawlings\u2019 voluntary participation in the strike constituted voluntary underemployment and, thus, was not a ground for finding a material change in circumstances warranting a reduction in child support. She further asserts that if a modification review was warranted, the chancellor should have imputed income to Mr. Rawlings based upon his pre-strike wages. This appeal presents issues of first impression in this Commonwealth. Under the specific facts of this case and for the following reasons, we affirm the chancellor\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>The parties had divorced following a marriage which produced one child not emancipated at the time of the dissolution of the marriage. On December 8, 1993, Mr. Rawlings was ordered to pay three hundred forty-eight dollars and fifty-four cents ($348.54) in monthly child support to Mrs. Rawlings. The child was then aged sixteen years, seven months.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">At the time of the parties\u2019 marriage and at all times thereafter, Mr. Rawlings was employed by Aerofin Corporation where he is a member of an AFL-CIO affiliated trade union. On or before March 12, 1994, members of the union, including Mr. Rawlings, voted to undertake an approved strike. Mr. Rawlings received strike pay and worked temporary jobs during the course of the strike, but nonetheless suffered a significant reduction in income.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">While continuing to attempt to pay the required child support payments to the best of his ability, Mr. Rawlings petitioned the appropriate juvenile and domestic relations district court for a reduction in child support based upon his change in income. The petition was denied and Mr. Rawlings appealed to the circuit court. Following an <em>ore terms </em>hearing, the chancellor determined that Mr. Rawlings\u2019 participation in the strike did not constitute voluntary underemployment. The chancellor stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-7\">... [Mr. Rawlings\u2019] family began in ... [the] early seventies as a union family. At the time of ... the divorce it was still a union family, [Mr. Rawlings] has a ninth grade education. He\u2019s been a member of the union. That has certain duties and obligations just like employment does. Had he been a recent member, had most of the union ignored the union vote, gone back across the line, that would be one situation, but here this union doesn\u2019t strike much. It\u2019s the only strike since the opening of the plant. He\u2019s been a member of [the union]. The family has benefitted from the fact that he\u2019s been in the union. So I think he does deserve a reduction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>I understand it\u2019s a hardship on everyone. It\u2019s not a[n] ... ideal situation, but it\u2019s part of the work environment he\u2019s been in and this family is in from the time ... he began working at this plant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">The chancellor ordered a reduction in child support from the date of the original petition and continuing during the pendency of the strike to one hundred seventy-four dollars ($174.00) per month. The parties were directed to calculate the appropriate arrearage, if any, based upon this amount and the amount actually paid during this time period.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">We begin our analysis by noting that several other jurisdictions have held that participation in a legal strike warrants a reduction in the child support obligations of a parent. <em>See, e.g., Cohn v. Cohn, </em>122 Ill.App.3d 763, 78 Ill.Dec. 194, 197, 461 N.E.2d 1028, 1031 (1984)(\u201crespondent participated in the strike in \u2018good faith\u2019 and was therefore entitled to a reduction in child support reflective of his present ability to pay\u201d); <em>Sandra L. v. John L., </em>125 Misc.2d 858, 480 N.Y.S.2d 291, 293 (N.Y.Fam.Ct.l984)(\u201c[t]he exercise of a federally protected right ... may not be used against a worker to deny a reduction of his support obligation which would otherwise be granted for good cause\u201d); <em>see also O\u2019Neal v. Wynn, </em>64 N.C.App. 149, 306 S.E.2d 822, 824 (1983)(non-union member who lost employment after refusing to cross picket line was entitled to reduction of child support), <em>aff'd, </em>310 N.C. 621, 313 S.E.2d 159 (1984); <em>cf. Reep v. Reep, </em>565 So.2d 814, 816 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1990)(\u201cparticipation in a legal strike, accompanied by diligent efforts to seek reemployment, cannot be considered a voluntary reduction of income and may form the basis for a petition for modification of alimony\u201d). <em>But see Horn v. Horn, </em>272 Ill.App.3d 472, 209 Ill.Dec. 130, 134, 650 N.E.2d 1103, 1107 (1995)(\u201cthe mere fact that an individual is on strike does not automatically require a trial court to reduce child support payments\u201d because other factors, including obligor\u2019s good faith, may be considered). These decisions rest upon two principles: the right of the obligor parent to participate in a lawful strike under federal and state statutes, <em>see, e.g., Sandra L., </em>480 N.Y.S.2d at 293 (citing 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 163</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>(1988)); <em>Reep, </em>565 So.2d at 816 n.4 (citing 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 168 and Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 447.03 (West 1989)), and the good faith of the obligor parent in undertaking the strike for the long-term benefit of his continued employment. <em>See, e.g., Cohn, </em>78 Ill.Dec. at 196, 461 N.E.2d at 1030.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">While fully in accord with other jurisdictions in recognizing the right of an individual to join a union and participate in a legal strike under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), <em>see </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 157,163 (1988), we further recognize that the right-to-work doctrine of this Commonwealth empowers an individual to maintain his employment during the pendency of a strike. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 40.1-53, -58. Moreover, we find that the preemption doctrine giving supremacy to the NLRA does not usurp the power of a state to require a union member to fulfill legal obligations unrelated to his or her union\u2019s collective bargaining activities. The potential of being required to maintain child support payments without reduction during the pendency of a legal strike is no different from other personal economic, considerations which an individual union member must take into account when determining whether to vote for or honor a strike. No deliberate action by the state interferes with the individual\u2019s right to vote for and participate in union activity and collective bargaining; thus, the preemption doctrine has no application to the issue of this case. <em>See, e.g., Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. v. Massachusetts, </em>471 U.S. 724, 749, 105 S.Ct. 2380, 2394, 85 L.Ed.2d 728 (1985) (preemption doctrine does not apply to state statutes and causes of actions which do not directly interfere with the primary purpose of NLRA to promote fair and equitable resolution of collective bargaining disputes). Accordingly, we hold that the fact that Mr. Rawlings was exercising a protected right in voting for and honoring the decision to strike neither mandates nor prohibits a reduction in his child support obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">Similarly, the reliance of other jurisdictions on the \u201cgood faith\u201d of the obligor parent in participating in the strike has no application in this Commonwealth. In <em>Antonelli v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number><em>Antonelli, </em>242 Va. 152, 409 S.E.2d 117 (1991), the Supreme Court held that \u201cwhen the [obligor parent] ... chose to pursue other employment, albeit a bona fide and reasonable business undertaking, the risk of his success at his new job was upon the [obligor parent], and not upon the children.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 156, 409 S.E.2d at 119-20. Interpreting <em>Antonelli, </em>this Court has held \u201cthat the risk of reduction in income as a result of a parent\u2019s intentional act, <em>even if done in good faith, </em>is insufficient grounds for reducing the amount of support due under a pre-existing order.\u201d <em>Hamel v. Hamel, </em>18 Va.App. 10, 13, 441 S.E.2d 221, 222 (1994)(emphasis added). Accordingly, while we concur in the chancellor\u2019s finding that Mr. Rawlings\u2019 decision to vote for and participate in the strike was consistent with the duties and obligations of union membership and done with good faith belief that it was for his and his family\u2019s ultimate benefit, that fact standing alone is insufficient to warrant a reduction in the child support due under the December 8, 1993 order.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">Nonetheless, we hold that the chancellor did not err in finding that under the facts of this case, Mr. Rawlings\u2019 decrease in income following the commencement of the union strike was a material change in circumstances invoking the court\u2019s continuing jurisdiction to modify its decree concerning his child support obligation. <em>See Yohay v. Ryan, </em>4 Va.App. 559, 565-66, 359 S.E.2d 320, 324 (1987). Although that reduc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>tion in income was the result of a good faith intentional act on the part of the obligor parent, we distinguish this case from <em>Antonelli </em>on the ground that at all times during and following the marriage the well-being of the economic relationship between Mr. Rawlings and his former spouse and child was inexorably entwined with the economic fortunes of the union. Thus, the strike itself, notwithstanding Mr. Rawlings\u2019 voluntary actions in voting for and honoring the strike, constituted the material change in circumstances warranting review of his child support obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">The mere fact of a material change in the obligor parent\u2019s income, however, does not necessarily warrant a reduction in the existing child support obligation. The chancellor is required to consider all the factors and guidelines enumerated in the Code for making such determinations and enter an award appropriate to circumstances as they exist at that time. <em>Watkinson v. Henley, </em>13 Va.App. 151, 156, 409 S.E.2d 470, 472-73 (1991); <em>see also Yohay, 4 </em>Va.App. at 566, 359 S.E.2d at 324; <em>Keyser v. Keyser, </em>2 Va.App. 459, 461-62, 345 S.E.2d 12, 14 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">Here, the amount of the reduction is supported by the record, unless, as Mrs. Rawlings asserts, the chancellor erred in not imputing income to Mr. Rawlings based upon his prestrike wages. Accordingly, we turn now to that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">\"While there is some suggestion in the record that Mr. Rawlings could have refused to honor the strike and returned to work at the wage he had been previously earning, it is clear that the standard of living of the family established during and maintained following the marriage until the strike flowed directly from the long-term benefits of his union membership. It is equally clear that the financial resources of the family were subject to fluctuation during a legal strike by the union. Thus, Mr. Rawlings was not \u201cunderemployed\u201d during the pendency of this strike. Rather, the record shows that in addition to participating in union activities in order to receive strike pay, Mr. Rawlings also sought temporary employment appropriate to his skills and educational level in order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>supplement his income and meet his support obligation. Nothing in the record suggests that equivalent employment to Mr. Rawlings\u2019 prior position and wage level was available in the locality or that he could have secured such a position elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">For these reasons, the decision of the circuit court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b712-8\">. At oral argument, it was established that the child is now emancipated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b715-6\">. We reject Mrs. Rawlings\u2019 assertion that the record establishes that Mr. Rawlings was motivated to vote for and support the strike in order to avoid the remaining months of his child support obligation prior to his son\u2019s emancipation. To the contrary, the record amply supports the chancellor\u2019s determination that this was not the case. Mr. Rawlings pursued temporary employment to supplement his strike pay, continued child support within his ability to pay, and pursued the appropriate legal course in seeking a reduction in his child support obligation. Although the record shows that because of his seniority and position with his employer, he stood to gain little direct economic benefit from a positive resolution to the strike, the intangible benefits accruing to all union members from a positive resolution of the strike and the previous benefits he had received as a result of union membership corroborate Mr. Rawlings' assertion that his decision to support the union was a matter of principle arising from his loyalty to the union made after reflecting on the strike\u2019s impact upon his financial situation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
