We granted the Commonwealth\u2019s and McQuinn\u2019s petitions for rehearing <em>en banc </em>and stayed the mandate of that decision. Upon rehearing <em>en banc, </em>for the reasons set forth in Judge Cole\u2019s concurrence and dissent, 19 Va.App. at 428, 451 S.E.2d at 709, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">At the conclusion of the presentation of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, McQuinn moved the trial court to strike the evidence on the ground that it was insufficient to prove the charges against him. The trial court denied that motion and McQuinn presented evidence. He did not renew his motion to strike at the conclusion of all the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">McQuinn contends on appeal that the trial court erred in denying his motion to strike the evidence and that the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions. We hold that by presenting evidence, McQuinn waived his motion to strike the evidence and that by failing to present the sufficiency issue to the trial court in the context of all the evidence, he failed to preserve that issue for appeal.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-7\">No ruling of the trial court ... will be considered as a basis for reversal unless the objection was stated together with the grounds therefor at the time of the ruling, except for good cause shown or to enable the Court of Appeals to attain the ends of justice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">Rule 5A:18. The conclusiveness of the proof renders this case inappropriate for invocation of the good cause and ends of justice exception to the applicability of this rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-9\">In <em>White v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 231, 348 S.E.2d 866 (1986), we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-10\">[W]hen a defendant elects to present evidence on his behalf, he waives the right to stand on his motion to strike the evidence made at the conclusion of the Commonwealth\u2019s case. <em>Spangler v. Commonwealth, </em>188 Va. 436, 50 S.E.2d 265 (1948). In <em>Spangler, </em>the Supreme Court explained the reason for this rule: \u201cPlaintiffs case may be strengthened by defendant\u2019s evidence. If thereafter a motion is made to strike the evidence or to set aside the verdict, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>must consider the entire record in reaching its conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 438, 50 S.E.2d at 266.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-5\">When White presented evidence in his behalf, he thereby waived his right to rely on his motion to strike which he had made at the end of the Commonwealth\u2019s case. After resting his case, White never objected to the sufficiency of the evidence. As a result, the trial court was never asked to rule on this issue based on the entire record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b802-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 233, 348 S.E.2d at 867.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-7\">[W]e hold that a defendant is barred on appeal from challenging the sufficiency of the evidence when he fails to renew his motion to strike the evidence after presenting his case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b802-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 234, 348 S.E.2d at 868. We reaffirmed this holding in <em>Day v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 1078, 1079, 407 S.E.2d 52, 53 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-9\">McQuinn relies on the 1992 amendment of Code \u00a7 8.01-384(A), which added the following sentence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-10\">No party, after having made an objection or motion known to the court, shall be required to make such objection or motion again in order to preserve his right to appeal, challenge, or move for reconsideration of a ruling, order, or action of the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b802-11\">He argues that this statutory amendment repealed the holdings of <em>Spangler, White, </em>and <em>Day, </em>causing his motion to strike, made at the conclusion of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, to preserve that issue sufficiently for appeal and eliminating the requirement of renewal at the conclusion of all the evidence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-12\">1992 Acts of Assembly, Chapter 564, which enacted the statutory change upon which McQuinn relies, provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-13\">2. That the provisions of this Act are declaratory of existing law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b803-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>The legislature is presumed to know the decisions of the appellate courts of the Commonwealth and to acquiesce therein unless it countermands them explicitly. <em>Burns v. Board of Supervisors of Stafford County, </em>227 Va. 354, 360, 315 S.E.2d 856, 860 (1984). The doctrine of <em>Spangler, White, </em>and <em>Day, </em>based on the concept of waiver, was firmly in place prior to the 1992 amendment to Code \u00a7 8.01-384(A). The 1992 statutory amendment did not address waiver and did not explicitly overrule the holdings of <em>Spangler, White, </em>and <em>Day.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\"><em>Spangler, White, </em>and <em>Day </em>state plainly the reason for their holdings. A motion to strike, made at the conclusion of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, addresses the sufficiency of proof within the context of that evidence. If the accused elects not to stand on his motion and presents evidence, he thereby creates a new context in which the court, if called upon to do so, must judge the sufficiency of the evidence. Thus, the original motion to strike is no longer applicable because it addresses a superseded context. If the accused intends to present the issue of sufficiency to the trial court at the conclusion of all the evidence, he must do so by new or renewed motion, made in the context of all the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">McQuinn failed to present the sufficiency issue to the trial court in a context upon which it could rule and thereby failed to preserve that issue for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b803-9\">ELDER, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Ali\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-10\">I would hold that we are not procedurally barred from addressing the sufficiency of the evidence issue. Having reached the sufficiency issue, I would hold that the evidence is sufficient to support the convictions. I do so for the reasons stated in Judge Barrow\u2019s panel opinion at 19 Va.App. 418, 451 S.E.2d 704 (1994).</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b804-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>BENTON, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AqV1\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">For the reasons stated in the portion of the previous panel decision titled \u201cPreservation of the Issue on Appeal,\u201d <em>see McQuinn v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 418, 420-23, 451 S.E.2d 704, 705-06 (1994), I would hold that McQuinn properly preserved for appeal the issue whether the evidence was sufficient to support the convictions. In addition, and for the reasons stated in my concurring and dissenting opinion, <em>see id. </em>at 425-32, 451 S.E.2d at 708-09 (Benton, J., concurring and dissenting), I would hold that the evidence was insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the elements of the offense. Therefore, I would reverse the convictions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
