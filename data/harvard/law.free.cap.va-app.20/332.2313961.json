The trial judge sentenced Adkins to twenty years in the penitentiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>On appeal, Adkins contends that the trial judge erred by admitting evidence of a doctor\u2019s \u201copinion\u201d as to the victim\u2019s IQ. He argues that the doctor should not have been permitted to give an opinion because it was not based on IQ test results that had been admitted into evidence or upon tests administered by him. Adkins further contends that the evidence is insufficient to support a conviction for rape under Code \u00a7 18.2\u201461(A)(ii). We hold that the trial court did not err by permitting the doctor to testify concerning the complaining witness\u2019s IQ. However, because the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence failed to prove that the defendant had sexual intercourse with the victim \u201cthrough the use of [her] mental incapacity,\u201d we reverse the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">We will refer to the victim as Teresa. At the time of the charged offense, Teresa was sixteen years old and lived with her parents in Danville. She was in the eighth grade in the Danville public school system. Doctors at the Medical College of Virginia had diagnosed Teresa, at age three, as being mentally retarded. Over the ensuing years, her IQ test scores had ranged between fifty-eight and seventy.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Prior to the date of the charged offense, Teresa had met Adkins at a local mall. When they met, Teresa exchanged telephone numbers with him. She recorded his telephone number in an address book that she kept.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">At the time of the charged offense, Adkins was twenty-seven years old and lived in an apartment with his father. According to the testimony of Adkins\u2019 sister, she received his social security check because he is not capable of handling his own money.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">One day before the charged offense, Teresa\u2019s mother heard Teresa talking with Adkins on the telephone. The mother took the telephone from Teresa and told Adkins, \u201cTeresa is mentally retarded. Leave her alone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">On the day of the charged offense, Teresa\u2019s mother went shopping, leaving Teresa at home. Teresa knew that her mother did not want her to talk with or to see Adkins. Nevertheless, Teresa called Adkins and asked him to pick her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>up at a mini-market near her home. She left a note telling her mother that she had gone to the mini-market. Adkins met Teresa, and they went to the apartment where he and his father lived. At the apartment, they watched television, had sexual intercourse, ate dinner, had intercourse a second time, and then fell asleep.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">When Teresa\u2019s mother returned and could not locate Teresa, she notified the Danville police. Based upon information from Teresa\u2019s parents, the Danville police found Teresa and Adkins late that evening, hiding in his apartment. Teresa said she was hiding because she did not want to go home. Later, Adkins signed a written statement admitting that he had had sexual intercourse with Teresa.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">At trial, Teresa\u2019s mother testified that Teresa is mentally retarded, but that she knows how to take care of herself, how to call 911, and how to go shopping. The mother testified that she had explained to Teresa the consequences of having sexual intercourse and that Teresa at least partially understood these discussions.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">Teresa testified that when she first met Adkins at the mall, she did so bn her own initiative, at which time she gave him her telephone number. She testified that she knew her mother did not want her to see Adkins, but she did so anyway. She testified that on the day of the charged offense, she called Adkins with the idea of having sex with him, and she asked him to meet her.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">Teresa testified that while at Adkins\u2019 apartment, she \u201cmade love\u201d with him twice. She said it was \u201cmostly\u201d her idea to have sex, and she told Adkins that she was eighteen. When asked about the consequences of having sexual intercourse, she testified, \u201cyou could catch AIDS\u201d and \u201cyou get pregnant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">James Pickens Culbert, PhD, a licensed clinical psychologist, was qualified as an expert witness. He testified that he had treated Teresa since she was seven years old, during which time he had tested her mental capacity and intellectual development. Based on IQ tests that had been administered to Teresa by Dr. Culbert\u2019s assistants, he testified that Tere<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>sa\u2019s IQ was fifty-nine, that her mental age was 10.4 years, and that her IQ range was determined to be between fifty-eight and seventy. Adkins objected to Dr. Culbert\u2019s testimony on the ground that he was giving an expert opinion that was not based on facts or test results admitted in evidence or that were personally known to Dr. Culbert. Adkins did not testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">I. EXPERT OPINION EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">For this opinion, we accept the parties\u2019 contention that Dr. Culbert\u2019s testimony as to Teresa\u2019s IQ is an expert\u2019s opinion. Because Dr. Culbert\u2019s opinion as to Teresa\u2019s IQ was based upon his personal knowledge of Teresa as her long-time treating psychologist and because his knowledge of the test results was based upon tests administered by persons directly under his supervision and control, we hold that Dr. Culbert\u2019s opinion as to Teresa\u2019s IQ was admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">The Commonwealth bore the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that Adkins had sexual intercourse with Teresa \u201cthrough the use of [her] mental incapacity.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-61(A)(ii). In an effort to prove that Teresa was mentally incapacitated, the Commonwealth introduced the testimony of Dr. Culbert, who had treated and tested Teresa since childhood concerning her mental and intellectual functioning. Code \u00a7 8.01^101.1 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AdR\">In any civil action any expert witness may give testimony and render an opinion or draw inferences from facts, circumstances or data made known to or perceived by such witness at or before the hearing or trial during which he is called upon to testify. The facts, circumstances or data relied upon by such witness in forming an opinion or drawing inferences, if of a type normally relied upon by others in the particular field of expertise in forming opinions and drawing inferences, need not be admissible in evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-9\"><em>Cf </em>Fed.R.Evid. 703 and 705. In criminal cases, however, the Supreme Court has expressly refused to adopt such a broad rule of admissibility for expert testimony. <em>See Simpson v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number><em>Commonwealth, </em>227 Va. 557, 566, 318 S.E.2d 386, 391-92 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">The Court said in <em>Simpson:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-5\">The General Assembly, in 1982, enacted Code \u00a7 8.01-401.1 which essentially adopts the foregoing provisions [Rules 703 and 705] of the Federal Rules of Evidence. That statute\u2019s application is expressly limited to \u201cany civil action.\u201d We regard this limitation as a clear expression of legislative intent to retain the historic restrictions upon expert testimony in criminal cases in Virginia.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-6\"><em>Simpson, </em>227 Va. at 566, 318 S.E.2d at 391 (citation omitted). The traditional rule for admissibility of opinion evidence, which continues to apply in criminal cases, is that \u201c[a]n expert may give an opinion based upon his own knowledge of facts disclosed in his testimony or he may give an opinion based upon facts in evidence assumed in a hypothetical question.\u201d <em>Walrod v. Matthews, </em>210 Va. 382, 388, 171 S.E.2d 180, 185 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">Adkins contends that, by applying the foregoing standard to Dr. Culbert\u2019s opinion as to Teresa\u2019s IQ, the opinion was inadmissible. Adkins posits that the underlying tests administered to Teresa which provided Dr. Culbert with the results to formulate his opinion were not personally administered by the doctor and, therefore, were not \u201cbased upon his own knowledge of facts,\u201d and the test results had not been admitted into evidence. We disagree with the defendant\u2019s contentions as to' what is required in order for facts to be within the personal knowledge of an expert witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">Dr. Culbert testified that Teresa had been his patient since she was seven years old. He had examined her on five occasions\u2014at ages seven, ten, eleven, thirteen, and fifteen. The purpose of the examinations was to determine Teresa\u2019s intellectual functioning. Dr. Culbert testified that on those occasions, his assistants administered intellectual functioning tests to Teresa, and they provided him with the results and test scores. He then conducted an independent examination of Teresa, including a personal interview with her and her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>parents. Thereafter, Dr. Culbert applied to the test results and the facts personally known to him about Teresa accepted and established procedures and standards in the field for determining Teresa\u2019s intellectual functioning. Based upon those standards, Dr. Culbert gave his opinion as to Teresa\u2019s IQ and relative mental age. His opinion was based upon his personal knowledge of the test results and upon facts that he knew personally about Teresa.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Unlike the situations in <em>Toro v. City of Norfolk, </em>14 Va.App. 244, 416 S.E.2d 29 (1992), and <em>Meade v. Belcher, </em>212 Va. 796, 188 S.E.2d 211 (1972), relied upon by Adkins, where test results and procedures were neither in evidence nor personally known to the witness, the tests administered to Teresa were under Dr. Culbert\u2019s direct supervision and control. He had personal knowledge of or access to the specific testing procedures that had been used, and he knew how the results were determined and how he had used them to formulate his opinion. From this knowledge, Adkins could have effectively cross-examined Dr. Culbert and could have required him to explain how he formed an opinion as to Teresa\u2019s IQ and mental age.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">The admissibility of expert witness evidence is within the sound discretion of the trial court, and the decision will not be disturbed on appeal unless the trial court has clearly abused its discretion. <em>Thorpe v. Commonwealth, </em>223 Va. 609, 614, 292 S.E.2d 323, 326 (1982). The trial judge did not abuse his discretion by admitting Dr. Culbert\u2019s opinion as to Teresa\u2019s IQ and mental age; therefore, we affirm the trial court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">II. SUFFICIENCY OF EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">When the sufficiency of the evidence is challenged on appeal, \u201cit is our duty to consider [the evidence] in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth and give it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u201d <em>Higginbotham v. Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 349, 352, 218 S.E.2d 534, 537 (1975). The trial court\u2019s judgment will not be reversed unless it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>plainly wrong or without evidence to support it. Code \u00a7 8.01-680; <em>Feigley v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 717, 722, 432 S.E.2d 520, 524 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Code \u00a7 18.2-61(A) provides that \u201c[i]f any person has sexual intercourse with a complaining witness who is not his or her spouse ... and <em>such act is accomplished </em>... (ii) <em>through the use of the complaining witness\u2019s mental incapacity </em>... he or she shall be guilty of rape.\u201d (emphasis added). \u201cMental incapacity\u201d is defined as \u201cthat condition of the complaining witness existing at the time of an offense under this article which prevents the complaining witness from <em>understanding the nature or consequences </em>of the sexual act involved in such offense and about which the accused knew or should have known.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-67.10 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">The elements necessary to constitute a crime are generally to be gathered from the definition of the crime. <em>Commonwealth v. Callaghan, </em>4 Va. (2 Va. Cas.) 460, 462 (1825). The Commonwealth has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt each and every element of the charged crime. <em>Powers v. Commonwealth, </em>211 Va. 386, 388, 177 S.E.2d 628, 629 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">Adkins concedes that the evidence proved beyond a reasonable doubt that he had sexual intercourse with Teresa, who was not his spouse. However, the critical question is whether the evidence proved that he \u201caccomplished\u201d the act of sexual intercourse with her \u201cthrough the use of\u2019 her \u201cmental incapacity.\u201d His argument is twofold: first, he contends that \u201cmental incapacity,\u201d for purposes of Code \u00a7 18.2-61(A)(ii), has a more particularized meaning than diminished mental capacity \u25a0 in general, requiring the Commonwealth to prove specifically that the victim did not understand the nature and consequences of sexual intercourse; second, he contends that the Commonwealth must prove that <em>he </em>in some way used or took advantage of Teresa\u2019s mental incapacity in order to \u201caccomplish\u201d the act of sexual intercourse with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">The legislative purpose of Code \u00a7 18.2-61(A)(ii) is to protect persons who are mentally impaired or retarded from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>being sexually exploited due to their mental incapacity. <em>See State v. Ortega-Martinez, </em>124 Wash.2d 702, 881 P.2d 281, 236 (1994) (explaining the legislative purpose of a similar statute). However, such statutes must not be interpreted and applied in a manner that, creates an unintended rule that would prohibit all mentally impaired or retarded persons from engaging in consensual sexual intercourse without having their partners commit a felony.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See State v. Olivio, </em>123 N.J. 550, 589 A.2d 597, 604 (1991) (expressing concern about \u201cunenlightened attitudes toward mental impairment and about the importance of according the mentally handicapped their fundamental rights\u201d). By specifically defining mental incapacity, the legislature has chosen to protect those mentally deficient persons whose mental condition prevents them from \u201cunderstanding the nature and consequences of the sexual act involved.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-67.10(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Thus, in order to convict a person of violating Code \u00a7 18.2-61(A)(ii), the Commonwealth must prove that the victim was \u201cmentally incapacitated\u201d as defined in Code \u00a7 18.2-67.10(3), which means that the person does not understand \u201cthe nature and consequences of the sexual act involved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Some jurisdictions have interpreted and applied similar statutory requirements narrowly by requiring the state to prove that the victim was incapable of comprehending the \u201cdistinctively sexual nature of the conduct.\u201d <em>See Olivio, </em>589 A.2d at 599. <em>See also </em>K.H. Carson, <em>Rape or Similar Offense Based on Intercourse With Woman Who Is Allegedly Mentally Deficient, </em>31 A.L.R.3d 1227 (1970) (discussing the treatment of mental incapacity in similar rape statutes). Other jurisdictions have interpreted similar statutes more broadly, requiring the state to prove only that the victim did not understand the physiological, social, and moral ramifications of his or her actions. <em>See People v. Easley, </em>42 N.Y.2d 50, 396 N.Y.S.2d 635,</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>638, 364 N.E.2d 1328, 1332 (1977) (stating that being able to \u201cappraise\u201d the nature of conduct means an \u201cappreciation of how it will be regarded in the framework of the societal environment and taboos to which a person will be exposed\u201d). <em>See also People v. McMullen, </em>91 Ill.App.3d 184, 46 Ill.Dec. 492, 495, 414 N.E.2d 214, 217 (1980) (stating that the victim was unable to understand how \u201cillicit sexual activity is regarded by other people\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">While the interpretations that other jurisdictions have given similar statutes are instructive, they are not controlling. Code \u00a7 18.2-61(A)(ii) does not leave solely to judicial interpretation the defined class of persons protected by the statute. To the extent that we must interpret the meaning of the statutory language\u2014\u201cunderstanding the nature and consequences of the sexual act\u201d\u2014we construe it strictly against the Commonwealth, because the statute is penal in nature, and limit its application to cases falling clearly within its ambit. <em>Turner v. Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 456, 459, 309 S.E.2d 337, 338 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">A person suffers from a \u201cmental incapacity\u201d within the meaning of the statute if he or she has a mental \u201ccondition\u201d that \u201cprevents\u201d the person from being able to \u201cunderstand\u201d <em>either </em>the \u201cnature\u201d <em>or </em>\u201cconsequences\u201d of engaging in sexual intercourse. To \u201cunderstand\u201d is \u201cto grasp the meaning of[; to] comprehend,\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>2490 (1986) or \u201cto know; to apprehend the meaning; to appreciate.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1526 (6th ed. 1990). <em>See State v. Johnson, </em>155 Ariz. 23, 745 P.2d 81 (1987) (en banc) (discussing the meaning of \u201cto understand\u201d). \u201cNature\u201d is defined as the \u201cnormal and characteristic quality ... of something,\u201d \u201cthe distinguishing qualities or properties of something.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>1507 (1986). \u201cConsequence\u201d is defined as \u201csomething that is produced by a cause or follows from a form of necessary connection or from a set of conditions: a natural or necessary result.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 482.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">To \u201cknow, apprehend, or appreciate\u201d the \u201cnature and consequences\u201d of sexual intercourse can range from a simple <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>understanding of how the act of coitus is physically accomplished together with an understanding that a sensation of pleasure may accompany the act, to a thorough and comprehensive understanding of the complex psychological and physiological \u201cnature\u201d of \u201cthe sexual act involved\u201d and that,, aside from immediate gratification, the act may have dire familial, social, medical, physical, economic, or spiritual consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Manifestly, the legislature did not intend to include as part of the protected class of people under Code \u00a7 18.2-61(A)(ii) those whose mental impairment or handicap may prevent them from comprehending the more complex aspects of the nature or consequences of sexual intercourse, but who, nevertheless, have the mental capacity to have a basic understanding of the elementary and rudimentary nature and consequences of sexual intercourse. Not all persons who are mentally retarded or handicapped need the special protection of Code \u00a7 18.2-61(A)(ii). The range of intellectual functioning among the mentally impaired and mentally retarded varies widely. The statute was not designed to unfairly punish the sexual partners of those mentally impaired or mentally retarded persons who have a basic understanding of the act and consequences of sexual intercourse and are capable of making a volitional choice to engage or not engage in such conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">The commentary of the Supreme Court of New Jersey interpreting a similar statute is noteworthy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-7\">The statutory concept of [\u201cmental incapacity\u201d] implicates both the intellectual or cognitive capacity and the volitional or consensual capacity of the individual with respect to personal sexual activity. The consensual capacity involves knowing that one\u2019s body is private and is not subject to the physical invasions of another, and that one has the right and ability to refuse to engage in sexual activity. The cognitive capacity, which is also implicit in the notion of consensual capacity, involves the knowledge that the conduct is distinctively sexual.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-8\"><em>Olivio, </em>589 A.2d at 604-05.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">When a mentally impaired or mentally retarded person has sufficient cognitive and intellectual capacity to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>comprehend or appreciate that he or she is engaging in intimate or personal sexual behavior which later may have some effect or residual impact upon the person, upon the person\u2019s partner, or upon others, then the person does not have a \u201cmental incapacity\u201d within the meaning of the statute. If a person is mentally incapacitated but, nevertheless, has the capacity to understand the nature and consequences of the sexual act, which understanding includes the capacity to make a volitional choice to engage or not engage in such act, then that person\u2019s sexual partner has not violated the rape statute merely because a mentally impaired person has made an unwise decision or has chosen to be sexually active.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">The fact finder cannot infer from proof of general mental incapacity or retardation or an IQ range or mental age that a victim is prevented or unable to understand the nature and consequences of a sexual act, unless the evidence proves that the victim lacks the ability to comprehend or appreciate either the distinguishing characteristics or physical qualities of the sexual act or the future natural behavioral or societal results or effects which may flow from the sexual act. The Commonwealth has the burden to prove every element of the offense in order to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">In this case, the Commonwealth presented testimony of Dr. Culbert, an expert witness; the victim\u2019s mother; and the victim. Dr. Culbert testified that the victim had an IQ of fifty-nine and a mental age of 10.4 years. He did not relate her IQ or her mental age to her capacity to understand the nature or consequences of sexual intercourse, particularly her capacity to make a volitional choice. On cross-examination, Dr. Culbert stated that although he measured her IQ and general intellectual capacity, he did not know whether Teresa understood or could use words like \u201cpenis\u201d and \u201cvagina,\u201d because he does not test such knowledge. Teresa\u2019s mother testified that Teresa is \u201csevere[ly] mentally retarded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">When Teresa testified, she stated, on cross-examination, that she \u201cmade love\u201d to the appellant, that she knew that she could get pregnant from \u201cmaking love\u201d and could catch AIDS, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>that she had had sex education classes in school, and she used the words \u201cpenis\u201d and \u201cvagina\u201d when describing the act of sexual intercourse. The Commonwealth did not explore the extent to which she knew or understood the significance of these words or engaging in sexual intercourse. No attempt was made to prove that Teresa may have been superficially mouthing these words to describe what had happened to her or to explain that she did not understand the nature and consequences of her actions. In fact, her testimony shows that she was the person who conceived the notion of having sexual intercourse with Adkins and initiated the sexual liaison between them.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">We recognize that a person may passively or suggestively take advantage of a mentally retarded or incapacitated individual; however, the fact that a victim may have diminished mental capacity does not relieve the Commonwealth of its burden of proving that the \u201cmental incapacity\u201d is that defined by Code \u00a7 18.2-67.10(3). We, therefore, find that the Commonwealth failed to meet its burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">Adkins also contends that the evidence failed to prove an additional element of the offense\u2014that he \u201caccomplished\u201d having sexual intercourse with Teresa \u201cthrough the use of\u2019 her mental incapacity. He argues that the evidence failed to show that he knowingly used or took advantage of her incapacity in order to accomplish the act of sexual intercourse. His argument would have us address whether he could have \u201caccomplished\u201d the result by knowingly taking advantage of a condition through passive conduct. However, because we find the evidence insufficient to prove that Teresa had a mental incapacity as defined in the statute, we do not address this contention. For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the conviction and dismiss the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b389-7\">. Although not a felony, consensual sexual intercourse between adults who do not have a \"mental incapacity\u201d as defined by Code \u00a7 18.2-67.10(3) is fornication, a Class 4 misdemeanor, Code \u00a7 18.2-344, a conviction for which is punishable by a fine of not more than $250.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
