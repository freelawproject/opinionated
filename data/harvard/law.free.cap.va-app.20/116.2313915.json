Wood Products argues that the commission erred in: (1) including claimant\u2019s independent contractor earnings when calculating his average weekly wage, and (2) finding that claimant\u2019s independent contractor work was similar to his employment with Augusta Lumber and Supply, Inc. (Augusta Lumber). Finding no error, we affirm the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">On February 15, 1989, claimant suffered numerous injuries, including the loss of one leg, while working for Augusta Lumber. The injury occurred on the first day of employment with Augusta Lumber, and claimant has not worked since the accident. Before the accident, Augusta Lumber\u2019s intent was to hire claimant to load and haul lumber over short distances for one four-day work week per month. Claimant was also a self-employed, long-haul truck driver three weeks each month, and his earnings as an independent truck driver represented the bulk of his wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">In 1993, this Court held that claimant was an employee of Augusta Lumber, not an independent contractor, and remanded the case to the commission for a determination of the claimant\u2019s average weekly wage. <em>See James v. Wood Products of Virginia, </em>15 Va.App. 754, 427 S.E.2d 224 (1993). This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>Court declined to address whether claimant\u2019s independent contractor earnings should be included in his average weekly-wage and left the issue for further commission consideration. <em>Id. </em>at 758, 427 S.E.2d at 226-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">On remand, the commission found that claimant was employed as a truck driver and his employment encompassed both his work as a self-employed independent contractor and as an employee of Augusta Lumber. The commission included claimant\u2019s earnings as an independent contractor when calculating his average weekly wage and determined that this calculation \u201cwould most closely approximate the claimant\u2019s anticipated earnings in his employment as a truck driver and the wages which his injury precludes him from earning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR EARNINGS AND AVERAGE WEEKLY WAGE</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Wood Products contends that claimant\u2019s earnings from his independent, long-haul truck driver employment should be excluded from the average weekly wage calculation and that only wages from his employment relationship should be considered. Additionally, Wood Products argues that, even if independent contractor earnings are included in the calculation of a worker\u2019s average weekly wage, the earnings in this case should be excluded under the \u201cdissimilar employment\u201d rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">Code \u00a7 65.2-101(A) defines \u201caverage weekly wage\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-8\">1. The earnings of the injured employee in the employment in which he was working at the time of the injury during the period of fifty-two weeks immediately preceding the date of the injury____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-10\">2. When for exceptional reasons the foregoing would be unfair either to the employer or employee, <em>such other method of computing average weekly wages may be resorted to as will most nearly approximate the amount which the injured employee would be earning were it not for the injury.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>(Emphasis added). \u201c\u2018The reason for calculating average weekly wage is to approximate the <em>economic </em>loss suffered by an employee or his beneficiaries when there is a loss of earning capacity because of work-related injury or death.\u2019 \u201d <em>Chesapeake &amp; Potomac Tel. Co. v. Williams, </em>10 Va.App. 516, 519-20, 392 S.E.2d 846, 848 (1990) (quoting <em>Bosworth v. 7-Up Distrib. Co., </em>4 Va.App. 161, 163, 355 S.E.2d 339, 340 (1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">Whether the commission may consider an employee\u2019s independent contractor earnings in calculating his average weekly wage was left unresolved in <em>Metropolitan Cleaning Corp., Inc. v. Crawley, </em>14 Va.App. 261, 264, 416 S.E.2d 35, 37 (1992) (en banc). However, we held that \u201can employee\u2019s \u2018average weekly wages\u2019 also include an employee\u2019s earnings from similar services for employment <em>not covered </em>by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.\u201d <em>First Virginia Banks, Inc. v. McNeil, </em>8 Va.App. 342, 344, 381 S.E.2d 357, 358 (1989) (emphasis added). We hold that, even though independent contractors are not covered under the workers\u2019 compensation system, in an appropriate case, the commission may include earnings from similar independent contractor work when calculating a claimant\u2019s average weekly wage.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">\u2018\u201cIt lies within the commission\u2019s authority to determine the facts and the weight of the evidence, and its findings in that regard, when supported by credible evidence, will not be disturbed on appeal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dominion Associates Group, Inc. v. Queen, </em>17 Va.App. 764, 767, 441 S.E.2d 45, 46 (1994) (quoting <em>Rose v. Red\u2019s Hitch &amp; Trailer Serv., Inc., </em>11 Va.App. 55, 60, 396 S.E.2d 392, 395 (1990)). In this case, pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.2-101(A)(2), the commission included claimant\u2019s independent contractor earnings because: (1) these earnings represented the greater portion of claimant\u2019s earnings as a truck driver, and (2) the combination of these earnings with claimant\u2019s wages from Augusta Lumber \u201cmost closely approximately] the claimant\u2019s anticipated earnings in his employment as a truck driver.\u201d Under these circumstances, we cannot say that the commission erred in including claimant\u2019s independent contractor earnings when calculating his average weekly wage.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>Wood Products\u2019s argument that claimant\u2019s independent contractor earnings should be excluded under the dissimilar employment rule is also without merit.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-4\">The elementary rule of statutory interpretation is that the construction accorded a statute by public officials charged with its administration and enforcement is entitled to be given weight by the court. The legislature is presumed to be cognizant of such construction. When it has long continued without change the legislature will be presumed to have acquiesced therein.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-5\"><em>Hudson v. Arthur Treachers, 2 </em>Va.App. 323, 326, 343 S.E.2d 97, 99 (1986). When calculating average weekly wages, the commission since 1922 \u201chas uniformly continued to allow the combination of wages earned in similar employment while denying the combination of wages earned in dissimilar employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We held that the requirement of similar employment is equally applicable to an average weekly wage determined under former Code \u00a7 65.1-6(A)(2) (now Code \u00a7 65.2-101(A)(2)). <em>Id. </em>at 327-28, 343 S.E.2d at 100. Credible evidence supports the commission\u2019s finding that claimant\u2019s independent contractor work as a long-haul truck driver was sufficiently similar to his work for Augusta Lumber as a short-haul truck driver to permit the inclusion of his independent contractor earnings when calculating his average weekly wage.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b164-11\">.
