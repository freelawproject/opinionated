Odom (claimant) appeals an order of the Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission (commission) dismissing her claim for benefits as not timely filed. Claimant asserts that the statute of limitations was tolled by estoppel or, in the alternative, that the doctrine of imposition permits the commission to accept the filing of her claim in order to do full justice.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because the acts and omissions of Liberty Mutual Insurance Company (carrier), the workers\u2019 compensation carrier for claimant\u2019s employer Red Lobster #235 (employer), and the acts of the employees of the commission served to prejudice the claimant, we hold that the doctrine of imposition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>should be applied to the facts of this case. Accordingly, we reverse and remand with instructions to reinstate the claim on. the hearing docket.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Claimant sustained a work-related injury on January 15, 1990 when she slipped and fell in employer\u2019s kitchen, injuring her right knee. Carrier accepted the claim as compensable and paid benefits without an award through August 6, 1992. On that date, carrier ceased payments, asserting that, pursuant to the two-year statute of limitations of Code \u00a7 65.2-601, the claim was time-barred from January 15,1992. On December 31, 1992, claimant filed an application with the commission to determine whether employer and carrier were estopped from asserting the statute of limitations. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 65.2-602 (providing for the tolling of the statute of limitations under certain circumstances). Claimant sought temporary total disability benefits for the period January 24, 1990 to August 17, 1992 (one and one-half weeks more than she was actually paid) and unspecified permanent partial disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">The record shows that employer filed a first report of accident on March 4, 1990. Prior to that date, claimant had received a workers\u2019 compensation pamphlet from carrier and began receiving regular temporary total disability payments. At no time did carrier or employer file a memorandum of agreement with the commission accepting the claim as compensable. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 65.2-701.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">Carrier\u2019s pamphlet identifies the wage loss and medical benefits payable under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act and included handwritten calculations of the wage loss benefits claimant would receive. Among other statements made in the pamphlet, claimant was informed that carrier \u201cdo[es] not require you to employ anyone to help you secure the benefits to which you are entitled. They are paid voluntarily by [carrier] for injuries and disabilities covered under the Act.\u201d The pamphlet further stated that \u201c[c]hecks are issued every 14 days, and they will continue until you are physically able to return to work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>The concluding paragraph of the pamphlet stated that claimant \u201c[could] deal directly with [carrier], one of the most respected service-oriented insurance companies in the country.\u201d Following this paragraph, the pamphlet stated that \u201cinformation is available\u201d from the commission if \u201cquestions remain.\u201d This final provision was substantially obliterated by a stamp giving the address of the commission. Claimant testified that she understood this pamphlet to mean that her claim had been accepted and that she would receive benefits so long as she remained disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">During the period that claimant was receiving wage loss benefits, carrier informed her twice by letter that she was receiving an upward cost-of-living adjustment in the benefits to which she was \u201centitled ... under Section 65.1-99.1.\u201d Carrier also paid for all medical and rehabilitation services and sent a nurse to claimant\u2019s home to discuss her rehabilitation program. During this period, claimant had numerous telephone and personal contacts with carrier\u2019s claims personnel regarding receipt of her benefits. She was not advised during these contacts that she needed to file a claim with the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">Claimant contacted the Richmond office of the commission in October 1990 by telephone and was told that she \u201c[had] a claim number and it had been filed and everything [was] all right\u201d with her claim. After this contact, the commission sent claimant a standard \u201cblue letter\u201d pamphlet instructing her to secure her rights by filing a claim within the statutory time period. In January 1992, recognizing that the statute of limitations would soon expire, claimant\u2019s counsel contacted both the Alexandria and Richmond offices of the commission and was informed that the claim had been filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">When carrier ceased payment of benefits, claimant filed an application for benefits, asserting that employer , and carrier were estopped from relying on the statute of limitations. The deputy commissioner ruled that carrier\u2019s acts did not support a finding \u201cof fraud, concealment or imposition or [have] in any way acted to prejudice the rights of the claimant.\u201d With <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>respect to the acts of the employees of the commission, the deputy commissioner opined that the filing of the Employer\u2019s First Report of Accident could be interpreted as the \u201cclaim\u201d referred to by commission employees contacted by claimant and her counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">Claimant sought review of this decision by the full commission. The majority of the commission affirmed the deputy commissioner\u2019s findings. The dissenting commissioner noted that carrier\u2019s benefits pamphlet contained phrases which implied that claimant need not act so long as carrier accepted her claim as compensable. This commissioner concluded by noting that claimant\u2019s \u201cimpression that her claim had been accepted as compensable and that she would receive all legal entitlement was reinforced by statements of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission____ [T]he carriers\u2019 conduct served to lull the claimant into a sense that [an] agreement had been reached____ It would be a manifest injustice as well as contrary to the Act to bar the claim in this context.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">We agree with the majority of the commission that the carefully drafted phrases of carrier\u2019s pamphlet, even when viewed in the overall context of carrier\u2019s conduct in handling claimant\u2019s benefits, do not rise to the level of fraud dictated by the standard for estoppel applied to workers\u2019 compensation claims in this Commonwealth. On appellate review, the Court \u201cwill construe the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party.\u201d <em>Crisp v. Brown\u2019s Tysons Corner Dodge, Inc., </em>1 Va.App. 508, 504, 339 S.E.2d 916, 916 (1986). Following that standard, we cannot say that carrier\u2019s acts and omissions evince a \u201creasonably calculated [effort] to induce ... [the employee] to refrain from filing [a] claim.\u201d <em>Stuart Circle Hosp. v. Alderson, </em>223 Va. 205, 208, 288 S.E.2d 445, 446^47 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-10\">Although claimant\u2019s belief that she was not required to take further action to secure her benefits was reasonable and compelling, the doctrine of estoppel requires the aggrieved party to show an affirmative, deliberate effort to prejudice the claimant\u2019s right to file a claim with the commission within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>limitations period. Carrier\u2019s acts and omissions in this instance were passive, and without clear evidence of a deliberate fraud; therefore, estoppel does not apply. <em>Id.; see also Cibula v. Allied Fibers &amp; Plastics, </em>14 Va.App. 319, 324-25, 416 S.E.2d 708, 711 (1992), <em>aff'd, </em>245 Va. 337, 428 S.E.2d 905 (1993). Moreover, an employee is \u201cdeemed not prejudiced if ... [s]he has received after the accident a workers\u2019 compensation guide ... or a notice\u201d from the commission describing the need to file a claim with the commission. Code \u00a7 65.2-602.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">We now consider the applicability of the doctrine of imposition. The deputy commissioner addressed imposition in conjunction -with estoppel, finding that neither applied. The majority of the commission, while not directly addressing imposition, implicitly approved that finding in affirming the deputy commissioner\u2019s decision. Although not expressly stated, the dissenting commissioner implicitly found that this was an appropriate case for application of this doctrine in order to avoid \u201ca manifest injustice.\u201d We agree with the dissent.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-6\">Within the principles established by statutes and the decisions construing them, the commission has \u201cjurisdiction to do full and complete justice in each case.\u201d From that principle has developed the concept known as \u201cimposition,\u201d which empowers the commission in appropriate cases to render decisions based on justice shown by the total circumstances even though no fraud, mistake or concealment has been shown.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-7\"><em>Avon Products, Inc. v. Ross, </em>14 Va.App. 1, 7, 415 S.E.2d 225, 228 (1992) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">In <em>Cheski v. Arlington County Public Schools, </em>16 Va.App. 936, 434 S.E.2d 353 (1993), we held that the doctrine of imposition does not apply where a carrier\u2019s or employer\u2019s acts are consistent with an endeavor to comply with the Act. <em>Id. </em>at 940, 434 S.E.2d at 356. In <em>Cheski, </em>the sole basis for the claimant\u2019s assertion of the doctrine of imposition was a letter from her employer concerning the compensability of her medical benefits. We agreed with the commission that the record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>did not establish claimant\u2019s reliance on this letter to her detriment. <em>Id. </em>at 939, 434 S.E.2d at 355.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">Here, the record shows not one act, but a series of acts by both carrier and commission employees upon which claimant would naturally and reasonably have relied to her detriment. Moreover, carrier\u2019s omission in failing to execute and file a memorandum of agreement pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.2-701, frustrated a primary purpose behind the Act\u2014the expedient entry of awards in cases where the parties agree as to the compensability\u2014further prejudicing claimant\u2019s rights. <em>See National Linen Service v. McGuinn, </em>5 Va.App. 265, 269, 362 S.E.2d 187, 189 (1987) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Under the doctrine of imposition, unlike estoppel, the receipt of a \u201cblue letter\u201d does not create a <em>de jure </em>bar to a finding that claimant suffered prejudice. Rather, receipt of the \u201cblue letter\u201d is simply one circumstance among others to be considered. Here, claimant did not receive the \u201cblue letter\u201d until after carrier had begun paying benefits and she had been informed, erroneously, by commission employees that her claim had been filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">As in <em>Avon, </em>the factors here supporting the usual application of the statute of limitations are absent. <em>Avon, </em>14 Va.App. at 7, 415 S.E.2d at 228. \u201c[T]he issue is whether under the totality of the circumstances shown, the actions of the employer and its carrier created an imposition on the commission and the claimant which empowered the commission \u2018do full and complete justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8, 415 S.E.2d at 229. In addition, the commission employees represented to claimant that a claim had been filed. These representations, though not chargeable to employer or carrier, further prejudiced the claimant\u2019s rights. Under the doctrine of imposition, the commission\u2019s \u201cjurisdiction to do full and complete justice\u201d includes the power to render decisions based \u201con justice shown by the total circumstances even though no fraud, mistake or concealment has been shown.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7, 415 S.E.2d at 228. Under the total circumstances of this case, the commission should have exercised that jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>By permitting the claim to go forward under the circumstances of this case, employer and carrier are in no worse a position than they would have been had not their acts and omissions and the representations of the employees of the commission combined to prejudice claimant. They may still contest the claim through the hearing docket and challenge the ultimate result, if unfavorable to them, by appeal. Thus, in applying the doctrine of imposition, we permit the commission to enforce the intent of the Act and to preserve the rights of the parties as they existed before the statute of limitations expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">For these reasons, we reverse the order of the commission dismissing claimant\u2019s application and remand with instructions to reinstate the claim on the hearing docket as timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b276-13\">. Claimant further asserts that if the statute of limitations was not tolled, the filing of medical evidence with the commission was adequate to preserve her claim. This second issue is mooted by our favorable resolution of the first.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
