Bishop was convicted of driving after having been adjudicated an habitual offender in violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-357(B) and sentenced as a felon pursuant to subsection (B)(2). He contends that the evidence was sufficient only to support punishment for a misdemeanor under subsection (B)(1) of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>statute.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We agree; therefore, we reverse the felony sentence and remand the case for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">The undisputed evidence proved that Bishop was seated in the driver\u2019s seat of a motor vehicle stopped at a toll booth on the Chesapeake Bay Bridge Tunnel. Two passengers were in the vehicle. When Bishop inquired about turning around because he was lost, a police officer approached the vehicle to assist Bishop and detected an odor of alcohol. In response to the officer\u2019s inquiry concerning whether he had been drinking, Bishop replied that he had. The officer told him to put the transmission in park and exit the vehicle. After the officer administered sobriety tests and learned that Bishop was an habitual offender, she arrested Bishop.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>The officer testified that Bishop was the driver of the motor vehicle. However, she also testified that she never saw the vehicle while it was moving. Bishop was fully cooperative and complied with her instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">In the circuit court, Bishop sought to plead guilty to the misdemeanor offense and pled not guilty to the felony offense. Bishop\u2019s counsel conceded that Bishop had been convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol in the general district court and that Bishop was an habitual offender. He argued at trial and on this appeal that the evidence proved only the elements sufficient to support misdemeanor punishment under Code \u00a7 46.2-357(B)(l). The trial judge, however, found that Bishop\u2019s driving endangered the passengers in the vehicle because Bishop was operating the vehicle while he was under the influence of alcohol. He convicted Bishop of violating Code \u00a7 46.2-357(B) and imposed a felony sentence pursuant to subsection (B)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">Code \u00a7 46.2-357 contains the criterion that distinguishes a misdemeanor violation from a felony violation. An habitual offender who is convicted of driving a motor vehicle after having been forbidden to drive shall be punished as a misdemeanant \u201c[i]f such driving does not, of itself, endanger the life, limb, or property of another.\u201d Code \u00a7 46.2-357(B)(l). Pursuant to subsection (B)(2), the convicted habitual offender shall be punished as a felon \u201c[i]f such driving, of itself, does endanger the life, limb, or property of another.\u201d Significantly, the statutory phrase, \u201cof itself,\u201d modified the word \u201cdriving.\u201d In applying the statute, we have a duty to give effect to every word in the statute. <em>Foote v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va.App. 61, 65, 396 S.E.2d 851, 854 (1990). The legislature\u2019s use of this phrase as a modifier necessarily required the trier of fact to find conduct, other than the mere fact of operating the motor vehicle, that imperiled or threatened danger to the life, limb, or property of a person other than the driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>In the absence of any evidence to prove that the actual manner in which Bishop drove the vehicle endangered life, limb, or property, the Commonwealth argued that proof of Bishop\u2019s intoxication constituted <em>per se </em>proof that life, limb, or property was endangered. We disagree and hold that the inference drawn solely from Bishop\u2019s intoxication, without more, was insufficient to support imposition of felony punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">The Supreme Court of Virginia has been consistent in stating that \u201c \u2018[o]ne who knowingly drives [an] automobile on the highway under the influence of intoxicants, in violation of statute, is, of course, negligent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Essex v. Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 273, 282, 322 S.E.2d 216, 221 (1984) (quoting <em>Baker v. Marcus, </em>201 Va. 905, 910, 114 S.E.2d 617, 621 (1960)). The Supreme Court also has observed that \u201cno case ... holds that one driving under the influence of an intoxicant must necessarily be driving recklessly.\u201d <em>Spickard v. City of Lynchburg, </em>174 Va. 502, 505, 6 S.E.2d 610, 611 (1940). Thus, while evidence of intoxication is a factor that might bear upon proof of dangerous or reckless driving in a given case, it does not, of itself, prove reckless driving.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-6\">One may be both drunk and reckless. He may be reckless though not drunk; he may even be a total abstainer, and he may be under the influence of intoxicants and yet drive carefully. Indeed, with knowledge of his condition, he might, for the time being, drive with extraordinary care. It is against the possibilities of such a condition that [Code \u00a7 18.2-266] is directed. A man under the influence of intoxicants may at times conduct himself with the utmost care and dignity, and he might do this to an extent which would manifest that which he hoped to conceal. He might tread a line with an exactness which no sober man would feel called upon to attempt____ [T]here are as many stages of intoxication as there are varieties of Heinz pickles.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 504-05, 6 S.E.2d at 611.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-10\">The distinction between negligent driving and reckless driving is the critical element in determining punishment under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>Code \u00a7 46.2-357. In defining the conduct that gives rise to felony punishment under Code \u00a7 46.2\u2014357(B)(2), the legislature used the phrase, \u201cdriving [that] ... endanger[s] the life, limb, or property of another,\u201d language virtually identical to that found in the statute defining reckless driving. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 46.2-852 (\u201cdriving ... at a speed or in a manner so as to endanger the life, limb, or property of any person shall be ... reckless driving\u201d). Thus, although proof of Bishop\u2019s conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-266 was sufficient to prove that Bishop was negligent by operating the motor vehicle, no other facts or circumstances proved that his intoxication was such that it elevated his \u201cconduct to the level of \u2018negligence so gross, wanton, and culpable as to show a reckless disregard of human life.\u2019\u201d <em>Essex, </em>228 Va. at 283, 322 S.E.2d at 222 (citation omitted), or that his \u201cdriving, of itself,\u201d was dangerous.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">The evidence in this case did not prove any movement of the motor vehicle. No witness testified that the vehicle moved while Bishop was observed at the toll booth. No evidence proved that Bishop drove the vehicle in a dangerous manner. Although Bishop\u2019s operation of the vehicle under the influence of alcohol was negligent, it was not, under the facts proven, conduct dangerous to life, limb, or property of another. In that regard, we also note that drunken driving is not a <em>malum in se </em>offense in Virginia; it is <em>malum prohibitum. Id. </em>at 282, 322 S.E.2d at 221.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Furthermore, it is a fundamental principle that \u2018\u2018[c]riminal statutes are to be \u2018strictly construed against the Commonwealth and in favor of [a] citizen\u2019s liberty.\u2019 \u201d <em>King v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 351, 354, 368 S.E.2d 704, 706 (1988) (citation omitted). We believe that if the legislature had intended a <em>per se </em>result, it would have specified that any habitual offender who operated a motor vehicle while intoxicated, regardless of the nature or the circumstances of the actual driving, would be deemed a felon. Indeed, the legislature provided that for a conviction of a second or subsequent offense under Code \u00a7 46.2-357, an habitual offender shall be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>punished as a felon, \u201cirrespective of whether the offense, of itself, endangers the life, limb, or property of another.\u201d Code \u00a7 46.2-357(B)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">Because the statute explicitly created a felony offense for a category of offender \u201cirrespective\u201d of proof of endangerment, we cannot conclude from the statute as written that the legislature intended the same result for persons who were proved to be intoxicated, irrespective of endangerment. \u201cA penal statute must be construed so as to proscribe only conduct which the legislature clearly intended to be within the statute\u2019s ambit.\u201d <em>King, </em>6 Va.App. at 355, 368 S.E.2d at 706. Had the legislature intended for courts to impose a felony sentence solely upon proof that an habitual offender drove after consuming alcohol, the legislature could have included such a penalty, as it did in subsection (B)(3). \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">Accordingly, we hold that the evidence failed to prove that Bishop\u2019s \u201cdriving, of itself ... endangered] the life, limb, or property of another\u201d and, thus, the evidence did not support the imposition of a felony sentence. Because the evidence proved beyond a reasonable doubt the elements necessary to support a violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-357(B), we uphold the conviction. However, for the reasons stated in this opinion, we remand the case to the trial judge for imposition of a misdemeanor punishment pursuant to Code \u00a7 46.2~357(B)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b254-7\">. In pertinent part, Code \u00a7 46.2-357 reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-8\">B.

If such driving does not, of itself, endanger the life, limb, or property of another, such person shall be guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by confinement in jail for no more than ninety days and a fine of not more that $2,500, either or both.
