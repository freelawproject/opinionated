Lee Edward Sattler contends that the trial judge erred in holding that a police officer lawfully searched Sattler before issuing a summons for a traffic violation. We reverse the trial judge\u2019s refusal to suppress the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-12\">The evidence presented at the suppression hearing proved that a state police officer observed Sattler\u2019s automobile abruptly turn from an interstate highway onto an exit. The officer followed the automobile but did not signal Sattler to stop because he had not decided to stop the driver. The officer testified that as the automobile approached a service station he saw a radar detector device and made the decision to stop the driver and issue a citation. When Sattler drove to the station\u2019s fuel pump and exited his automobile, the officer parked his vehicle behind Sattler\u2019s automobile and asked Sattler for his driver\u2019s license, registration, and radar detector device. The officer told Sattler that he would issue a sum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>mons for the radar detector violation; however, he also told Sattler that he could pump the gas, pay for it, and then move his automobile. The officer moved his vehicle to a side area. When Sattler completed the purchase and moved his automobile to join the officer, the officer told Sattler to sit in the officer\u2019s vehicle but that he would first \u201cpat\u201d Sattler for weapons. The officer testified that he \u201cpat[s] everybody down [for weapons] prior to them coming back to [his] vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">During the frisk for weapons, the officer felt an object in Sattler\u2019s pocket. He said that when Sattler took a step back, he reached into Sattler\u2019s pocket and retrieved a pipe. He then arrested Sattler for possession of marijuana that he saw in the pipe. After placing handcuffs on Sattler, the officer searched Sattler\u2019s automobile and seized a bag of marijuana and psiloeyn.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">The trial judge found that the officer\u2019s search for weapons was reasonable and refused to suppress the evidence. At trial, where the evidence was admitted, Sattler was convicted of possession of marijuana and possession of psiloeyn.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">The Fourth Amendment prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures. <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 9, 88 S.Ct. 1868,1873, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968). \u2018Whether a search ... is unreasonable is determined by balancing the individual\u2019s right to be free from arbitrary government intrusions against society\u2019s countervailing interest in preventing or detecting crime and in protecting its law enforcement officers.\u201d <em>Stanley v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 873, 875, 433 S.E.2d 512, 513 (1993). To conduct a patdown search, a police officer must be able to \u201c \u2018 \u201cpoint to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts,\u201d \u2019 reasonably lead him to conclude, \u2018in light of his experience, that \u201ccriminal activity may be afoot\u201d and that the suspect \u201cmay be armed and presently dangerous.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). In <em>Stanley, </em>we held that it was unreasonable for police officers to conclude that a person on a motor scooter was armed and dangerous because a police officer saw a bulge in the person\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>pocket following a traffic stop. 16 Va.App. at 877, 433 S.E.2d at 515.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">The evidence at the suppression hearing failed to prove that the officer had specific and articulable facts upon which to conclude that Sattler was armed and dangerous. The officer initially detained Sattler solely for the purpose of issuing a summons for a traffic infraction. Sattler was not under arrest. The officer offered no reason to support a belief that Sattler was armed or dangerous or that he possessed illegal drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">The officer searched Sattler solely because of his general policy of searching every person entering his vehicle. In every encounter, <em>\u201cTerry </em>requires reasonable, individualized suspicion before a frisk for weapons can be conducted.\u201d <em>Maryland v. Buie, </em>494 U.S. 325, 334 n. 2, 110 S.Ct. 1093, 1098 n. 2, 108 L.Ed.2d 276 (1990). The officer\u2019s generalized policy of frisking all persons does not satisfy the restrictions imposed by <em>Terry. </em>\u201cIndeed, if everyone is assumed to be armed and dangerous until the officer is satisfied that he or she is not, then officers would be able to frisk at will\u2014a result not contemplated by the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>State v. Garland, </em>270 N.J.Super. 31, 636 A.2d 541, 548 (App.Div.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">Accordingly, we hold that the trial judge erred in finding that the officer\u2019s search was reasonable and in refusing to suppress the seized evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b415-9\">COLE, Senior Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AqV\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">I concur in the judgment reversing the trial court\u2019s refusal to suppress the evidence. However, my opinion is based upon the inadequate record in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-11\">The operation of a motor vehicle equipped with a radar detector to detect radar used by law enforcement personnel is unlawful on the highways of the Commonwealth and constitutes a traffic infraction. Code \u00a7 46.2-1079. Traffic infractions are not felonies or misdemeanors but are violations of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>public order and are not deemed criminal in nature. Code \u00a7 18.2-8. However, Code \u00a7 46.2-937 provides that \u201c[flor purposes of arrest, traffic infractions shall be treated as misdemeanors\u201d and \u201cthe authority and duties of arresting officers shall be the same for traffic infractions as for misdemeanors.\u201d If the offense of possession of a radar detector was a misdemeanor, the officer could have searched the defendant incident to the arrest. <em>See Leeth v. Commonwealth, </em>223 Va. 335, 340-41, 288 S.E.2d 475, 478 (1982) (holding that because the officer possessed probable cause, he could search the car for a radar detector). None of these issues was raised in the trial court or on appeal. The only issue raised was the reasonableness of the <em>Terry </em>stop. The only reason given for the patdown was the officer\u2019s personal policy of frisking everyone who entered his police car. Based upon this record, I join the majority opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
