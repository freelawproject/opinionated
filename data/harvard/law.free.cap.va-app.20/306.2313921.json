Reed, pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-283(C). Mother appealed to the trial court and, following a hearing <em>ore terms, </em>the court denied the petition concluding that, although the substantive evidence supported termination, the mother\u2019s age constituted \u201cgood cause\u201d for her failure to remedy timely those conditions which originally \u201cled to the child\u2019s foster care placement.\u201d <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 16.1-283(0(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Petitioners appeal, complaining that the trial court erroneously denied relief clearly appropriate to the circumstances in accordance with Code \u00a7 16.1-283(0(2). Assigning cross-error, mother asserts procedural irregularities as a bar to petitioners\u2019 \u201cstanding\u201d to pursue termination. She also challenges the constitutionality of Code \u00a7 16.1-283(0(2) and the sufficiency of the evidence to establish that termination was in Jordan\u2019s best interests. We agree that the evidence supported termination, but find that mother\u2019s failure to remedy the conditions which prompted foster care in accordance with Code \u00a7 16.1-283(0(2) was without the requisite \u201cgood cause\u201d and, therefore, reverse the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">The facts are uncontroverted. Jordan was born April 30, 1991, of an unknown father. Mother was then fourteen years of age and in the custody of Patrick and Denise Creary, having been voluntarily placed with them by her estranged mother.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Mother and Jordan remained in the Creary home until the custody of mother was transferred to the Virginia Beach Department of Social Services (DSS) in mid-July, 1991, in response to a petition of Mr. and Mrs. Creary for \u201crelief.\u201d Jordan thereafter remained briefly with Mr. and Mrs. Creary, and was reunited with mother on August 12, 1991, through a DSS placement in a \u201ctherapeutic foster home.\u201d However, mother \u201cran away\u201d shortly thereafter, and Jordan was transferred to \u201cregular\u201d foster care with petitioners where he has remained since September 4, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>DSS subsequently developed a \u201cfoster care plan,\u201d which was submitted to and approved by the J &amp; D Court, to place mother in a \u201cresidential group\u201d setting and Jordan with relatives or \u201cother appropriate\u201d persons, subject to visitation with mother. The plan was intended to provide for Jordan\u2019s physical needs in a \u201cnurturing and stimulating environment,\u201d while \u201cstabiliz[ing] [mother] psychologically and emotionally\u201d with a \u201ctreatment plan ... to enable her to parent\u201d Jordan \u201cin the future.\u201d These \u201ctreatment goals\u201d were disrupted, however, by mother\u2019s persistent \u201crunaway behavior\u201d throughout the remainder of 1991 and into early 1992. <em>As </em>a result, petitioners moved the J &amp; D Court for custody of Jordan, and DSS petitioned to terminate the parental rights of both mother and the unknown father. The DSS petition was accompanied by a second foster care plan, dated June 26, 1992, which documented termination as \u201cbeing in the best interests of the child.\u201d Code \u00a7 16.1-283(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Several \u201chome studies,\u201d psychological and like assessments of the parties involved were undertaken incidental to these petitions. The record discloses that mother \u201ctested ... borderline mental retarded\u201d and evidenced a \u201chigh risk for abuse/neglect\u201d of Jordan. She displayed \u201cparenting practices of corporal punishment, ... rejection of [Jordan] for failure to comply with an order and appeasing [him] by allowing an inappropriate activity.\u201d Mother and Jordan were \u201cemotionally distanced,\u201d and she \u201clack[ed] empathy.\u201d Jordan\u2019s \u201cinteraction\u201d with mother \u201cwas ... evocative of one between a babysitter and a child.\u201d Observations of Jordan following visitation with mother \u201crevealed a high level of demandingness, disorganized, ... difficult\u201d and \u201canxious behaviors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Evaluations of Jordan characterized a \u201ccheerful,\u201d \u201calert,\u201d \u201ccurious,\u201d \u201cattentive\u201d child of \u201caverage\u201d intelligence, without noted physical disability. He exhibited significant \u201cattachment,\u201d a \u201cparent-child interaction,\u201d with his foster mother, petitioner Mrs. Lecky. Petitioners have provided Jordan with a \u201cstable environment\u201d of \u201crules and expectations^] ... stated and enforced with ... loving [and] understanding,\u201d essential to his development into a \u201csecure, productive, law abiding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>citizen.\u201d Jordan \u201cresponds positively\u201d to the \u201cappropriate parenting attitudes, and ... sensitive ... style\u201d of Mrs. Lecky. Separation from petitioners would be disruptive and \u201charmful\u201d to Jordan, and mother\u2019s ability to provide his resulting need for emotional support was termed \u201cquestionable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">A hearing before the J &amp; D Court on the consolidated petitions was originally scheduled for August 14, 1992, but postponed until December 3, 1992, on motion of DSS because mother had demonstrated \u201cprogress toward having Jordan returned to her custody.\u201d This improvement in \u201cparenting skills\u201d continued until the December hearing, and the J &amp; D Court then granted custody of Jordan to petitioners, but denied the DSS termination petition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, mother\u2019s \u201crunaway\u201d and attendant irresponsible behavior reoccurred shortly thereafter, prompting the instant petition on June 25, 1993, and related November 3, 1993 order of the J &amp; D Court to terminate her parental rights. Although evidence at the January 6, 1994 hearing on appeal to the trial court indicated that mother was again \u201cdoing well\u201d in a \u201cgroup home,\u201d this followed yet another \u201crunaway\u201d episode the preceding month.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">At the conclusion of the <em>ore terms </em>hearing on appeal to the trial court, the court concluded that \u201ctermination [was] in the best interests of the child ... and that [mother] has been unwilling and unable to remedy substantially the conditions which led to the foster care placement of the child ... notwithstanding the reasonable and appropriate efforts of the [DSS] to such end.\u201d The court recognized that, absent \u201cgood cause,\u201d Code \u00a7 16.1-283(0(2) required a parent to resolve such \u201cconditions\u201d within a \u201creasonable period not to exceed twelve months.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, finding that \u201cthe statute, ... does not contemplate a sixteen-year-old parent and that ... \u2018a reasonable period of time\u2019 is different for a minor than for an adult,\u201d the court determined that the \u201cage of the mother\u201d constituted \u201cgood cause\u201d for her failure to satisfy the \u201c \u2018rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>sonable time\u2019 standard\u201d of Code \u00a7 16.1-288(C)(2) and denied termination. <em>See generally id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">Code \u00a7 16.1-288 embodies \u201c[t]he statutory scheme for the ... termination of residual parental rights in this Commonwealth.\u201d <em>Rader v. Montgomery County Dep\u2019t of Social Servs., </em>5 Va.App. 523, 526, 365 S.E.2d 234, 235 (1988). This \u201cscheme provides detailed procedures designed to protect the rights of the parents and their child,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 526, 365 S.E.2d at 236-36, balancing their interests while seeking to preserve the family. <em>Kaywood v. Halifax County Dep\u2019t of Social Servs., </em>10 Va.App. 535, 539, 394 S.E.2d 492, 494 (1990). However, we have consistently held that \u201c[t]he child\u2019s best interest is the paramount concern.\u201d <em>Wright v. Alexandria Div. of Social Servs., </em>16 Va.App. 821, 827, 433 S.E.2d 500, 503 (1993), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 115 S.Ct. 651, 130 L.Ed.2d 555 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">Code \u00a7 16.1-283(C)(2) provides, in pertinent part, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-7\">[t]he residual parental rights of a parent or parents of a child placed in foster care as a result of court commitment ... may be terminated if the court finds, based upon clear and convincing evidence, that it is in the best interests of the child and that ... [t]he parent or parents, without good cause, have been unwilling or unable <em>within a reasonable period not to exceed twelve months </em>to remedy substantially the conditions which led to the child\u2019s foster care placement, notwithstanding the reasonable and appropriate efforts of ... rehabilitative agencies to such end.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">(Emphasis added). The statute identifies circumstances which \u201cshall constitute prima facie evidence of the conditions\u201d requisite to termination, including failure by the parent or parents, \u201cwithout good cause, ... to make reasonable progress towards the elimination of the conditions which led to the child\u2019s foster care placement in accordance with their obligations under and within the time limits or goals set forth in a foster care plan filed with the court.\u201d Code \u00a7 16.1-283(0(3); <em>see Logan v. Fairfax County Dep\u2019t of Human Dev., </em>13 Va.App. 123, 130, 409 S.E.2d 460, 464 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>The statute clearly contemplates that efforts to resolve the \u201cconditions\u201d relevant to termination are constrained by time. Code \u00a7 16.1-283(C)(2). Absent \u201cgood cause,\u201d a parent or parents receiving the \u201creasonable and appropriate\u201d services of \u201crehabilitative agencies\u201d must \u201cremedy substantially\u201d the \u201cconditions which led to ... foster care\u201d of the child in a \u201creasonable period not to exceed twelve months.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This provision protects the family unit and attendant rights of both parents and child, while assuring resolution of the parent/child relationship without interminable delay. \u201cIt is clearly not in the best interests of a child to spend a lengthy period of time waiting to find out when, or even if, a parent will be capable of resuming ... responsibilities.\u201d <em>Kaywood, </em>10 Va.App. at 540, 394 S.E.2d at 495.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Here, the record clearly supports the trial court\u2019s determination that (1) termination was in Jordan\u2019s best interests, and (2) that mother had been either unwilling or unable to remedy those conditions which led to Jordan\u2019s placement in foster care within twelve months, notwithstanding the significant efforts of DSS. Accordingly, these requirements of Code \u00a7 16.1-283(C) indispensable to termination of a mother\u2019s parental rights were satisfied. Nevertheless, the court declined to terminate because mother\u2019s \u201cage\u201d provided \u201cgood cause\u201d or excuse for her unwillingness or inability to cure timely the circumstances which gave rise to foster care.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">While age of the parent or parents is doubtless an appropriate consideration in assessing \u201cgood cause\u201d in the context of Code \u00a7 16.1-283(C), it is not a circumstance which prevails over the best interests of the child. Nothing in this record attributes mother\u2019s parental deficiencies to her age or suggests that the mere passage of time would resolve her difficulties. Thus, further delay would prolong Jordan\u2019s familial instability without the promise of benefit to him, a result clearly contrary to the child\u2019s best interests. Under such circumstances, mother\u2019s age does not alone constitute good cause to excuse her failure to resolve the conditions which prompted Jordan\u2019s foster care in accordance with statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>We turn next to mother\u2019s assignments of cross-error and first address her challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence to prove that termination serves Jordan\u2019s best interests. The evidence was overwhelming that mother pursued an unstable and irresponsible lifestyle, incompatible with Jordan\u2019s needs and reflective of an indifference to his interests. This conduct spanned the child\u2019s entire life, despite the best efforts and substantial resources of DSS to assist and redirect mother in her behavior and parenting skills. Guided by Jordan\u2019s best interest, the record therefore provided the requisite \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d that termination of mother\u2019s residual parental rights in Jordan was the appropriate statutory remedy. Code \u00a7 16.1-283(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Deficiencies in the record preclude our consideration of mother\u2019s remaining arguments. Mother objected to the order of the trial court only \u201con the issue of finding that termination is in the best interests of Jordan Reid.\u201d \u201cNo ruling of the trial court ... will be considered as a basis for reversal unless the objection was stated together with the grounds therefor <em>at the time of the ruling, </em>except for good cause shown or to enable the Court ... to attain the ends of justice.\u201d Rule 5A:18 (emphasis added). Further, we will not review an issue first argued on appeal. <em>Jacques v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 591, 593, 405 S.E.2d 630, 631 (1991) (citations omitted). A contrary rule would \u201c \u2018deny the trial court the opportunity to consider and weigh, and, if necessary, reconsider before finally ruling.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mounce v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 433, 435, 357 S.E.2d 742, 744 (1987) (quoting <em>Floyd v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 575, 584, 249 S.E.2d 171, 176 (1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">During oral argument, mother urged that we apply the \u201cends of justice\u201d exception to the procedurally defaulted arguments. <em>See </em>Rule 5A:18; <em>see also Mounce, </em>4 Va.App. at 436, 357 S.E.2d at 744. However, \u201cto avail [herself] of the rule [she] had to affirmatively show ... that the error [was] clear, substantial and material,\u201d constituting a \u201cmiscarriage of justice,\u201d an \u201cobvious injustice.\u201d <em>Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>8 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>Va.App. 126, 132, 380 S.E.2d 8, 11 (1989). Such circumstances are not demonstrated by this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court and order the residual parental rights of mother terminated in accordance with Code \u00a7 16.1-283(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b354-7\">.
