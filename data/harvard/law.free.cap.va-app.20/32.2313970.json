Because we conclude that the questioning was within the scope of the witness\u2019s direct testimony, we hold that the trial judge did not err, and we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-11\">Berry was indicted for aggravated sexual battery, rape, and breaking and entering, while armed, with the intent to commit rape. At trial, the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence proved that the victim received a series of obscene phone calls beginning in the spring of 1992. During the calls, the caller asked her \u201cwhy [she] wore clothes to show up [her] breasts in public?\u201d Usually, the calls were received on Fridays at 6 a.m. When the victim received a similar call on October 27, 1992, she wrote the time and originating number as shown on an identification device attached to her telephone. Using this information, the police located the telephone from which the call was made and obtained a videotape from a surveillance camera that recorded persons using that telephone. The videotape showed Berry using the telephone at the approximate time the October 27 call originated. The evidence proved that another call originated from a telephone in a fabric shop the same day Berry visited the shop and used the telephone.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>The evidence further proved that on the morning of September 18, 1992, at 6 a.m., the victim responded to a knock at her door. A man with a knife in his hand pushed her into her house and sexually assaulted her. She testified that the man said, \u201cwhy do [you] like to show up [your] body in public, talking about ... breasts.\u201d From a photographic spread and in court, the victim identified Berry as the man who entered her home and assaulted her. The victim also listened to several voice samples and recognized a voice, that of Berry, as being the same as the person who made the obscene calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">Berry\u2019s wife testified as a defense witness. On direct examination, Berry\u2019s trial counsel asked her several questions concerning the family\u2019s morning \u201croutine.\u201d She testified that she and Berry arose every morning at 6:30 a.m. She stated that their alarm clock was set for 6:00 a.m.; however, she said that they remained in bed until 6:30 a.m. She also testified that she was a light sleeper and would have known if Berry arose before 6:30 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">During cross-examination, the prosecutor asked whether she told a friend that her husband admitted making obscene phone calls to the victim. Berry\u2019s counsel objected on the ground that the question was beyond the scope of the direct examination and stated that the direct examination concerned only the events of September 18. The trial judge overruled the objection.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-7\">Berry\u2019s wife then testified on cross-examination as follows: Q Mrs. Berry, my question would be, do you recall having a conversation with Bob Scott in which you told him that your husband admitted making the phone calls to Ms. Clements to you, and that the gist of the conversation was that you were concerned about your status of your relationship you were having with your husband because you knew he made those phone calls to Ms. Clements. Do you recall having that conversation with Bob Scott?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-8\">A I don\u2019t recall, no, but\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-9\">Q Could you have had that conversation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-10\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>Q Your husband admitted making the phone calls to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Acy\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-6\">Q That being the case, Ms. Berry, if I indicated to you that the evidence showed that some of these phone calls that he admitted making to you were at 6 o\u2019clock in the morning, how can you tell this jury that his common practice was to sleep in, in the morning, and that he was always at home?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-7\">A I don\u2019t think he made any phone calls at 6 o\u2019clock in the morning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-8\">Q Is there any reason why you would have told Mr. Scott that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-9\">A I didn\u2019t tell Mr. Scott that they were at 6 o\u2019clock in the morning.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-10\">On redirect examination, Berry\u2019s counsel elicited from her testimony that Berry did not get out of bed in sufficient time to make a telephone call at 6 a.m. She testified that she would have known if he had done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-12\">\u201c[A] witness may be cross-examined upon any testimony given by him [or her] in chief.\u201d <em>Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>128 Va. 698, 713, 104 S.E. 853, 858 (1920). <em>Accord Fisher v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 447, 455, 431 S.E.2d 886, 891 (1993). If the question is \u201crelevant to the facts testified to\u201d by the witness on direct examination or if the question tends \u201cto test the veracity or credibility of the witness,\u201d the question is proper. <em>Williams, </em>128 Va. at 714, 104 S.E. at 858.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-13\">Contrary to Berry\u2019s assertion that the witness\u2019s direct testimony was confined to the events of a specific date only, the record reflects that the questions posed to the witness on direct examination sought testimony concerning generalized conduct. For example, the witness testified as follows on direct examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-14\">Q What time do you go to work every day?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>A I have to be there at 8:30, I leave my home normally around 7:30.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-5\">Q When you say normally, is that the normal routine?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AY\">A Yes, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-6\">Q And does that include the routine that [Berry] has also?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Axv\">A Yes. Since I worked so far away, our normal routine was to get up together around 6:30, and I would go on and prepare myself to go to work and he would feed, dress and take care of the children so that I wouldn\u2019t have to waste any time to drive across town.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-7\">Q So you get up approximately 6:30 every morning?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-8\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-9\">Q Do you have your alarm clock set for that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-10\">A Actually, it\u2019s set for around 6:00, and then snoozes for about half an hour.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-11\">Q Did you notice anything unusual in September that occurred?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-12\">A No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-13\">Q So your routine would have been followed every day? A Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-14\">This testimony was offered to prove that Berry did not arise before 6:30 a.m. and that the witness had direct knowledge of Berry\u2019s conduct. The trier of fact could have inferred from this testimony, if believed, that Berry could not have been the person who telephoned the victim prior to the assault. The cross-examination was designed to test both the witness\u2019s basis to know whether Berry had, on occasions, arisen in time to make telephone calls and the witness\u2019s veracity and credibility when she testified that Berry never arose before 6:30 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-15\">Because the cross-examination related to a material matter placed in issue by the witness\u2019s direct testimony and because the questioning had the tendency to impeach the veracity of the witness, the trial judge did not err in permitting the inquiry. <em>See Hummel v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 548, 550, 231 S.E.2d 216, 217 (1977) (\u201cWhile it is true that the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>[judge] may, in the exercise of discretion, limit cross-examination of a witness within reasonable bounds, that does not mean that in the exercise of such judicial discretion [the trial judge] should exclude relevant evidence which tends to attack the credibility of a witness who is not a defendant\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
