Henderson. The sole issue on appeal is whether the evidence was sufficient to support the commission\u2019s finding that appellee\u2019s injury \u201carose out of\u2019 his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Garland Henderson is a correctional officer at the Marion Correctional Treatment Center. He testified that on April 23, at approximately 10:15 p.m. as he was returning to the main building,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-6\">I\u2019d just got through acknowledging the tower officer in tower two, which is to the left of the steps, and I started down the steps and I was looking at tower one to see if the officer there was seeing me coming. And, I went to put my right foot down on I think it\u2019s the third or fourth step, which it\u2019s in the report but I can\u2019t remember which one it was. My heel slid off the steps, I had onto the rail, and I put all the weight on the left knee when I did. I didn\u2019t actually fall, but when my foot slipped down to the next step on the right foot all my weight to my left knee and when I went something popped in my knee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">The commission found that, because Henderson\u2019s job responsibilities caused him to watch the tower guards rather than the steps, how he performed his job provided the \u201ccritical link\u201d between the conditions of the workplace and the injury, and therefore, Henderson\u2019s injury arose out of his employment. <em>See County of Chesterfield v. Johnson, </em>237 Va. 180, 186, 376 S.E.2d 73, 76 (1989). We affirm that holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">An injury, to be compensable under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, must \u201carise out of\u2019 and be \u201cin the course of\u2019 employment. Code \u00a7 65.2-101. <em>See Johnson, </em>237 Va. at 183, 376 S.E.2d at 74. \u201cArising out of\u2019 refers to the origin or. cause of the injury. <em>Richmond Memorial Hospital v. Crane, </em>222 Va. 283, 285, 278 S.E.2d 877, 878 (1981). Whether an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>accident arises out of employment is a mixed question of law and fact which is reviewable on appeal. <em>Mullins v. Westmoreland Coal Co., </em>10 Va.App. 304, 307, 391 S.E.2d 609, 611 (1990). An injury arises out of the employment if there is apparent to the rational mind a causal connection between the conditions under which the work is required to be performed and the resulting injury. <em>United Parcel Service v. Fetterman, </em>230 Va. 257, 258, 336 S.E.2d 892, 893 (1985). An injury does not arise out of one\u2019s employment if it is caused by \u201ca hazard to which the employee would have been equally exposed apart from the employment.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>237 Va. at 183, 376 S.E.2d at 75. However, if an injury \u201chas followed as a natural incident of the work and has been a result of an exposure occasioned by the nature of the employment,\u201d then the injury \u201carises out of\u2019 the employment. <em>Fetterman, </em>230 Va. at 258, 336 S.E.2d at 893.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">Virginia has adopted an \u201cactual risk\u201d test and has rejected the \u201cpositional risk\u201d test followed by other jurisdictions. <em>See Johnson, </em>237 Va. at 185, 376 S.E.2d at 75-76. The actual risk test \u201c \u2018requires only that the employment expose the workman to a particular danger from which he was injured, notwithstanding the exposure of the public generally to like risks.\u2019\u201d <em>Olsten v. Leftwich, </em>230 Va. 317, 319, 336 S.E.2d 893, 894 (1985) (quoting <em>Lucas v. Lucas, </em>212 Va. 561, 563, 186 S.E.2d 63, 64 (1972)).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">. Officer Henderson testified at the evidentiary hearing that he was \u201ctrained to observe\u201d and that his work duties included \u201c[a]ll security, security and safety of the inmates and the other employees.\u201d Henderson testified that every time he walked through the correctional unit, he checked the tower officers \u201cto make sure they\u2019re alert and just wave at them and have them wave back.\u201d Henderson testified that on the day he slipped, he had just acknowledged tower two, was descending the stairs, and was observing tower one when the accident occurred. Observation of the guard towers was one of the security functions of his employment. The way in which he performed this aspect of his job increased his risk of falling on this occasion and directly contributed to cause his fall and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>injury. <em>Cf. Fetterman, </em>230 Va. at 259, 336 S.E.2d at 893. He would not have been equally exposed to the risk apart from his duty to observe the guard towers and provide security at the facility. <em>Cf. Bradshaw v. Aronovitch, </em>170 Va. 329, 335, 196 S.E. 684, 686 (1938). Henderson\u2019s injury occurred because of the performance of his job duties in a particular manner. Therefore, the cause of the injury was not \u201cunrelated to any hazard common to the workplace.\u201d <em>Fetterman, </em>230 Va. at 259, 336 S.E.2d at 893. Because Henderson\u2019s employment exposed him to a danger that caused his injury, it arose out of his employment. <em>Id. </em>The commission did not err in its award of medical benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
