On appeal, he contends (1) the trial court erred in failing to grant his motion to strike on the basis that a savings and loan association is not a \u201cbanking house\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 18.2-93; (2) the trial court erred in granting a jury instruction that used the term \u201cbanking house\u201d without defining the term; and (3) the trial judge abused his discretion in admitting testimony from three witnesses that they recognized appellant from a prior robbery he committed at the same savings and loan association. We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">On February 20, 1993, at about noon, a robber entered Providence Savings and Loan Association in Alexandria. He approached Diana Perez, a teller, pulled out a gun and said, \u201cTake the money out or I\u2019ll shoot.\u201d The robber also said, \u201cDon\u2019t give me the dye pack this time.\u201d Manoj Pattni, the assistant manager, told Perez to comply with the robber\u2019s request. Perez placed the money on the counter. The robber put the money in his jacket pocket and left the bank. Pattni testified that the robber was in the bank for about forty-five seconds.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>Lee Homsi, branch manager, was standing \u201cfive to seven feet\u201d away from the robber and saw him demand and receive the money from Perez. Homsi then followed the robber outside of the bank and saw him enter a car. Later, Homsi, Pattni, Perez and another eyewitness, Yvette Terrell, gave similar descriptions of the robber to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">On March 5, 1993, Pattni, Perez, and Homsi viewed a photo spread. All three of the witnesses picked out appellant\u2019s picture as that of the robber, Perez positively identified appellant at the photo spread. Homsi and Pattni tentatively identified appellant at the photo spread. On April 1, 1993, Pattni, Perez, Homsi, and Terrell identified appellant in a live lineup.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">Pattni, Perez, and Homsi testified that they recognized appellant from a previous robbery he had committed at the same savings and loan association in October of 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">\n<em>I. The \u201cBanking House\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">\u201c[B]eeause [Code \u00a7 18.2-93] is penal in nature, it must be strictly construed, and any ambiguity or reasonable doubt as to its meaning must be resolved in [appellant\u2019s favor. \u2018This does not mean, however, that [appellant] is entitled to a favorable result based upon an unreasonably restrictive interpretation of the statute.\u2019\u201d <em>Mason v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 260, 262, 430 S.E.2d 543, 543-44 (1993) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">\u201cWhen the wording of a statute is clear and unambiguous, its plain meaning is to be accepted without resort to rules of interpretation.\u201d <em>Commonwealth Dep\u2019t of Mines, Minerals &amp; Energy v. May Bros., Inc., </em>11 Va.App. 115, 118, 396 S.E.2d 695, 696 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-10\">Code \u00a7 18.2-93 provides that \u201c[i]f any person, armed with a deadly weapon, shall enter any banking house, ... with intent to commit larceny ... he shall be guilty of a Class 2 felony.\u201d The Code does not define \u201cbanking house.\u201d Appellant interprets the statute to apply only to institutions \u201cexclusively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>engaged in the banking business.\u201d In support of his position, appellant cites the Encyclopedia of Banking and Finance which defines \u201cbanking house\u201d as \u201c[t]he premises or building in which a bank conducts its business.\u201d <em>Encyclopedia of Banking and Finance </em>90 (9th ed. 1991). He further argues that because a savings and loan association is not a \u201cbank,\u201d it is not engaged in the banking business. Therefore, appellant concludes Providence Savings and Loan Association is not a \u201cbanking house\u201d within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AcC\">Recognizing the doctrine that robbery is a crime against the person, and not against a house or other inanimate thing, the Legislature passed the act of 1928 [now Code \u00a7 18.2-93]....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-5\">[T]he crime is complete when a person armed with a deadly weapon enters a banking house, in the day time or in the night time, with intent to commit larceny, etc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-6\"><em>Falden v. Commonwealth, </em>167 Va. 542, 546-47, 189 S.E. 326, 328 (1937). The purpose of Code \u00a7 18.2-93 is to establish as a felony the entry of \u201cany banking house,\u201d while armed with a deadly weapon, with the intent to commit larceny.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">\u201cBanking\u201d is defined, in part, as \u201creceiving deposits payable on demand; [and] making loans of money on collateral security.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>146 (6th ed. 1990). Lee Homsi testified that Providence Savings and Loan Association \u201cfunctions ... in the form of a banking institution.\u201d Homsi further stated that the savings and loan association offers services such as checking accounts, savings accounts, and loans. Therefore, Providence Savings and Loan Association is in the \u201cbanking business\u201d and the premises wherein this business is conducted is a \u201cbanking house\u201d within the purview of Code \u00a7 18.2-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">Technical distinctions in the definitions of \u201cbank\u201d and \u201csavings and loan association\u201d provided for regulatory purposes, and found in the Banking and Finance title of the Code, do not bar inclusion of both types of financial institutions within the general descriptive term \u201cbanking house\u201d as used in Code \u00a7 18.2-93. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 6.'l-4(l) and 6.1-194.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>\u201cWe must determine the purpose and scope of the [statute] by construing the intent of our legislature from the language and \u2018the plain meaning of the words\u2019 used in the statute. Where the intent is clear from a plain reading of ... the statute, we must adhere to the pronouncement of our legislature.\u201d <em>Erickson-Dickson v. Erickson-Dickson, </em>12 Va.App. 381, 386-87, 404 S.E.2d 388, 391 (1991) (citation omitted). To construe the statute as appellant suggests would require us to conclude that the intent of the legislature was to punish armed entry into a \u201cbank,\u201d but not to punish armed entry into a \u201csavings and loan association.\u201d Such an interpretation is contrary to the legislative intent and requires \u201can unreasonably restrictive interpretation of the statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">In fact, this Court and the Supreme Court have upheld convictions under Code \u00a7 18.2-93 that involved the robbery of savings and loan associations. <em>Dorantes v. Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 383, 281 S.E.2d 823 (1981); <em>Hill v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va.App. 683, 347 S.E.2d 913 (1986). <em>Dorantes </em>involved the robbery of the Washington and Lee Savings and Loan Association. In its opinion, the Supreme Court specifically referred to the savings and loan association as a \u201cbanking house\u201d although it reversed the conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-93 on other grounds. The Court stated, \u201c[n]ot excluded by the evidence in this case is the reasonable hypothesis the robbers left their weapons in the getaway car before entering the banking house involved in the instant robbery.\u201d <em>Dorantes, </em>222 Va. at 386, 281 S.E.2d at 825.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">We hold that the trial judge properly ruled that, for the purpose of Code \u00a7 18.2-93, the savings and loan association was a \u201cbanking house.\u201d Accordingly, the trial judge did not err in denying appellant\u2019s motion to strike the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">\n<em>II. The Challenged Jury Instruction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">Appellant objected to jury instruction number four, which stated the elements of the offense as defined by Code \u00a7 18.2-93. The instruction read, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-9\">The defendant is charged with the crime of entering a banking house while armed with intent to commit larceny.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>The Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt each of the following elements of that crime:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-5\">(1) That the defendant entered a banking house while armed with a deadly weapon; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-6\">(2) That he did so with intent to steal money, bonds, notes or other evidence of debt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">Appellant objected to the instruction because it contained the phrase \u201cbanking house.\u201d He argues that the term \u201cbank\u201d should have been used because a similar Virginia Model Jury Instruction uses the word \u201cbank.\u201d Appellant also asserts that the jury was \u201cleft to speculate\u201d on the definition of \u201cbanking house\u201d because it was not instructed on the meaning of the phrase.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">The challenged jury instruction stated the law clearly and related to issues which the evidence fairly raised. <em>See Darnell v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 485, 488, 370 S.E.2d 717, 719 (1988). The language of the instruction paralleled the language of the statute and the indictment. In accordance with the previous analysis, the plain meaning of the phrase \u201cbanking house\u201d encompassed the business of the savings and loan association. Therefore, \u201cbanking house\u201d was an appropriate expression to use in the jury instruction. Thus, the instruction withstands review on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">\n<em>III. Prior Robbery Testimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AGh\">As a general rule, \u201c\u2018proof tending to show an accused committed other crimes at other times is incompetent and inadmissible for the purpose of showing commission of the particular crime charged.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jimmerson v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 388, 389-90, 411 S.E.2d 446, 447 (1991) (citation omitted). \u201cHowever, such evidence may be admissible if it \u2018tends to prove any other relevant fact of the offense charged, and is otherwise admissible.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lewis v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 574, 579, 383 S.E.2d 736, 739 (1989) <em>(en </em>banc) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">The accuracy of the savings and loan employees\u2019 identifications of appellant was challenged on cross-examination. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>Three of those employees were then allowed to testify that they recognized appellant from another robbery at the same savings and loan association four months earlier. Manoj Pattni and Diana Perez also testified that appellant said, \u201cDon\u2019t give me the dye pack <em>this time.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">The trial court instructed the jury that the evidence of the prior robbery, if the jury believed it, was admissible only for the purpose of assessing the accuracy of the witnesses\u2019 identifications of appellant as the person who committed the robbery charged. The trial judge further instructed the jury not to consider the evidence \u201cas tending to show in any other way the Defendant\u2019s guilt of the offense for which he [was] on trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">\u201cOnce a jury is instructed regarding the use or limitations placed upon specific evidence, they are presumed to follow such instructions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 580, 383 S.E.2d at 740. Nothing in the record indicates that the jury did not follow the trial judge\u2019s clear instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">The responsibility for balancing whether the probative value of the evidence of the prior robbery outweighed any incidental prejudice to appellant is left largely within the sound discretion of the trial judge. <em>Curtis v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 636, 638-39, 352 S.E.2d 536, 538 (1987). Identification was a central issue in the case. The testimony was probative in that it explained and confirmed the three witnesses\u2019 ability to identify appellant. Although the prior robbery occurred over four months prior to the February 20,1993 robbery, all three of the eyewitnesses positively identified appellant as the criminal agent in the October, 1992 robbery. These circumstances add to the credibility of the identifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">The trial judge also used prudence in receiving the evidence by issuing the cautionary instruction. We find no abuse of discretion in admitting evidence of the prior robbery for the limited purpose of assessing the accuracy of the witnesses\u2019 identifications of appellant. <em>See Rodriguez v. Commonwealth, </em>\u2014 Va.-, 454 S.E.2d 725 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
