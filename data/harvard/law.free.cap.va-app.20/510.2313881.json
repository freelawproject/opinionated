Defendant contends on appeal that the \u201ccrime did not exist\u201d because no attendant penalty was prescribed by statute. We agree and reverse the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">On the date of the instant offense, August 10, 1993, Code \u00a7 18.2-32 defined \u201c[a]ll murder[,] other than capital murder and murder in the first degree[,]\u201d as \u201cmurder of the second degree,\u201d \u201cpunishable by confinement ... for not less than five <em>nor more than forty years\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added). At that time, Code \u00a7 18.2-26 prescribed the several punishments for \u201cattempts to commit an offense which is a noncapital felony,\u201d differentiating each by specific reference to the <em>\u201cmaximum punishment\u201d </em>of the underlying consummated crime. <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added); <em>see also </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-10. However, former Code \u00a7 18.2-26 did not provide a punishment for an attempted felony which was punishable by confinement for a maximum of <em>forty years. </em>Thus, although defendant\u2019s conduct may have been proscribed by statute, it was an offense without a penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-10\">A review of the legislative history of Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-32 and 18.2-26 discloses that Code \u00a7 18.2-32 was amended during the 1993 session of the General Assembly, increasing the punishment for second degree murder from a Class 3 felony, \u201cnot less than five years nor more than twenty years,\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-10, to \u201cnot less than five nor more than forty years.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-32. However, Code \u00a7 18.2-26 was not correspondingly amended to embrace the enhanced penalty for a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-32 until the 1994 session of the legislature. The Commonwealth reasons that this \u201chistory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>... shows that an oversight occurred\u201d urging that we \u201cgive life to the intent of the legislature\u201d and affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">We recognize that \u201cthe primary objective of statutory construction is to ascertain and give effect to legislative intent.\u201d <em>Crews v. Commonwealth, 3 </em>Va.App. 531, 535-36, 352 S.E.2d 1, 3 (1987) (citation omitted). However, \u201c[i]t is ... fundamental ... that penal statutes \u2018must be strictly construed against the state and limited in application to cases falling clearly within the language of the statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Knott, </em>11 Va.App. 44, 47, 396 S.E.2d 148, 150 (1990) (quoting <em>Crews, </em>3 Va.App. at 536, 352 S.E.2d at 3). \u2018Words of a penal law will not be extended by implication to the prejudice of the accused, and all reasonable doubt must be resolved in his favor.\u201d <em>Waller v. Commonwealth, </em>192 Va. 83, 88, 63 S.E.2d 713, 716 (1951) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">\u201c[A] crime is made up of two parts, forbidden conduct and a prescribed penalty.' The former without the latter is no crime.\u201d Wayne R. LaFave &amp; Austin W. Scott, Jr., <em>Substantive Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 1.2(d) (1986); <em>see United States v. Evans, </em>333 U.S. 483, 486, 68 S.Ct. 634, 636, 92 L.Ed. 823 (1948); <em>State v. Fair Lawn Serv. Ctr., Inc., </em>20 N.J. 468, 120 A.2d 233, 235 (1956); <em>Redding v. State, </em>165 Neb. 307, 85 N.W.2d 647, 652 (1957); <em>State v. Ching, </em>62 Haw. 656, 619 P.2d 93, 94 (1980). Criminal penalties \u201cshould be provided with that degree of clarity that characterizes all criminal law, to the end that its application must not be left to conjecture.\u201d <em>McNary v. State, </em>128 Ohio St. 497, 191 N.E. 733, 740 (1934). If a criminal statute or ordinance does not specify a penalty, it is beyond our province to prescribe one on the assumption that the deficiency was simply an \u201coversight.\u201d <em>See Evans, </em>333 U.S. at 486, 68 S.Ct. at 636; <em>Fair Lawn Serv. Ctr., </em>120 A.2d at 236. \u201c[Djefining crimes and fixing penalties are legislative, not judicial, functions.\u201d <em>Evans, </em>333 U.S. at 486, 68 S.Ct. at 636.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">Although the amendments to Code \u00a7 18.2-26 subsequent to defendant\u2019s misconduct included attempts at Code \u00a7 18.2-32 offenses, the revised statute may not retroactively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>assign punishment to prior acts. <em>See Brushy Ridge Coal Co. v. Blevins, </em>6 Va.App. 78, 78-79, 367 S.E.2d 204, 207 (1988) (quoting <em>Duffy v. Hartsock, </em>187 Va. 406, 419, 46 S.E.2d 570, 576 (1948)).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">Defendant was, therefore, convicted for conduct which constituted no crime at the time of the offense. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
