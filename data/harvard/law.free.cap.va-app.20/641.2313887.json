Satchell, </em>15 Va.App. 127, 422 S.E.2d 412 (1992) <em>(Satchell I), </em>an appeal by the Commonwealth pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-398, a panel of this Court reversed the trial court\u2019s suppression of evidence relating to cocaine found on Satchell\u2019s person and remanded the case for trial. In obedience to that mandate, the trial court admitted the cocaine, and a description of its seizure, into evidence. On appeal from his resulting conviction of possession of cocaine and invoking Code \u00a7 19.2-409, Satchell contends that the cocaine and the circumstances of its discovery should have been excluded because they derived from an unlawful seizure of his person. We agree and reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-11\">This appeal was assigned initially to a three judge panel. However, thinking that the issues concerning the effect of our decision on interlocutory appeals and the review mandate of Code \u00a7 19.2-409 required a prompt full-Court decision, on motion of two members of the panel, we decided to consider this case <em>en banc. </em>Code \u00a7 17-116.02(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>The evidence adduced at the pretrial hearing on Satchell\u2019s initial motion to suppress disclosed that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-4\">In mid-afternoon on December 18, 1991, Sergeant John Buckovich, who was dressed in plain clothes and traveling in an unmarked police car, saw [Satchell] standing with two other individuals on a Richmond street comer known to Buckovich as an area for narcotics trafficking. Buckovich saw [Satchell] hand money to one man and receive something in return. The three men saw the police car as it approached and immediately started to walk away in separate directions. [Satchell] walked to a door stoop, but was unable to enter the locked door.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-5\">From these observations, Buckovich believed that criminal activity was transpiring. Buckovich, who had a badge around his neck, approached [Satchell] on the stoop and identified himself. He asked [Satchell], \u201cWhat\u2019s in your hand, pal?\u201d [Satchell] showed his left hand, which was empty. Buckovich then asked [Satchell] what was in his other hand. [Satchell] opened his right hand, which contained two packages of cocaine. Buckovich arrested [Satchell]. Buckovich testified that until he observed the cocaine and made the arrest, Satchell was free to leave at any time or to ignore Buckovich\u2019s questions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b690-6\"><em>Satchell I, </em>15 Va.App. at 129, 422 S.E.2d at 413. The trial court ruled that Buckovich\u2019s observations were insufficient to establish the level of suspicion required to justify a seizure of Satchell\u2019s person. The Commonwealth did not contest that ruling in <em>Satchell I </em>and does not contest it in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">The trial court found that a person in Satchell\u2019s position would reasonably have believed that he was not free to leave or to disregard Buckovich\u2019s questions. It ruled that Satchell had been seized and that the seizure, being unsupported by the requisite reasonable suspicion, was unlawful. It suppressed evidence of the cocaine and the circumstances surrounding its discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">The Commonwealth appealed the suppression ruling pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-398. Holding that, under the recited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>circumstances, Buckovich had not seized Satchell, a panel of this Court reversed the suppression ruling and remanded the case for trial. The panel noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-5\">[A] law enforcement officer does not violate the fourth amendment by merely approaching an individual in a public place and asking questions of the person if the individual is willing or chooses to remain and answer them. There must be some coercion or show of force or authority by the officer, measured by objective standards, that would cause a person so situated reasonably to have believed that he or she was required to comply with the officer\u2019s requests.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AMOO\"><em>Id. </em>at 131, 422 S.E.2d at 415 (citation omitted). The panel analyzed the facts as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-6\">Sergeant Buckovich approached Satchell in midday in public and asked him what was in his hand. The officer made no show of authority other than his presence, he was not in uniform, he displayed no weapon, he was a lone officer, and, insofar as the record reflects, he made no command nor adopted a threatening tone. A question, as directed by Buckovich, is less coercive than a demand, as made by the officer in <em>Baldwin [v. Commonwealth, </em>243 Va. 191, 413 S.E.2d 645 (1992) ]. In <em>Baldwin, </em>the police officer\u2019s demand, coupled with the shining of a floodlight and a request for identification, was held not to constitute a seizure. The Court found that a reasonably prudent person under those circumstances would not have believed his freedom of movement was restrained. In this case, the trial court ruled that a reasonably prudent person in Satchell\u2019s position, when approached by an officer and asked what was in his hand, would have believed he was not free to leave---- Absent factors of coerciveness or factors that would have confined Satchell, we find no evidence to support the ruling by the trial judge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b691-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 132, 422 S.E.2d at 415.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-10\">At trial upon remand, the trial court reopened the admissibility issue concerning the cocaine and the circumstances of its discovery. The evidence at trial established, in addition to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>scenario described in <em>Satchell I, </em>that four officers exited the police vehicle, that Buckovieh walked swiftly toward Satchell and followed him onto the porch of a nearby building, that Satchell attempted to enter the building but was prevented from doing so by a locked door, and that Buckovieh, although wearing plain clothes, displayed a visible firearm. Buckovieh testified that he \u201choped\u201d Satchell would comply with his request. He said that he would have pressed Satchell for compliance, although \u201cif he wanted to leave there was no way that I could keep him. I didn\u2019t have any right to hold him____\u201d Buckovieh acknowledged that he was attempting to conduct an investigative detention. Adhering to its previous factual findings and reaffirming its earlier conclusion that a reasonable person would not have felt free to leave under the circumstances, the trial court ruled, \u201cI am fully aware of my obligation to follow the holdings of the Court [of Appeals], and for that reason I deny [the objection to the evidence].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">Before addressing the merits of the case, we confront three threshold questions: (1) the reviewability of the issue decided in <em>Satchell I, </em>(2) the context of review, and (3) the standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">\n<em>Reviewability</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b692-9\">Relying on <em>Commonwealth v. Burns, </em>240 Va. 171, 173-74, 395 S.E.2d 456, 457 (1990), and <em>Robinson v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 540, 543, 413 S.E.2d 661, 662 (1992), the Commonwealth contends that the holding in <em>Satchell I </em>is <em>stare decisis </em>as to the admissibility issue raised in this appeal. We find this argument unpersuasive. <em>Bums </em>and <em>Robinson </em>concerned rules of law developed in the normal appellate process. The holding in <em>Satchell I </em>addressed the admissibility of specific items of evidence, not in the context of the normal appellate process, but in the context of a special, prospective, interlocutory, and limited appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-10\">Code \u00a7 19.2-408 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>The decision of the Court of Appeals shall be final for purposes of an appeal pursuant to \u00a7 19.2-398 ... and no further pretrial appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">No provision is made for rehearing <em>en banc. </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-409 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-6\">Such finality of the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision shall not preclude a defendant, if he is convicted, from requesting the Court of Appeals or Supreme Court on direct appeal to reconsider an issue which was the subject of the pretrial appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">The purpose of Chapter 25 of Title 19.2 of the Code (\u00a7\u00a7 19.2-398, <em>et seq.) </em>is to afford the Commonwealth a limited right of appeal under certain carefully specified circumstances. Those appeals are pre-trial, and the statutory scheme plainly contemplates that rulings on such appeals are interlocutory and reversible, as are the reviewed trial court rulings. This conclusion is made plain by the early finality and limitation of appellate review set forth in Code \u00a7 19.2-408 and by the express provision for reconsideration on direct appeal set forth in Code \u00a7 19.2-409. Thus, the holding in <em>Satchell I </em>is not <em>stare decisis </em>as to the admissibility issue raised in this appeal, and that issue is fully reviewable.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">\n<em>The Context of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b693-9\">Although we consider in this appeal the same issue of admissibility considered in <em>Satchell I, </em>this case is not a rehearing of <em>Satchell I. </em>The error assigned is to the trial court\u2019s admission of the questioned evidence at trial, following remand under <em>Satchell I. </em>Thus, our inquiry is not confined to the facts before the trial court when it made its initial suppression ruling. Rather, we consider all the facts underlying the ruling admitting the evidence. Had the trial court heard no further evidence on the subject but simply admitted the evidence in obedience to the mandate of <em>Satchell I, </em>our inquiry would, of necessity, address only the circumstances underlying the holding in <em>Satchell I. </em>However, because the trial court heard further evidence on the matter, our inquiry must ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>dress the full context in which the trial court ruled, and we must consider the additional evidence adduced at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">\n<em>The Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">Upon review of an evidentiary suppression ruling, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the party prevailing below, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. <em>See Commonwealth v. Grimstead, </em>12 Va.App. 1066, 1067, 407 S.E.2d 47, 48 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">This well-established standard is based on deference to the peculiar fact finding capability of the trial court. In appraising the evidence, the trial court is not limited to the stark, written record. The trial court has before it the living witnesses and can observe their demeanors and inflections. In assessing the credibility of witnesses and the weight and significance to be given their testimony, the trial court enjoys advantages not available on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">This case presents an anomaly on review. The trial court made factual findings but ruled contrary to those findings in obedience to the mandate of <em>Satchell I. </em>Under those circumstances, we adopt for this case a standard of review deferential to the trial court\u2019s factual findings and confine our inquiry to whether those findings are supported by credible evidence. Those findings, if supported by credible evidence, constitute the factual predicate to which we must apply our legal analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-9\">\n<em>Seizure Issue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b694-10\">A person is seized \u201conly if, in view of all the circumstances surrounding the incident, a reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave.\u201d <em>United States v. Mendenhall, </em>446 U.S. 544, 554, 100 S.Ct. 1870, 1877, 64 L.Ed.2d 497 (1980); <em>see also Florida v. Royer, </em>460 U.S. 491, 502, 103 S.Ct. 1319, 1326, 75 L.Ed.2d 229 (1983).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-11\">Although the <em>Mendenhall </em>test \u201cis necessarily imprecise\u201d and \u201cflexible enough to be applied to the whole range of police conduct in an equally broad range of settings, it calls <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>for consistent application from one police encounter to the next, regardless of the particular individual\u2019s response to the action of the police.\u201d Whether a person who encounters a police officer believes he is free to leave must be measured under all the circumstances by an \u201cobjective standard\u2014 looking to the reasonable man\u2019s interpretation of the conduct in question.\u201d Whether a seizure has taken place involves factual determinations which bear upon whether a reasonably prudent person would feel that he or she is not free to leave, but whether the evidence is sufficient to support a finding that a seizure has occurred is ultimately a question of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-5\"><em>Satchell I, </em>15 Va.App. at 130, 422 S.E.2d at 414 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">Buckovich was one of four officers who exited the police car. Although Buckovich wore plain clothes, he announced his status as a police officer. He wore a badge on a chain around his neck and carried a visible firearm. Walking swiftly, he pursued Satchell onto private property. When Satchell was unable to enter the locked door of the house, he turned and, with his back to the locked door, was confronted by Buckovich on the confines of the porch. This record alone discloses Buckovich in an authoritative and aggressive posture and reveals Satchell, in effect, being brought to bay. Furthermore, the trial court had the advantage, denied to us, of seeing Buckovich in person, of observing his demeanor, and of assessing his inflection as he described his conduct and questions. The trial court was peculiarly well placed to determine whether those questions took the tone of simple inquiry or of command. The trial court found that a reasonable person in Satchell\u2019s situation would not have believed himself free to ignore Buckovich\u2019s inquiries and leave. The evidence supports this finding and the trial court\u2019s determination that Satchell was seized.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">In support of its contention that the circumstances did not effect a seizure of Satchell, the Commonwealth relies on <em>Baldwin v. Commonwealth, </em>243 Va. 191, 413 S.E.2d 645 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>(1992). We find <em>Baldwin </em>distinguishable from this case in two major respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">First, in <em>Baldwin, </em>the Supreme Court, according deference to the trial court\u2019s findings of fact, held the evidence sufficient to support those findings, and affirmed the trial court\u2019s holding that no seizure had occurred. The same standard of review requires us to affirm the trial court\u2019s holding that Satehell was seized.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Second, in <em>Baldwin, </em>the police officers, in a police car, shined a light on Baldwin and directed him to come to them. Baldwin complied, but he could as well have walked the other way. Satehell was confronted by Officer Buckovich in close quarters with his back to a locked door. He lacked the alternative departure route that was available to Baldwin.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">The evidence supports the trial court\u2019s holding that Satehell was unlawfully seized. Because the cocaine in his possession was discovered only upon that unlawful seizure, the trial court should have suppressed it as evidence. Without the cocaine, the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to support Satchell\u2019s conviction. Accordingly, we reverse his conviction and order the charge dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b696-8\">BENTON, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Akg\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-9\">I concur in the opinion, except the section titled, \u201cThe Context of Review,\u201d and I concur in the judgment reversing the conviction. I do not join in the section titled \u201cThe Context of Review\u201d because I believe it too narrowly interprets the language of Code \u00a7 19.2-409, the statute that controls the scope of our review.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>This appeal follows SatchelTs conviction for possession of cocaine. Following an interlocutory appeal prior to that trial, this Court reversed the trial judge\u2019s decision to suppress unlawfully seized evidence. <em>See Commonwealth v. Satchell, </em>15 Va.App. 127, 422 S.E.2d 412 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">In pertinent part, Code \u00a7 19.2-409 states that \u201cthe Court of Appeals\u2019 decision [following a pretrial appeal by the Commonwealth] shall not preclude a defendant, if he is convicted, from requesting the Court of Appeals or Supreme Court on direct appeal to reconsider an issue which was the subject of the pretrial appeal.\u201d Consistent with the statute, Satchell asked this Court to review both the trial judge\u2019s initial ruling on the suppression motion and the trial judge\u2019s decision on remand following the interlocutory appeal. In particular, the issues presented for review are whether \u201c[t]he ... [previous] panel erred by reversing the April 10, 1992 ruling of the trial judge granting the original motion to suppress\u201d and whether \u201c[t]he trial court erred in not granting the renewed motion to suppress made October 28, 1992.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">This appeal, which invokes the review granted by Code \u00a7 19.2-409, requires this Court to conduct a two-step review. First, because Satchell requests it, the Court must conduct a review of the pretrial suppression ruling that was the subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>of the initial Commonwealth\u2019s appeal. Code \u00a7 19.2-409 by its very terms mandates that review. On this review, when we \u201creconsider [the] issue which was the subject of the pretrial appeal,\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-409, we must view the evidence from the initial suppression hearing in the light most favorable to Satchell, who prevailed at that hearing. <em>See Commonwealth v. Grimstead, </em>12 Va.App. 1066, 1067, 407 S.E.2d 47, 48 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">Second, if that initial review results in a renewed holding that the trial judge erred in suppressing pretrial evidence that was the subject of the prior interlocutory appeal, the Court must then review the appeal from the trial judge\u2019s denial of the renewed suppression motion made following remand. At the hearing when the renewed motion to suppress was considered, the trial judge considered new evidence that Satchell presented, and the trial judge ruled anew on the motion to suppress. Our review of the trial judge\u2019s decision following the remand from the interlocutory ruling is consistent with the review in which the majority opinion engages. This is the review that must be taken even in the absence of a statute such as Code \u00a7 19.2-409.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">Because this two-step review is statutorily mandated and because it preserves the appropriate standard of review, I would first review the decision of the trial judge initially suppressing the evidence, and I would uphold the trial judge\u2019s decision to suppress the evidence. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Satchell, </em>15 Va.App. 127, 132-34, 422 S.E.2d 412, 415-17 (1992) (Benton, J., dissenting). However, because I believe that the majority\u2019s analysis properly decides the second prong of the review, I concur in the judgment reversing the conviction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b696-10\">. I also disagree with the process by which this appeal was considered <em>en banc. </em>Following Satchell\u2019s conviction, this appeal followed the usual procedure. When a panel granted the petition for appeal, the appeal was assigned to a panel of three judges who considered the appeal on the record after briefing and oral argument. An opinion was prepared with one judge dissenting. When the opinions were filed in the clerk\u2019s office, the dissenting judge requested that the entire Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>reconsider the appeal <em>en banc. </em>The Court determined to withhold release of the panel\u2019s decision and to consider the appeal anew <em>en banc. </em>I believe that there are sound jurisprudential reasons to avoid a mechanism that allows a' dissenting judge to initiate an <em>en banc </em>consideration after a panel has decided a case and before the panel releases its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">Although the statutory provisions for hearing a case <em>en banc </em>state that \"[t]he Court may sit <em>en banc </em>... at any time,\u201d Code \u00a7 17-116.02(D), the procedure employed to take this case <em>en banc </em>squandered scarce judicial resources. More importantly, however, the procedure employed in this case graphically demonstrates the need for this Court to set standards for <em>en banc </em>review that are published and available to all litigants. All members of the Bar should be informed that assignment of a case to a panel and the panel\u2019s consideration of an appeal do <em>not </em>preclude <em>en banc </em>consideration <em>before </em>the panel renders its decision. Although I believe that this process negates the efficiency of the panel process, I also believe that this Court has an obligation to inform the Bar of the procedures that it employs to consider cases <em>en banc.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b698-7\">BAKER, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Acz\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">For the reasons set forth in the panel decision, <em>Commonwealth v.
