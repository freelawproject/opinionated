On appeal, defendant complains that the trial court erroneously overruled his motion to suppress the offending drugs discovered during a seizure of his person and search of his property. We disagree and affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-9\">In reviewing a trial court\u2019s ruling on a suppression motion, we consider the evidence in the \u201clight most favorable to ... the prevailing party below,\u201d the Commonwealth in this instance, and the decision will be disturbed only if plainly wrong. <em>Commonwealth v. Grimstead, </em>12 Va.App. 1066, 1067, 407 S.E.2d 47, 48 (1991). \u201cIt is well established that, on appeal, appellant carries the burden to show ... that the denial of a motion to suppress constitutes reversible error.\u201d <em>Motley v. Commonwealth, </em>17 Va.App. 439, 440-41, 437 S.E.2d 232, 233 (1993) (citing <em>Fore v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 1007, 1010, 265 S.E.2d 729, 731, <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 1017, 101 S.Ct. 579, 66 L.Ed.2d 477 (1980)). Our review of the record includes evidence adduced at both the suppression hearing and trial. <em>Greene v. Commonwealth, </em>17 Va.App. 606, 608, 440 S.E.2d 138, 139 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-10\">On the morning of November 13,1992, Jim Hughes, a \u201cdrug agent\u201d assigned to the Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas airport, notified Douglas Kahn, a Drug Enforcement Administration agent interdicting narcotics at Washington National Airport, that a \u201cconfidential informant\u201d had advised him that an indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>vidual identified as Brian Wechsler was in flight to Washington National, from Tucson, Arizona, through Dallas/Fort Worth, \u201cpossibly carrying narcotics.\u201d Wechsler had reserved a one-way ticket only an hour before departure, arrived at the Tucson terminal just prior to \u201ctake off,\u201d paid cash and \u201cchecked\u201d two bags. Hughes provided Kahn with Wechsler\u2019s description and his flight and baggage claim numbers. He also reported that a person matching Weehsler\u2019s description was in the Dallas/Fort Worth airport, \u201cacting very nervous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Without objection, Kahn qualified in the trial court as \u201can expert in narcotics and drug transportation and methodology at the airport and generally.\u201d He testified that \u201cdrug couriers typically will pay cash for a ... ticket and check in at the last minute to board flights.\u201d Based upon this experience and the information provided by Hughes, Kahn initiated an investigation and, accompanied by agents Jacobsen and Shelley, proceeded immediately to National Airport.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">While Agent Shelley located Wechsler\u2019s \u201cchecked\u201d luggage, Agents Jacobsen and Kahn stationed themselves at the gate disembarking passengers from Wechsler\u2019s flight. Defendant, fitting the description of Wechsler, <em>carrying </em>two bags, deplaned into the concourse, looked \u201cright at\u201d the agents, and \u201cput his head down very quickly.\u201d He then walked with other passengers to the baggage claim area and stopped approximately ten to fifteen feet from and \u201cfacing\u201d the luggage carousel unloading bags from the flight. After approximately five minutes, defendant had \u201ceye contact\u201d with Kahn and Jacobsen and stepped to a nearby pay telephone. He appeared to \u201cdial a number,\u201d but apparently spoke with no one and \u201cshortly\u201d exited the terminal building, without returning to the baggage carousel.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">As defendant was about to enter a taxi cab, Agent Kahn displayed his badge, identified himself, and \u201casked if he would mind answering a few questions.\u201d Kahn advised defendant that he was free to leave and not under arrest. Defendant agreed to speak with the agents and, at Kahn\u2019s request, \u201cmoved over a little bit\u201d to the sidewalk adjoining the cab <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>stand. In response to Kahn\u2019s inquiries, defendant produced proper identification and confirmed his recent arrival from Tucson. However, he claimed that he \u201cthrew his ticket away\u201d and denied that he had \u201cchecked\u201d any baggage or used the telephone. When Kahn explained that he was investigating the movement of narcotics and large sums of cash into the Washington area, defendant denied any involvement and consented to a search of the two bags in his immediate possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">In one bag, Kahn discovered a package containing a \u201cgreen substance,\u201d labeled \u201cSmoking Herb,\u201d which he suspected was marijuana.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Almost simultaneously, Jacobsen located defendant\u2019s airline and baggage claim tickets in the remaining bag. When Jacobsen reminded defendant of his earlier statements, Wechsler replied, \u201cI thought I threw [the plane ticket] away,\u201d \u201cI guess I have luggage then.\u201d Defendant then protested that he \u201cwanted to leave,\u201d but was detained and \u201casked\u201d by Kahn to accompany the agents to the \u201cpolice substation\u201d in the terminal building. As the trio walked to the substation, defendant told Jacobsen, \u201cI don\u2019t have any luggage with me,\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t have any luggage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">The investigation was delayed at the substation approximately thirty-five minutes while Kahn spoke with the U.S. Attorney by telephone and a \u201cdog unit\u201d reported to the airport. Shelley then brought the two \u201cchecked\u201d bags, tagged \u25a0with defendant\u2019s claim tickets, into the substation. The locked \u2022 luggage was opened by keys found with the carry-on bags, twenty-five pounds of marijuana was discovered, and defendant was arrested for the subject offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">In overruling defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the drugs, the trial court found that defendant had \u201cID\u2019d\u201d the agents in the airport terminal, \u201cknew they were looking for him,\u201d and that \u201che had a problem with [the] luggage,\u201d and \u201cgot [the] cab to get out of there.\u201d The court concluded that this conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>combined with defendant\u2019s denials of ownership to manifest abandonment of the luggage.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">THE SEIZURE</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">Defendant first contends that he was unconstitutionally seized by Kahn\u2019s oppressive conduct at the inception of the encounter, and, therefore, all evidence attributable to this unlawful restraint must be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">Fourth Amendment jurisprudence recognizes three categories of police-citizen confrontations: (1) consensual encounters, (2) brief, minimally intrusive investigatory detentions, based upon specific, articulable facts, commonly referred to as <em>Terry </em>stops, <em>see Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968), and (3) highly intrusive arrests and searches founded on probable cause. <em>Payne v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 86, 88, 414 S.E.2d 869, 869-70 (1992); <em>Iglesias v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va.App. 93, 99, 372 S.E.2d 170, 173 (1988) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">A \u201cconsensual encounter between police and an individual has no fourth amendment implications unless accompanied by such \u2018coercion or show of force or authority by the officer ... that would cause a person ... reasonably to have believed that he or she was required to comply\u2019 and \u2018not free to leave.\u2019 \u201d <em>Greene, </em>17 Va.App. at 610, 440 S.E.2d at 140 (quoting <em>Commonwealth v. Satchell, </em>15 Va.App. 127, 131, 422 S.E.2d 412, 414 (1992)). This principle acknowledges that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aog\">[t]he purpose of the Fourth Amendment is not to eliminate all contact between the police and the citizenry, but \u201cto prevent arbitrary and oppressive interference by enforcement officials with the privacy and personal security of individuals.\u201d As long as the person to whom questions are put remains free to disregard the questions and walk away, there has been no intrusion upon that person\u2019s liberty or privacy as would under the Constitution require some particularized and objective justification.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-9\"><em>United States v. Mendenhall, </em>446 U.S. 544, 553-54, 100 S.Ct. 1870, 1877, 64 L.Ed.2d 497 (1980) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>Cooperation with police and \u201c[acquiescence in \u2018a police request, which most citizens will do, does not negate \u201cthe consensual nature of the response.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Greene, </em>17 Va. App. at 610, 440 S.E.2d at 140-41 (citations omitted). A voluntary police-citizen encounter becomes a seizure for Fourth Amendment purposes \u201conly if, in view of all of the circumstances ... a <em>reasonable person </em>would have believed that he was not free to leave.\u201d <em>Mendenhall, </em>446 U.S. at 554, 100 S.Ct. at 1877 (emphasis added); <em>see also Baldwin v. Commonwealth, </em>243 Va. 191, 196, 413 S.E.2d 645, 647-48 (1992); <em>Greene, </em>17 Va.App. at 610-11, 440 S.E.2d at 141. This objective standard \u201censures that the scope of Fourth Amendment protection does not vary with the state of mind of the particular individual being approached.\u201d <em>Michigan v. Chesternut, </em>486 U.S. 567, 574, 108 S.Ct. 1975, 1979, 100 L.Ed.2d 565 (1988); <em>see also Greene, </em>17 Va.App. at 611, 440 S.E.2d at 141. It requires \u201cfactual determinations\u201d by the trial court \u201cthat bear upon\u201d the perceptions of a similarly situated \u201creasonably prudent person.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Satchell, </em>15 Va.App. 127, 130, 422 S.E.2d 412, 414 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">In contrast, even a brief detention for investigative purposes constitutes a seizure contemplated by the Fourth Amendment. <em>See Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 16, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 1877, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968). \u201cIn order to justify such a seizure, an officer must have a \u2018reasonable and articulable suspicion of criminal activity on the part of the defendant____\u2019 A general suspicion of some criminal activity is enough, as long as the officer can, based on the circumstances before him ... articulate a reasonable basis for his suspicion.\u201d <em>Hatcher v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 487, 490, 419 S.E.2d 256, 258 (1992) (citations omitted). \u201c[W]hen a court reviews whether an officer had reasonable suspicion to make an investigatory stop, it must view the totality of the circumstances ... objectively through the eyes of a reasonable police officer with the knowledge, training, and experience of the investigating officer.\u201d <em>Murphy v. Commonwealth, </em>9 Va.App. 139, 144, 384 S.E.2d 125, 128 (1989) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>Armed with the requisite suspicion, an officer may stop a person \u201c \u2018in order to identify him, to question him briefly, or to detain him briefly, while attempting to obtain additional information.\u2019 \u201d <em>DePriest v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va. App. 577, 585, 359 S.E.2d 540, 544 (1987), <em>cert. denied, </em>488 U.S. 985, 109 S.Ct. 541, 102 L.Ed.2d 571 (1988) (quoting Hayes <em>v. Florida, </em>470 U.S. 811, 816, 105 S.Ct. 1643, 1647, 84 L.Ed.2d 705 (1985)). However, police procedures and investigative methods attendant to the detention must be calculated to confirm or dispel the suspicion quickly and with minimal intrusion. <em>Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 851, 856-57, 434 S.E.2d 319, 323 (1993). While a \u201c \u2018bright line rule would be desirable, in evaluating whether [the] investigative detention is unreasonable, common sense and ordinary human experience must govern over rigid criteria.\u2019 \u201d <em>Limonja v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 532, 542, 383 S.E.2d 476, 482 (1989) (en banc) (citation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>495 U.S. 905, 110 S.Ct. 1925, 109 L.Ed.2d 288 (1990). Thus, the level and duration of detention must be assessed in the context of each case and the related police conduct judged accordingly. <em>See, e.g., Thomas, </em>16 Va.App. at 856-57, 434 S.E.2d at 323; <em>Limonja, </em>8 Va.App. at 542, 383 S.E.2d at 482; <em>DePriest, </em>4 Va.App. at 587, 359 S.E.2d at 545.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Here, the initial encounter between defendant and the officers was clearly consensual. Defendant was approached during daylight hours in a busy, public place as he prepared to enter a taxi. The agents were not in uniform, displayed no weapons, did not touch defendant, did not speak harshly or otherwise threaten or intimidate him. After Kahn\u2019s initial contact with defendant, defendant agreed to converse with the agents, and was advised that he was free to leave and not under arrest. Such circumstances \u201cwould not communicate restraint or coercion to a reasonable person.\u201d <em>Greene, </em>17 Va.App. at 612, 440 S.E.2d at 141 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">Defendant did not indicate that he wished to end the encounter until the consent search of the carry-on bags revealed inconsistencies with his earlier responses. Kahn had been informed that defendant had purchased a one-way ticket, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>with cash, shortly before departure of his flight and arrived at the airport immediately prior to take-off, behavior typical of a drug courier. Defendant had been observed en route and appeared nervous then and later at Washington National. After noticing the agents, defendant departed the terminal building and engaged a cab, leaving his luggage unclaimed at the carousel. During consensual conversation with the agents, he answered several questions untruthfully, then suddenly ended the exchange and immediately sought to leave the airport. These circumstances provided abundant articulable suspicion of illegal activity, and the agents were justified in a limited detention of defendant necessary to permit further investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">The record does not suggest that the ensuing detention was unnecessarily intrusive or protracted. Defendant was escorted from a congested public thoroughfare, highly inappropriate for the investigation, to the privacy of a police substation within the nearby terminal building. The \u201cchecked\u201d luggage was quickly located and retrieved while defendant waited with the agents. Although a \u201cdog unit\u201d was summoned to assist in the investigation, its use, if any, occasioned only slight delay.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, the investigation was diligently and responsibly conducted and the incidental detention brief and reasonable to the circumstances. <em>See Limonja, </em>8 Va.App. at 543, 383 S.E.2d at 483.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">Accordingly, the disputed evidence was properly gathered by the agents through both a consensual encounter and an investigatory detention and, therefore, was untainted by police misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">ABANDONMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">Defendant next challenges the trial court\u2019s finding that he had abandoned the \u201cchecked\u201d luggage prior to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>search, thereby relinquishing any reasonable privacy interest in the bags or their contents.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">\u201cOne who voluntarily abandons property forfeits any expectation of privacy he or she may have in it\u201d and all standing to complain of its warrantless search and seizure. <em>Commonwealth v. Holloway, </em>9 Va.App. 11, 18, 384 S.E.2d 99, 103 (1989) (citing <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>864 F.2d 843, 845 (D.C.Cir.1989); <em>United States v. Kendall, </em>655 F.2d 199, 200 (9th Cir.1981)). Abandonment in the context of the Fourth Amendment is distinguishable from the property law concept of abandonment. <em>Holloway, </em>9 Va.App. at 18, 384 S.E.2d at 103. A person may retain a proprietary interest in personal property and simultaneously relinquish his or her reasonable expectation of privacy in it. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">\u201cWhether a person intends to retain a reasonable expectation of privacy in property is to be determined by objective standards. Such an intent may be inferred from words, acts, and other objective facts.\u201d <em>Id.' </em>(citations omitted). Two factors are particularly relevant in ascertaining intent: physical relinquishment of the property and denial of ownership. <em>Id. </em>\u201cIf a person relinquishes possession and disclaims ownership of personal property, he or she surrenders any expectation of privacy in that property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[R]epeated disclaimers of ownership generally constitute a relinquishment of an expectation of privacy.\u201d <em>Id. A </em>finding of an abandonment by the trial court is a determination which, \u201ceven when arguably mixed with questions of law, is subject to attack only if clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 19, 384 S.E.2d at 104.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">The record in this instance disclosed abundant evidence that defendant voluntarily abandoned the \u201cchecked\u201d luggage. Defendant elected to forego physical possession of the bags when he departed the terminal building and attempted to enter a cab, leaving the luggage at the baggage carousel. When initially questioned by the agents, he denied ownership of any \u201cchecked\u201d bags, claiming only the two \u201ccarry-on\u201d pieces in his possession. After Agent Jacobsen located the claim tickets, defendant equivocated, commenting, \u201cI guess I have luggage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>then.\u201d However, while walking to the police substation, he again disclaimed the \u201cchecked\u201d bags, insisting, \u201cI don\u2019t have any luggage with me,\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t have any luggage.\u201d Thus, defendant both relinquished physical possession of the baggage and expressly denied ownership, thereby clearly abandoning any privacy interests in the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Accordingly, the trial court correctly overruled the motion to suppress, and we affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b214-8\">.
