We hold that the wife\u2019s testimony was not privileged under Code \u00a7 8.01-398 because it did not concern \u201cany communication privately made\u201d between the defendant and his former wife.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">The defendant was charged with first degree murder, abduction, robbery, and use of a firearm in connection with the death of a man who disappeared while demonstrating his Mercedes automobile which he was offering for sale. In response to a classified ad for the sale of the automobile, the victim\u2019s wife received a telephone call from a person who identified himself as J.C. Jiles and expressed interest in the car. The victim and his wife met \u201cJiles,\u201d a light-skinned black man wearing a long, black tweed coat, a yellow shirt and a red tie at the Omni Hotel at 7:00 p.m. The victim\u2019s wife testified at trial that the defendant was the person who had introduced himself as Jiles. After a test-drive, the defendant indicated that he would call the following day. Upon receiving a call from \u201cJiles\u201d the next day, the victim left home to go to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>Omni, carrying a wallet with a few credit cards and a small amount of money. He disappeared and his body was found a week later, shot in the chest. Two weeks later, the Mercedes was found. The victim\u2019s wallet was never recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">The defendant was married at the time of the offense, but divorced by the time of the trial. Before trial, the court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to exclude the wife\u2019s testimony pursuant to Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-271.2 and 8.01-398. She testified that her husband was \u201clooking for automobiles\u201d and that he went to test-drive a \u201cMercedes, with an older couple\u201d around 7:00 p.m. one evening during the same time period that the defendant met the victim and the victim\u2019s wife. When he left that evening, he was wearing a pale yellow shirt, teal sweater vest, red tie, and a long, black tweed trench coat with leather lapels.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">She further testified that the following evening, a friend of the defendant\u2019s came to her home and took her to the Omni, where she saw the car the defendant had been driving when she had last seen him. The defendant was not there, so the friend instructed the wife to page him. When the defendant called back, he told his wife to meet him and pick him up at a relative\u2019s house in Richmond. The defendant\u2019s aunt and uncle were expecting the wife, but the defendant was not there when she arrived. While waiting for her husband, the defendant\u2019s wife drove the uncle to a convenience store, and on her return, she saw the defendant driving a Mercedes with the license number FAV-725. She returned to the house and went to bed. The defendant arrived around 2:30 a.m., and the couple left at 4:00 a.m. In the car on the way home, the wife heard a radio report about a missing man and a missing car with the license plate number she had seen on the Mercedes the defendant had been driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">Finally, the defendant\u2019s former wife testified that on a later evening, the defendant came home wearing his black coat and went upstairs for some time and returned, no longer wearing the coat. When the wife went upstairs alone later and looked in his belongings, she found a wallet containing the victim\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>driver\u2019s license and Price Club card. She did not tell the defendant she had found them, and when she looked for the wallet the next day, she did not find it. The former wife testified that, because of her fear of the defendant, she did not contact the police until she saw a reenactment of the crime on \u201cAmerica\u2019s Most Wanted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">The defendant appeals the trial court\u2019s admission of the wife\u2019s testimony describing the defendant\u2019s attire on the evening of the victim\u2019s disappearance, his interest in purchasing a Mercedes and his plan to test-drive a Mercedes with an older couple, his instruction to her over the phone to meet him at a relative\u2019s house, and her discovery of a wallet containing the victim\u2019s driver\u2019s license and Price Club card among the defendant\u2019s belongings. We hold that the wife\u2019s testimony was properly admitted. The first three of these events, although communications between spouses, did not express or imply by their nature that they were intended to be \u201csecret or confidential.\u201d The wife\u2019s discovery of the wallet was not a communication by the defendant to his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">\u201c[N]either husband nor wife shall, without the consent of the other, be examined in any action as to any communication privately made by one to the other while married, ... nor reveal in testimony after the marriage relation ceases any such communication made while the marriage subsisted.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.01-398(A). Such communications include \u201call information or knowledge privately imparted and made known by one spouse to the other by virtue of and in consequence of the marital relation through conduct, acts, signs, and spoken or written words.\u201d <em>Menefee v. Commonwealth, </em>189 Va. 900, 912, 55 S.E.2d 9, 15 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">The purpose of the privilege is to preserve the \u201ccontinued tranquility, integrity and confidence\u201d of the marital relation, shielded and protected by the \u201cinviolate veil of the marital sanctuary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, it does not shield any and every communication or act, regardless of its nature, but \u201conly communications of a confidential nature,\u201d that is, \u201cof a secret nature between husband and wife.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 907, 55 S.E.2d at 13 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>(quoting <em>Thomas v. First National Bank of Danville, </em>166 Va. 497, 511, 186 S.E. 77, 83 (1936)). <em>Accord Stewart v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 887, 893, 252 S.E.2d 329, 333 (1979) (noting that the predecessor to Code \u00a7 8.01-398 shields confidential communications).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Thus, admissibility depends \u201cupon the nature of the communication ... whether it was intended to be secret or confidential.\u201d <em>Thomas, </em>166 Va. at 511, 186 S.E. at 83. One indicator of whether a communication was made in confidence is whether its content is disclosed to a third party. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">The wife\u2019s description of the defendant\u2019s clothing, which he displayed in public when he left the home, was not a confidential communication. We find no objective indicia of confidential intent. Further, it is reasonable to infer that clothing worn in public was not intended to be kept private or confidential.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Therefore, the wife\u2019s testimony about the defendant\u2019s attire on the evening of the offense was properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">The wife\u2019s testimony about the defendant\u2019s interest in purchasing a Mercedes and his intent to test-drive a Mercedes with an older couple was also not the sort of communication a spouse would reasonably consider \u201cof a secret nature between husband and wife.\u201d The information was not conveyed with an expression of confidentiality, nor did its content imply that it should be kept confidential. In fact, the defendant not only expressed his intent to the victim and his wife, but also arranged to meet them in a public place, further supporting a finding that this communication was not a marital \u201csecret.\u201d Protecting such a communication is not necessary to preserve the \u201ccontinued tranquility, integrity and confidence\u201d of the marital relation.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>The defendant\u2019s wife testified that the defendant instructed her over the phone to meet him at his relative\u2019s house. We do not consider such a communication \u201csecret.\u201d Here again, we find no objective indicia of confidential intent. If anything, the defendant\u2019s actions indicate the opposite, since he instructed her to meet him at a place where other people would be present to witness the meeting. Therefore, the testimony was properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Finally, when the wife testified that she looked through the defendant\u2019s belongings, which he had deposited in their bedroom outside of her presence, and found a wallet containing the victim\u2019s driver\u2019s license and Price Club card, she was not describing a communication. While a spouse\u2019s conduct may convey information to the other spouse and would, therefore, be privileged under Code \u00a7 8.01-398, <em>see Menefee, </em>189 Va. at 912, 55 S.E.2d at 15, a spouse\u2019s conduct which does not convey information to the other spouse is not privileged. <em>Osborne v. Commonwealth, </em>214 Va. 691, 692, 204 S.E.2d 289, 290 (1974) (wife\u2019s testimony that husband had beaten her and daughter not privileged). The former wife\u2019s discovery of the contents of the wallet conveyed information to her, as did the fact that she discovered it among the defendant\u2019s belongings. However, the defendant\u2019s conduct\u2014leaving the wallet among his belongings\u2014was not observed by the former wife and did not convey information to her. Thus, the conduct was not a \u201ccommunication privately made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">For these reasons, Code \u00a7 8.01-398 does not prohibit the former wife\u2019s testimony, and the trial court correctly allowed her to testify concerning these events. We, therefore, affirm the judgments of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b518-10\"> Judge Bernard G. Barrow participated in the hearing and decision of this case and prepared the opinion prior to his death.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b518-11\">. We are not barred by Rule 5A:18 from considering the issues raised by the defendant on appeal because the defendant\u2019s objections were sufficiently preserved by his motion in limine, objections at trial, and the trial court\u2019s assurance that defense counsel \u201cwould not have to continue to make the same objection on each and every one of the witnesses\u201d because he had \"made one general objection which will follow him through the trial so long as he wishes that to be the case.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b521-8\">. We are not establishing a <em>per se </em>rule about attire. Some acts, such as cross-dressing, or wearing bloody clothing, might be considered confidential communications.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
