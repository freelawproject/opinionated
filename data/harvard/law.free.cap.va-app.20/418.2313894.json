Duncan contends (1) that no credible evidence supports the commission\u2019s finding that he was released to pre-injury work and that his continuing disability was not causally related to his June 10, 1992 compensable injury, (2) that the commission erred in failing to conduct an evidentiary hearing, and (3) that the \u201con the record\u201d hearing conducted by the commission violated his right to due process of law. We find no error and affirm the commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">On appeal, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the party prevailing below. <em>Crisp v. Brown\u2019s Tysons Corner Dodge, Inc., </em>1 Va.App. 503, 504, 339 S.E.2d 916, 916 (1986). The findings of the commission, if based on credible evidence, are conclusive and binding on this Court. <em>Morris v. Badger Powhatan/Figgie Int\u2019l Inc., </em>3 Va.App. 276, 279, 348 S.E.2d 876, 877 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">On December 31, 1992, Duncan\u2019s treating physician, Dr. Korsh, released Duncan to return to his pre-injury work. Dr. Korsh reiterated this release on April 20, 1993. This credible evidence supports the comxnission\u2019s finding that Duncan was released to perform pre-injury work with regards to his compensable back injury. \u201c[W]hen an attending physician is positive in his diagnosis, great weight will be given by the courts to his opinion.\u201d <em>Pilot Freight Carriers, Inc. v. Reeves, </em>1 Va.App. 435, 439, 339 S.E.2d 570, 572 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">Duncan contends the commission\u2019s finding that his present condition is not causally related to his compensable industrial injury by accident is not supported by credible evidence. He argues that Dr. Homey found that the pain in his lower back and right testicle resulted from his June 10, 1992 accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">The evidence provided by the examining physicians established that Duncan suffered from testalgia, but none of the physicians found any physiological basis to relate that condition to his compensable back injury. Duncan\u2019s claimed diagnosis by Dr. Horney was not part of the record before the commission. The evidence in the record shows the following: Dr. Morin, an orthopaedist, found that Duncan suffered from a lumbosacral strain, but could not relate that condition to the testalgia. Dr. Korsh, a spinal surgeon, found that Duncan \u201chas a very strange pain pattern not consistent with any normal neurological pattern.\u201d His overall impression was \u201cthat the patient most likely has no pathology emanating from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>Ms lumbar spine.\u201d Dr. Poffenberger, a urologist, diagnosed Duncan with bilateral testalgia, but stated it was more of a \u201cmusculoskeletal problem\u201d than a urologic one. Dr. Hormel, a neurologist stated, \u201cI cannot relate it clearly to Ms lumbar spine although certaiMy some people who have lumbar steno-sis can get testalgia---- It is possible ... that his medications are contributing to Ms testalgia____\u201d Dr. Joiner, an orthopaedist, limited Duncan to restrictive work duties, but never related the testalgia to the compensable back injury. Additionally, Duncan underwent a CT-scan, two MRI\u2019s, and a post-trauma myelogram, wMch showed no abnormality. TMs credible evidence supports the commission\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">Duncan contends that the deputy commissioner erred in denying an evidentiary hearing. By letter of July 22, 1993, the deputy commissioner demed Duncan\u2019s request for an evidentiary hearing and concluded that \u201cthe single issue to be resolved in tMs matter is a medical issue, that matter can be resolved in the Dispute Resolution Department in an on-the-record hearing.\u201d Duncan argues that material issues remained in dispute. However, Duncan did not request the full commission to review the deputy commissioner\u2019s demal of an evidentiary h\u00e9aring. Decisions of a deputy commissioner that are not reviewed by the full commission cannot be brought before tMs Court. <em>Southwest Architectural Products v. Smith, </em>4 Va.App. 474, 478, 358 S.E.2d 745, 747 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">Duncan contends that the deputy commissioner\u2019s \u201con the record\u201d review of the case demed Mm due process. He argues that the \u201con the record\u201d review did not afford Mm an adequate opportumty to be heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">The deputy commissioner\u2019s utilization of the \u201con the record\u201d hearing procedure satisfied the requirements of due process. \u201c[D]ue process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands.\u201d <em>Mathews v. El</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number><em>dridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 334, 96 S.Ct. 893, 902, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976). \u201c[T]he fundamental requisite of due process of law is the opportunity to be heard.\u201d <em>Goldberg v. Kelly, </em>397 U.S. 254, 267, 90 S.Ct. 1011, 1020, 25 L.Ed.2d 287 (1970). An evidentiary hearing was not required in this case because no conflict or dispute existed in the claimant\u2019s medical evidence. <em>See Williams v. Virginia Elec. &amp; Power Co., </em>18 Va.App. 569, 577, 445 S.E.2d 693, 698 (1994). The issues to be decided were whether the claimant had been released to pre-injury employment with respect to the industrial injury by accident, and whether his present condition was causally related to his compensable injury. An evidentiary hearing would have produced no additional medical evidence to refute Duncan\u2019s assertion that he had not been released to his pre-injury work and that his present condition was causally related to his industrial accident. Because no genuine controversy existed, the \u201con the record\u201d hearing procedure met the requirements of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the decision of the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
