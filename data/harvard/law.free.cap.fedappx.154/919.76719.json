United States, </em>No. 04-CV-1055 (Fed.Cl. March 15, 2005). We <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b873-20\">\u201cThe jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims arises chiefly from the Tucker Act, which gives that court \u2018jurisdiction to render judgment upon any claim against the United States founded either upon the Constitution, or any Act of Congress or any regulation of an executive department, or upon any express or implied contract with the United States, or for liquidated or unliquidated damages in cases not sounding in tort.\u2019 \u201d <em>LeBlanc v. United States, </em>50 F.3d 1025, 1028 (Fed.Cir.1995) (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(a)). Whether the trial court properly dismissed De Carlo\u2019s complaint for lack of jurisdiction is a question of law that we review <em>de novo. Pixton v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number><em>B &amp; B Plastics, Inc., </em>291 F.3d 1324, 1326 (Fed.Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">It is well established that the Court of Federal Claims does not have jurisdiction over De Carlo\u2019s tort claims. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(a); <em>LeBlanc, </em>50 F.3d at 1030. In addition, it lacks jurisdiction over <em>qui tam </em>suits. <em>LeBlanc, </em>50 F.3d at 1031 (citing 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3732(a)). Finally, De Carlo has failed to establish jurisdiction based on a government contract. Although the Supreme Court has described the basis of a relator\u2019s claim as a partial assignment from the government, <em>see Vermont Agency of Natural Resources v. United States ex rel. Stevens, </em>529 U.S. 765, 773, 120 S.Ct. 1858, 146 L.Ed.2d 836 (2000), De Carlo\u2019s \u201ccontractual\u201d arguments in this case only attempt to challenge the amount of his recovery in the <em>qui tam </em>action. The Court of Federal Claims is without jurisdiction to hear such a challenge. <em>See LeBlanc, </em>50 F.3d at 1030.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
