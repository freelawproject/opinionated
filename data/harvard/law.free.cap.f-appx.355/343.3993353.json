For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-23\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-24\">A grand jury issued an indictment charging Menendez with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846, (\u201cCount 1\u201d); and possession with intent to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2, (\u201cCount 2\u201d). The indictment also contained a forfeiture count stating that, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853, Menendez should forfeit all property constituting and derived from proceeds obtained as a result of Counts 1 and 2, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>including $174,545 in United States currency.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">Menendez entered a conditional guilty plea to Counts 1 and 2 and the forfeiture count, reserving the right to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress. Under the plea agreement, Menendez agreed to forfeit his interest in the $174,545. At the change of plea hearing, the court noted that Menendez\u2019s guilty plea would require him to forfeit the seized currency. Menendez stated that he wished to plead guilty to Counts 1, 2, and the forfeiture count.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Prior to sentencing, the government filed a motion for entry of an order of forfeiture of the $174,545. On May 25, 2000, the district court entered an order of forfeiture, but noted that, \u201c[bjefore the agreed upon forfeiture can be accomplished, the United States ... must publish notice of the forfeiture to address any claims.\u201d The order stated that a final order of forfeiture would be entered upon adjudication of all third party interests, or, if no claims were filed within 30 days of the final publication of notice, the present order would be deemed a final order of forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">On June 29, 2000, the United States published the order of forfeiture in the Miami Daily Business Review. No claims were filed within 30 days. On August 1, 2000, the court sentenced Menendez to 135 months\u2019 imprisonment on each count, to run concurrently, followed by 3 years\u2019 supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">Six years later, on July 31, 2006, Menendez filed a <em>pro se </em>motion for return of property, pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.Rule 41(g). He asserted that the court had no jurisdiction to enter a forfeiture order, because it had failed to enter such an order during his sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">The government filed a motion to dismiss Menendez\u2019s Rule 41(g) motion. On March 30, 2007, the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation (\u201cR&amp;R\u201d), recommending denial of Menendez\u2019s motion for return of property. The magistrate determined that Menendez failed to demonstrate that he had a possessory interest in the seized currency, because, in the plea agreement, he expressly agreed to forfeit the currency. It also noted that Menendez failed to challenge the court\u2019s finding, set forth in the order of forfeiture, that he had relinquished all rights to the money. The magistrate also determined that \u201ca return of the currency that constitutes proceeds of illegal narcotics violations, and which [Menendez] has already conceded is subject to forfeiture, would thwart the purpose of the forfeiture statute.\u201d It noted that Menendez pled guilty to the forfeiture count contained in the indictment, which alleged that the currency constituted proceeds of narcotics violations. The R&amp;R noted that the parties had 10 business days in which to file written objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">On April 18, 2007, the district court entered an order adopting the R&amp;R, denying Menendez\u2019s motion for return of property, and granting the government\u2019s motion to dismiss. It noted that neither party had filed objections to the R&amp;R.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-10\">Two months later, on June 16, 2007, Menendez mailed objections to the R&amp;R. First, Menendez asserted that the amount of money seized by the government was $200,000. Second, Menendez objected \u201cto the magistrate\u2019s report and recommendation in its entirety.\u201d He stated that the district court\u2019s failure to enter a final order of forfeiture at sentencing rendered his preliminary order null and void, and that the court lacked jurisdiction to amend the final judgment. On June 27, 2007, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>district court struck Menendez\u2019s objections as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">On April 18, 2008, Menendez filed a motion for relief from final judgment, under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(1), requesting that the court vacate the April 18, 2007 order denying his motion for return of property. Menendez explained that, on February 7, 2007, he was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-6\">placed on an administrative transfer from FPC Pensacola and did not arrive to FCI La Tuna until April 13, 2007. On April 17, 2007 during mail call defendant received the magistrate\u2019s R&amp;R and filed an informative motion requesting an extension of time to file objections because of the above mentioned reasons on April 19, 2007.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">He asserted that, because he was in transit between prisons until April 13, 2007, it was impossible to file objections to the R&amp;R. He also asserted that he first learned that an R&amp;R had been issued on April 17, 2007, one day prior to the district court adopting the R&amp;R. Menendez stated that he was unable to appeal the district court\u2019s final order, because he did not learn the district court had issued a final order until June 2007, when his objections to the R&amp;R were stricken as untimely. Menendez asked the court to vacate its final order and allow him to file his objections to the R&amp;R.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">Menendez attached to his motion a document titled \u201cinformative and request for exten[s]ion of time motion to file objections to magistrate\u2019s report and recommendation.\u201d In the document, Menendez explained that he was transferred between prisons and asked for an extension of time in which to file objections to the R&amp;R. The certificate of service states that Menendez mailed the document on April 19, 2007, but there is no indication that the document was stamped as having been filed with the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">The court denied Menendez\u2019s motion for relief from final judgment, stating that Menendez never filed a motion for extension of time in which to file objections to the R&amp;R. It also noted that Menendez failed to demonstrate that he was entitled to relief under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-11\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of relief under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) for an abuse of discretion. <em>Big Top Koolers, Inc. v. Circus-Man Snacks, Inc., </em>528 F.3d 839, 842 (11th Cir.2008). To show abuse of discretion, the appellant \u201cmust demonstrate a justification [for relief] so compelling that the court was required to vacate its order.\u201d <em>Cavaliere v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>996 F.2d 1111, 1115 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-12\">Rule 60(b)(1) provides that a district court may relieve a party from a final judgment or order for \u201cmistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(1). We have held that \u201cwhether a party\u2019s neglect of a deadline may be excused is an equitable decision turning on all relevant circumstances surrounding the party\u2019s omission.\u201d <em>Cheney v. Anchor Glass Container Corp., </em>71 F.3d 848, 850 (11th Cir.1996) (internal quotations omitted). We consider \u201cthe danger of prejudice to the [opposing party], the length of the delay and its potential impact on judicial proceedings, the reason for the delay, including whether it was within the reasonable control of the movant, and whether the movant acted in good faith,\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b367-13\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Menendez\u2019s Rule 60(b)(1) motion, because Menendez failed to show a \u201cjustification so compelling that the court was required to vacate its order.\u201d <em>See Cavaliere, </em>996 F.2d at 1115. Although Menendez alleged, in his Rule 60(b) motion, facts that would have made it impos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>sible for him to file objections to the R&amp;R within 10 days of the R&amp;R\u2019s filing, the length of Menendez\u2019s delay in filing his objections his Rule 60(b) motion weigh against granting the motion. <em>See Cheney, </em>71 F.3d at 850. First, although Menendez asserted that he moved for an extension of time in which to file his objections, the district court noted and the record reflects that such a motion was not filed. Menendez attached to his Rule 60(b) motion a copy of a motion requesting such an extension, but this document was not marked as having been received or filed by the court. Second, Menendez did not mail his objections to the R&amp;R until June 16, 2007, two months after he learned that the magistrate had issued the R&amp;R. Menendez fails to explain why he waited so long to file the objections. Finally, Menendez\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion was not filed until April 22, 2008, about ten months after he had learned that the magistrate had issued the R&amp;R. Again, he does not explain the reasons behind the delay. Granting Menendez\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion after such a long delay would cause prejudice to the government, especially considering the fact that the preliminary order of forfeiture became final on July 29, 2000, more than seven and a half years prior to the filing of the Rule 60(b) motion. <em>See id. </em>(noting that the courts should consider \u201cthe danger of prejudice to the opposing party\u201d and \u201cthe length of the delay and its potential impact on judicial proceedings\u201d in determining whether to grant a Rule 60(b) motion). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Menendez\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
