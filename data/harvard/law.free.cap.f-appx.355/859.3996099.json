The district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>court denied his request to proceed IFP on appeal, certifying that the appeal was not taken in good faith. Axmendariz\u2019s IFP motion in this court is a challenge to that certification. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">The Prison Litigation Reform Act requires a prisoner to exhaust his administrative remedies before he may file a Section 1983 suit against prison officials. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). Armendariz argues that the district court erred in finding that he failed to exhaust. To the extent that Armendariz has alleged new facts for the first time on appeal, those facts are not cognizable. <em>See Theriot v. Parish of Jefferson, </em>185 F.3d 477, 491 n. 26 (5th Cir. 1999). Otherwise, Armendariz repeats his conclusory allegations raised in district court that the defendants prevented him from exhausting. The district court found that those allegations were refuted by the defendants\u2019 evidence. Armendariz\u2019s allegations are insufficient to excuse him from the exhaustion requirement. <em>See Holloway v. Gunnell, </em>685 F.2d 150, 154 (5th Cir.1982). The record therefore supports the district court\u2019s conclusion that Armendariz failed to exhaust his administrative remedies as to the claims in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">Armendariz has not shown that he will present a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). His motion for leave for IFP on appeal is denied, and the appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">Our dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). The district court\u2019s dismissal, with prejudice, of Armendariz\u2019s Section 1983 complaint as frivolous and for failure to state a claim in <em>Armendariz v. U.S. Congress, </em>No. 1:08-cv-00154-C (N.D.Tex. Dec. 15, 2008), also counts as a strike under Section 1915(g). Armendariz is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes under Section 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g). Also, in light of Armendariz\u2019s history of filing frivolous pleadings, lawsuits, and habeas corpus petitions, we warn Armendariz that frivolous, repetitive, or otherwise abusive filings will invite the imposition of sanctions, including dismissal, monetary sanctions, and/or restrictions on his ability to file pleadings in this court and any court subject to this court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-8\">IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNINGS ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b881-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
