Prior to the instant arrest, Jackson had been convicted of several crimes\u2014including possession and delivery of cocaine; robbery with a firearm, burglary of a dwelling, and aggravated battery, all arising from a single incident and arrest; and resisting an officer with violence, in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 843.01\u2014and was classified as an \u201carmed career criminal,\u201d under the Armed Career\u2019 Criminal Act\u2019s (\u201cACCA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). On appeal, Jackson argues that: (1) \u201cresisting an officer with violence,\u201d as defined by the Florida statute under which he was convicted, and as interpreted by the Florida Supreme Court, does not qualify as a violent felony within the meaning of the ACCA; and (2) the application of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) is unconstitutional under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s determination that a particular conviction is a \u201cviolent felony\u201d within the meaning of the ACCA. <em>United States v. Canty, </em>570 F.3d 1251, 1254-55 (11th Cir.2009). We also review <em>de novo </em>claims that a sentence violates <em>Apprendi. United States v. Clay, </em>376 F.3d 1296, 1300 (11th Cir.2004). \u201cThis [C]ourt will review <em>de novo </em>appeals alleging error in an indictment under <em>Apprendi, </em>but we will reverse only for harmful error.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">First, we are unpersuaded by Jackson\u2019s argument that \u201cresisting an officer with violence,\u201d as defined by the Florida statute under which he was convicted, and as interpreted by the Florida Supreme Court, does not qualify as a violent felony within the meaning of the ACCA. The ACCA mandates a minimum term of 15 years\u2019 imprisonment for anyone who is convicted of possessing a firearm after having been convicted of a felony, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g), and who has three previous convictions for a violent felony and/or a serious drug offense. It defines a violent felony, in relevant part, as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-8\">[A]ny crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year ... that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-9\">(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-10\">(ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-11\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-12\">We use a \u201ccategorical\u201d approach when determining whether a prior conviction is a qualifying offense for ACCA enhancement purposes. <em>United States v. Llanos-Agostadero, </em>486 F.3d 1194, 1196-97 (11th Cir.2007). That is, we will \u201clook no further than the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense\u201d to determine whether a conviction fits the ACCA\u2019s definition of a violent felony. <em>Id. </em>\u201cIn determining whether a crime is a violent felony ... we examine it in terms of how the law defines the offense and not in terms of how an individual offender might have committed it on a particular occasion.\u201d <em>United States v. Harrison, </em>558 F.3d 1280, 1285 (11th Cir.2009) (quotation and brackets omitted). The issue of whether the federal ACCA applies to a state-law-defined crime is a question for federal courts, and state court rulings on the issue are not binding. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>528 F.3d 1318, 1321 (11th Cir.2008), ce<em>rt. granted, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1315, 173 L.Ed.2d 583 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-16\">Florida law provides that resisting an officer with violence is a felony: \u201cWhoever knowingly and willfully resists, obstructs, or opposes any officer ... in the execution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>of legal process or in the lawful execution of any legal duty, by offering or doing violence to the person of such officer or legally authorized person, is guilty of a felony of the third degree.... \u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 843.01. In <em>Frey v. State, </em>708 So.2d 918, 920 (Fla.1998), the Florida Supreme Court held that resisting an officer with violence does not require a heightened or particularized intent, \u201conly a general intent to \u2018knowingly and willfully5 impede an officer in the performance of his or her duties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">The Florida statute defines resisting an officer with violence as \u201cknowingly and willfully\u201d resisting an officer by \u201coffering or doing violence to the person of such officer....\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 843.01. Nothing in <em>Frey </em>contradicts the statute\u2019s plain language, which involves the \u201cuse, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another,\u201d as defined to be a predicate violent felony offense under the ACCA. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under our categorical analysis, Jackson\u2019s conviction of resisting an officer with violence therefore qualifies as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d within the meaning of the ACCA, and we need not turn to a specific factual inquiry. <em>See Llanos-Agostadero, </em>486 F.3d at 1196-97.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court did not err when it concluded that Jackson\u2019s criminal history warranted a corresponding sentence enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">We also reject Jackson\u2019s alternative argument that, because he used minimal force, his crime does not qualify as a violent felony. We have held that a prior conviction involving only a minimal amount of force can still constitute a violent felony. <em>See, e.g., Johnson, </em>528 F.3d at 1321-22 (holding that a Florida conviction for battery was a violent felony, which may be committed by \u201cintentional touching\u201d); <em>United States v. Young, </em>527 F.3d 1274, 1278 (11th Cir.2008) (holding that battery of a child involving bodily fluids was a violent felony within the meaning of the ACCA). Indeed, Jackson acknowledges our prior holdings. Although the Supreme Court has granted certiorari in <em>Johnson v. U.S. , </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1315, 173 L.Ed.2d 583 (2009), pending a decision, it remains the law of this circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-12\">We likewise find no merit in Jackson\u2019s claim that the application of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) is unconstitutional. In <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 226-27, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), the Supreme Court held that the factual issue of whether a defendant has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>been convicted of an \u201caggravated felony\u201d for senteneing-enhancement purposes is not a constitutional \u201celement of the offense,\u201d and it is not required to be alleged in the indictment. We are bound by that decision, and we have rejected the argument that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>is undermined by the Supreme Court\u2019s later holding in <em>Apprendi. United States v. Greer, </em>440 F.3d 1267, 1273-74 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">Jackson concedes that our previous holdings reject his argument. Although he argues that the Supreme Court appears to be ready to reconsider the issue, we have cautioned against such reasoning as the basis for an appeal: \u201cThe problem with lower courts basing decisions on predictions that the Supreme Coui\u2019t will overturn one of its own decisions is that the Supreme Court has repeatedly told us not to do it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1275. Accordingly, the district court did not err, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b321-6\">. Jackson's claim that, because the Florida Supreme Court has deemed it a \u201cgeneral intent\u201d crime, <em>Frey, </em>708 So.2d at 920, resisting an officer with violence is not a violent felony within the meaning of the ACCA is unpersuasive. Although the United States Supreme Court analyzed a similar statute and found that \"use of force\u201d or a threat to use force requires a \"higher degree of intent than negligent or merely accidental conduct,\u201d the Court did not cast its decision in terms of \"specific\u201d and/or \u201cgeneral\u201d intent. <em>See Leocal v. Ashcroft, </em>543 U.S. 1, 9, 125 S.Ct. 377, 160 L.Ed.2d 271 (2004). Thus, whether or not <em>Frey </em>deemed the crime to be one of \"general intent\u201d is irrelevant to the violent felony inquiry.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b321-7\">. Likewise, Jackson\u2019s reliance on <em>State v. Green, </em>400 So.2d 1322 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1981), is misplaced. In <em>Green, </em>an intermediate Florida state court held that a defendant who \"wiggled and struggled\u201d to free himself from handcuffs was not entitled to dismissal of a charge of resisting an officer with violence. <em>Id. </em>at 1323. The court reasoned that the ambiguous description of the defendant's actions \"prevent[ed] a determination by the trial court that [the defendant]'s conduct was or was not, as a matter of law, with violence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The issue before us however, does not involve an analysis of Jackson's specific conduct. <em>See Harrison, </em>558 F.3d at 1284. Instead, we only examine \"how the law defines the offense,\u201d and not \"how an individual offender might have committed it on a particular occasion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1285 (quotation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
