The action was removed to federal court as a diversity case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b363-10\">Jorge Luis Cabrera, a minor, was electrocuted near a bus shelter on or about October 12, 1998. Eller had performed the electrical installation at the bus shelter. The Miami-Dade County State Attorney\u2019s Office prosecuted Eller for criminal manslaughter, alleging that Eller had performed defective electrical work at the shelter. Eller spent significant sums of money in its criminal defense. Some of these funds were spent on \u201cwork product\u201d, including expert witnesses and developing defense strategies. As Eller points out in its brief, \u201c[although some \u2018work product\u2019 in the legal sense may have been included, the term \u2018work product\u2019 is used descriptively and not as the term is traditionally used when referring to a legal privilege.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Brief at 8 n.2.) We use the term in the same sense. The criminal case ended in an acquittal for Eller in April 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-13\">Cabrera\u2019s family initiated a civil wrongful death action against Eller on October 20, 1998. Eller\u2019s primary insurer, Reliance Insurance Company, initially provided Eller\u2019s defense. On September 14, 2001, however, the policy limits were exhausted. As a result, National Union took over Eller\u2019s defense pursuant to Eller\u2019s Commercial Umbrella Policy. Eller claims that National Union used work product created and paid for by Eller during its criminal proceedings, in National Union\u2019s civil defense of Eller, but refused to pay for the work product.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-14\">Eller brought suit against National Union, asserting claims for unjust enrichment, quantum meruit, and breach of contract. Both parties moved the district court for summary judgment. National Union sought summary judgment on all three counts of Eller\u2019s complaint. Eller opposed National Union\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and sought partial summary judgment on the breach of contract claim, or in the alternative, liability based upon unjust enrichment or quantum meruit. (R.5-181 at 3.) The district court granted National Union\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and denied Eller\u2019s motion. (R.5-131 at 18.) Eller appeals, contending that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to National Union on each of its three claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-15\">We first consider the unjust enrichment claim. In order to prevail under such a claim in Florida, Eller must demonstrate facts, that if accepted as true, would establish: (1) that a benefit was conferred upon National Union; (2) that National Union either requested the benefit or voluntarily accepted it; and (3) that under the present circumstances, it would be inequitable for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>National Union to retain the benefit without paying for it. <em>W.R. Townsend Contracting, Inc. v. Jensen Civil Const. Inc, </em>728 So.2d 297, 303 (Fla. 1st Dist.Ct.App. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">Although Eller argues otherwise, courts may resolve unjust enrichment claims on summary judgment. <em>See e.g., Nova Info. Sys., Inc. v. Greenwich Ins. Co., Nac, </em>365 F.3d 996 (11th Cir.2004). We assume for purposes of this appeal, as did the district court, that Eller established the first two elements of an unjust enrichment claim. Nevertheless, we agree with the district court that no inequity would occur by allowing National Union to retain the benefit of the work product without paying Eller for it. \u201c[Ejquity suggests that National Union should not be required to pay for the \u2018work product\u2019 of Eller that Eller generated in its own criminal defense, which was ultimately used again for the benefit of Eller in its civil defense.\u201d (R.5-131 at 14.) Eller disputes the district court\u2019s conclusion that it received a benefit from National Union\u2019s representation. Instead, Eller contends that it was National Union that received a benefit from use of the work product, because National Union was subjected to the financial exposure in the civil suit, not Eller. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Regardless of any benefit National Union received or the nature of Eller\u2019s limited financial exposure, it is undeniable that Eller received <em>some </em>benefit from National Union\u2019s use of the work product during its civil defense of Eller. Moreover, Eller certainly benefited during its criminal proceedings from the work product it developed. \u201cOrdinarily, restitution is not available under an unjust enrichment theory for a benefit conferred as an incident of a plaintiffs having acted primarily for his or her own benefit.\u201d 66 Am.Jur.2d, <em>Restitur tion and Implied Contracts, </em>\u00a7 13. Thus, although it was \u201cfortuitous\u201d for National Union to use Eller\u2019s work product during its representation of Eller, (R.5-131 at 15), that work product was used solely for the benefit of Eller during the criminal proceedings and at least partly for the benefit of Eller during the civil action. We concur with the district court that if Eller\u2019s logic were followed, National Union would have been able to start from scratch and forego using the work product that already existed. \u201cHowever, if National Union had followed such a course of conduct ... it is questionable whether National Union would have been acting in the best interest of [Eller] and/or acting in good faith in the resolution of it[s] insured\u2019s claims.\u201d (Dist. Ct. Order, R.l-131 at 14-15) <em>(citing Nat\u2019l Union Fire Ins. Co. v. Travelers Ins. Co., </em>214 F.3d 1269, 1274 (11th Cir.2000)). Because no inequity would result by allowing National Union to use the work product without providing compensation to Eller, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment to National Union on the unjust enrichment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">Having considered the briefs on the other issues, we conclude that the district court properly ' granted National Union summary judgment on Eller\u2019s breach of contract and quantum meruit claims for the reasons stated in its order on the motion.
