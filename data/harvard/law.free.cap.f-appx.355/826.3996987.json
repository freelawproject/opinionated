We review de novo the district court\u2019s dismissal. <em>Geiger v. Jowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 373 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-20\">Through the vehicle of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, Richards sought DNA evidence related to his conviction and 20-year sentence for second degree aggravated sexual assault. The district court determined that Richards\u2019s claims were barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994) and <em>Kutzner v. Montgomery County, </em>303 F.3d 339 (5th Cir.2002), the latter of which held that a petition for habeas corpus relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\u2014not \u00a7 1983\u2014is the procedural mechanism by which claims that \u201cnecessarily imply the invalidity of [a plaintiffs] conviction or sentence\u201d must be brought. <em>Kutzner, </em>303 F.3d at 340-41 (quoting <em>Heck; </em>512 U.S. at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364)(alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-21\">We need not resolve whether <em>Kutzner </em>remains good law or <em>Heck </em>bars Richards\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim for access to DNA evidence because, whether his claims sound in habeas or \u00a7 1983, Richards cannot establish the deprivation of a constitutional right. There is no freestanding federal constitutional right to post-conviction access to DNA evidence for testing. <em>Dist. Attorney\u2019s Office for Third Judicial Dist. v. Osborne, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2308, 2323, 174 L.Ed.2d 38 (2009). Moreover, for purposes of a procedural due process claim, Richards has not demonstrated the facial inadequacy of Texas\u2019s procedures for post-conviction DNA access, and never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>having invoked the state process available to him, he cannot sustain an as-applied challenge. <em>Id. </em>at 2321.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">Accordingly, Richards\u2019s appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b848-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under die limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
