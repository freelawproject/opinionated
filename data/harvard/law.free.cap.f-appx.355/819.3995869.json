We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-14\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b842-15\">This case arises out of a boating accident in Galveston Bay. In July 2006, James and Donald Ervin set out on Donald\u2019s boat for a day of fishing. After fishing at Bart\u2019s Pass, the Ervins navigated towards Earnest Reef at about twenty miles per hour. As they approached, their vessel allided with a submerged object, which the Ervins claim was a pipe with a four- to six-inch diameter. Donald was thrown over board, and James was thrown against the vessel\u2019s bow. Both lost consciousness briefly and were treated at the emergency room for their injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-16\">The Ervins sued Masters and alleged that it owned or controlled the pipeline struck by their vessel. A jury, however, rendered a verdict for Masters, finding that it did not own, control, maintain, or put in place the pipe the Ervins struck. The district court entered judgment on the verdict and denied the Ervins\u2019 motion for a new trial. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-17\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b842-18\">The Ervins argue that the jury verdict was against the great weight of the evidence. But federal courts \u201cdo not directly review jury verdicts.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Since the Ervins did not move for judgment as a matter of law on the sufficiency of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>evidence, they did not properly preserve that argument in the district court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Issues raised for the first time on appeal are reviewed only for plain error.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On plain error review, the question \u201cis not whether there was substantial evidence to support the jury verdict, but whether there was any evidence to support the jury verdiet.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">Although the Ervins raised the issue in a motion for a new trial, such a motion \u201cwill not reopen the question foreclosed by plaintiffs\u2019 failure to move for a directed verdict.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A denial of a motion for new trial is reviewed for abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As such, we do not review the \u201csufficiency\u201d of the evidence, but rather \u201cwhether there was an absolute absence of evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">Because the alleged tort occurred in navigable waters, the ease is governed by admiralty law.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> To establish liability, the Ervins had to show that Masters \u201cowned, maintained, placed, or controlled\u201d the submerged obstruction that damaged their vessel.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Ervins argue that the evidence conclusively established that Masters owned, maintained, placed, or controlled the object at issue and that no reasonable juror could have found otherwise. Specifically, the Ervins point to the testimony as to where the accident occurred and the testimony of Masters\u2019s corporate representative, John Barton, which they allege establishes that Masters controlled and maintained all pipelines in the vicinity of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">We conclude that there is some evidence to support the jury verdict. The only evidence that the Ervins struck a pipe was their testimony that immediately after the accident, which knocked them both unconscious, they saw a four- to six-inch rusty pipe just below the surface of the water. But when they returned to the alleged location of the allision, they could not locate the pipe and therefore could offer no direct proof that Masters owned the object that was struck. Although the Ervins offered circumstantial evidence suggesting that Masters owned most of the pipes in the area, this evidence was countered by testimony from Masters\u2019s witnesses that two other companies had pipes in or near the accident location. Moreover, the Ervins insisted that the pipe allegedly struck had a diameter of four to six inches, and Masters\u2019s corporate representative testified that it did not own any pipelines that size in the area of the accident. Accordingly, we cannot conclude that there is an \u201cabsolute absence\u201d of evidence supporting the jury verdict. Given the highly deferential standard of review, we must affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-15\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b842-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
