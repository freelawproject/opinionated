On appeal, Moreland argues that: (1) because he was originally sentenced under the drug quantity guideline, rather than the career offender guideline, the district court should have resentenced him without considering the applicability of career offender guideline; and (2) if we determine that he was sentenced as a career offender, his case should be stayed until the petition for rehearing <em>en banc </em>has been resolved in the similar case of <em>United States v. Argro, </em>No. 08-14591. After careful review, we affirm, and deny his motion for a stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">We \u201creview <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions regarding the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). Section 3582(c)(2) gives federal courts the authority to consider reducing the sentence \u201cof a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">A district court must follow a two-step process in ruling on a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000). First, the court must recalculate the defendant\u2019s sentence \u201cby substituting the amended guideline range for the originally applied guideline range, and then using that new base level to determine what ultimate sentence it would have imposed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In other words, the court \u201cshall determine the amended guideline range that would have been applicable to the defendant if the amendment(s) ... had been in effect at the time the defendant was sentenced.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l). Under the second step, the court must decide whether to retain the original sentence or to resentence the defendant under the amended guideline range. <em>Id. </em>at 781.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-11\">A career offender\u2019s base offense level is determined by using either the offense level which would ordinarily apply under Chapters 2 and 3, or, if it results in a <em>higher </em>offense level, the table in \u00a7 4Bl.l(b). U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b). Thus, where, as here, a defendant\u2019s offense level would be the same, sentencing under Chapters 2 and 3 is contemplated.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-12\">In <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323 (11th Cir.2008), cert. <em>denied, McFadden v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009), <em>and cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009), we held that defendants who were originally sentenced under \u00a7 4Bl.l(b)\u2019s career offender table were not eligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief because their guideline ranges were not based on the drug quantity offense levels which had been lowered by Amendment 706. 541 F.3d at 1327-30. The <em>Moore </em>decision, however, did not address the applicability of Amendment 706 to a career offender who was originally sentenced based on the drug quantity guideline.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-17\">In this case, Moreland was originally sentenced as a career offender, but his base offense level was determined under \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) because application of \u00a7 4B 1.1(b) did not result in a higher of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>fense level. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b). Because of Moreland\u2019s status as a career offender, the district court, in determining whether Amendment 706 reduced Moreland\u2019s guideline range, was required to consider not only whether the amendment reduced his drag quantity base offense level, but also its determination at his original sentencing that Moreland was a career offender. <em>See </em>Bravo, 203 F.3d at 780. In other words, the court had to determine More-land\u2019s new base offense level under \u00a7 2Dl.l(c), and then compare it to his career offender base offense level under \u00a7 4Bl.l(b) to determine which was higher.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">Amendment 706 reduced Moreland\u2019s drug quantity base offense level from 34 to 32. See U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 706. Nevertheless, because 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 860(a) carry a statutory maximum sentence of 80 years\u2019 imprisonment, Moreland\u2019s base offense level under \u00a7 4Bl.l(b) remained at 34. See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(B), 860(a); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b). Therefore, Amendment 706 did not have the effect of reducing More-land\u2019s sentencing range. This approach is consistent with the policy statement in \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l), which directs the court to \u201cdetermine the amended guideline range that would have been applicable to the defendant if the amendment(s) ... had been in effect at the time the defendant was sentenced.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l). As a result, the district court did not err in denying Moreland\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, and we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of the motion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b400-10\">. We also deny Moreland's request to stay his case pending the resolution of the <em>en banc </em>petition in <em>Argro </em>because we have already dismissed the petition in <em>Argro.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
