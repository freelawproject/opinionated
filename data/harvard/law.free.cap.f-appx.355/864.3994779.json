After this court affirmed his conviction on appeal, Spykes filed a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence. The district court denied relief and declined to issue a certificate of appealability. This court, however, granted Spykes\u2019s request for a certificate of appealability on the issue of whether his counsel was ineffective for failing to allow Spykes to testify at his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-22\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b886-23\">We review the district court\u2019s findings of fact in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding for clear error.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Questions of law are reviewed de novo.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b886-24\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b886-25\">When a defendant argues that his counsel failed to allow him to testify, \u201cthe appropriate vehicle for such claims is a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel under <em>Strickland v. </em>Washington.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Under <em>Strickland, </em>a defendant must demonstrate that his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and prejudiced the defense.'<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> To establish deficient performance, the defendant must \u201cshow that counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> There is a \u201cstrong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> To establish prejudice, the defendant \u201cmust show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b887-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>Spykes argues that this court should set aside the <em>Strickland </em>test for ineffective assistance of counsel and instead require the Government to prove that counsel\u2019s deficient performance was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Because Spykes\u2019s argument runs counter to established Fifth Circuit precedent, we decline to adopt such a test.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">Spykes further argues that if he had been allowed to testify, he would have been acquitted. Spykes states that had he been given the opportunity at trial, he would have been able to rebut testimony concerning the presence of large amounts of cash, drugs, and firearms in his vehicle. At the evidentiary hearing, the magistrate judge considered these arguments and concluded that, in light of the testimony and Spykes\u2019s demeanor during the hearing, there was not a reasonable probability that Spykes would have been found not guilty if he had testified at trial. We find no error in the magistrate judge\u2019s conclusions, and thus we hold that Spykes has failed to establish an ineffective assistance of counsel claim under <em>Strickland. </em>Therefore, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">Spykes also filed a motion to substitute counsel or in the alternative to relieve counsel and proceed pro se on appeal. Spykes\u2019s request comes too late, however, because Spykes waited until after his appellate brief was filed to inform the court that he wished to substitute counsel or proceed pro se.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b887-7\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b887-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment. Spykes\u2019s motion to substitute counsel or in the alternative to relieve counsel and proceed pro se on appeal is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b886-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
