The IJ found Jimenez\u2019s conviction records as clear and convincing evidence that Jimenez was subject to removal for conviction of a crime relating to a controlled substance and denied his application for cancellation of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) as ineligible because of his convictions. For the reasons set forth below, we dismiss his petition in part for lack of jurisdiction and deny in part because the BIA correctly decided that Jimenez\u2019s convictions constitute an aggravated felony rendering him ineligible for cancellation of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">This Court has statutory jurisdiction to review final orders of removal. INA \u00a7 242, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. However, this jurisdiction is restricted by INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(C), which states that courts do not have jurisdiction \u201cto review any final order of removal against an alien\u201d who is removed for crimes relating to a controlled substance under Section 237(a)(2)(B)(i). 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C). Additionally, we are generally forbidden from reviewing removal orders for cases in which the alien has been convicted of an aggravated felony. <em>Carachuri-Rosendo v. Holder, </em>570 F.3d 263, 265 (5th Cir.2009) (citations omitted). Notwithstanding, we retain jurisdiction to review facts and issues involving a question of law. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D).. Because Jimenez\u2019 petition falls within this exception, we review the BIA\u2019s rulings of law de novo. <em>See Carachuri-Rosendo, </em>570 F.3d at 265.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-10\">Jimenez contends that neither drug conviction is considered a felony under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), and thus, not an aggravated felony that would render him ineligible for cancellation of removal. Jimenez asks us to reverse the BIA\u2019s findings that Jimenez has been convicted of a recidivist offense and that the IJ failed to link Jimenez\u2019 homosexuality and HIV/AIDS disease properly together. The BIA found Jimenez removable under INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(B)\u00ae, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B)\u00ae because he is an alien who was convicted of a crime relating to a controlled substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-12\">Jimenez\u2019s two drug convictions constitute an aggravated felony. In <em>United States v. Sanchez-Villalobos, </em>412 F.3d 572, 576 (5th Cir.2005), this Court concluded that two state convictions for possession could be punished as a felony under the CSA\u2019s recidivism provisions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Later, this Court in <em>United States v. Cepeda-Rios, </em>530 F.3d 333, 334-35 (5th Cir.2008), stated its approach to this issue in <em>Sanchez-Villalobos </em>was still viable after <em>Lopez </em>and again decided that a second state possession offense punishable as a felony under federal law qualified as an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B). <em>Carachuri-Rosendo, </em>570 F.3d at 266-67. Recently, this Court affirmed an en-banc decision by the BIA in <em>Carachuri-Rosendo, </em>that determined that even though the petitioner had been convicted twice of misdemeanor possession charges but was not charged as a recidivist, the convictions met the definition of an aggravated felony under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>CSA. <em>Id. </em>at 265. Here, the facts are similar to those in <em>Carachuri-Rosendo </em>because Jimenez also has two misdemeanor state drug conviction that the BIA determined under this Court\u2019s case law to meet the definition of an aggravated felon for recidivist possession. Jimenez\u2019s December 2000 conviction under California law require the same elements as a conviction under federal possession would require. While Jimenez argues that use of cocaine should not be considered the same as possession of cocaine, this argument is foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Courtney, </em>979 F.2d 45, 49 (5th Cir.1992), in which we determined that possession and use were not distinct crimes with separate elements. Jimenez\u2019s 2004 conviction under Florida law constitutes his second conviction that may be considered together to meet the definition of an aggravated felony under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(a). <em>See SanchezVillalobos, </em>412 F.3d at 576-77. Thus, Jimenez\u2019s two drug convictions render him ineligible for cancellation of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">Jimenez also asks this Court to review his claim for withholding of removal. But, as Jimenez merely disagrees with the Board\u2019s finding of evidence and does not raise a constitutional claim or question of law, we lack jurisdiction to review.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">Therefore, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b867-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
