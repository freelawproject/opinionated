Fay contends that the district court failed to comply with <em>United States v. Jones, </em>899 F.2d 1097 (11th Cir.1990), <em>overruled on other grounds by United States v. Morrill, </em>984 F.2d 1136 (11th Cir.1993), when it failed to elicit objections from the parties regarding the court\u2019s findings of fact, conclusions of law, and the manner in which the sentence was imposed. He also contends that the record is insufficient for meaningful appellate review of the procedural and substantive reasonableness of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-14\">District courts must \u201celicit fully articulated objections, following imposition of sentence, to the court\u2019s ultimate findings of fact and conclusions of law,\u201d as well as to \u201cthe manner in which the sentence is pronounced.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>899 F.2d at 1102. The objection-elicitation requirement of <em>Jones </em>applies to revocation of supervised release proceedings. <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>473 F.3d 1345, 1348 (11th Cir.2007). A district court\u2019s question about whether there is \u201canything else\u201d or \u201canything further\u201d is not enough to meet that requirement. <em>Id. </em>\u201cWhere the district court has not elicited fully articulated objections following the imposition of sentence, [we] will vacate the sentence and remand for further sentencing in order to give the parties an opportunity to raise and explain their objections.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>899 F.2d at 1103. Remand is unnecessary, however, if the record on appeal is sufficient for meaningful appellate review. <em>Campbell, </em>473 F.3d at 1347.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-15\">At the conclusion of Fay\u2019s revocation hearing, the district court imposed the sentence and asked, \u201canything else?\u201d In response, neither side raised a \u201cfully articulated objection.\u201d Therefore, the district court failed to comply with the procedure required by <em>Jones. See Campbell, </em>473 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>F.3d at 1348. Furthermore, the record is insufficient to allow for meaningful review of the reasonableness of Fay\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">A sentence imposed upon the revocation of supervised release is reviewed for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d 1105, 1106-07 (11th Cir.2006). An abuse of discretion standard applies to our reasonableness review. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 46, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). \u201c[W]e must first ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. To do that, we determine whether the district court (1) properly calculated the guideline range; (2) treated the guidelines as advisory; (3) considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors; (4) did not select a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts; and (5) adequately explained the chosen sentence, including an explanation for any variance from the guideline range. <em>Id., </em>128 S.Ct. at 597; <em>Campbell, </em>473 F.3d at 1349 (holding that in a revocation proceeding we must \u201cfirst determine whether the district court correctly interpreted and applied the appropriate advisory Guidelines range.\u201d) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">In a revocation proceeding when the district court finds \u201cby a preponderance of the evidence that a defendant has violated a condition of supervised release, [a district court may] revoke the term of supervised release and impose a term of imprisonment after considering certain factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d at 1107; <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e). One of the factors that the court must consider is the sentencing range established by the guidelines or policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission. <em>Campbell, </em>473 F.3d at 1348; <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3583(e), 3553(a)(4). For sentences imposed upon revocation of supervised release, the recommended sentencing range is based on the classification of the conduct that resulted in the revocation and the criminal history category applicable at the time of the defendant\u2019s original sentencing. U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 7B1.1, 7B1.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">In <em>Campbell </em>we held that the record was insufficient for meaningful appellate review because during the revocation hearing the district court never mentioned the guideline range, and it did not mention the criminal classification of the violation that was the basis for the revocation. <em>Campbell, </em>473 F.3d at 1349. Even though defense counsel and the government mentioned the guideline range during the revocation hearing, we concluded that the record still was insufficient because \u201cthe district court <em>itself </em>never made any on-the-record conclusion regarding the Guidelines or the applicable sentencing range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1349 n. 2 (emphasis in original). We declined to consider the reasonableness of the ultimate sentence because we must be able to determine whether a sentence is procedurally reasonable before we address substantive reasonableness. <em>Id. </em>at 1349.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">Here, the district court itself never identified the guideline range or even mentioned the word \u201cguideline.\u201d Furthermore, the district court never mentioned the criminal classification for the violations used to revoke Fay\u2019s supervised release or his criminal history category. Thus, as in <em>Campbell, </em>the record is insufficient to determine whether the district court correctly calculated the sentencing range or considered the sentencing range and policy statements. Because we are unable to determine whether Fay\u2019s sentence is procedurally reasonable, we cannot review the substantive reasonableness of Fay\u2019s ultimate sentence. <em>See Campbell, </em>473 F.3d at 1349. Accordingly, we vacate Fay\u2019s sentence and remand to the district court for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>resentencing in accordance with <em>Jones </em>and <em>Campbell.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
