Pursuant to \u00a7 2605(e), a loan servicer, upon receipt of a qualified written request, must provide \u201ca written response acknowledging receipt of the correspondence\u201d within 20 business days. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2605(e)(1)(A). RESPA further requires that, within 60 business days of receipt of a qualified written request, the servicer must either: (1) make appropriate corrections in the account of the borrower and transmit a written notification of such correction; (2) after conducting an investigation, provide the borrower with a written explanation that includes a statement of the reasons for which the servicer believes the account is correct, and the name and telephone number of an employee or department that can provide further assistance; or (8) after conducting an investigation, provide the borrower with a written explanation that includes the information requested by the borrower or an explanation of why the information requested is unavailable, along with the name and telephone number of an employee or department that can provide further assistance. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2605(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">We hold that the district court properly concluded that BoA complied with its statutory obligations under \u00a7\u00a7 2605(e)(1) and 2605(e)(2). In accordance with the former provision, BoA acknowledged receipt of the Chipkas\u2019 qualified written requests within the applicable 20-day response period. Moreover, pursuant to \u00a7 2605(e)(2), BoA provided the Chipkas with a written explanation of why it believed that their loan was correctly serviced and transmitted the name and telephone number of an employee who could provide them with further assistance. In sum, the court properly granted BoA summary judgment on the Chipkas\u2019 RESPA claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">For the first time on appeal, the Chipkas argue that BoA violated its obligations under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681s-2(a) as a furnisher of credit information by knowingly disseminating and failing to correct inaccurate credit information transmitted to consumer reporting agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">In general, the FCRA was enacted \u201cto require that consumer reporting agencies adopt reasonable procedures for meeting the needs of commerce for consumer credit ... in a manner which is fair and equitable to the consumer, with regard to the confidentiality, accuracy, relevancy, and proper utilization of such information.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681(b). To achieve its purpose, the FCRA places distinct obligations on three types of entities: consumer reporting agencies, users of consumer reports, and furnishers of information to consumer reporting agencies. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1681b, 1681m, and 1681s-2. Among other statutory responsibilities, consumer reporting agencies must follow reasonable procedures to assure the accuracy of information contained in consumer reports, note the existence of any non-frivolous disputes concerning information in a consumer report, and delete or correct any information disputed by a consumer that is found to be inaccurate and promptly notify the furnisher of that information of such corrective action. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1681e(b), 1681i(c), 1681i(a)(5). The Act defines a \u201cconsumer reporting agency\u201d as \u201cany person which ... regularly engages in whole or in part in the practice of assembling or evaluating consumer credit information ... for the purpose of furnishing consumer reports to third parties.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1681a(f). The statutory definition, however, excludes those that solely report information \u201cas to transactions or experiences between the consumer and the person making the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>port.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1681a(d)(2)(A)(i); <em>see also Smith v. First Nat\u2019l Bank of Atlanta, </em>837 F.2d 1575, 1578 (11th Cir.1988) (holding that a bank reporting information solely on its own experience with one of its customers was not acting as a \u201cconsumer reporting agency\u201d within the meaning of the FCRA). Civil liability may be imposed on consumer reporting agencies who willfully or negligently violate the FCRA. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1681n and 1681o.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Pursuant to \u00a7 1681s-2, the FCRA also imposes certain responsibilities on persons who furnish information to consumer reporting agencies. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1681s-2. Under subsection (a), persons may not knowingly furnish inaccurate information to a consumer reporting agency, must correct any such furnished information, and must notify a consumer reporting agency when any information is disputed by a consumer. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1681s-2(a)(l)-(3). In accordance with subsection (b), furnishers of consumer credit information must also verify the sufficiency and accuracy of the information when notified by a consumer reporting agency of a credit-report dispute. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1681s-2(b); <em>see also id. </em>\u00a7 1681i(a)(2). Congress, however, expressly reserved enforcement of subsection (a) to governmental agencies and officials, thereby limiting a consumer\u2019s private cause of action against a furnisher of credit information to violations of \u00a7 1681s-2(b). <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1681s-2(c)\u2014(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">In their counseled complaint,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the Chipkas specifically alleged that BoA violated \u00a7\u00a7 1681e(b), 1681i(c), and 1681o of the FCRA by disseminating and subsequently failing to correct inaccurate and false information regarding their credit history. Although the district court determined that BoA could not be held civilly liable under those specific provisions because it does not constitute a \u201cconsumer reporting agency\u201d within the meaning of the Act, the Chipkas do not challenge the court\u2019s determination, but rather, invoke distinct statutory provisions regulating the conduct of those who furnish credit information to such agencies. Because the Chipkas currently rely on statutory provisions that were neither raised nor addressed by the district court, and because the court was not obligated to liberally construe their counseled complaint, the FCRA claims raised on appeal are deemed forfeited. Moreover, as the Chipkas fail to address the FCRA claims actually presented to the district court, those claims are abandoned. We accordingly affirm the court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on the Chipkas\u2019 FCRA claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-12\">On cross-appeal, BoA argues that the district court erred in denying its motion for summary judgment as to the Chipkas\u2019s remaining state law claims. The BoA apparently overlooks the fact that the court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the Chipkas\u2019s state law claims, dismissing them without prejudice. It was within the court\u2019s discretion to do this. The state law claims are not before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-13\">We find no merit in the Chipkas\u2019s appeal and BoA\u2019s cross appeal. The district court\u2019s judgment is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b405-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b403-11\">. In addition to challenging the district court's disposition of their RESPA and FCRA claims, the Chipkas argue that the court mismanaged the case, suggesting, among other things, that the court was biased against <em>pro se </em>litigants like themselves. Their initial brief fails, however, to develop the argument. We therefore treat it as abandoned.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b403-12\">. We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, considering all evidence and drawing all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Galvez v. Bruce, </em>552 F.3d 1238, 1241 (11th Cir.2008). We review for abuse of discretion a district court's refusal to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over state law claims under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367 after dismissing the federal question claim(s) from the case. <em>See generally </em>36 C.J.S. Federal Courts \u00a7 16.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b403-21\">. The Chipkas also claim that BoA violated 12 \u00a7 2605(e)(3) of RESPA by reporting derogatory information regarding to a credit reporting agency within 60 days of receipt of their requests. They did not present this claim to the district court. We therefore do not consider it. <em>Access Now, Inc. v. Southwest Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1329-31 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b405-7\">. The Chipkas were represented by retained counsel at the time their complaint was filed. Counsel withdrew, and the Chipkas proceeded <em>pro se, </em>prior lo the district court\u2019s disposition of the parties motions for summary judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
