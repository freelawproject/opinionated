Ellis asserts U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 is unreasonable where the only offense characteristic it takes into consideration is the defendant\u2019s criminal history, and the imposition of 48 months\u2019 imprisonment was unreasonable in his case because it was based on a 16-point enhancement in his criminal offense category for a crime he committed over 25 years ago.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-16\">The Government contends this Court should not address Ellis\u2019s claim that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 is unreasonable because he invited the district court to sentence him pursuant to that section. Ellis filed no objections to the PSI and specifically told the district court at sentencing he agreed with the calculations in the PSI. The Government argues Ellis has waived the right to appeal this asserted error because he invited it.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-17\">\u201cIn the Eleventh Circuit, the doctrine of invited error is implicated when a party induces or invites the district court into making an error.\u201d <em>United States v. Brannan, </em>562 F.3d 1300, 1306 (11th Cir.2009) (quotations omitted). \u2018Where a party invites error, the Court is precluded from reviewing that error on appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Ellis did not object to the asserted inherent unreasonableness in \u00a7 2L1.2. In fact, his counsel stated that he \u201cagreed\u201d with the PSI calculations in his case, and requested a sentence of \u201c46 months or the least amount of incarceration that the Court sees fit.\u201d The court sentenced Ellis just above the low end of the Guidelines range after Ellis\u2019s counsel agreed with the Guidelines range and made no objections to the PSI. Therefore, because Ellis invited the error, if any, of which he now complains, we are precluded from reviewing that error on appeal. <em>See Brannan, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>562 F.3d at 1306. Thus, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ALru\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b334-15\">. Ellis specifically requested a sentence two months lower than the one imposed. To the extent he challenges the overall reasonableness of his sentence apart from the application of \u00a7 2L1.2, we conclude the district court's sentence was both procedurally and substantively reasonable. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
