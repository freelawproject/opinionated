On appeal, Makos argues that his sentence was substantively unreasonable because the district court failed to adequately consider 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors prior denying his request for a downward variance below the United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cGuidelines\u201d) range.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-16\">\n<em>I. BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b279-17\">Makos, a prior convicted felon, pled guilty to the charged offense for possession of one or more firearms and ammunition. During the sentencing hearing, the district court assigned Makos a base offense level of 21 and found the applicable Guideline range to be between 37 and 46 months. Doc. 87 at 59. Makos however, requested that the district court give him a more lenient sentence by granting him a downward variance from the Guidelines range. The government recommended a sentence at the low end of the Guidelines range. The district court agreed and sentenced Makos to 37 months. After review of the record and the briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-18\">\n<em>II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b279-19\">We review the district court\u2019s decision not to grant Makos a downward variance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>from the Guidelines range for reasonableness in light of the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>485 F.3d 1264, 1272 (11th Cir.2007). We review the reasonableness of a sentence imposed on a defendant for a deferential abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Beckles, </em>565 F.3d 832, 845 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">\n<em>HI. DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">As an initial matter, the government\u2019s argument that Makos did not object to his sentence on procedural or substantive grounds, and that Makos is only entitled to relief if he can establish plain error affecting his substantial rights, is meritless. In his sentencing memorandum, Makos explicitly asked the district court for a below-Guideline sentence, arguing that such a sentence was justified by the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> During the sentencing hearing, Makos again asked the district court for a downward variance. Therefore, Makos has properly preserved the issue on appeal. Thus, the central issue is whether the district court erred in its determination not to lower Makos\u2019 sentence below the Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">Turning to the merits of the case, Makos does not challenge the procedural measures taken by the district court when fashioning his sentence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Rather, Makos argues that although his 37-month sentence is at the low end of the Guidelines range, his sentence is substantively unreasonable. In support of this argument, he contends that the district court failed to consider whether a downward variance was appropriate based on a totality of the circumstances which includes consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors prior to imposing his sentence. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (permitting variance pursuant to sentencing factors). Makos explained to the district court that his prior felony conviction occurred twenty-eight (28) years ago. He added that most of the firearms at issue in this case were inherited from his father, and they were not intended to further unlawful conduct. Based on this, Makos argued that it would be unfair to severely penalize him for something that happened so long ago, so a sentence below the Guidelines range is warranted. The district court found this argument unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>Review of a district court\u2019s decision regarding downward variances is subject to deference so long as it is reasonable in light of the \u00a7 3558(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Willis, </em>560 F.3d 1246, 1251 (11th Cir.2009). Consequently, this Court grants deference to a district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of any variance, or its decision to refrain from granting a downward departure. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. at 597.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Moreover \u201cthe weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court, and [this Court] will not substitute [its] judgment in weighing the relevant factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 832 (11th Cir.2007) (internal quotations omitted). Since we review the \u201ctotality of the circumstances,\u201d a district court need not discuss each \u00a7 3553(a) factor if the judge imposes a sentence within the Guidelines range. <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1191 n. 8. The burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is on the party challenging the sentence. <em>Johnson, </em>485 F.3d at 1272.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">After review, we conclude that Makos has not met this burden. Contrary to Makos\u2019 argument, the record reflects that the district court explicitly considered a number of \u00a7 3553(a) factors prior to imposing a sentence. To begin with, the district court expressly stated that it \u201cconsidered\u201d the \u201cstatutory factors,\u201d finding that the most \u201cappropriate and reasonable sentence\u201d was 37 months. Doc. 87 at 90. The district court then engaged in an examination of those factors as it applied to Makos\u2019 offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">Pursuant to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district court examined \u201cthe history and characteristics of the defendant.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1). The district court found that Makos: (1) had been convicted, in 1980, of aggravated assault, kidnaping, and possession of a weapon to commit an offense, and (2) had been convicted, in 2004, of brandishing a firearm. The district court, therefore, observed that Makos had continuously been in possession of firearms in defiance of the law for the past twenty-eight (28) years. This discussion emphasizes the district court\u2019s uneasiness with Makos\u2019 repetitive history for possessing destructive devices as a prior convicted felon, and the necessity promote respect for the law pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A). As such, the district court properly deduced that there was a \u201creal issue here about acceptance of responsibility,\u201d and that Makos was devoid of an \u201cappreciation of the danger\u201d to which he exposed others. Doc. 87 at 86. Consequently, it properly concluded that even though there are people who \u201clove him and respect him and appreciate him,\u201d Makos\u2019 history prompted the district court\u2019s concern that his character appeared to be \u201csomeone who is willing to endanger the other people living in his condominium to this degree.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 92. This is especially true when the convicted felon exposes the weapon, threatening people in their community.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">Indeed, as a matter of principle, it is well settled that convicted felons are not permitted to be in possession of firearms, explosive chemicals, or to brandish fire<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>arms. Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion when it determined that there is a necessity to \u201cprotect the public from further crimes of the defendant\u201d pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(C). In doing so, the district court acknowledged Makos\u2019 arguments for a sentence below the Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">Additionally, at the sentencing hearing, the district court stated that it was \u201creally worried that Mr. Makos is a danger to the community.\u201d Doc. 87 at 90. The district court also noted that because Makos was found to have dangerous chemicals, \u201cthe whole building [c]ould have gone up like a bomb, not to speak of the buildings nearby. It\u2019s inexplicable. I don\u2019t understand it, but it makes me very fearful that Mr. Makos is a danger to the community.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 93. In view of the district court\u2019s findings, it appropriately rationalized that it could not \u201cin good conscious to the community\u201d grant Makos a downward variance from the Guidelines range. <em>Id. </em>In light of the scope and severity of Makos\u2019 offenses, we cannot say that the district court imposed an unreasonable sentence by denying Makos\u2019 request for a downward variance from the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">\n<em>IV. CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">The record thus reflects the district court\u2019s adequate consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Accordingly, the district court has not abused its discretion, and we affirm its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b280-6\">. In addition 'to the applicable Guidelines range, Section 3553(a) provides that district courts must consider, <em>inter alia, </em>(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense; (2) the history and characteristics of the defendant; (3) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (4) the need for adequate deterrence to criminal conduct; (5) protection of the public from further crimes of the defendant; and (6) the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b280-7\">. Generally, if a defendant challenges the reasonableness of the overall sentence, we must consider the correctly calculated advisory Guidelines range and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Johnson, </em>485 F.3d at 1272. Therefore, our review for reasonableness consists of two steps. <em>Beckles, </em>565 F.3d at 845; <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1190 (11th Cir.2008). First, we must verify that the district court did not commit a procedural error, such as failing to properly calculate the Guidelines range, failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines, or selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts. <em>Beckles, </em>565 F.3d at 845. Second, \"[i]f the district court did not procedurally err, then we must consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard, based on the totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotes and citations omitted). In the instant case, Makos does not contend that his 37-month sentence is procedurally unreasonable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b281-6\">. In <em>Gall, </em>the Supreme Court advised that an appellate court \"may consider the extent of the deviation, but must give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u201d <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. at 597. Although the court did not deviate from the Guidelines range in the instant case, <em>Gall </em>makes clear that district court\u2019s decision whether to grant such a variance and its consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is afforded deference.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
