Previously, the district court granted Wynn\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion and reduced his sentence to 136 months\u2019 imprisonment. However, we remanded to the district court because it was not apparent from the record whether the district court had considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. On remand, the district court again reduced Wynn\u2019s sentence to 136 months\u2019 imprisonment, which was at the middle of his amended Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-26\">Wynn asserts the district court abused its discretion and violated this Court\u2019s or<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>der by failing to consider his family\u2019s health under either the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5H1.6. Wynn further contends the district court violated <em>Clisby v. Jones, </em>960 F.2d 925 (11th Cir.1992) (en banc), by failing to address the merits of his claim or to make a legal finding as to why he was not entitled to a lower sentence under \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in determining the extent of the sentence reduction because the record demonstrates it took into account the pertinent \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002) (reviewing for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2)). The district court explicitly stated it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and found the middle of the amended Guidelines range was the appropriate sentence due to the need to protect the public. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(C); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>557 F.3d 1254, 1256 (11th Cir.2009) (stating, if the defendant is eligible for a sentence reduction, the district court must consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors as well as public safety considerations, regardless of whether it ultimately denies or grants \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief). Additionally, \u00a7 5H1.6 is not a retroactively applicable Guidelines amendment and the district court could not consider it in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(A). Contrary to Wynn\u2019s contentions, the district court\u2019s order indicates it did consider his wife\u2019s health condition, but the condition was not sufficient to overcome the concern for public safety. Further, Wynn\u2019s reliance on <em>Clisby </em>is misplaced, both because the district court resolved all claims before it and because the <em>Clisby </em>doctrine, by its own terms, is available only in habeas proceedings. <em>See Clisby, </em>960 F.2d at 936 (instructing district court to resolve all claims in a federal habeas petition, regardless of whether habeas relief is granted or denied). Accordingly, we affirm'the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
