After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-15\">Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court has the authority to modify a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment if the defendant\u2019s sentence was \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o).\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l)-(2) (2009).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Wardlow based his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which lowered most, but not all, of the base offense levels applicable to crack cocaine offenses. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. app. C, amends. 706, 713.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-16\">The district court correctly concluded that Wardlow was ineligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction based on Amendment 706. At Wardlow\u2019s original sentencing in 1994, the district court found that Wardlow was responsible for over 15 kilograms of cocaine base. Based on the drug quantity table in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c), the district court assigned Wardlow a base offense level of 42. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l)(1993) (designating an offense level 42 for \u201c15 KG or more of Cocaine Base\u201d). With a criminal history category of I, the district court calculated Ward-low\u2019s guidelines range as 360 months\u2019 to life imprisonment and imposed a 360-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-17\">In 1996, Wardlow filed his first \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion based on Amendment 505, which lowered the base offense level under \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l) of the drug quantity table from 42 to 38. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. app. C, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>amend. 505 (changing \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l) to level 38 and lowering the amount of crack cocaine to \u201c1.5 KG or more of Cocaine Base\u201d). The district court granted Ward-low\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, finding his new offense level to be 38, making his guideline range 235 to 293 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court imposed a 240-month sentence. In the amended judgment, the district court noted that Wardlow had been held responsible for over 15 kilograms of crack cocaine at his original sentencing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">In 2008, Wardlow filed this second \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion based on Amendment 706. Although Amendment 706 reduced by two levels the offense levels for crack cocaine offenses involving less than 4.5 kilograms, Amendment 706 left unchanged the base offense level (level 38) for offenses involving 4.5 kilograms or more of crack cocaine. <em>Compare </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(1) (1996) <em>with </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(1), (2) (2009). Because Ward-low was held responsible for more than 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine (in fact, over 15 kilograms), Amendment 706 had no effect on his base offense level or his sentencing range. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1369 (11th Cir.2008) (explaining that defendants held responsible for more than 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine would not have a new guidelines range under Amendment 706 and, thus, would not be eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 1657, 173 L.Ed.2d 1025 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">We find meritless Wardlow\u2019s argument that, after his first \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, he was held responsible for only 1.5 kilograms of crack cocaine because he was resentenced under then-applicable \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l), which designated an offense level 38 for crack cocaine offenses involving \u201c1.5 KG <em>or more </em>of Cocaine Base.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l) (1996) (emphasis added). Wardlow\u2019s 1996 amended sentence was not based on 1.5 kilograms of crack cocaine, but on <em>more than </em>1.5 kilograms of crack cocaine, or more precisely 15 kilograms of crack cocaine. In any event, because a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction is not a <em>de novo </em>resentencing, the district court could not, and did not, revise the amount of crack cocaine attributed to Wardlow when it granted his first \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion and reduced his sentence. <em>See United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000) (noting that original sentencing determinations remain unchanged with sole exception of amended guideline provision); <em>United States v. Cothran, </em>106 F.3d 1560, 1563 (11th Cir.1997) (explaining that distinct court ruling on \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion was bound by drug quantity finding from original sentencing).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-13\">Wardlow\u2019s argument that his sentence is unconstitutional in light of <em>United States v. </em>Booker, 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), is foreclosed by binding precedent. <em>See United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 2382, 173 L.Ed.2d 1300 (2009). Because Wardlow was ineligible for resentencing under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), the district court had no authority to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the advisory guidelines or exercise its discretion to impose a new sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-16\">We also reject Wardlow\u2019s policy argument that the Sentencing Commission\u2019s decision to leave the base offense level at 38 for offenses involving more than 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine is inconsistent with the policies underlying Amendment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>706 because policy does not trump plain language. <em>See Asociacion De Empleados Del Area Canalera v. Panama Canal Comm\u2019n, </em>329 F.3d 1235, 1241 (11th Cir.2003). Finally, based on the current record and briefs, Wardlow has not shown that Amendment 706 is at odds with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 994(f) or 991(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b377-12\">.
