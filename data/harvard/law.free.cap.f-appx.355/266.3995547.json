First, she argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on her Title VII sex discrimination disparate treatment claim because she presented direct evidence of discrimination and established a <em>prima facie </em>case with circumstantial evidence of discrimination. Second, she argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on her Title VII sexual harassment claim because she suffered a tangible employment action\u2014withdrawal of work assignments'\u2014and the hostile work environment interfered with her job performance. Third, she contends that the district court erred in finding that she did not present direct evidence of retaliation for taldng protected FMLA leave or that she did not establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliatory discharge. Fourth, she argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on her state law claim of negligent retention of Waibel. Finally, she argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on her claims for punitive damages and attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">Upon review of the parties\u2019 briefs and the record, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for KB Home for all claims on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">\n<em>I. STANDARD OF REVIEW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">We review a grant of summary judgment <em>de novo </em>and view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Brooks v. County Comm\u2019n of Jefferson County, Ala., </em>446 F.3d 1160, 1161-62 (11th Cir.2006) (citing <em>Patrick v. Floyd Med. Ctr., </em>201 F.3d 1313, 1315 (11th Cir.2000)). Summary judgment should be granted if \u201cthe pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">\n<em>II. DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">\n<em>A. Title VII Sex Discrimination Disparate Treatment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b290-10\">An employer may not \u201cdischarge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to [her] compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\u2019s ... sex,\u201d and, following enactment of the PDA, this includes discrimination on the basis of \u201cpregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e-2(a)(l), 2000e(k); <em>Armindo v. Padlocker, Inc., </em>209 F.3d 1319, 1320 (11th Cir.2000) (per curiam). In other words, an employer is not permitted to take an \u201cadverse employment action\u201d against an employee on the basis of his or her sex or pregnancy, as to do so would constitute illegal discrimination. <em>See Davis v. Town of Lake Park, Fla., </em>245 F.3d 1232, 1235 (11th Cir.2001) (adverse employment action is required to obtain relief under Title VII\u2019s anti-discrimination clause). Thus, an \u201cadverse employment action\u201d is a crucial component in any discrimination claim under Title VII because without it, Title VII offers no remedy. <em>See id. </em>Whether an employment action is adverse is a matter of federal law, not state law. <em>Hinson v. Clinch County, Ga. Bd. Of Educ., </em>231 F.3d 821, 828-29 (11th Cir.2000). It is also a question of fact, although one still subject to the traditional rules governing summary judgment. <em>See id. </em>at 830 (noting that a reasonable factfinder could have concluded that the plaintiff suffered an adverse employment action, thus indicating that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>whether an employment action is adverse is a question of fact); Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">A plaintiff \u201cmust show a <em>serious and material </em>change in the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment\u201d to establish an adverse employment action. <em>Davis, </em>245 F.3d at 1239 (emphasis in original). The actions must also be viewed under the totality of circumstances. <em>See Akins v. Fulton County, Ga., </em>420 F.3d 1293, 1301 (11th Cir.2005) (citing <em>Shannon v. Bell-south Telecomms., Inc., </em>292 F.3d 712, 716 (11th Cir.2002)) (\u201cIn deciding whether employment actions are adverse, we consider the employer\u2019s acts both individually and collectively.\u201d); <em>Bass v. Bd. of County Comm\u2019rs, Orange County, Fla., </em>256 F.3d 1095, 1118 (11th Cir.2001) (\u201cWhile the other actions might not have individually risen to the level of adverse employment action under Title VII, when those actions are considered collectively, the total weight of them does constitute an adverse employment action.\u201d). It is important to note, however, that not all conduct by an employer that negatively affects an employee constitutes adverse employment action in a discrimination context. <em>Davis, </em>245 F.3d at 1238. Additionally, \u201cthe employee\u2019s subjective view of the significance and adversity of the employer\u2019s action is not controlling; the employment action must be materially adverse as viewed by a reasonable person in the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1239. Under the Supreme Court\u2019s precedent in <em>Burlington Northern &amp; Santa Fe Railway Company v. White, </em>a plaintiff must show that the employer\u2019s challenged action \u201cwould have been materially adverse to a reasonable employee,\u201d that it would have \u201clikely ... dissuad[ed] a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination,\u201d and that the plaintiff was harmed by this. 548 U.S. 53, 57, 126 S.Ct. 2405, 2409, 165 L.Ed.2d 345 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Under FMLA regulations, temporary reassignment to accommodate leave is permissible. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.204(a). A reduction in hours may be accompanied by a reduction in overall pay, however, so long as the hourly rate remains constant. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.204(c). An employer may also alter duties or responsibilities in connection with an employee\u2019s needs under the FMLA. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.204.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">With respect to Title VII, in <em>Davis, </em>we noted that temporary changes in work assignments that were essentially demotions but did <em>not </em>change the employee\u2019s pay status did not meet the definition of adverse employment action. 245 F.3d at 1240. While we declined to hold that a change in work assignments can never by itself give rise to a Title VII claim, we observed that in the majority of instances, \u201ca change in work assignments, without any tangible harm\u201d is outside the protection of Title VII\u2019s anti-discrimination clause, \u201cespecially where ... the work assignment at issue is only by definition temporary and does not affect the employee\u2019s permanent job title or classification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1245. A transfer to a different position can also be \u201cadverse\u201d if it involves a reduction in \u201cpay, prestige, or responsibility.\u201d <em>Hinson, </em>231 F.3d at 829 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">Hyde argues that the reduction of her pay rate, disallowance of vacation time during leave, and withdrawal of substantially all of her work assignments constituted a <em>serious and material </em>change in employment involving a loss of prestige and responsibility. KB Home responds that it provided Hyde with every benefit to which she was entitled under the FMLA and that Hyde\u2019s unsubstantiated claim that her pay was reduced at some point is specious. Additionally, KB Home argues that there is no record evidence showing that Hyde was denied vacation time, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>Hyde admits that she was given as much time off as needed under the FMLA. KB Home also responds that temporary reduction and reassignment of job duties in preparation for an employee\u2019s maternity leave does not rise to the level of a serious and material change of the terms of employment, and therefore, cannot constitute adverse employment action.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">Hyde additionally argues that the withdrawal of substantially all of her job responsibilities a month and a half before she took any intermittent leave were not actions taken by her employer to accommodate her FMLA leave requests. KB Home argues that it had to have a plan in place to continue its operations and ensure that work was getting done in a timely fashion when Hyde was out of the office taking intermittent and continuous FMLA leave. Thus, KB Home responds that it simply took reasonable steps to ensure that this would occur. It additionally argues that a temporary reassignment of job duties is proper under the FMLA, and such temporary reassignment cannot, at the same time, somehow be deemed to constitute an adverse employment action for Title VII purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Hyde failed to present evidence of an adverse employment action, and therefore, she has not presented a cognizable claim for Title VII sex discrimination disparate treatment. First, Hyde relies on <em>Hinson </em>for the proposition that an action may be considered an adverse employment action under Title VII \u201cif it involves a reduction in pay, prestige, <em>or </em>responsibility.\u201d 231 F.3d at 829 (emphasis added). In <em>Hinson, </em>a female plaintiffs transfer from high school principal to an administrative position, and eventually a full-time teacher constituted adverse employment action because the administrative position entailed a significant loss of pay, and there was an issue of fact that the new position was less prestigious. <em>Id. </em>Hyde\u2019s case is distinguishable because Hyde\u2019s job title did not change, she did not receive a reduction in pay for taking FMLA leave, and although her responsibilities were reduced and reassigned, it was the result of KB Home preparing for Hyde\u2019s intermittent and continuous medical leave. Additionally, \u201c[a]ny adversity must be material; it is not enough that a transfer imposes some <em>de minimis </em>inconvenience or alteration of responsibilities.\u201d <em>Doe v. Dekalb County Sch. Dist., </em>145 F.3d 1441, 1453 (11th Cir.1998) (emphasis in original). Here, Hyde was not transferred or demoted, but her job title and salary remained the same, and her reduction in responsibilities alone, therefore, did not amount to an adverse employment action. KB Home\u2019s reassignment of Hyde\u2019s job responsibilities to Tammy Catchings and Cheryl Nelson were also proper in order to prepare for Hyde\u2019s intermittent and continuous FMLA leave. There is evidence that some of Hyde\u2019s duties were daily ones, and some days were more intensive than others. This support\u2019s KB Home\u2019s reasoning that it withdrew Hyde\u2019s duties because it needed to adequately prepare those who would be replacing Hyde while she was out on leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">Therefore, we affirm the decision of the district court granting summary judgment in favor of KB Home on Hyde\u2019s Title VII sex discrimination disparate treatment claim because Hyde did not suffer an adverse employment action.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">\n<em>B. Title VII Sexual Harassment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">Under Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(l), sex-based harassment of an employee is forbidden. <em>See Mendoza v. Borden, Inc., </em>195 F.3d 1238, 1244-45 (11th Cir.1999) <em>(en </em>banc) (stating that although Title VII does not mention harassment, the Supreme Court includes harassment as actionable under Title VII). To prove sex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>ual harassment, a plaintiff may rely on either a \u201ctangible employment action\u201d theory or a \u201chostile work environment\u201d theory.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Hulsey v. Pride Restaurants, LLC, </em>367 F.3d 1238, 1245 (11th Cir.2004). \u201c[A] tangible employment action is a significant hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a decision causing a significant change in benefits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>Burlington Indus., Inc. v. Ellerth, </em>524 U.S. 742, 761, 118 S.Ct. 2257, 2268, 141 L.Ed.2d 633 (1998)). The test for an adverse employment action in a disparate treatment context is similar to the one for a \u201ctangible employment action\u201d in a harassment analysis. <em>Webb-Edwards v. Orange County Sheriffs Office, </em>525 F.3d 1013, 1031 (11th Cir.2008) (equating \u201ctangible employment action\u201d with \u201cadverse employment action\u201d). Additionally, in order to establish employer liability, a plaintiff must also establish a \u201ccausal link between the tangible employment action and the sexual harassment.\u201d <em>Cotton v. Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc., </em>434 F.3d 1227, 1231 (11th Cir.2006). Because Hyde failed to establish an \u201cadverse employment action\u201d under her Title VII disparate treatment discrimination claim, she likewise has not established a \u201ctangible employment action\u201d for her Title VII harassment claim. Therefore, Hyde\u2019s harassment claim under the \u201ctangible employment action\u201d theory cannot survive KB Home\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">A Title VII harassment claim under the \u201chostile work environment\u201d theory is established upon proof that \u201cthe workplace is permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult, that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim\u2019s employment and create an abusive working environment.\u201d <em>Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., </em>510 U.S. 17, 21, 114 S.Ct. 367, 370, 126 L.Ed.2d 295 (1993) (internal quotations and citations omitted) (holding that Title VII is not implicated in the case where there is a mere utterance of an epithet); <em>Miller v. Kenworth of Dothan, Inc., </em>277 F.3d 1269, 1275 (11th Cir.2002). To prove sexual harassment under a hostile work environment theory, a plaintiff must show that: (1) she is a member of a protected group; (2) she was subjected to unwelcome sexual harassment; (3) the harassment was based on her sex; (4) \u201cthe harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the terms and conditions of employment and create a discriminatorily abusive working environment;\u201d and (5) there is a basis for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>employer liability. <em>Mendoza, </em>195 F.3d at 1245.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">As the fourth element, severe and pervasive, contains both an objective and a subjective element, this behavior must result in both an environment \u201cthat a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive,\u201d and an environment that the victim \u201csubjectively perceive[s] ... to be abusive.\u201d <em>Harris, </em>510 U.S. at 21, 114 S.Ct. at 370; <em>Miller, </em>277 F.3d at 1276. In evaluating the objective severity of the harassment, this Court looks at the totality of the circumstances and considers, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201c(1) the frequency of the conduct, (2) the severity of the conduct, (3) whether the conduct is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance, and (4) whether the conduct unreasonably interferes with the employee\u2019s job performance.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>277 F.3d at 1276 (citing <em>Allen v. Tyson Foods, </em>121 F.3d 642, 647 (11th Cir.1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">The conduct and comments that Hyde provides for her harassment claim based on a \u201chostile work environment\u201d theory do not rise to the level of conduct that is \u201csevere or pervasive to alter the conditions of [her] employment.\u201d <em>Harris, </em>510 U.S. at 21, 114 S.Ct. at 370. Although several stray comments by Waibel were directed towards Hyde, arguably indicating that her reduction in responsibilities was due to her pregnancy, these comments to not rise to the level of being \u201csevere or pervasive,\u201d and they did not occur until after Hyde returned to work after taking FMLA leave. Hyde additionally argues that Waibel\u2019s conduct in the office before she went on FMLA leave, specifically ignoring Hyde or slamming papers on Hyde\u2019s desk, constituted severe or pervasive conduct that altered her working conditions. However, Hyde does not provide any evidence that such conduct occurred as a result of her pregnancy or taking FMLA leave, and such conduct was not severe or pervasive to create a hostile work environment. Finally, Hyde does not offer any evidence that would indicate that Waibel\u2019s comments or conduct unreasonably interfered with her job performance. Therefore, Hyde\u2019s Title VII harassment claim based on a \u201chostile work environment\u201d theory cannot survive KB Home\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">Based on the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for KB Home on Hyde\u2019s Title VII sexual harassment claim because there is no genuine issue of material fact as to Hyde\u2019s claim based on either a \u201ctangible employment action\u201d theory or a \u201chostile work environment\u201d theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">\n<em>C. FMLA Retaliation and Title VII and FMLA Retaliatory Discharge</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">Pursuant to the FMLA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2615(a)(2), it is unlawful \u201cfor any employer to discharge or in any other manner discriminate against any individual for opposing any practice made unlawful by this subchapter.\u201d Similarly, Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a), makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against an employee because he or she \u201chas opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by this subchapter.... \u201d This includes internal complaints of discrimination. <em>See Rollins v. Fla. Dep\u2019t of Law Enforcement, </em>868 F.2d 397, 400 (11th Cir.1989). Such discrimination may be proven through direct or circumstantial evidence. <em>See Berman v. Orkin Exterminating Co. Inc., </em>160 F.3d 697, 701 (11th Cir.1998). Statements made by a non-decision maker are not probative of discriminatory intent as direct evidence. <em>Standard v. A.B.E.L. Servs. Inc., </em>161 F.3d 1318, 1330 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-10\">To establish a <em>prima face </em>case of retaliation using circumstantial evidence, a plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>tiff may show that \u201c(1) [she] engaged in a statutorily protected activity; (2) the employer took an adverse employment action against him; and (3) there is a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse action.\u201d <em>Berman, </em>160 F.3d at 701; see <em>also Martin v. Brevard County Pub. Schs., </em>543 F.3d 1261, 1268 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam) (citing <em>Brungart v. BellSouth Telecomms., Inc., </em>231 F.3d 791, 798 (11th Cir.2000)) (setting out elements for <em>prima facie </em>case of FMLA retaliation). If the plaintiff makes out a <em>prima facie </em>case, the burden shifts to the employer to offer a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for its actions. <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 1824, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). If one is offered, the presumption of discrimination is rebutted, and the plaintiff must offer evidence that the reason is pretext for illegal discrimination. <em>Wilson v. B/E Aerospace, Inc., </em>376 F.3d 1079, 1087 (11th Cir.2004) (citing <em>Tex. Dep\u2019t of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 255-56, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 1094-95, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981)).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Under a \u201ccat\u2019s paw\u201d or mixed-motive theory of liability, \u201ca non-decisionmaking employee\u2019s discriminatory animus may be imputed to a neutral decisionmaker when the decisionmaker has not independently investigated allegations of misconduct.\u201d <em>Crawford v. Carroll, </em>529 F.3d 961, 979 n. 21 (11th Cir.2008). \u201cWhere a decision maker conducts his own evaluation and makes an independent decision, his decision is free of the taint of a biased subordinate employee.\u201d <em>Pennington v. City of Huntsville, </em>261 F.3d 1262, 1270 (11th Cir.2001). In a mixed-motive case, the plaintiff must prove that her gender played a motivating part in an employment decision, and the defendant must show that it would have made the same decision regardless of the plaintiffs status in order to avoid liability. <em>Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, </em>490 U.S. 228, 258, 109 S.Ct. 1775, 1795, 104 L.Ed.2d 268 (1989) (plurality opinion). Where a defendant does so, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to demonstrate that termination was motivate*; by the improper consideration. <em>Crawford v. City of Fairburn, Ga., </em>482 F.3d 1305, 1309 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">Hyde argues that both withdrawal of her work assignments and her termination were the result of retaliation. She argues that she presented direct evidence of the pre-termination retaliation through statements by Waibel stating that he took her work away \u201cbecause she got F-ing pregnant\u201d and \u201cwas tired of her milking the system.\u201d She contends that her termination was the result of retaliation and can be established via circumstantial evidence. As to Hyde\u2019s pre-termination FMLA retaliation claim, although there is direct evidence that Waibel withdrew Hyde\u2019s work and reassigned her duties because Hyde chose to take FMLA leave, the reduction and reassignment of duties did not constitute adverse employment actions, but were a means of accommodating Hyde\u2019s FMLA leave. Therefore, Hyde\u2019s FMLA pre-termination retaliation claim cannot survive KB Home\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">Additionally, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment on Hyde\u2019s Title VII and FMLA retaliatory discharge claims. There is no evidence that Waibel was a decision maker in terminating Hyde. Therefore, even if Waibel wished to terminate Hyde for using FMLA leave, his lack of involvement in Hyde\u2019s termination means that such evidence cannot establish a retaliatory discharge claim. Further, Hyde cannot establish a \u201ccat\u2019s paw\u201d theory of retaliatory discharge because she has not presented evidence that any of the actual decision makers had any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>substantial input from Waibel in making their decision. Finally, she did not show that this was a mixed motive ease because the only evidence of a discriminatory motive rests with Waibel, and he did not participate in the decision to terminate her through the reduction in force (\u201cRIF\u201d). There is no evidence that her gender or status as a pregnant woman played any role in her dismissal through RIF. Accordingly, the decision of the district court granting summary judgment to KB Home and Waibel regarding her FMLA retaliation claim for withdrawal of work assignments is affirmed, and the grant of summary judgment on her claims for Title VII and FMLA retaliatory discharge are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">\n<em>D. Georgia State Law Claim for Negligent Retention</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">\u201cIn a cause of action for negligent retention, an employer may be held liable only where there is sufficient evidence to establish that the employer reasonably knew or should have known of an employee\u2019s \u2018tendencies\u2019 to engage in certain behavior relevant to the injuries allegedly incurred by the plaintiff.\u201d <em>MARTA v. Mosley, </em>280 Ga. App. 486, 634 S.E.2d 466, 469 (2006) (citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">The district court correctly concluded that Hyde presented no evidence that KB Home knew or should have known of any tendency of Waibel to discriminate against pregnant women. Her first complaint about Waibel to KB Home did not occur until after she returned from leave in August, at which point she met with HR to discuss the problem and was promptly reassigned to work under another supervisor in a different department. Complaints by another employee about earlier animosity towards Hyde were similarly dealt with when Hyde returned from leave. Additionally, because KB Home was not on notice about a hostile work environment before Hyde went on leave, they cannot be held liable for negligent retention. Further, Waibel was terminated shortly after Hyde complained, albeit for unrelated reasons. Accordingly, the decision of the district court granting summary judgment to KB Home on Hyde\u2019s negligent retention claim is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">\n<em>E.

See EEOC v.W &amp; O, Inc., </em>213 F.3d 600, 610 (11th Cir.2000) (citation omitted). A plaintiff may recover punitive damages under Title VH if the defendant \u201cengaged in a discriminatory practice ... with malice or with reckless indifference to the federally protected rights of an aggrieved individual.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981a(b)(l). Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(k), a court in its discretion may allow the prevailing party reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-11\">Because the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to KB Home is affirmed as to Hyde\u2019s Title VII claims, Hyde cannot recover punitive damages under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981a(b)(l). Accordingly, the grant of summary judgment regarding punitive damages is affirmed. Because the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on all claims is affirmed, and Hyde is not a prevailing party; the decision to grant summary judgment regarding attorneys\u2019 fees is also affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-13\">\n<em>III. CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b296-14\">Upon review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to KB Home and Waibel on Hyde\u2019s Title VII discrimination, harassment, and retaliation claims; FMLA retaliation claim; Georgia state law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>negligent retention claim; and punitive damages and attorneys\u2019 fees claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b293-5\">. Hyde appears to have raised both \"tangible employment action\u201d and \"hostile work environment\u201d theories of sexual harassment in Count I of her complaint. Doc. 1 at 19-21 (\"Count I: Violation of Title VII Gender-Based Discrimination with .Tangible Employment Action\u201d and alleging that the \"gender-based discrimination by Defendant Waibel and the failure of KB Home to take adequate remedial measures to remedy discrimination ... unreasonably interfered with Plaintiff\u2019s \u25a0work performance and created and intimidating, hostile and offensive working environment\"). The Magistrate Judge\u2019s report and recommendation, however, only addressed Hyde\u2019s harassment claim under the tangible employment action theory and denied summary judgment on Hyde's harassment claim because there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether a reduction in responsibilities constituted a \"tangible employment action.\u201d Doc. 99 at 43-46. Although the district court granted summary judgment on the harassment claim without explanation, it appears that when the district court found that Hyde\u2019s Title VII disparate treatment discrimination claim could not survive, it concurrently found that Hyde\u2019s Title VII harassment claim also could not survive. Doc. 110 at 4. Because it is unclear which theory of harassment Hyde makes her claim under, we address both theories upon review of the district court's grant of summary judgment for KB Home.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
