We remanded Bruce\u2019s second appeal to the Board for review following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>549 U.S. 47, 127 S.Ct. 625, 166 L.Ed.2d 462 (2006) for the proper application of Bruce\u2019s drug conviction and qualification as an aggravated felony under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). The Board reaffirmed its earlier decision that the convictions constitute a drug trafficking aggravated felony because the marijuana convictions could have been punishable under the recidivist provision of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(a) (2006). Thus, Bruce was subject to removal because of his convictions and rendered ineligible for cancellation of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-18\">This Court has statutory jurisdiction to review final orders of removal. INA \u00a7 242, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. However, this jurisdiction is restricted by INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(C), which states that courts do not have jurisdiction \u201cto review any final order of removal against an alien\u201d who is removed for crimes relating to a controlled substance under Section 237(a)(2)(B)(i). 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C). Additionally, we are generally forbidden from reviewing removal orders for cases in which the alien has been convicted of an aggravated felony. <em>Carachuri-Rosendo v. Holder, </em>570 F.3d 263, 265 (5th Cir.2009) (citations omitted). Notwithstanding, we retain jurisdiction to review facts and issues involving a question of law. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). Because Bruce\u2019s petition falls within this exception, we review the Board\u2019s rulings of law de novo. <em>See Carachuri-Rosendo, </em>570 F.3d at 265.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-19\">Bruce specifically challenges the determination that his convictions for possession of a controlled substance constitute \u201caggravated felonies\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B). Bruce contends that because he was never convicted under a recidivist statute, that his offenses should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>not be considered aggravated felonies. For the reasons set forth below, we dismiss his petition in part for lack of jurisdiction and deny in part because the Board correctly decided that Bruce\u2019s convictions constitute an aggravated felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">Earlier this year, we noted that federal statutes referring to drug trafficking also includes recidivist state possession offenses. <em>See Carachuri-Rosendo, </em>570 F.3d at 265 (quoting <em>United States v. Cepeda-Rios, </em>530 F.3d 333, 335 (5th Cir.2008)). The Supreme Court in <em>Lopez </em>decided that if the conduct proscribed by the state offense could have been prosecuted under the CSA as a felony, then the state conviction qualifies as an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B). <em>Lopez, </em>549 U.S. at 60, 127 S.Ct. 625. In <em>United States v. Sanchez-Villalobos, </em>412 F.3d 572, 576 (5th Cir.2005), this Court concluded that two state convictions for possession could be punished as a felony under the CSA\u2019s recidivism provisions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Later, this Court in <em>Cepeda-Rios </em>stated its approach to this issue from <em>Sanchez-Villalobos </em>was still viable after <em>Lopez </em>and again decided that a second state possession offense punishable as a felony under federal law qualified as an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B). 530 F.3d at 334-35. The <em>Carachuri-Rosendo </em>court affirmed the Board\u2019s en-banc decision determining that even though the petitioner had been convicted twice of misdemeanor possession charges but was not charged as a recidivist, the convictions met the definition of an aggravated felony under the CSA. 570 F.3d at 265.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">Here, the facts are similar to those in <em>Carachuri-Rosendo </em>because Bruce asserts that his state possession convictions cannot meet the definition of an aggravated felony under the CSA since he was not charged as a recidivist. This argument is inapposite to what the <em>Carachuri-Rosendo </em>court explicitly stated. 570 F.3d at 265. Bruce\u2019s convictions for possession of a controlled substance constitute an aggravated felony under INA \u00a7 101(a)(43)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B) because his third offense would have been punishable under the recidivist provision of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(a) as a felony, and by extension, a drug trafficking aggravated felony. Thus, Bruce is removable under INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(B)(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-10\">Bruce also argues that the Board abused its discretion for failing to address his motion to remand and motion to change venue and that these failures resulted in \u201csubstantial constitutional challenges.\u201d Bruce\u2019s assertions do not involve a constitutional claim; instead they merely ask this Court to replace the Board\u2019s rulings with a new outcome. <em>See Hadwani v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 798, 800-01 (5th Cir.2006) (stating that mere propositions constituting abuse of discretion arguments cannot be cloaked in constitutional garb and pass as a constitutional claim); <em>see also Torres-Aguilar v. INS, </em>246 F.3d 1267, 1271 (9th Cir.2001) (preventing the petitioner from establishing jurisdiction by cloaking arguments in constitutional garb). Because Bruce merely disagrees with the Board\u2019s decision and does not raise a constitutional claim or question of law on these challenges, we lack jurisdiction to review.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-11\">Accordingly, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b869-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
