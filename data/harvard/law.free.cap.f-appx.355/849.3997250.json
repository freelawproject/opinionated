Specifically, he contends that the district court\u2019s decision to sentence him within the guidelines range resulted in an excessive sentence given the age of his prior convictions. He also asserts: his more serious convictions were attributable to his cocaine use; and, after he stopped using cocaine, his offenses were less serious. Further, Ortiz suggests the advisory Sentencing Guidelines fail to account for his benign motive for committing the instant offense: to care for his ill parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-23\">In district court, although Ortiz raised several objections at sentencing, he did not challenge the sentence as unreasonable. Arguably, our review should be only for plain error. We need not address that question because his challenges fail under our normal standard of review for issues raised at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-24\">Although post-Booker, the Guidelines are advisory only, and an ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court must still properly calculate the guideline-sentencing range for use in deciding on the sentence to impose. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In that respect, its application of the guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo; </em>its factual findings, only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Gisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-25\">The district court made an individualized sentencing decision, based on the facts of the case in the light of the factors set out in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 49-50, 128 S.Ct. 586. The court\u2019s conclusion that a within-guidelines sentence was appropriate is entitled to deference, and we presume that it is reasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586; <em>United States v. Newson, </em>515 F.3d 374, 379 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 2522, 171 L.Ed.2d 802 (2008). It goes without saying that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>court was in a superior position to find facts and assess their import under \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. We see no reason to disturb the district court\u2019s discretionary decision to impose a sentence within the guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">Ortiz also challenges the application of the appellate presumption of reasonableness, claiming it should not apply because \u00a7 2L1.2 is not empirically based. As he concedes, this assertion is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 192, 175 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b871-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
