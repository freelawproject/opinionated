On appeal, they argue that: (1) substantial evidence did not support the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination, and, moreover, that the determination violated then* right to due process; and (2) on the merits, the IJ\u2019s denial of asylum was erroneous. After thorough review, we dismiss the petition in part, and deny it in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">We review jurisdictional questions <em>de novo. Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006). When evaluating a petition for review of an order by the BIA denying an application for asylum and withholding of removal, we review findings of fact under the highly deferential substantial evidence test, and must affirm the decision if it is \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation omitted). Moreover, we review the record evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision, and may not overturn findings of fact unless the record compels it. <em>Id. </em>at 1286-87. Because credibility determinations constitute factual findings, we review such determinations under the substantial evidence test, and will not substitute our judgment for that of the IJ or BIA. <em>Id. </em>at 1286.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-12\">When the BIA issues a separate decision, we review only that decision, \u201cexcept to the extent that [the BIA] expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cInsofar as the [BIA] adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we will review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We, however, will not review the IJ\u2019s decision as to an issue not addressed by the BIA. Instead, if necessary, we must remand the case to give the BIA \u201cthe opportunity to address the matter in the first instance in light of its own expertise.\u201d <em>INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16-17, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-13\">As an initial matter, we lack jurisdiction over the petitioners\u2019 due process claim and over their claim that the IJ erred when he found that Rodriguez was not a victim of past persecution on account of political opinion. We may not review a final order of removal unless \u201cthe alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1). If a petitioner fails to exhaust available administrative remedies, we lack jurisdiction to consider the claim. <em>Amaya-Artunduaga, </em>463 F.3d at 1250. In <em>Amaya-Artunduaga, </em>we held that an alien did not exhaust administrative remedies when he failed to raise his due process claim before the BIA. <em>Id. </em>at 1251.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>In this case, we do not have jurisdiction to review the petitioners\u2019 due process claim because they failed to exhaust administrative remedies by not raising that claim in their notice of appeal or brief to the BIA. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Amaya-Artunduaga, </em>463 F.3d at 1250-51. We also cannot review their claim that the IJ erred by denying them asylum on the merits, because the BIA did not reach that issue, but simply affirmed the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination and reasoned from there. <em>See Ventura, </em>537 U.S. at 16-17, 123 S.Ct. 353. We therefore dismiss the petition as to these two claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">We also reject the petitioners\u2019 argument that substantial evidence did not support the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. An alien who arrives in or is present in the United States may apply for asylum. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). The Attorney General has discretion to grant asylum if the alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(A). A \u201crefugee\u201d is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-5\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality or, in the case of a person having no nationality, is outside any country in which such person last habitually resided, and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). The asylum applicant carries the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284. To establish asylum eligibility, the alien must, with specific and credible evidence, establish (1) past persecution on account of political opinion or any other protected ground, or (2) a well-founded fear that political opinion or any other protected ground will cause future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a) and (b). To qualify for withholding of removal, an applicant must establish that it is more likely than not that the applicant\u2019s \u201clife or freedom would be threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003) (citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A)). When a petitioner fails to establish a claim of asylum on the merits, that petitioner \u201cnecessarily fails to establish eligibility for withholding of removal.\u201d <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1288 n. 4. This is because the standard for withholding of removal is significantly higher than the asylum standard. <em>See Amaya-Artunduaga, </em>463 F.3d at 1249 n. 3. If an IJ makes a finding that a petitioner is not entitled to asylum, that IJ is \u201cnot obligated to make specific findings with respect to withholding of removal.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">An applicant\u2019s testimony, if credible, may carry that applicant\u2019s burden of proof without corroboration. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a). \u201cConversely, an adverse credibility determination alone may be sufficient to support the denial of an asylum application.\u201d <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287. Nevertheless, if an applicant who is not a credible witness produces other evidence of persecution aside from his testimony, the IJ and BIA must consider that evidence. <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe weaker an applicant\u2019s testimony, however, the greater the need for corroborative evidence.\u201d <em>Yang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">In order to enable our review of credibility findings, the IJ must make a clean, explicit determination of credibility. <em>Id. </em>\u201cOnce an adverse credibility finding is made, the burden is on the applicant alien to show that the IJ\u2019s [and BIA\u2019s] credibility decision was not supported by specific, cogent reasons or was not based on substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>1287 (quotation omitted). \u201cIndications of reliable testimony include consistency on direct examination, consistency with the written application, and the absence of embellishments.\u201d <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1255 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">The Real ID Act of 2005 (\u201cRIDA\u201d), which amended the INA\u2019s asylum provisions, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-6\">Considering the totality of the circumstances, and all relevant factors, a trier of fact may base a credibility determination on the demeanor, candor, or responsiveness of the applicant or witness, the inherent plausibility of the applicant\u2019s or witness\u2019s account, the consistency between the applicant\u2019s or witness\u2019s written and oral statements (whenever made and whether or not under oath, and considering the circumstances under which the statements were made), the internal inconsistency of each such statement, the consistency of such statements with other evidence of record (including the reports of the Department of State on country conditions), and any inaccuracies or falsehoods in such statements, without regard to whether an inconsistency, inaccuracy, or falsehood goes to the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim, or any other relevant factor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">Pub.L. No. 109-13, \u00a7 101(a)(3), (d)(2), 119 Stat. 231, 303, 304-05 (codified at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii), 1229a(c)(4)(C)). This provision of RIDA applies to asylum applications filed after May 11, 2005. Pub.L. No. 109-13, \u00a7 101(h)(2), 119 Stat. at 305.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">In this case, the IJ made a clean adverse credibility determination against Rodriguez. The IJ explicitly found Rodriguez\u2019s testimony inconsistent and not credible. <em>See Yang, </em>418 F.3d at 1201. Moreover, substantial evidence supported that determination. The IJ noted, and Rodriguez now admits, that Rodriguez\u2019s wife\u2019s testimony contradicted Rodriguez\u2019s testimony regarding at what time and to whose house in Bogot\u00e1 Rodriguez returned after the roadblock shooting incident. While the discrepancy regarding the time is relatively minor, the discrepancy regarding at whose house Rodriguez and his wife were staying at the time is stark. Under RIDA, which applies to this case, the IJ was free to base his credibility determination on this inconsistency of Rodriguez\u2019s testimony \u201cwith other evidence of record,\u201d such as his wife\u2019s testimony. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">In addition, the BIA also considered Rodriguez\u2019s nontestimonial evidence. <em>See Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287. The BIA expressly explained how Rodriguez\u2019s submitted documents, including photographs of the car, a newspaper article, and Sermiento\u2019s death certificate, failed to corroborate his testimony. And since Rodriguez\u2019s testimony contradicted his wife\u2019s testimony on two grounds, the need for corroborative evidence was all the greater. <em>See Yang, </em>418 F.3d at 1201.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-11\">Finally, because the IJ did make a clean credibility finding, it is Rodriguez\u2019s burden to show that the finding was not supported by specific, cogent reasons, or was not based on substantial evidence. <em>See Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287. Rodriguez, however, cannot bear that burden here because all of his arguments are without merit. First, because RIDA applies to the case, the IJ was free to base his credibility finding on inconsistencies that did not go the heart of Rodriguez\u2019s claim. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii). Second, while Rodriguez in his brief argues that \u201crelevant and persuasive evidence\u201d explained the alleged discrepancies, he does not, and cannot, point to any such evidence. Third, the discrepancies were not due to his wife\u2019s lack of personal knowledge of the details of the incidents. The discrepancies concerned facts squarely within her personal knowledge, namely, where she was staying on December 20, 2005, and at what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>time Rodriguez returned there that night. Moreover, her testimony does not indicate that it was based on anything other than her personal knowledge of those facts. Fourth, even if Rodriguez\u2019s own testimony closely mirrored his application addendum statement, that consistency did not negate the inconsistencies between his and his wife\u2019s testimony. And lastly, given that Rodriguez bore the burden of establishing that he was entitled to relief, it was not the IJ\u2019s duty to bring the discrepancies to the attention of the witnesses. <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284. These were not mere ambiguities that reasonably called for clarification on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">Because Rodriguez cannot establish that the adverse credibility finding was not based on substantial evidence, and given that such a finding is sufficient to support the denial of asylum, and, necessarily, withholding of removal, we deny the petition regarding this claim. <em>See Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287,1288 n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
