California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Murray has filed a response. We note that after Murray filed his notice of appeal, the district court sua sponte amended its judgment pursuant to Fed.R.CrimP. 35(b), reducing Murray\u2019s sentence from 262 months of imprisonment to 174. The district court, however, lacked jurisdiction to grant Rule 35(b) relief once Murray\u2019s notice of appeal had been filed. <em>See United States v. Hayes, </em>589 F.2d 811, 827 n. 8 (5th Cir.1979). The district court\u2019s AMENDED JUDGMENT is thus VOIDED, and the original judgment remains in effect for purposes of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-24\">The record is insufficiently developed to allow consideration at this time of Murray\u2019s claim(s) of ineffective assistance of counsel; such claim(s) generally \u201ccannot be resolved on direct appeal when [they have] not been raised before the district court since no opportunity existed to develop the record on the merits of the allegations.\u201d <em>United States v. Cantwell, </em>470 F.3d 1087, 1091 (5th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Our independent review of the record, counsel\u2019s brief, and Murray\u2019s response discloses no nonfrivolous issue for appeal. Accordingly, the motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b885-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
