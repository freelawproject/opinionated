The BIA found that Botero did not meet his burden for asylum because he did not suffer past persecution or establish a well-founded fear of future persecution in Colombia.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">On petition for review, Botero does not raise the issues of the BIA\u2019s denial of withholding of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), INA \u00a7 241(b)(3), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3), or relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (\u201cCAT\u201d), 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c). Accordingly, Botero has abandoned those issues on appeal, and we will not review those issues. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that when an appellant fails to offer argument on an issue, that issue is abandoned).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-10\">When the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Here, the BIA did not expressly adopt the IJ\u2019s decision. Therefore, we only review the BIA\u2019s \u25a0 decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-11\">The BIA\u2019s factual determination that a removable alien is not entitled to asylum \u201cmust be upheld if it is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Mazariegos v. U.S. Att\u2019y. Gen., </em>241 F.3d 1320, 1323 (11th Cir.2001). Substantial evidence is a \u201chighly deferential test,\u201d and we affirm if the decision is \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y. Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation omitted). We do not \u201creweigh the evidence from scratch.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We review \u201cthe record evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). A \u201cdenial of asylum may be reversed <em>only </em>if the evidence presented by the applicant is so powerful that a reasonable factfinder would <em>have </em>to conclude that the requisite fear of persecution exists.\u201d <em>Mazariegos, </em>241 F.3d at 1323-24. The fact that evidence in the record may also support a conclusion contrary to the administrative findings is not enough to justify a reversal. <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en </em>banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-13\">An alien who arrives in or is present in the United States may apply for asylum. INA \u00a7 208(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). The Attorney General or Secretary of DHS has discretion to grant asylum if the alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d INA \u00a7 208(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AE8\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality ... and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-15\">INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). The asylum applicant carries the burden of proving statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>\u201crefugee\u201d status. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284. To establish asylum eligibility, the alien must, with specific and credible evidence, establish (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that the statutorily listed factor will cause such future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b); <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">To establish asylum based on past persecution, the applicant must prove (1) that he was persecuted, and (2) that the persecution was on account of a protected ground. <em>Silva v. U.S. Att\u2019y. Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229, 1236 (11th Cir.2006). In terms of past persecution, \u201cpersecution\u201d is an extreme concept that requires \u201cmore than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation, and ... mere harassment does not amount to persecution.\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation and alteration omitted); <em>see Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 762, 766 (11th Cir.2007) (holding that the BIA must review the cumulative effect of an applicant\u2019s events to determine whether the events cumulatively amount to past persecution). To establish past persecution on account of a political opinion, the applicant must show that the persecution was on account of the applicant\u2019s political opinion, not the persecutor\u2019s. <em>Sanchez v. U.S. Att\u2019y. Gen., </em>392 F.3d 434, 437-38 (11th Cir.2004) (citing <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 482, 112 S.Ct. 812, 816, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992)). An asylum applicant may prevail on a theory of \u201cimputed political opinion\u201d if he shows that the persecutor falsely attributed an opinion to him, and then persecuted him because of that mistaken belief about his views. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">If an applicant establishes past persecution, he is presumed to have established a well-founded fear of persecution on the basis of the same claim. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1). If the applicant\u2019s fear of future persecution is unrelated to past persecution, he bears the burden of establishing that the fear is well-founded. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">In this case, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s finding that Botero-Bermudez did not have a well-founded fear of persecution. His claim is based on his past persecution but Botero-Bermudez fails to make the requisite showing of a well-founded fear of persecution. His detention and isolated harassing phone calls and letters do not rise to the level of persecution as defined in our precedent. Accordingly, we deny Botero-Bermudez\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
