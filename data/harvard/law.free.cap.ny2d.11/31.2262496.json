The United States has consented to be bound by New York practice in this foreclosure action. II. The <em>Neiv Britain </em>doctrine does not apply to New York mortgage foreclosure procedure. III. The foreclosure judgment of October 20, 1960, directing the payment of real estate taxes as an expense of sale, reversed by the Appellate Division by its order of May 9, 1961, was a proper judgment because the tax lien of defendant, United States of .America, could only attach to the surplus moneys left .from the proceeds of the foreclosure sale after the payment therefrom, as an expense of the sale, of local taxes and assessments. <em>(Emigrant Ind.

Victory, dated and recorded April 5, 1946. At the time of verification of the complaint there was a balance due on the bond of $1,473.75, with interest at the rate of 5%' per annum from January 10, 1958. The United States was <em>made a party because of a tax lien it filed in the Erie County Clerk\u2019s office January 15, 1953 against the mortgagor, since deceased. </em>Its answer stated a balance due on the lien of $689.07, plus interest. Plaintiff did not advance any sums for payment of local real property taxes and assessments, which became liens upon the land on and after July 1,1957.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">The mortgagee moved for summary judgment providing that the premises be sold free of the United States tax lien, but <em>subject </em>to all real property taxes and assessments. This motion was granted by the Brie County Court. On appeal by the respondent, the Appellate Division reversed and remitted the case to the County Court, stating that the discretionary authority to have the property sold <em>subject </em>to all local real estate taxes \u201c may not properly be exercised in a case such as this in which there is a problem of circular priorities\u201d (11AD 2d 160). Thereafter the County Court once more granted summary judgment in favor of the mortgagee providing that the premises be sold and directing that the Referee \u201c shall, as a part of the expenses of the sale, pay out of the proceeds of said sale all real estate taxes, assessments and water rates which are liens upon the property sold, and redeem the property sold from any sales for unpaid real estate taxes, assessments or water rates which have not apparently become absolute \u2019 \u2019. The judgment further foreclosed all rights, liens, and equities of redemption in the premises, except as to the one-year period of redemption granted to the United States by section 2410 of title 28 of the United States Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">On appeal by the United States, the Appellate Division modified the judgment by providing that \u201c the rule of priorities laid down in <em>United States </em>v. <em>New Britain </em>(347 U. S. 81) applies \u201d (13 A D 2d 208), and that the local tax liens were not to be paid as expenses of the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>The appellant mortgagee contends that the foreclosure procedure of New York is determined by our State law and that a direction to pay local taxes and assessments as expenses of the sale was a proper direction within section 1087 of the New York Civil Practice Act. The United States contends that this court is barred from reaching a determination reversing' the Appellate Division and affirming the judgment of Erie County Court. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>New </em>Britain, 347 U. S. 81.)</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">Although the United States Supreme Court in recent years has passed on the question of priority of liens and the resulting effect upon mortgagees, their decisions provide no clear command governing us here.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">The case of <em>United States </em>v. <em>New Britain (supra) </em>is distinguishable from the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">There the Supreme Court assumed, in the posture of the case as it reached that court, that the contest was between the local government and the Federal Government over their respective rights in surplus funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">In the usual case, as here, however, the state of facts shows that the dispute is really between the mortgagee and creditors of the mortgagor. The debts of the mortgagor obviously can only be satisfied out of such equity in the real property as the mortgagor may have. When the property is sold in foreclosure, the equity of the mortgagor is extinguished except in the event the bid provides a surplus. Any interest of the mortgagor is fully protected. The mortgagor can bid at the sale, bring surplus money proceedings and resist a deficiency judgment by adducing proof that the value of the property exceeded the bids. In New York State the local government is not paid out of the surplus as the mortgage is subject to its liens, but the Federal Government as a creditor of the mortgagor can look only to the surplus for the satisfaction of its lien. The local government lien is not a levy against the mortgagor, but against the land and must be paid together with other costs from whatever funds the sale of the land produces before (if there were no creditors of the mortgagor) any claimed interest of the mortgagor could be asserted. Our State law has not characterized the nature and extent of the Federal tax lien, but has determined the nature and extent of the property interests of the taxpayer (admittedly a State function), which in the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>of real property is conditioned upon the payment of annually recurring govermental land taxes, the payment of which may not be avoided by a forclosure sale. Of course, the Federal Government\u2019s claim, which is based on the claimed interest of the mortgagor, can have no better standing, that is, the Federal lien is also to be paid when there is a surplus in which the mortgagor would have an interest. It would manifestly be unjust to require a mortgagee to pay a creditor of a mortgagor when it appears that the mortgagor had no equity in the real property.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">In the <em>New Britain </em>suit <em>(supra) </em>the court, at the outset, held that the contestants were vying over rights to funds which were considered as surplus. Federal liens securing unpaid withholding and unemployment taxes and insurance contributions owed by the mortgagor attached to his interest in the property subsequent to two mortgages and a judgment hen, but prior to city liens for unpaid real estate and water taxes. Connecticut law provided that the statutory liens for real estate taxes and water rent took precedence over all other liens or incumbrances. Mr. Justice Mixtox, speaking for the court, conceding that the mortgagee had a preference, stated at pages 85-86: \u201cIt does not follow, however, that the City\u2019s liens must receive priority as a whole. We believe that priority on these statutory liens is determined by another principle of law, namely, \u2018 the first in time is the first in right. \u2019 * * * We think that Congress had this cardinal rule in mind when it enacted \u00a7 3670, a schedule of priority not being set forth therein. Thus, the priority of each statutory lien contested here must depend on the time it attached to the property in question and became choate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">Although it may have been the clear intent of Congress that this Federal tax lien have a priority determined by the timeliness with which it attached to the interest of the mortgagor in the real property, <em>New Britain </em>does not indicate that it was the intent of Congress to upset established State procedures in foreclosure actions or curtail the absolute preference granted to mortgagees. The statement (p. 88) that \u201c The United States is not interested in whether the State receives its taxes and water rents prior to mortgagees and judgment creditors \u201d is far too removed, in the light of the real issue here, from the court\u2019s interpretation of congressional intent to have any relation thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>Not to be lost sight of in its discussion of the relative priority of the liens is the court\u2019s statement that Congress intended to assert the Federal lien \u2018\u2018 as to any funds <em>in excess of the amount </em>necessary to pay the mortgage and judgment creditors.\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>New Britain, </em>347 U. S. 81, 88, <em>supra; </em>italics supplied.) The Supreme Court there recognized that the mortgagor\u2019s interest in the proceeds of the foreclosure sale, and consequently the United States lien, reaches only surplus moneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">But such surplus funds cannot be created by the judgment, for they are the moneys paid for the land in excess of the amount decreed in the judgment. A judgment which omits an item of sale expense in order to create a surplus fund to which subsequent liens can attach violates the statute. Rights of lienors in surplus funds are to be protected, but the law of this State cannot be subverted to create a surplus where none might otherwise exist. Our State law does not prevent such lienors from bidding at a foreclosure sale in order to protect their nens; but, inasmuch as they are not forced to bid a sum which will create a surplus, it would be inequitable to force the foreclosing mortgagee to bid an inflated price creating a surplus through the scheme of \u201c circular priorities \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">In this case the respondent\u2019s claim that its lien, founded on the interest of the defaulting mortgagor in the real property, should be granted a priority over the lien on the land, concededly superior to not only the mortgagor\u2019s interests in the realty but the mortgagee\u2019s interest as well, depends on the obviously fallacious contention that the lien of the municipality upon the land is akin to the lien of the Federal Government as a creditor of the mortgagor. The plain answer is that the Federal Government is only the creditor of a debtor whose interest in the land is subordinate to the local government lien, which need not be reduced to judgment nor perfected by a filing in the County Clerk\u2019s office. As a lien for taxes for essential services supplied for the benefit of the land, it attached directly to the particular parcel of real property. The Federal lien was filed in the Clerk\u2019s office against a presumed equity in the real property held by the mortgagor. This respondent imagines a surplus, which is as yet nonexistent, against which it would press a lien arising from a debt owed to it by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>mortgagor. But in a foreclosure suit the equity of the mortgagor upon which a Federal lien depends should be established according to law, not by an ipse dixit.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">The real estate tax and water-rent liens are not liens which attach to the property merely because of an unconnected indebtedness of the owner of the land, as are Federal tax liens, The property itself, in its very nature as land, incurs the indebtedness. It matters not who owns the land for, even if the United States in foreclosing its lien had a Receiver appointed to sell the land, the property could not have been transferred free and clear of the local tax liens attaching while the United States was in possession <em>(see Borock </em>v. <em>City of New York, </em>268 F. 2d 412).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">Thus, the circumstances in the present case are quite different from those assumed in <em>United States </em>v. <em>New Britain (supra). </em>The question is not \u2018 \u2018 the relative priority of statutory federal and municipal liens to the proceeds of a mortgage foreclosure sale of the property to which the liens attached \u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>New Britain, supra, </em>p. 82), but whether the payment of the Federal lien filed against the mortgagor should be mandated where there is no evidence that the mortgagor has a financial interest at the time of foreclosure. Here we are faced with the true parties in interest\u2014the mortgagee and the Federal Grovernment. Under New York law no funds are deemed surplus until the expenses of the sale, the costs of the action and the amount of the foreclosed mortgage debt plus interest have been fully paid. (Civ. Prac. Act, \u00a7 1082). The procedure<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in this State requires the officer conducting the foreclosure sale to pay out of the proceeds all taxes, assessments and water rates which are liens on the property, unless the judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>directs otherwise. These payments are expenses of the sale by statute. Therefore, the question of what, if any, financial interest the mortgagor-taxpayer had on which the Federal Government had a lien can only be determined under the State law after the foreclosure sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">The procedure adopted by the Appellate Division does not follow New York State procedure. Up to the present time the expenses of sale have always been determined by State, rather than Federal, law, and even the judgment in <em>New Britain (Brown </em>v. <em>General Laundry Serv., </em>19 Conn. Supp. 335) recognized that the expenses of sale have priority over any other claim to the moneys realized on the sale. Certainly precedent demands that we should reaffirm the principle that State procedures govern.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">Moreover, the Supreme Court in a recent decision has allowed State law to control the procedure of foreclosure and payment of liens. In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Brosnan </em>(264 F. 2d 762, affd. 363 U. S. 237) Federal tax liens attached to property subject to a purchase-money mortgage, but prior to local tax liens.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Upon default in payment of the mortgage, the mortgagee caused a confession of judgment to be entered on the bond. A writ of <em>fieri facias </em>for the sale of the property issued to the Sheriff. The United States was not a party to this action. \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>The sheriff held the sale of the property on January 3, 1956; it was bid in by Brosnan and Jacob [assignees of the mortgagee] for $6,203 and, it is presumed, the discharge of the mortgage indebtedness. <em>The amount of the hid went to satisfy </em>costs of the sale, and for various outstanding local taxes.\u201d (264 F. 2d, p. 764; emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">More than a year later the United States brought an action to enforce its lien, but the District Court (164 F. Supp. 357) and the Court of Appeals for the 3d Circuit (264 F. 2d 762, <em>supra) </em>held that the junior lien of the Government was extinguished even though the United States had not been joined as a party. The Supreme Court affirmed the determinations below <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>(363 U. S. 237). The opinion was replete with references to State law and procedure \u2014 something not found in <em>New Britain.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">The Supreme Court\u2019s attention was drawn to the fact that Pennsylvania gave its own tax liens more favorable treatment than it rendered the Federal liens at pages 25 to 27 of the United States\u2019 brief: <em>\u201c </em>Indeed, Pennsylvania law itself treats state tax liens more favorably than federal tax liens. A Pennsylvania statute provides that \u2018 The lien of all taxes * * * against any real estate within this Commonwealth shall be divested by any judicial sale of such land: Provided, The amount of the purchase money shall equal the amount of the said taxes \u2019 (Purdon\u2019s Penna Statutes Annotated, Title 53, Section 7104, Appendix, infra, p. 36). While Pennsylvania law permits discharge of a junior lien on realty through foreclosure of a prior mortgage at a sheriff\u2019s sale, the Commonwealth\u2019s liens may be divested only to the extent permitted by statute [eases cited]. Thus, under Pennsylvania law the state\u2019s tax lien will be discharged through foreclosure only if the state\u2019s tax claim is paid in full out of the proceedings. The decision below holds, however, that the same foreclosure proceeding wipes out the federal lien even though the United States receives not a single penny toward payment of its claim. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">The dissent makes it clear that the objection to Pennsylvania procedure in extinguishing the lien of the Federal Government was not that it was done according to State procedure, but that Pennsylvania procedure did not provide for notice to junior lienors (363 U. S. 261).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">Although the main facet of the <em>Brosnan </em>case was a sanction of Pennsylvania\u2019s procedure, whereby the United States was not required to be a party to the action in order to extinguish its lien, the affirmance also necessarily sanctioned that State\u2019s procedure of paying local taxes out of the proceeds of the sale without the necessity of creating a surplus with which to pay liens prior to the local tax liens. (Purdon\u2019s Pennsylvania Statutes Ann., tit. 53, \u00a7\u00a7 7103-7105.) This is a departure from the holding in the <em>New Britain </em>case, as that case is construed by the respondents. The Supreme Court in <em>Brosnan </em>also gave effect to the preference accorded to mortgagees by State and Federal law, and the decision tends toward the principle stated in the dissenting opinion of Haynswoeth, J., in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bond </em>(279 F. 2d 837, 848, cert. den. 364 U. S. 895).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>According to respondent\u2019s reasoning, the mortgagee, concededly not under any obligation to pay the Federal lien on the interest of the mortgagor at the time the lien was filed, becomes obligated when it bids in at the foreclosure sale simply because the mortgagee as bidder under State law must bear the cost of unpaid local taxes on the land falling due subsequent to the filing of the Federal lien. This imposition of liability is justified on the assumption that at the time of foreclosure the undetermined financial interest of the mortgagor has a value at least equal to the amount of the unpaid taxes which fell due subsequent to the filing of the Federal lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">The circumstances present in the case of the foreclosure of a real estate tax lien by a municipality illustrate best the paradoxical result of the application of the rule respondent asserts. Under that rule the municipality which is foreclosing the tax lien for local taxes, which accrued subsequent to the filing of a tax lien filed against the equity of the property owner, shall be obligated to discharge the Federal tax lien in order to secure a clear title. But the interest of such a property owner obviously is worthless, since neither the property owner nor the public would bid on the tax lien which the municipality ultimately had to foreclose. In spite of this evidence of lack of value, the respondent would contend that the Federal lien has a priority because the nonexistent financial interest of the property owner cannot be diminished by giving priority to local taxes accrued subsequent to the filing of the Federal lien, and that, therefore, the municipality must satisfy the Federal lien. In other words, the financial interest of the property owner which was nil develops value through the default of the property owner on local taxes. This <em>nonsequitur </em>had to be resorted to because respondent realizes its lien is not a lien on the land, but is only a lien on the equity of the owner. Therefore, it had to invent an equity which the owner could be said to possess at the time of the foreclosure in order to avoid the controlling State law which provides that the nature and extent of the property interests of a defaulting mortgagor can only be determined after a foreclosure sale conducted according to the State laws. The patent infirmity of this contrivance explains why the respondent has improperly invoked a canon, in a matter involv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>ing disparate liens, which is relevant only to the relationships of kindred liens, i.e., \u201c the first in time is the first in right</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">Such a rule, if accepted now, would adversely affect the credit rating of all municipal bonds which are marketed on the assumption that local taxes are a first lien on the land within the municipality. It would also impair the borrowing power of municipalities because it makes the municipality liable for the personal debts a tax delinquent property owner owes to the Federal Government. Finally, it would cloud the title of properties which the municipalities have resold after acquisition through tax lien foreclosures.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">The logic of the respondent appears to be as circular as the type of priority that it would have this court stamp with approval. The procedure that it proposes is novel to this State. Were local taxes not owing upon the land, the United States could not, through its own admissions, compel the creation of a surplus in which its lien would share with the judgment creditors. Is it logical that the Federal Government should be entitled to compel the mortgagee to treat the amount of real estate taxes subsequently accruing as a surplus to be applied toward payment of the Federal lien?</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">To accede to this attempt to foist the personal debts of the mortgagor owing to the United States on the mortgagee is to agree to the imposition of an indirect tax on savings banks who have invested billions of dollars in mortgages and on the savings of our citizens invested in mortgages which have been accorded a preference even under Federal law (U. S. Code, tit. 26, \u00a7 6323, subd. [a]). If the preference is to be whittled down, it should be done explicitly by a statute enacted by the representatives of the States in the national Congress and not by the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">The direction in the resettled judgment of foreclosure that the Referee should pay the real estate taxes, assessments and water rates out of the proceeds of the sale as expenses of the sale is not only in conformity with State law (Civ. Prac. Act, \u00a7 1087), but is also in keeping with the preference conferred on the mortgagee by State and Federal law protecting \u2018 \u2018 all those rights which the Congress must have known the mortgagee commonly and usually possesses \u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Bond, </em>279 F. 2d 837, 851, <em>supra). </em>Being the proper procedure of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>State, the resettled judgment of foreclosure of October 20, 1960 should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">The judgment of the Appellate Division, entered June 13, 1961, should be reversed, and the judgment of the County Court, Erie County, entered October 20,1960, reinstated, without costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b79-7\">.

The Federal liens, amounting to $40,403.34 attached to the property between April 11,1949 and November 28,1951 (Exhibit B to complaint of United States).

(dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"AP9\">By its present decision, the court Is holding that a Federal tax lien filed against a mortgagor prior to the accrual of local real estate taxes and assessments\u2014which are superior to the mortgage debt \u2014 is not entitled to priority over those subsequently accrued local liens. I cannot agree. In my view, the conclusion reached by the majority stands opposed to controlling authority. (See <em>United States </em>v. <em>New Britain, </em>347 U. S. 81; see, also, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bond, </em>279 F. 2d 837 [4th Cir.]; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Christensen, </em>269 F. 2d 624 [9th Cir.]; <em>Stadelman </em>v. <em>Hornell Woodworking Corp., 172 </em>F. Supp. 156 [U. S. Dist. Ct., W. D. N. Y.]; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lord, </em>155 F. Supp. 105 [U. S. Dist. Ct., N. H.]; <em>Union Central Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Peters, </em>361 Mich. 283.) Nor may the impact of such authority be avoided by having the State, through legislative enactment or court decision, label local taxes and assessments \u201cexpenses of the sale\u201d, that is, of the mortgage foreclosure sale following the action brought by the mortgagee (Civ. Prac. Act, \u00a7 1087).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">Once it has been determined, under State law, that the taxpayer has property or rights to property, \u201c state law is inoperative to prevent the attachment of liens created by federal statutes in favor of the United States.\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Bess, </em>357 U. S. 51, 57.) Moreover, when a Federal tax lien has attached to property o'f the taxpayer, as undoubtedly it had here, State law may not destroy it. (See <em>Commissioner </em>v. <em>Stern, </em>357 U. S. 39.) As already indicated, calling the local taxes \u201c expenses of the sale \u201d does not help the local taxing authority, for it is to substance, not form, that the courts look. Local taxes do not result from the mortgage foreclosure sale; on the contrary, they pre-exist the sale. Accordingly, the State\u2019s characterization of them as \u2018 \u2018 expenses of the sale \u2019 \u2019 \u2014 appropriate though it may be for the State\u2019s own purposes \u2014 is thoroughly unreal in our present context and completely ineffectual to affect the priority of the Federal lien. (Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gilbert Associates, </em>345 U. S. 361.)</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>In deciding questions concerning the relevant priorities of a Federal tax lien and other liens, it is perfectly clear that State law determines the nature and extent of the property interests of the taxpayer and that Federal law determines the priority of the competing claims themselves. (See, e.g., <em>Aquilino </em>v. <em>United States, </em>363 U. S. 509, 515-516; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Brosnan, </em>363 U. S. 237, 240; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bess, </em>357 U. S. 51, 55, <em>supra; United States </em>v. <em>Acri, </em>348 U. S. 211, 213.) Although the court\u2019s opinion herein does not expressly reject this proposition \u2014 as to the proper role of State and Federal law in this area-\u2014-its decision stands squarely opposed to it. What the court has done, under State law, is to characterize the nature and extent of the Federal lien and determine its priority in competition with local liens \u2014 a function exclusively reserved to the Federal law. (See <em>Aquilino </em>v. <em>United States, </em>363 U. S. 509, <em>supra.) </em>Thus, the majority describes the Government\u2019s status in the present action as that merely of <em>\u201c </em>a creditor of the mortgagor \u201d and concludes that, since the Government\u2019s position <em>\u201c </em>is based on the claimed interest of the mortgagor, [it] can have no better standing [than the mortgagor], that is, the Federal lien is also to be paid when there is a surplus [over mortgage debt plus local taxes] in which the mortgagor would have an interest\u201d (opinion, p. 37). To employ the language of the opinion in the <em>Brosnan </em>case, this is not an authorized State determination of the \u2018 \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>property and rights to property \u2019 * * * to which a government tax lien attaches,\u201d but rather an unauthorized State determination of \u2018' matters directly affecting the nature or operation of [federal tax] liens \u201d (363 U. S. 237, 240).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Furthermore, giving priority to the after-accrued local taxes, as the majority is here doing, is directly contrary to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States </em>v. <em>New Britain </em>(347 U. S. 81, <em>supra). </em>In that case, in addition to prior mortgages and a prior judgment lien, the taxpayer\u2019s property was incumbered by a Federal tax lien and, subsequent in time to such lien, by a municipal tax lien. The Connecticut Supreme Court reasoned, as the majority does here, that, since Federal law subordinated the Federal tax lien to mortgage and judgment liens and since, under State law, these mortgage liens were subordinated to real property tax liens, the Federal tax lien had to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>subordinated to the local real property tax lien. (See <em>Brown </em>v. <em>General Laundry Serv., </em>139 Conn. 363, 373.) In answer to this argument, the Supreme Court of the United States declared (347 U. S., at p. 88):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-5\">\u201c We do not agree. The United States is not interested in whether the State receives its taxes and water rents prior to mortgagees and judgment creditors. That is a matter of state law. But as to any funds in excess of the amount necessary to pay the mortgage and judgment creditors, Congress intended to assert the federal lien.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">Even more recently, in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Brosnan </em>(363 U. S. 237, <em>supra), </em>the Supreme Court, citing numerous decisions, \u201c rejected \u201d the very position taken by the majority in this case (363 U. S., at p. 241):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-7\">\u201c This Court has repeatedly rejected the contention that because a fee owned by a taxpayer was already encumbered by a lien which enjoyed seniority under state law, the Government\u2019s lien necessarily attached subject to that lien.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">The rule adopted in the <em>New Britain </em>case as the Federal rule for resolving conflicts between a Federal tax lien and local real property tax liens is the olden one that \u2018 \u2018 \u2018 the first in time is the first in right\u2019\u201d (347 U. S., at p. 85). As there pointed out, \u201cWhen the debtor is insolvent, Congress has expressly given priority to the payment of indebtedness owing the United States, whether secured by liens or otherwise, by \u00a7 3466 of the Revised Statutes, 31 U. S. C. (1946 ed.) \u00a7 191. In that circumstance, where all the property of the debtor is involved, Congress has protected the federal revenues by imposing an absolute priority \u2019 \u2019. Where, however, the court continued (p. 85), \u201cthe debtor is not insolvent, Congress has failed to expressly provide for federal priority, with certain exceptions not relevant here \u201d. (And see Internal Revenue Code of 1939, U. S. Code, tit. 26, \u00a7 3672; Internal Revenue Code of 1954, U. S. Code, tit. 26, \u00a7 6323).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> And, added the court, \u201c There is nothing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>in the language of \u00a7 3672 to show that Congress intended antecedent federal tax liens to rank behind any but the specific categories of interests set out therein \u201d (p. 88), that is, mortgagees, judgment creditors, pledgees and purchasers. Accordingly, the relative priority of each lien here involv<em>ed </em>must depend upon the time [each of them] attached to the property in question and became choate \u201d (p. 86. See, also, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bond, </em>279 F. 2d 837, <em>supra; United States </em>v. <em>Christensen, </em>269 F. 2d 624, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">The court seeks to distinguish <em>New Britain </em>from the present case on the ground that the contest there <em>\u201c </em>was between the local government and the Federal government over their respective rights in surplus funds \u201d, whereas here the \u201c facts [show] that the dispute is really between the mortgagee and creditors of the mortgagor \u201d (opinion, p. 36). Starting from this premise, the majority urges that, if the contest were between the Federal Government and the local taxing authorities, <em>New Britain </em>would control and the Government would prevail. But, since the dispute here is between the United States, as a creditor of the mortgagor, and the mortgagee, the latter must prevail, because (the argument proceeds) the Government can have no better standing than the mortgagor himself. And the court seeks to bolster this conclusion by claiming that <em>\u201c </em>the respective liens [in this case] are not comparable charges on real property \u201d (p. 35). In my judgment, the proffered ground for distinction is not tenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">It is true that in <em>New Britain </em>the contest was between the city and the Federal Government but, as the facts disclosed and later developments made clear (see <em>Brown </em>v. <em>General Laundry Serv., </em>19 Conn. Supp. 335), the real parties in interest were the Federal Government and private lienors of the debtor\u2019s real estate who were entitled to priority over the Federal lien by the express terms of the Federal lien statutes. The State of Connecticut received its taxes in full at the expense of lienors whose liens were prior to those of the Federal Government. The fact that the contest in <em>New Britain </em>was between the city and the Federal Government and in this case between the mortgagee and the Government neither compels nor justifies a difference in result.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>As I have already noted, it is the majority\u2019s assertion that the lien for local taxes must take precedence over the Government\u2019s lien because the respective liens are not comparable charges on real property. This is its position (pp. 36-38): On the one hand, \u201c The local government lien is not a levy against the mortgagor, but against the land\u201d. On the other hand, the Federal Government\u2019s status is only that of <em>\u201c </em>a creditor of the mortgagor \u2019 \u2019, its claim merely one \u20181 based on the claimed interest of the mortgagor \u201d. And its lien, rather than being a lien which \u201c attach [es] directly to the particular parcel of real property \u201d, as does that of the local government, <em>\u201c </em>attach [es] to the property merely because of an unconnected indebtedness of the owner of the land \u2019 \u2019. In other words, the Federal lien is not against the land, but <em>\u201c </em>against a presumed equity in the real property held by the mortgagor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">Having made these distinctions, the court goes on to suggest that the difference in the way these liens arise assures priority to the liens of the local taxing authorities over the lien of the Federal Government. From this and the status ascribed to the Federal lien, it is the court\u2019s conclusion that \u201c the Federal Government\u2019s claim, which is based on the claimed interest of the mortgagor, can have no better standing [than the mortgagor\u2019s claim], that is, the Federal lien is also to be paid when there is a surplus [above the mortgage debt and expenses of sale, including local taxes] in which the mortgagor would have an interest \u201d (opinion, p. 37).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">The fallacy of this argument, I venture, is that it mistakes the Federal law with respect to the status and incidence of the Federal interest. The Federal Government is no mere unsecured creditor of a delinquent taxpayer. It is, rather, the holder of \u201c a lien * * * upon all property or rights to property, whether real or personal, belonging to such person \u201d (Internal Revenue Code of 1954, TJ. S. Code, tit. 26, \u00a7 6321). Such a lien attaches to the real property owned by the taxpayer at the time the \u201c [tax] assessment is made \u201d (U. S. Code, tit. 26, \u00a7 6322), not to whatever equity he may have in it after a subsequent mortgage sale. In short, the Federal lien is not, as the majority insists, <em>\u201c </em>against a presumed equity in the real property held by the mortgagor \u201d, but against the land itself. The rights of the Federal Government to the proceeds of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>the mortgage sale are not, therefore, limited to those of the mortgagor.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">Let me state the matter somewhat differently. The lien of the United States arose when the assessments were made, and it attached to the mortgaged property at that time. Consequently, if the sale of the property had then been held, that lien could have been satisfied out of the proceeds of such sale after payment of proper expenses and of the amount then due on the mortgage plus interest to the date of payment. The local taxes here involved had not yet come into being and might never have become liens against the property. They might have been paid by the mortgagor or the property might have been foreclosed before they became due. Since, therefore, the liens of the local authorities had at best only a potential existence, we do not reach the question whether those liens were choate when the Federal liens attached. It comports neither with reality nor with law to give such \u201cpotential liens \u201d priority over the pre-existing matured Federal lien by labeling them \u201c expenses of the sale \u201d in foreclosure proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">Indeed, an argument very similar to that made by the court here, namely, that the respective charges of the Federal Government and the local taxing authorities are \u2018 \u2018 not comparable charges on real property \u201d, was expressly made and rejected in the <em>New Britain </em>case (347 U. S. 81, <em>supra). </em>It had evidently been argued that the local tax liens should take precedence over the Federal tax lien because they were \u201cspecific\u201d while the Federal lien was \u201c general \u201d. With respect to this contention, the Supreme Court declared (p. 84):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-7\">\u201c [T]he fact that one group of liens [the local] is specific and the other [the federal] general in and of itself is of no significance in these cases * * *. Thus, the general statutory liens of the United States are as binding as the specific statutory liens of the City. The City gains no priority by the fact that its liens are specific while the United States\u2019 liens are general. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">Finally, a word must be said about the majority\u2019s characterization of the decision in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Brosnan </em>(363 U. S. 237, <em>supra) </em>as \u201c a departure \u201d from the holding in the <em>New Britain </em>case. In the first place, <em>Brosnan </em>was concerned with a question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>whether a Federal tax lien could be extinguished under a State procedure for foreclosure in which the Federal Government, <em>a junior </em>lienor, was not, and need not have been, a party; what was involved, therefore, was not the problem of priority at issue here. In the second place, although local taxes had been paid out of the proceeds of the mortgage sale and thus had, in effect, achieved priority, that issue was never raised on appeal, the sole issue being\u2014to cull from the court\u2019s opinion\u2014\u201cwhether the federal lien was effectively extinguished by state proceedings to which the United States was not, nor was required under state law to be, a party \u201d (363 U. S., at pp. 238-239). The third' and (to me) conclusive reason why <em>Brosnan </em>may not be taken to be a departure from the <em>New Britain </em>holding is that in <em>Brosnan </em>the Supreme Court actually cited <em>New Britain </em>with approval (363 U. S., at p. 241, n. 4) and restated one of the principles which it had announced; thus, it wrote in <em>Brosnan </em>(p. 241): \u201c This Court has repeatedly rejected the contention that because a fee owned by a taxpayer was already encumbered by a lien which enjoys seniority under state law, the Government\u2019s lien necessarily attached subject to that lien\u201d. As is evident, far from supporting the majority view in the present case, the opinion in <em>Brosnan </em>stands <em>-with. New Britain </em>to refute it.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">In sum, then, in situations of this kind, the lien of the Federal Government must be recognized as prior in right to that of the local taxing authorities. This follows from the fact that it is prior in time. But this does not mean that those local taxing authorities will not collect their taxes. The majority opinion has placed the contest in its proper setting. The dispute is between the mortgagee and the Federal Government as a creditor of the mortgagor. The local taxing authorities will be paid at the expense of the mortgagee so there will be no adverse economic impact upon the taxing authorities. The mortgagee\u2019s interest in the proceeds of the mortgage sale may, perhaps, be diminished. But the mortgagee is not left without recourse where the mortgagor is liable for payment of the debt secured by the mortgage and he is not insolvent. In such a case, the mortgagee may collect the \u201c residue \u201d or balance due from the mortgagor by way of a deficiency judgment (Civ. Prac. Act, \u00a7\u00a7 1082,1083).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">I would affirm the judgment of the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>Chief Judge Desmond and Judges Dye, Froessel and Van Voorhis concur with Judge Burke; Judge Fuld dissents in an opinion in which Judge Foster concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">Judgment of Appellate Division, entered June 13, 1961, reversed and judgment of the County Court, Erie County, entered October 20, 1960, reinstated, without costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b86-9\">. It is appropriate to note at this point that the record before us, like the record in <em>New Britain </em>(347 U. S., at p. 85), does not indicate that the mortgagor-taxpayer was insolvent.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
