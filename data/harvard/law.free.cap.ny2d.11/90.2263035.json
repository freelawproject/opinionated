By the releases and assignments executed by appellants, they relinquished any claims they might have had against respondents under the paper dated March 25,1946. <em>(Lucio </em>v. <em>Curran, </em>2 N Y 2d 157.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b132-6\">Fuld, J.</author>\n<p id=\"APl\">Whether the joint will of Mr. and Mrs. Mottek constitutes a contract by each of the testators to dispose of his or her respective estate in the manner specified in such will is the question presented by this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">Ludwig Louis Mottek and his wife Margaret came to this country from Germany in 1941. Some 5 years later, in March of 1946, they executed a holographic will, written in German, which bore the caption \u201cJoint Testament\u201d. After opening with the recital that Ludwig is married to Margaret and that there are two children, Helen Arnhym and Ilselotte (also Ilia) Rich, the will continues in this way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-8\">\u201cWe are not restricted in the disposition of our property and we are in full possession of our senses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-9\">\u201c2. Under this premise, we spouses mutually appoint ourselves heirs, if neither one of us remarries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-10\">\u201cIn the latter case there would have to be a prior settlement with our children. Therefore the survivor of us is the sole heir of the predecedent, whereas our children are appointed heirs of the last decedent spouse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>\u201c3. If we should obtain property from Germany, Ilselotte Rich shall receive first $3000. (three thousand), in order to put both daughters in equal position.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Ludwig signed first and, following his signature and those of the attesting witnesses, there is this sentence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-6\"><em>\u201c </em>The foregoing Testament of my husband Ludwig Louis Mottelc shall also be deemed to be mine.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">And this is followed by Margaret\u2019s signature and those of the same attesting witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">Ludwig died in August of 1950 and his will was admitted to probate. In 1955, on October 8, his widow Margaret revoked the will which she had executed with, her husband in 1946 and made a new one. In this latter will, after providing for gifts of $2,500 to each daughter, Margaret created a trust, the income of which was to go to each daughter in equal shares for life. The remainder of the share of one daughter was left to her children, while the remainder of the other daughter\u2019s share went, ultimately, to the children of Margaret\u2019s brother. Margaret died in 1957 and the 1955 will was admitted to probate.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">Margaret was survived by both Helen Arnhym and Ilia Rich, and they brought this action to impress a trust upon the property left by their mother and to have it distributed to them in accordance with the provisions of the 1946 joint will. Following a trial, the court reached a decision opposed to the plaintiffs \u2019 position and dismissed the complaint. The Appellate Division, by a divided vote, affirmed the resulting judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-10\">The applicable principles are clear and settled. Two persons may validly agree to dispose of their estates in a particular way and may embody their agreement in mutual wills or a joint testament. During the lifetime of either party, each may, of course, use his property as he pleases, \u201c short of making a different testamentary disposition or a gift to defeat the purpose of the agreement\u201d. <em>(Rastetter </em>v. <em>Hoenninger, </em>214 N. Y. 66, 73.) \"Whether or not one party may revoke by notifying the other during their joint lives, we need not consider or decide. However, \u2018 after the agreement [has] been executed by one dying without making a different testamentary disposition of his property and after the acceptance by the other of the bene<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>fits of the agreement, it [becomes] obligatory upon the latter and enforceabl\u00e9 in equity upon his death.\u201d <em>(Rastetter </em>v. <em>Hoenninger, </em>214 N. Y. 66, 73.) In other words, if the survivor of the two testators breaches the contract by executing a will other than that agreed upon, the courts will compel his executors to \u201cperform the contract\u201d. <em>(Tutunjian </em>v. <em>Vetzigian, </em>299 N. Y. 315, 319; see, also, <em>Hermann </em>v. <em>Ludwig, </em>229 N. Y. 544.) Indeed, as we observed in the <em>Tutunjian case </em>(299 N. Y., at p. 319), \u201c to permit the one who survives to gain the benefits of the joint will and then to flout its provisions in violation of the promise made to the other <em>1 </em>would be a mockery of justice \u2019. <em>(Mutual Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Holloday, </em>13 Abb. N. C. 16, 24.) \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">The mere existence of a joint testament may not in and of itself serve to establish the agreement, but the lang*uage used by the testators in their will or the circumstances surrounding its making may suffice to spell out a contract, particularly in the case of a joint will executed by husband and wife or by parents interested in providing for their children. (See, e.g., <em>Tutunjian </em>v. <em>Vetzigian, </em>299 N. Y. 315, 319, <em>supra; Hermann </em>v. <em>Ludwig, </em>229 N. Y. 544, <em>supra; Rastetter </em>v. <em>Hoenninger, </em>214 N. Y. 66, 72, <em>supra; </em>cf. <em>Oursler </em>v. <em>Armstrong, </em>10 N Y 2d 385.)</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">In the case before us, the terms of the will impose a clear obligation on the part of husband and wife to provide, at death, first for each other and then for their children. They labeled their will a \u201c Joint Testament \u201d and, using the plural \u201cwe \u201d and \u201c our \u201d throughout, declared that \u201c We are not restricted in the disposition of our property \u201d and that \u201c our children are appointed heirs of the last decedent spouse \u201d. Language such as this, this court remarked in both <em>Tutunjian </em>(299 N. Y. 315, 320) and <em>Rastetter </em>(214 N. Y. 66, 72), \u201cimports the joint disposition of the collective property of both, not the independent disposition by each of his own\u201d. Moreover, the arrangement giving one daughter an extra $3,000 to put both \u2018 \u2018 in equal position \u2019 \u2019 likewise seems consistent only with an agreement by the parties to provide unconditionally for their daughters upon the death of the surviving spouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">The will does, it is true, use the term \u201c sole heir\u201d in connection with the surviving spouse and omits the word \u201c sole \u201d in referring to the children as \u201c heirs \u201d. But this does not, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>our opinion, indicate an intention to place the survivor in a more favorable position than the children or negate the existence of a contractual obligation. Since, under the laws of intestacy in this country (Decedent Estate Law, \u00a7 83)\u2014and apparently in Germany (see I Manual of German Law [British Foreign Office, 1950], p. 185) \u2014the children, as well as the widowed party, are the heirs of the deceased spouse, the parties undoubtedly intended, by the use of the adjective \u201c sole \u201d, to make more emphatic the children\u2019s exclusion from the estate of the \u201cpredecedent\u201d spouse at his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">In point of fact, in the <em>dispositive </em>language of the testament, it will be observed that the word \u201c heir \u201d is not qualified by \u201csole\u201d; that portion merely recites, \u201cwe spouses mutually appoint ourselves [that is, each other] heirs \u201d. The word \u201c sole \u201d is used only in what may be termed the narrative part of the will, namely, \u201c Therefore, the survivor of us is the sole heir of the predecedent \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">The word \u201csole\u201d does no more or less than denote the singular rather than the plural. In the present context, it neither enlarges nor strengthens the comprehensive and meaningful term \u00a3 \u00a3 heirs \u2019 \u2019. In short, there is no difference, at least in the present instance, between an \u201c heir \u201d and a \u201c sole heir \u201d, and the adjective \u201c sole \u201d would have been even less meaningful and, certainly, superfluous, if used with respect to a class such as \u201c our children \u201d. Moreover, this provision for the children, following as it does immediately upon the reference to the possible remarriage of the survivor, is strong indication that each party intended to bind the other to leave his property to the children whether he remarried or whether he did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">Nor does the use of the transitional word \u201cwhereas\u201d (in German, \u201c wahrend \u201d) after the provision for the surviving spouse and before the provision for the children weaken this conclusion. The word does not necessarily imply antithesis; rather, we would say, it differentiates, without suggesting contrariety. If, though, there is any antithesis in the present context, it is simply as to times and sequences; it does no more than refer to the different times at which the surviving spouse and the children will come into full enjoyment of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">Thus, the will itself reflects and establishes a contract between the testators to dispose of their respective estates in the manner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>specified.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plaintiffs are, therefore, entitled to their mother\u2019s entire estate, unless releases which they signed at the time of their father\u2019s death stand in the way. These are the circumstances surrounding the execution of the releases. When Ludwig died, the daughters were advised, in substance, that it would be easier for their mother to obtain certain funds owed their father if they signed instruments of release entitling her to deal Avith their father\u2019s estate in Germany. They agreed to do so and, accordingly, each daughter released and assigned to her mother \u201c all of my right, title and interest * * * in and to any and all property * * * Avhereof my father, Lud-Avig Mottek, died seized or possessed, that I noAv or hereafter may claim * * * by virtue of any of the terms, provisions, conditions and trusts contained in any Last Will and Testament of my said father * * * or under any intestacy laws of the State of New York or of any other state or country.\u201d The very wording of the releases indicates that the daughters were merely giving up all claims to their <em>father\u2019s </em>estate under the terms of <em>his </em>Avill. Nothing in the documents suggests or provides for a forfeiture of their rights under their mother\u2019s will, nor does it release her from her contractual obligation to leave them her estate. It is manifest that, although there may have been some moral inducement for the plaintiffs to forego all claims under the will of their father for the benefit of their mother \u2014 Avhether it was to give up the statutory portion in the father\u2019s estate to Avhich they might have been entitled under German law or otherAvise to expedite the administration of his estate in Germany\u2014 there was no such inducement for them to forego their rights under their mother\u2019s will.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">In sum, then, Margaret Mottek, having agreed with her husband to leave her estate to her daughters, was under a contractual obligation to do so, and it is immaterial that the later Avill which she made in violation of her agreement has been admitted to probate.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>The judgment of the Appellate Division should be reversed, with costs in all courts, and the relief demanded in the complaint granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b136-9\">. In the vieiv thus taken, it is unnecessary to consider the propriety of the trial judge\u2019s ruling which excluded the testimony of a German law expert, proffered by the plaintiffs, with respect to German law and custom, in order to prove both the \u201c background \u201d and \u201c intent \u201d of the Motteks and the meaning which would be accorded in Germany to a \u201c Joint Testament\u201d such as they executed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b137-5\">Van Voorhis, J. (dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"AEq\">Unless the rule is to be changed that the mere existence of a joint will may not in and of itself establish an agreement to refrain from altering or revoking the testamentary disposition of the survivor, it seems to me that the judgment appealed from must be affirmed. Certainty and predictability in the law furnish a sound basis for the rule that such an agreement must clearly appear from the evidence. It is not to be found in vague or doubtful implication. I vote to affirm for the reasons stated in the opinion by Bergan, J., at the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">Chief Judge Desmond and Judges Froessel, Burke and Foster concur with Judge Fuld; Judge Van Voorhis dissents in an opinion in which Judge Dye concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">Judgment reversed, with costs in all courts, and matter remitted to the Supreme Court for further proceedings in accordance with the opinion herein.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
