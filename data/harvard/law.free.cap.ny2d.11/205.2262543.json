A binding agreement resulted when plaintiff accepted its offer of appointment pursuant to the terms of defendant\u2019s offer set forth in the document defendant handed to him. <em>(Hotchkiss </em>v. <em>National City Bank, </em>200 F. 287, 201 F. 664, 231 U.

Defendant, having availed itself of the benefits of full performance on the part of Dr. Leider, cannot at this time repudiate or deny him its promised reward. <em>(Rubin </em>v. <em>Dairymen\u2019s League Co-op.

There is no basis in the facts or the law for summary judgment in favor of defendant. The undisputed facts dictate judgment in favor of plaintiff. <em>(Matter of Marburg </em>v. <em>Cole, </em>286 N.

In the ease of private institutions, in the absence of any contractual relationship or agreement to the contrary, the exclusion of a physician from staff privileges rests entirely in the discretion of the managing authorities. <em>(Matter of Trapasso Oldsmobile [Italian Soc. of M.

Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that defendant\u2019s constitution and the by-laws of its medical board constituted a contract between the parties, it was either a contract at will and duly terminated by defendant, or a contract not to be completed before- the end of plaintiff\u2019s lifetime and thus void under the Statute of Frauds. <em>(Tyler </em>v. <em>Windels, </em>186 App. Div. 698, 227 N.

Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that defendant\u2019s board of trustees had approved plaintiff\u2019s alleged contract, such contract would nevertheless be void, for the board of trustees of defendant, a membership corporation, does not have the power to bind defendant to such a contract. <em>(Clifford </em>v. <em>Firemen\u2019s Mut.

More specifically, his successive annual appointments effected no contractual relationship with the defendant which prevented its board of trustees from terminating his member<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>ship on its medical staff. His exclusion from the staff and the \u201c off-service \u201d privileges, incident to staff membership, including the privileges to care for private patients in the hospital, rested entirely in the discretion of the board of trustees. As the court at Special Term aptly noted, the by-law provision granting such \u201c off-service \u201d privileges to doctors \u201c of the Hospital Staff \u201d \u201c cannot derogate from the right of the board of trustees to make <em>annual </em>appointments only, and * * * can refer only to those physicians and surgeons whom the board * \" * determines annually to reappoint to the hospital\u2019s medical staff \u2018 off service \u2019 after they have reached the age limits \u2019 \u2019 provided for by the hospital\u2019s constitution. Consequently, the denial to the plaintiff of future courtesy privileges following the termination of his annual employment constituted no legal wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">The judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b249-7\">Froessel, J. (dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"AVJ\">Appellant, during his many years as a member in good standing of respondent\u2019s hospital staff, rendered service to the hospital in reliance upon the provisions in article IX of the by-laws of the medical staff, which secure to him the enjoyment of certain privileges upon his retirement. That article provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-8\">\u2018 \u2018 When any surgeon or physician of the Hospital Staff below the rank of Director or Attending shall have reached the age limit as provided for by the Constitution of the Board of Trustees, such surgeon or physician shall thereafter continue to retain the rank then held, but without service, and shall he designated with this title, 1 off service. \u2019 These physicians and surgeons shall enjoy the following Hospital privileges;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-9\">\u201c 1. The care of their private patients in the Hospital.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">Respondent now seeks to divest appellant of his <em>right </em>to the enjoyment of these privileges; a <em>right </em>to which he became entitled in 1959, when he attained the age limit provided for one in his rank. In my opinion, the fact that the hoard of trustees, to Avhom the hospital\u2019s constitution commits the control, direction and management of all the affairs and property of the corporation, could liaA'e altered or abrogated the by-laws, or even discharged appellant on the day before he attained the slated age limit and became entitled to the privileges proAdded in article IX, does not mean that they may divest him of these rights <em>after </em>they vest.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>111 my view of this ease, the controlling fact is that appellant was a member in good standing of the hospital staff when he attained the stated age limit in 1959. At that moment, by virtue of the above-quoted provision of the by-laws, he became entitled to the designation <em>\u201c </em>off-service \u201d and the privileges which accrue to one in his new \u201c off-service \u201d category. Indeed, the by-laws are couched in mandatory terms, providing that appellant11 shall be designated with this title \u201d, and \u201c shall enjoy \u201d the privilege which he now seeks. This is tantamount to a contract, and appellant\u2019s right may not be impaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">The fact that he was denied reappointment as a member of the hospital staff after May 1, 1960 is irrelevant, and cannot affect the rights to which he became entitled in 1959. I fully recognize that the board of trustees may not be restricted in the exercise of the sweeping powers the constitution commits to them, and intend no such limitation. The board, now as before, has the right to exercise its powers with respect to those members of the hospital staff who have not as yet attained the retirement age. They may not, however, reward 10 years of service, rendered in reliance upon rights assured by article IX, with a summary abrogation of these rights after appellant has become legally entitled to them. However plenary the board\u2019s power, the short answer to this case is that it failed to exercise it in time.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">Accordingly, the judgment appealed from should be reversed and summary judgment directed in favor of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">Chief Judge Desmond and Judges Dye, Fuld, Van Voor.his, Burke and Foster concur in <em>Per Curiam </em>opinion; Judge Froessel dissents in a separate opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
