Plaintiff\u2019s right to final payment has not yet matured, because no final certificate in the form mandated by the contract herein has as yet been issued by the architects. Hence, this action has been prematurely instituted, and the complaint should have been dismissed. II. In an action by a contractor upon a cost-plus contract, it is improper to grant summary judgment where the facts as to the expenditures made by the contractor, the propriety, reasonableness and necessity of such expenditures, and the extent of rebates received from subcontractors and suppliers are solely within the contractor\u2019s knowledge and the owner has not been afforded an opportunity to conduct an examination before trial and discovery of the contractor\u2019s books <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>and records. <em>(Title Guar. &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Pam, </em>192 App. Div. 268; <em>Levine </em>v. <em>Behn, </em>282 N.

The alleged denial to defendant Sapphire of an opportunity for further investigation creates no triable issue sufficient to withstand summary judgment. <em>(Levine </em>v. <em>Behn, </em>282 N.

This being so, the certificate, when issued, is conclusive and decisive on the rights of the parties, obligating the defendant, Sapphire Realty Co., to pay the amount fixed by the architects unless it can show that the certificate was obtained by fraud or mistake. (See <em>Glacius </em>v. Black,50 N. Y. 145, 151; <em>Wyckoff </em>v. <em>Meyers, </em>44 N. Y. 143,145.)</p>\n<p id=\"b59-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>As to the defendants\u2019 objections to the form of the certificate, taken for the first time in this court, we need merely say that the architects sufficiently complied with the contract\u2019s requirements when, titling the certificate \u201cFinal Payment \u201d, they certified that Hughes (the plaintiff herein) \u201c is entitled \u201d to the payment of the sum of $100,383.90. In view of that certification, it verges on the sophistical to urge, as the defendants have, that the certificate is deficient because it fails explicitly to recite that the architects found the building properly and fully completed and that they had inspected it and found it \u201c acceptable \u201d. As a reading of the contract between the parties establishes, it makes the final payment certificate dependent upon the architects\u2019 finding the work \u201c acceptable \u201d. All this, and far more, is subsumed by the architects\u2019 use of the phrase that the contractor Hughes \u201c is entitled \u201d to the \u201c final payment \u201d due and owing on the contract. (See <em>Wyckoff </em>v. <em>Meyers, </em>44 N. Y. 143,145-146, <em>supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">It is equally captious for the defendants to attack the architects\u2019 final certificate on the further ground that it refers to the building as \u201c being constructed \u201d rather than \u201c completed As already indicated, the certificate was to issue, according to the contract itself, only if the building had been inspected by the architects and only if they had found the work \u201c acceptable under the Contract and the Contract fully performed \u2019 \u2019. Accordingly, the very issuance of the certificate demonstrated not only completion of the building, but also its \u2018 \u2018 inspection \u2019 \u2019 by the architects and their approval of the work as <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u2018 acceptable \u2019 \u2019.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">We merely add, for we believe it sheds some light on the <em>bona fides </em>of the defense, that the final payment certificate was issued on July 19, 1960, several months after a certificate of occupancy had been issued for the building and the defendants had gone into possession.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">In sum\u2014the architects, in fulfillment of their duties and powers, made a final inspection, found the work acceptable and the contract fully performed and certified that the plaintiff was entitled to \u201cfinal\u201d payment of the amount still unpaid. The objections to the form of the certificate are without sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>stance and the courts below were fully warranted in granting partial summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">The judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">Chief Judge Desmond and Judges Fuld, Burke and Foster concur in <em>Per Curiam </em>opinion; Judges Dye, Froessel and Van Voorhis dissent and vote to reverse upon the ground that triable issues of fact were presented by the pleadings and affidavits as to the conclusiveness of the architects\u2019 final certificate of damage on the issue of performance, and value of the work, as well as to the propriety, reasonableness and necessity of the expenditures and the extent of rebates received, all solely within the knowledge of respondent, who by this cost plus contract had expressly placed itself in a \u201c trust and confidence \u201d relationship. Accordingly, the motion for partial summary judgment should be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b59-7\">. The other contentions advanced by the defendants have been considered and found without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
