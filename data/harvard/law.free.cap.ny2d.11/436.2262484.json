Defendants, Robert Fasano and Salvatore Monaco, were tried upon a joint indictment which charged them with murder in the first degree in that they willfully and feloniously shot decedent while <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>acting in concert and each aiding and abetting the other \u201d. The jury found each defendant guilty of murder in the second degree. The Appellate Division, Second Department, unanimously (1) affirmed the judgment of conviction with respect to defendant Fasano, and (2) reversed on the law the judgment convicting defendant Monaco, and ordered a new trial as to him. It is from the judgment and the order of the Appellate Division that the present appeals have been taken by defendant Fasano and the People respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>The relevant facts, which the jury were entitled to find, are briefly as follows: On the night of the homicide, defendants, both members of a teen-age gang known as the \u201c Gremlins \u201d, set out from Fasano\u2019s home with the avowed purpose of \u201c grabbing \u201d a member of the \u201c Ditmas Dukes \u201d, a hostile gang, so that they could \u201c hurt \u201d him, \u201c give him a beating \u201d. There had been trouble culminating in fights or 11 rumbles \u2019 \u2019 between the two gangs since the preceding Summer, and the reason for defendants\u2019 expedition into the \u201c Duke territory \u201d was to avenge a beating which Monaco had received.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">On January 18, 1958 defendants met another member of the Gremlins, John D\u2019Orazio, and asked him whether he had a gun. D\u2019Orazio replied that he did, a .22 caliber rifle, and defendants thereupon told him to <em>\u201c </em>bring it down and cut it down \u201d. After their meeting D\u2019Orazio went home, and the following day cut approximately 9 inches off the stock and 19% inches off the barrel; this left the weapon about 15 inches long. Approximately a week later, D\u2019Orazio placed the rifle under some papers in an ashean outside a bowling alley, which he thereupon entered \u201c bragging around that I had a gun \u201d. When defendant Fasano arrived, unaccompanied by Monaco, D \u2019Orazio stated that he had thrown the gun into the ashean, which gun Fasano retrieved.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Although Monaco was not specifically aware of it at the time, when defendants left Fasano\u2019s home on the night of the homicide the latter had the sawed-off rifle concealed under his jacket, but while they were walking toward 18th and Coney Island Avenues \u2014 the scene of the shooting\u2014Fasano showed Monaco the gun. According to defendants\u2019 statements to the police and the District Attorney, which were not denied and were admitted in evidence without objection, it was their intention to \u201c grab a Duke, show him the gun and give him a beating \u2019 \u2019.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">When defendants neared the intersection of Coney Island and 18th Avenues, they saw three cars with Dukes in them and thereupon concealed themselves in a nearby alleyway. The cars drove off; one owned by Adam Gragnani passed the alleyway in which defendants remained hidden. Monaco stated that it was at about this time that Fasano loaded the rifle; he <em>knew </em>that Fasano had \u2018 \u2018 put the shell in there \u2019 \u2019.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">Decedent, together with James Autunnale, William Clifford and Nicholas Benvenuto, all members of the Dukes, was in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>Gragnani\u2019s automobile. According to Gragnani, two other cars containing Dukes were parked at the corner. He testified that they were \u201c looking to get \u201d members of the Gremlins because they had received threatening telephone calls from the latter, and because \u2018 \u2018 they were down to our candy store a week before chasing our cars \u201d. On the way to the Prospect Park neighborhood where the Gremlins congregated, the three cars separated.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Nicholas Benvenuto testified that he had accompanied decedent and the others in Gragnani\u2019s car to 15th Avenue, the Gremlin\u2019s territory, in order to try to prevent a fight between the two gangs. He also stated there had been a \u201c bat [sawed-off pool cue], chain, regular junk \u201d in the car, but that it had been thrown out of the car on the way back to 18th Avenue. William Clifford testified that the purpose of their drive was to see one \u201c Dennis the Menace \u201d, who was to tell the Gremlins that the Ditmas Dulces did not want to have any more fighting. Clifford saw no weapons in the car. James Autunnale corroborated Clifford\u2019s version of their ride.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">After they had spoken to Dennis, decedent and the other boys returned to their own neighborhood. Gragnani parked his car on the east side of Coney Island Avenue diagonally across from Lord\u2019s Luncheonette located on the northwest corner of Coney Island and 18th Avenues. Decedent and some of the others left the car first and started toward the corner intending to cross over to Lord\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">As they approached the corner, defendants, who had observed them from their vantage point in the alleyway, charged out of the alley, ran east on 18th Avenue past the luncheonette, crossed Coney Island Avenue, and, when about three feet away from decedent, Fasano took the gun from his jacket and fired the fatal shot. Defendants then ran from the scene and went to Prospect Park Lake, into which they threw the gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">Mortally wounded, decedent, holding his side, started to run back toward the car in an attempt to escape from defendants ; he was assisted by some of the other boys but collapsed on the sidewalk a short distance away. An autopsy performed the next day revealed that death was caused by a .22 caliber rifle bullet which entered decedent\u2019s left chest near the armpit.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">Two teen-age girls, Merrily Jones and Ellen O\u2019Brien, were standing on the corner in front of Lord\u2019s Luncheonette when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>the defendants ran past them on their way toward decedent. Each identified Fasano as the one who fired the shot. Merrily Jones testified that at the time of the shooting Monaco stood a little behind Fasano; that she did not see decedent do anything, and that there were no other persons behind defendants at that moment. She also said that while in the candy store that afternoon she overheard decedent state that someone wanted to fight them, but that he did not want to have anything to do with it. Ellen O\u2019Brien also testified that there were no boys running after defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Defendants were arrested at about 11:00 p.m. on the night of the homicide and, after approximately two hours of questioning, Fasano related how they had gone out that evening to beat up a Duke, and admitted he had shot the decedent. Monaco was then brought into the room and Fasano told him, \u201c Sal, I told him the whole story. Now you tell him it \u201d. Fasano reiterated his statement in the presence of Monaco, which the latter confirmed, admitting that Fasano had shown him the gun on the way to the location. Defendants were kept at the police station until daylight, when they accompanied the officers to the lake to search for the rifle; it was never recovered. Defendants do not claim that they were deprived of food, maltreated or coerced into making the inculpatory statements, which, as noted, were admitted in evidence without objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">Defendants did not take the stand or call any witness on their behalf. Their defense was that they had gone out merely for the purpose of beating up a Duke, that Fasano carried the gun merely to scare their victim, that they never intended to kill anyone, and that it was not until they were confronted by a large number of armed, hostile Dukes that Fasano became frightened and shot in self-defense. Monaco additionally contended that he was unaware that Fasano was going to shoot the rifle, and that he at no time aided or abetted the latter in the killing.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">Defendants\u2019 assertion that they were <em>\u201c </em>cornered \u201d or surrounded was disputed by the testimony of Merrily Jones and Ellen O\u2019Brien\u2014both \"of whom stated that there was no one behind defendants \u2014 as well as by G-ragnani and Clifford. The witness Gragnani did say that he saw decedent with a sawed-off pool cue in his hand <em>after </em>someone yelled <em>\u201c </em>He\u2019s got a Roscoe \u201d, but this was denied by Benvenuto, Clifford and Autunnale. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>Moreover, from defendants\u2019 own statements the jury could have concluded that <em>they </em>rather than the Dukes were the aggressors. Fasano stated: <em>\u201c </em>We started towards them figuring on giving them a scare and running them off. We started running toward them * * Similarly, Monaco stated <em>\u201c </em>we figured before they chased us we would run at them. And we ran at them * * #</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">A further indication of defendants\u2019 aggressive intent at the time of the killing is found in the testimony of John Mills, also a member of the Ditmas Dukes. Shortly before the shooting, defendants ran toward Mills, who saw Fasano put his hand inside his jacket and pull out \u201c what looked like a bulky gun \u201d. Mills ran away from defendants who were chasing him, Fasano shouting \u201c Get that Duke * *</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">The narrow question presented by the People\u2019s appeal \u2014 the only ground for the Appellate Division\u2019s reversal of the Monaco conviction \u2014 is whether the Trial Judge committed reversible error when he declined to amplify his main charge (to which no exception was taken) by charging, at defendant\u2019s request, that if the <em>1 \u2018 </em>jury have a reasonable doubt as to whether Monaco was a principal, as you [the court] have described it, they must acquit Monaco \u201d. The Trial Judge was of the opinion that \u201c that subject matter has already been covered in my main charge \u201d. The Appellate Division, however, held this to be error, stating: \u201c Nowhere in the main charge had the court given the instruction requested.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">Our reading of this record leads us to a different conclusion. The Trial Judge did more than merely recite <em>\u201c </em>general instructions \u201d to the effect that guilt must be established beyond a reasonable doubt; indeed, he charged in substance, if not in the exact language, the defendant\u2019s request, and in our view it was not reversible error for him to decline to amplify his charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">During the course of his main charge, the Trial Judge instructed the jury on at least ten occasions that the burden was upon the prosecution to establish defendants\u2019 guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and if they entertained such a doubt they must acquit. More specifically, however, he instructed them that the prosecution \u201c must establish each and every essential ingredient or element of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt \u201d. At the conclusion of his instruction with respect to the element <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>of \u20181 intent to kill \u2019 \u2019, the court noted that it was \u20181 the contention of the prosecution that the defendants, acting in concert, aiding and abetting each other in the commission of the crime with which they are charged, wilfully, feloniously and with malice aforethought shot [the decedent] * *</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">The court then went on to \u201c discuss what the legal import of the phraseology \u2018 acting in concert \u2019 is \u201d, and read to the jury the definition of a \u201c principal \u201d as contained in section 2 of the Penal Law. After restating that definition so that the jury would be sure to understand it, the court charged them: \u201c <em>If you find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendants were engaged in a common purpose or design, </em>and while so mutually engaged, whether by express or implied understanding, then anything done or said by any of them, intended to effectuate their common purpose or design, is binding upon and attributable to all of the parties to the common enterprise \u201d (emphasis supplied). The jury were thus in effect instructed that they could not deem the acts of Pasano binding upon Monaco unless they found, beyond a reasonable doubt, that at the time <em>\u201c </em>the defendants were engaged in a common purpose or design \u2019 \\</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">The court also charged the jury that it was their duty to return a separate verdict as to each defendant, and if they entertained a reasonable doubt \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>regarding the guilt of either or any of the defendants on trial, your duty will be to acquit the defendant concerning whom you entertain such reasonable doubt and to convict the defendant concerning whose guilt you entertain no reasonable doubt \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">The instructions with respect to the prosecution\u2019s contention that defendants were \u201c acting in concert \u201d and the court\u2019s discussion of what that phrase meant, including the statutory definition of a \u201c principal \u201d, were subsequently reread to the jury at their request after they had been deliberating for approximately five hours. There can thus be no question but that the jury was properly instructed and recognized the importance of passing upon the question of whether Monaco was <em>\u201c </em>acting in concert \u2019 \u2019 and aiding and abetting Pasano at the times in question, and as to the consequence of their finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">Furthermore, defense counsel in his summation placed great emphasis upon the point that the jury must find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendant Monaco did in fact \u2018 \u2018 aid and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>abet \u201d Fasano. He repeatedly told the jury that there was not <em>11 </em>one iota of testimony that Monaco, as the indictment alleges, aided and abetted Fasano in firing that shot \u201d, and\u2014addressing himself to the law as he understood it \u2014 they must find that, beyond a reasonable doubt, in order to convict Monaco. The prosecutor also discussed Monaco\u2019s alleged aiding and abetting of Fasano, and the court instructed the jury to consider and \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>weigh carefully \u2019 \u2019 the arguments of counsel. Thus, with the issue so clearly presented to the jury, the court\u2019s refusal to amplify his charge \u2014 on the ground that he had already covered the requested instruction\u2014may not be held to constitute reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">We turn now to defendant Fasano\u2019s appeal. Under the court\u2019s charge, to which no exception was taken, the jury were presented with a question of fact which by their verdict they resolved against defendant. The Appellate Division unanimously affirmed, and from the above recital of the facts it is evident that the record contains ample evidence in support of the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">We find no validity in the contention that it was error for the court to admit the testimony of John Mills with respect to defendants\u2019 attempt to assault him shortly before the shooting of Cuomo. The challenged evidence was admissible under the rule of <em>People </em>v. <em>Molineux </em>(168 N. Y. 264, 293, 305-306) to establish the defendants\u2019 intent and common scheme or plan to assault any member of the Dukes to avenge the assault upon Monaco (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Lieberman, </em>3 N Y 2d 649).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">Defendant Fasano\u2019s final contention is that the court erred in refusing to permit the defense to inspect the prior statements and Grand Jury testimony of the People\u2019s principal witnesses, Merrily Jones, Ellen O\u2019Brien, D\u2019Orazio, Benvenuto and Clifford. Defense counsel requested the District Attorney to submit any statements taken from the witness, as well as the Grand Jury testimony, to the court \u201c for your Honor to determine whether under the law I may be permitted to see it \u201d. The applicable law then was the rule of <em>People </em>v. <em>Walsh </em>(262 N. Y. 140). In compliance therewith, the prosecutor submitted the statements and testimony to the court except as to Clifford; after the court informed defense counsel that he had read the material submitted, defense counsel stated: \u201c Very well. Might I ask that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>they be marked for identification.\u201d They were so marked, and no further request was made with respect thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">Upon these facts the Appellate Division rejected defendant\u2019s contention that the trial court committed prejudicial error under the rule of <em>People </em>v. <em>Rosario </em>(9 N Y 2d 286).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">We have compared the statements and Grand Jury testimony with the witnesses\u2019 trial testimony and found no serious discrepancies or inconsistencies. The court\u2019s failure to turn over this material to defense counsel was, therefore, not prejudicial error with respect to this <em>pre-Rosario </em>trial <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hernandez, </em>10 N Y 2d 774, 776; <em>People </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>10 N Y 2d 839; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hurst, </em>10 N Y 2d 939; <em>People </em>v. <em>Pereira, </em>11 N Y 2d 784).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">The situation with respect to the witness Clifford is somewhat different. It does not appear that the court was presented with his prior statement and Grand Jury testimony; it made no ruling with respect thereto and these documents were not marked for identification. Defense counsel never renewed his request. Nevertheless the Appellate Division was of the opinion that error <em>\u201c </em>was committed, even under these circumstances \u201d when the court failed to turn over the items to defense counsel, but concluded <em>11 </em>there was no rational possibility in view of the overwhelming evidence of defendant Fasano\u2019s guilt, that as to him the jury would have reached a different verdict if his counsel had been allowed the use of such prior statements (Code Crim. Pro., \u00a7 542).\u201d We agree with the Appellate Division that, even assuming error, it was not sufficiently substantial to warrant a reversal of defendant\u2019s conviction, especially since the witness\u2019 prior statements do not exculpate Fasano.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">Accordingly, on the appeal by the People, the order appealed from should be reversed and the case remitted to the Appellate Division pursuant to section 543-b of the Code of Criminal Procedure so that it may pass upon the facts; on the appeal by defendant Fasano, the judgment appealed from should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">Chief Judge Desmond and Judges Dye, Fuld, Van Vookhis, Burke and Foster, concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-10\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Fasano: </em>Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-11\">In <em>People </em>v. Monaco: Order reversed and case remitted to the Appellate Division to pass upon questions of fact (Code Crim. Pro., \u00a7 543-b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
