Shumate </em>for respondents.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AlH\">The decision of this court in the <em>Kilberg </em>case (9 N Y 2d 34) does not support plaintiffs \u2019 contention that they are entitled to interest on the verdicts from the date of death of decedents and the learned Trial Court was in error in allowing such interest.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b433-5\">Dye, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Agb\">Section 132 of our Decedent Estate Law provides that, \u201c When final judgment for the plaintiff is rendered \u201d in a wrongful death action, \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>the clerk must add to the sum so awarded, interest thereupon from the decedent\u2019s death, and include it in the judgment \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">The issue presented on this appeal is whether that provision applies to an action brought in New York but based on a wrong committed elsewhere, in other words, whether the addition of prejudgment interest is to be governed by <em>lexi fori </em>or by <em>lex loci delictus. </em>The deaths in this case resulted from an automobile collision which occurred in Maryland; the decedents were residents of New York. Neither Maryland\u2019s wrongful death statute nor that State\u2019s case law authorizes the addition of prejudgment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">These actions resulted in a verdict and judgment for plaintiffs, which judgment was subsequently amended, on motion, to include interest from the date of death, on the authority of <em>Kilberg </em>v. <em>Northeast Airlines </em>(9 N Y 2d 34). Upon appeal, the Appellate Division unanimously modified the judgment by striking the addition of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">The overwhelming weight of authority, recognizing that \u20181 the question of the proper measure of damages is inseparably connected with the right of action \u201d <em>(Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>241 U. S. 485, 491), has long held that the measure of damages for a tort is to be treated as a matter of substance, governed by the law of the place where the wrong occurred (see Leflar, Conflict of Laws, \u00a7 65; 2 Beale, Conflict of Laws, \u00a7 412.2; Goodrich, Conflict of Laws [3d ed.], \u00a7 91, p. 254; 2 Rabel, Conflict of Laws: A Comparative Study [2d ed.], ch. 25, pp. 276-277). This has been particularly true in the area of wrongful death actions. Such actions did not exist at common law; they are creatures of statute (see <em>Debevoise </em>v. <em>New York, L. E. &amp; W. R. R. Co., </em>98 N. Y. 377). Therefore, as we said on another occasion, \u201cBight and remedy coalesced \u201d and are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>\u201c united \u201d <em>(Matter of Berkowitz </em>v. <em>Arbib &amp; Houlberg, </em>230 N. Y. 261, 272).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">In New York, the prejudgment interest in a wrongful death action is \u201cpart of the damages\u201d <em>(Cleghorn </em>v. <em>Ocean Acc. &amp; Guar. Corp., </em>244 N. Y. 166, 167), the addition of which is governed by recourse to the usual conflicts of law rules, which we have consistently applied by not adding interest to the judgment unless <em>lex loci delictus </em>authorizes such an addition <em>(Murmann </em>v. <em>New York, N. H. &amp; H. R. R. Co., </em>258 N. Y. 447; <em>Monkwall </em>v. <em>Turbine Eng. Corp., </em>276 App. Div. 866, affd. 301 N. Y. 521; <em>Colliton </em>v. <em>United Shipyards, </em>256 App. Div. 923, affd. 281 N. Y. 582; <em>Wyman </em>v. <em>Pan American Airways, </em>181 Misc. 963, affd. 267 App. Div. 947, <em>affd. 293 </em>N. Y. 878; <em>Frounfelker </em>v. <em>Delaware, L. &amp; W. R. R. Co., </em>73 App. Div. 350; <em>Kiefer </em>v. <em>Grand Trunk Ry. Co., </em>12 App. Div. 28, affd. on opinion below 153 N. Y. 688). The Federal courts, operating under the doctrine of <em>Klaxon Co. </em>v. <em>Stentor Elec. Mfg. Co. </em>(313 U. S. 487), have followed suit <em>(Frasier </em>v. <em>Public Serv. Interstate Transp. Co., </em>254 F. 2d 132 [2d Cir.]; <em>Maynard </em>v. <em>Eastern Air Lines, </em>178 F. 2d 139 [2d Cir.]; <em>St. Clair </em>v. <em>Eastern Air Lines, </em>194 F. Supp. 623; <em>[post-Kilberg]).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">Whether we now refuse to apply our prejudgment interest statute because, as we said in the <em>Murmann </em>case, \u2018 \u2018 The Legislature had no intention to make it reach so far \u201d (258 N. Y. 447, 450, <em>supra) </em>or whether we refuse to do so because our statutory provision authorizing the addition of such interest, like the provision creating the cause of action for wrongful death, \u201c constitute [s] a part of the substantive law of the State \u201d <em>(Kiefer </em>v. <em>Grand Trunk Ry. Co., </em>12 App. Div. 28, 32, <em>supra, </em>affd. on opinion below 153 N. Y. 688), the meaning and effect are the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">Plaintiffs contend, however, that <em>Kilberg </em>has changed all this. We there indicated that the courts of this State were free to award damages in excess of the amount limited by a foreign death statute under which the action was brought since \u201cNew York\u2019s public policy prohibiting the imposition of limits on such damages is strong, clear and old. <em>* * </em>* (N. Y. Const., art. I, \u00a7 16; N. Y. Const. [1894], art. I, \u00a7 18) \u201d (9 N Y 2d 34, 39, <em>supra). </em>Recognizing \u2018 \u2018 The absurdity and injustice \u2019 \u2019 <em>(id., </em>p. 40) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>of such limitations, we announced that we would no longer recognize them.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">Plaintiffs point to language in the <em>Kilberg </em>opinion to the effect that \u201cIt is open to us <em>* </em>* * to treat the measure ? of damages in this case as being a procedural or remedial question controlled by our own State policies \u201d (9 N Y 2d 34, 41-42, <em>supra). </em>Concededly, there is other such language to be found in the opinion. In <em>Kilberg </em>the court was confronted with a question of State public policy requiring decision. <em>Kilberg </em>and <em>Wooden </em>v. <em>Western N. Y. &amp; Pa. R. R. Co. </em>(126 N. Y. 10), which we followed in <em>Kilberg, </em>must be held merely to express this State\u2019s strong policy with respect to <em>limitations </em>in wrongful death actions. It is of particular significance that (as was pointed out in <em>Loucks </em>v. <em>Standard Oil Co., </em>224 N. Y. 99,109) the <em>Kiefer </em>case came to us after the decision in <em>Wooden </em>(as did the other interest cases) and, by affirming on the opinion in the Appellate Division, \u201c we held that interest had relation to the substance of the right, and must be governed by the foreign statute \u201d (224 N. Y. 99,109, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">Consistent with the authorities is the very practical consideration that, if we hold the award of prejudgment interest to be procedural rather than substantive, a New York resident who is compelled to resort to the courts of another State to enforce an action for wrongful death occurring in this State will not be entitled to prejudgment interest, since other States either have no statutory authorization for prejudgment interest (and there are a number of those) or else characterize it as substantive and therefore not applicable to foreign causes of action. We therefore hold, as we did in <em>Murmann </em>v. <em>New York, N. H. &amp; H. R. R. Co. </em>(258 N. Y. 447, 450, <em>supra), </em>that section 132 of the Decedent Estate Law must be read with sections 130 and 131, and cannot be severed therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">The judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b435-10\">Chief Judge Desmond (concurring).</author>\n<p id=\"ATn\">I concur in the result only, since much of the discussion in the majority opinion is inconsistent with our stated grounds for decision in <em>Kilberg </em>v. <em>Northeast Airlines </em>(9 N Y 2d 34). The result here is correct, however, since there is no New York public policy or other bar to our following Maryland\u2019s law as to interest on a recovery for a wrongful death in Maryland.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b436-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>Froessel, J. (dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"ADV\">I do not see how we can affirm here in the light of <em>Kilberg </em>v. <em>Northeast Airlines </em>(9 N Y 2d 34). Section 132 of the Decedent Estate Law, implementing section 16 of article I of our State Constitution, expressly provides that as to a final judgment in a death action \u2018 \u2018 the clerk must add to the sum so awarded, interest thereupon from the decedent\u2019s death, and include it in the judgment\u201d. We have held that this statute \u201c requires addition to the verdict <em>as part of the damages </em>of interest from date of death to verdict \u201d (emphasis supplied). <em>(Cleghorn </em>v. <em>Ocean Acc. &amp; Guar. Corp., </em>244 N. Y. 166, 167; see, also, <em>Welsh </em>v. <em>Peerless Cas. Co., </em>8 A D 2d 373, 376, affd. 8 N Y 2d 745.) And in <em>Kiefer </em>v. <em>Grand Trunk Ry. Co. </em>(12 App. Div. 28, 32, affd. on opinion below 153 N. Y. 688), it was held: \u201c The right to interest is inseparable from the right to damages \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Inasmuch as the majority of this court in <em>Kilberg (supra, </em>pp. 41-42) decided that it is open to us, \u201cparticularly in view of our own strong public policy as to death action damages, to treat the measure of damages in this case as being a procedural or remedial question controlled by our own State policies \u201d, and that despite the limitations contained in the Massachusetts wrongful death statute (Gen. Stats, of Mass., ch. 229, \u00a7 2), such action may be enforced in this State \u201c without regard to the $15,000 limit \u2019 \u2019, logic and reason dictate that interest, an inseparable part of the damages, was properly allowed here by the Trial Judge. I would, therefore, modify the judgment of the Appellate Division by reinstating the amended judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">Judges Ftjld, Van Voorhis, Burke and Foster concur with Judge Dye; Chief Judge Desmond concurs in a separate memorandum; Judge Froessel dissents in a separate opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
