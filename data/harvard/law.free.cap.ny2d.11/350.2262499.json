Atamanchuk\u2019s explanation for his claimed ability to identify a voice on three of the recordings as Day\u2019s was incredible, as a matter of law, and those telephone conversations should therefore not have been received in evidence against Day because of the absence of \u201cfoundation\u201d testimony. <em>(Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kumitis, </em>167 Pa.

Refusal to permit Dinan and Bricker to be represented by other counsel, who was ready to proceed, deprived them of counsel of their own choosing; requiring Day\u2019s counsel, over his objection, to continue to represent Dinan, Bricker and Castellucci, deprived Day of his right to effective counsel. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>137 F. 2d 1006; <em>People </em>v. <em>Silverman, </em>3 N Y 2d 200; <em>Glasser </em>v. <em>United States, </em>315 U.

The other points raised do not require discussion. They have been examined carefully and resolved in favor of respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">In many criminal prosecutions evidence obtained by wire tapping authorized by orders granted under the New York State Constitution (art. I, \u00a7 12) and Code of Criminal Procedure (\u00a7 813-a) has been introduced in criminal trials in New York State courts. In 1928 the United States Supreme Court held that the tapping of telephone wires is not in violation of the Fourth Amendment protecting against unreasonable searches and seizures <em>(Olmstead </em>v. <em>United States, 277 </em>U. S. 438, 465). In the opinion it was said: \u201c Congress may of course protect the secrecy of telephone messages by making them, when intercepted, inadmissible in evidence in federal criminal trials, by direct legislation, and thus depart from the common law of evidence. But the courts may not adopt such a policy by attributing an enlarged and unusual meaning to the Fourth Amendment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">Six years later, in June, 1934, section 605 of the Federal Communications Act was enacted in response to this suggestion. Section 605 was held to render wire-tap evidence inadmissible in the Federal courts in <em>Nardone </em>v. <em>United States </em>(302 U. S. 379) but to permit their introduction into evidence in trials in State courts <em>(Schwartz </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>344 U. S. 199). That was the condition of the law when the United States Supreme Court was called upon in 1957 to decide <em>Benanti </em>v. <em>United States </em>(355 U. S. 96) which reaffirmed the doctrines enunciated in both <em>Nardone </em>v. <em>United States </em>and <em>Schwartz </em>v. <em>Texas. </em>The opinion in <em>Benanti, </em>by Chief Justice Warren (p. 101), says concerning <em>Schwarts:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>\u00a3 \u00a3 The rationale of that case is that despite the plain prohibition of Section 605 [Federal Communications Act], due regard to federal-state relations precluded the conclusion that Congress intended to thwart a state rule of evidence in the absence of a clear indication to that effect.\u201d The <em>Schwartz </em>case was a wiretapping-case. The Supreme Court indicated in it that section 605 of the Federal Communications Act is violated by the procedure for obtaining wire taps prescribed by the New York Constitution and statutes, but made clear that such violations of this Federal statute are not sufficient to justify preventing the States from receiving such evidence in trials in State courts. The Federal statute itself contains no language forbidding the admission of such evidence in any courts. <em>Benanti, Nardone </em>and <em>Schwartz </em>held the means of obtaining such evidence to be illegal, but ruled that it was a question of policy of the forum whether the enforcement of section 605 of the Federal Communications Act should be implemented by imposing an exclusionary rule. Wire taps, it should be repeated, do not infringe constitutional immunity against unreasonable searches and seizures <em>(Olmstead </em>v. <em>United States, supra). </em>Exclusion of such testimony was ordained in the United States courts as a policy measure to aid in the enforcement of section 605.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">A contrary policy has been adopted in New York State <em>(People </em>v. <em>Variano, </em>5 N Y 2d 391; <em>People </em>v. <em>Dinan, </em>7 A D 2d 119, 6 N Y 2d 715), pursuant to the power reserved in the States by <em>Schwartz </em>v. <em>Texas (supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">Appellants argue that the decision in <em>Mapp </em>v. <em>Ohio </em>(367 U. S. 643), in 1961, deprived the States of the power reserved to them in <em>Schwartz </em>v. <em>Texas (supra) </em>to give effect to their own public policies in this regard. It is said that <em>Mapp </em>v. <em>Ohio </em>overruled <em>Schwartz </em>v. <em>Texas </em>by reading the exclusionary rule into section 605 of the Federal Communications Act, as, by analogy, it was read by <em>Mapp </em>into the Fourth Amendment, which was held to have been mandated on the States (in this respect) by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">The identical result does not necessarily follow in case of divulging telephone conversations in violation of section 605 of the Federal Communications Act, inasmuch as a statute may not possess the sanction of a constitutional inhibition pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>tecting against fundamental rights granting immunity from unreasonable search and seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">There is an indication that the Supreme Court of the United States adopted this distinction in deciding <em>Pugach </em>v. <em>Dollinger </em>(365 U. S. 458) in 1961, several months prior to deciding <em>Mapp </em>v. <em>Ohio {supra). </em>The determination of the Federal Court of Appeals in the Second Circuit (277 F. 2d 739) was affirmed by the Supreme Court in a memorandum decision citing <em>Schwartz </em>v. <em>Texas </em>(344 U. S. 199, <em>supra) </em>and <em>Stefanelli </em>v. <em>Minard </em>(342 U. S. 117). The <em>Pugach </em>case involved a Federal injunction sought against proceedings in a State court, to be sure, and <em>Stefanelli </em>v. <em>Minaret </em>held that the Federal courts would not ordinarily restrain the State courts from receiving illegally obtained evidence in advance of trial. <em>Pugach </em>could have been decided exclusively on that theory, as Justice Brennan pointed out in his concurring memorandum by voting to affirm on the authority of <em>Stefanelli </em>alone. But in the face of that the majority affirmed both on that theory and on the rationale of <em>Schwartz </em>v. <em>Texas. </em>We thus have a clear and authoritative decision by the Supreme Court, on the eve of <em>Mapp </em>v. Ohio, reaffirming the <em>Schwarts </em>doctrine that State-obtained wire taps may be admitted into evidence in criminal trials in State courts notwithstanding section 605 of the Federal Communications Act. Is it, then, to be assumed, that the Supreme Court in <em>Mapp </em>meant to overrule <em>Pugach </em>without citing it insofar as <em>Pugach </em>reaffirmed <em>Schwarts, </em>or was the intention of the Supreme Court in deciding <em>Mapp </em>v. <em>Ohio </em>to limit its application to situations where evidence has been obtained unconstitutionally by unreasonable search and seizure (which wire taps are not) without intending to render inadmissible in State courts all illegally obtained evidence where the Constitution has not been violated but only a Federal statute or rule? So, at least, the Second Circuit seems to have thought in <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Ball </em>(294 F. 2d 94, 96) where that court stated: \u201c We do not read Mapp v. Ohio, 1961, 367 U. S. 643, * * * as overruling sub silentio Schwartz v. Texas \u2014 on which six Justices had expressly relied, only four months earlier, in the per curiam affirmance, 1961, 365 U. S. 458, * * * of our decision in Pugach v. Dollinger, 2 Cir., 1960, 277 F. 2d 739.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">It needs to be borne in mind that nothing in the Fourth Amendment or section 605 of the Federal Communications Act expressly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>renders any evidence inadmissible. The exclusionary rule of <em>Weeks </em>v. <em>United States </em>(232 U. S. 383) was adopted for the Federal courts not because it was thought at the time that the Fourth Amendment required it, but for the reason that the Supreme Court considered it to be the most effective means of enforcing the constitutional prohibition against unreasonable search and seizure. This was recognized in <em>Wolf </em>v. <em>Colorado </em>(338 U. S. 25) as the basis for allowing the State courts to receive unconstitutionally obtained evidence. Neither does section 605 of the Federal Communications Act contain language precluding evidence obtained in violation thereof. For reasons of high governmental policy, the exclusionary rule has been deemed in <em>Mapp </em>to be binding on the States to aid in the enforcement of the fundamental law. <em>Pugach </em>indicates that the same sanction may not be applied to the enforcement of a Federal statute or rule (cf. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Ball, supra; Bolger </em>v. <em>Cleary, </em>293 F. 2d 368). Unless and until the Supreme Court decides otherwise we shall follow our prior decisions in <em>People </em>v. <em>Variano (supra); People </em>v. <em>Dinan (supra), </em>and the Federal Court of Appeals in the Second Circuit in <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Ball (supra).</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b396-6\"> <em>Nardone </em>and <em>Benanti </em>were decided as a matter of Federal policy rather than directly in pursuance of the command of the statute. Not without significance is the analogy with <em>McNabb </em>v. <em>United States </em>(318 U. S. 332) and <em>Mallory </em>v. <em>United States </em>(354 U. S. 449), where it was held \u2014 without basing the ruling on the Constitution \u2014 that confessions were inadmissible in Federal court if obtained during an interval while a defendant was being held without prompt arraignment. Since this rule was not based on any constitutional mandate, it was held not to constrain the State courts <em>(Gallegos </em>v. <em>Nebraska, </em>342 U. S. 55). Of course the confession would be inadmissible in the State courts if it were coerced in violation of the constitutional inhibition arising from due process of law.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b396-5\">Fuld, J. (dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"AEK\">There can no longer be any doubt that section 605 of the Federal Communications Act is violated when a person\u2014whether private individual or law enforcement official\u2014taps telephone wires and discloses the contents of intercepted communications. (See <em>Benanti </em>v. <em>United States, </em>355 U. S. 96, 105-106, n. 19; <em>Pugach </em>v. <em>Dollinger, </em>277 F. 2d 739, affd. 365 U. S. 458.) Consequently, whether or not the decision in <em>Mapp </em>v. <em>Ohio </em>(367 U. S. 643) actually compels State courts to exclude evidence obtained in deliberate contravention of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>Federal statute, we should forthrightly hold, despite prior decisions (see, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Variano, </em>5 N Y 2d 391), that its use in the courts of New York is barred as a matter of New York law.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">We have here the unusual circumstance that it is the very introduction of the wire-tapping evidence in open court, the very disclosure of the intercepted communication to the jury, which violates the Federal statute and constitutes the Federal crime. (See <em>Benanti </em>v. <em>United States, </em>355 U. S. 96, 100, <em>supra.) </em>At the very least, \u201c the imperative of judicial integrity \u201d <em>(Elkins </em>v. <em>United States, </em>364 U. S. 206, 222) commands exclusion of such evidence. Not alone the purposes of the exclusionary rule \u2014 deterring law enforcement officials from violating the law they are sworn to uphold and engendering respect for constitutional guarantee and statutory mandate\u2014but, even more important, the necessity to avoid commission of a criminal act within the very room where the trial is being held demand that evidence obtained in violation of the Federal Communications Act be ruled inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">The circumstance that adoption of a rule excluding such testimony may, as I noted, in a somewhat different context, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Lane </em>(10 N Y 2d 347, 357, concurring opinion), <em>\u20181 </em>make it more difficult for police or prosecutors to gain convictions does not warrant its rejection. What is significant and decisive is that \u2018 the imperative of judicial integrity \u2019 demands that the court should give sanction neither to illegal enforcement of the criminal law nor to the corrosive doctrine that the end justifies the means.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">I would reverse the judgments appealed from and direct a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">Judges Dye, Froessel and Foster concur with Judge Van Voorhis; Judge Fuld dissents in an opinion in which Chief Judge Desmond and Judge Burke concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">Judgments affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
