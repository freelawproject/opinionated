It is the contention of the plaintiff that the 1930 lease from the Water Street Company to the same tenant was a lease of \u201cadditional space ... in said building\u201d within the meaning of the 1927 contract. The judge found for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">When the first lease was made in 1927, the building therein described was a large office building fourteen stories high facing Post Office Square and also bounding on Milk and Kilby streets, but not extending to Water Street. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>appears to have been constructed in two large blocks or \u201cbays\u201d which were built together to the height of the first two or three stories, but above that were in part separated by a light and air space under which was located the main entrance. It was then, and so far as appears still is, owned by the defendant Post Office Square Company. In 1929 the Water Street Company was organized. Having acquired title to the land between the original building and Water Street, the new corporation began in 1930 the erection of a new structure thereon under an elaborate written agreement with the Post Office Square Company which regulated the manner of erecting the new building, its connection with the original structure of the defendant, including the making of openings for corridors from one structure to the other, the connection of services for water, steam and electricity, rights of way and similar matters. The new structure bounded on Post Office Square, Water and Kilby streets. It adjoined the old building and was similar to it in height, in design and in general as to materials and construction. The upper floors were separated from the old building by a light and air space similar to the one between the two \u201cbays\u201d of the original building. The new building when completed formed a third block or \u201cbay\u201d of about the same width as each of the two original blocks or \u201cbays\u201d and was in general similar to them in appearance. The space described in the 1930 lease was in the new block which was owned by the Water Street Company and not by the defendant and which at that \u2022 time was not yet completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-3\">Without stating the evidence in detail, we assume that the judge could have found that after the completion of the new block, all three blocks taken together would appear to constitute and could be properly described as one building with a public entrance at 10 Post Office Square. But the meaning of the agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant made in 1927 must be ascertained in the light of conditions existing or contemplated by the parties at the time when that agreement was made, and not as if the same words had been used under conditions existing in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>1930. <em>C. H. Batchelder &amp; Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Batchelder, </em>220 Mass. 42, 45. The words \u201csaid building\u201d in the lease of 1927 could only refer to the building composed of the two blocks which were then in existence. Those words could not have included a new third block not shown to have been in contemplation by anybody in 1927, but erected three years later by a different owner. The erection of the new block was not such an incidental or minor alteration as might be held to have been anticipated when the agreement was made. It was an entirely new structure on additional land of approximately half the size of the original building. By the 1927 agreement the defendant bound itself to pay the plaintiff commissions in respect of new space thereafter taken by the plaintiff\u2019s customers in the defendant\u2019s existing building, but it did not bind itself to pay in respect of space taken in the new structure which was afterwards erected by the Water Street Company. The scope of its engagement was not enlarged by subsequent events.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Our conclusion remains the same even though, as contended by the plaintiff, the Water Street Company \u201cwas organized by interests affiliated with the defendant,\u201d and even though the two parts may now be operated as one building under, the same management.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">As we think there was no evidence which would have supported a finding for the plaintiff, it is not necessary to deal with the plaintiff\u2019s requests for rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
