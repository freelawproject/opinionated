He must show this by evidence of acts or of physical facts and not merely by the accumulation of adjectives and adverbs denoting violence. <em>Work </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>207 Mass. 447. The same burden rests upon a passenger in a motor bus. <em>Dorman </em>v. <em>Worcester Consolidated Street Railway, </em>277 Mass. 95. See <em>McRae </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>276 Mass. 82, 84.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Beyond the principle just stated, the question becomes one of degree in each case, and it is impossible to lay down any rule of general application. Not a few cases are so close that opinions may well differ. This is one of them. However, we think the evidence went beyond the mere characterization of the alleged jerk as \u201csharp and quick,\u201d and that the testimony as to the effect upon other passengers, the loss of the plaintiff\u2019s grip upon the seat and the extent of her injuries, taken together, is enough to support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>the finding. The case seems to us stronger for the plaintiff than <em>Phinney </em>v. <em>Eastern Massachusetts Street Railway, 285 </em>Mass. 207, cited by the defendant, and at least as strong as <em>McRae </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>276 Mass. 82, cited by the plaintiff. Other relevant cases are <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>207 Mass. 551, <em>Warren </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>259 Mass. 226, <em>Weiner </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>262 Mass. 539, <em>Seidenberg </em>v. <em>Eastern Massachusetts Street Railway, </em>266 Mass. 540, <em>Pickard </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>267 Mass. 133, <em>Hallinan </em>v. <em>Worcester Consolidated Street Railway, </em>273 Mass. 27, and <em>Revsbech </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>275 Mass. 317.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-3\">\n<em>Order of Appellate Division dismissing report affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
