There was no evidence as to the exact location of the street boundary, but from repeated references to \u201cthe sidewalk\u201d and to the movements of the plaintiff upon it from the wall of the building to the curbstone and in the absence of anything to control natural inferences, we think the jury were justified in finding that the entire space was open to travellers and that if the front of the building was not itself the property line, the owner had invited the public to use that part of the sidewalk which was on its land. <em>Holmes </em>v. <em>Drew, </em>151 Mass. 578. See <em>Conroy </em>v. <em>Allston Storage Warehouse, Inc. ante, </em>133.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-3\">More difficulty is presented by the positive testimony of the plaintiff himself on cross-examination that when he was struck he was leaning \u201cup against\u201d the vertical rod, but we need not decide whether if this evidence stood alone it would require a ruling that the plaintiff was a trespasser. There was other evidence. Hartigan, called by the plaintiff, testified that he warned the plaintiff that, he was about to raise the awning; that the plaintiff, who had been leaning against the building near the rod, \u201cdid not reply, but stepped forward toward the curbing ... to a point about midway on the sidewalk\u201d; and that Hartigan \u201cthen turned to the awning attachment\u201d and proceeded to raise the awning. The plaintiff was entitled to the benefit of this testimony, although it differed from his own. <em>Whiteacre </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>241 Mass. 163. <em>Horneman </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>286 Mass. 65, 70-71. <em>Jennings </em>v. <em>Bragdon, </em>289 Mass. 595, 597. The jury could believe it unlikely that the plaintiff would leave the side of the building, as Hartigan testified, and then almost immediately return again to the rod as the awning was raised, and therefore they could find that the plaintiff was mistaken when he testified that he was still leaning against the rod when he was struck.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">The jury could find that Hartigan was negligent in causing the bar to fall upon the plaintiff, whose position <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>on the sidewalk he could have observed. And a ruling could not have been made as a matter of law that the plaintiff himself was negligent. Although the plaintiff testified that he knew there was a bar which came down when the awning was folded up, he also testified that he heard nothing and did not know Hartigan was doing anything to the awning until he was hit.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-3\">The defendant appears to have taken a single exception to a part of the charge in which the judge stated certain contentions of the plaintiff and of the defendant, defined the duty owed to a trespasser, laid down a test for determining whether the plaintiff was a trespasser, and defined the duty of the defendant to the plaintiff if the plaintiff was not a trespasser. Seemingly this was the entire charge on the subject of trespass. However that may be, although the defendant\u2019s counsel spoke to the judge about lack of evidence as to location of the property line, there is no specification in the record, and it is not shown affirmatively that there was any at the trial, as to what particular statements or rulings were intended to be made the subject of exception. The case is within the authority of a number of decisions holding that such general exceptions to a charge as a whole or to large segments of a charge without particularization will not be sustained. <em>Boston Conservatory of Music, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dulfer, </em>256 Mass. 262, 266. <em>Callahan </em>v. <em>Fleischman Co. </em>262 Mass. 437. <em>Connelly </em>v. <em>Fellsway Motor Mart, Inc. </em>270 Mass. 386, 391. <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Beacon Oil Co. </em>281 Mass. 108, 110.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
