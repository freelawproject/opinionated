The case originally came before the Industrial Accident Board upon a claim for compensation filed August 13, 1934, in which it is set forth that on May 24, 1934, the claimant was struck by a falling tree in a woodlot and sustained a broken leg. The claim was contested by the insurer on the ground that the claimant was not an employee within the meaning of the workmen\u2019s compensation act; a question as to the average weekly wage also was raised. A hearing was had before a member of the Industrial Accident Board on. September 17, 1934, under the provisions of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 8, and he duly made a report. It was admitted at this hearing \u201cthat on May 24, 1934, the claimant sustained an accident as a result of which he broke his left leg\u201d and was disabled to the date of said hearing because of the injury. On October 4, 1934, the board member filed a decision wherein he found and ruled that the claimant \u201cwas not an employee within the terms of the workmen\u2019s compensation act but was an independent contractor,\u201d and he ordered that the claim for compensation be dismissed. The claimant having filed a claim for review, the reviewing board heard the parties on March 14, 1935, on the questions stated in the report of the single member. The \u201cFindings and Decision\u201d of the reviewing board were filed on April 12, 1935. The board reversed the decision of the single member and found that the claimant was an employee within the meaning of the workmen\u2019s compensation act, and that his average weekly wage was $4.50, and made an award in accordance with said findings. The insurer then certified the case to the Superior Court, and that court on May 9, 1935, entered a decree to the effect \u201cthat the claimant . . . was not an employee of the subscriber, A. K. Turner, within the terms of the workmen\u2019s compensation act at the time of his injury on May 24, 1934, but was an independent contractor,\u201d and ordered \u201cthat the claim for compensation be and is hereby dismissed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">The pertinent facts disclosed by the material evidence reported by the board member to the reviewing board may be summarized as follows: About April 1, 1934, the claimant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>was and had been for a period of four years unemployed by anyone \u201cat anything.\u201d On or about April 1, 1934, he was told by one Skindelis that work would be found on Turner\u2019s (the subscriber\u2019s) woodlot. Skindelis did not ask the claimant \u201cto go up and cut some wood there\u201d and there is no evidence reported to the effect that he had authority so to do. At some time approximately two months before May 24, 1934, he went to the woodlot and \u201cstarted to work cutting wood.\u201d Sometime later Turner came up and found him cutting wood on his (Turner\u2019s) woodlot. Before Turner came to the woodlot the claimant had talked with Skindelis about cutting the wood. They were chopping wood when Turner came and the claimant was putting the wood he chopped with the wood that Skindelis chopped; he had not chopped a cord. He brought with him \u201cto the job two saws, two axes, and two wedges\u201d and he sharpened his axes and saws himself, using a whetstone which he brought along to sharpen tools. When Turner saw the claimant cutting wood, they talked and Turner employed him to cut wood at $1.50 per cord and later he was paid $1.50 per cord.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">The claimant testified that Turner \u201cdid not tell him he had to start to work at . . . any particular time in the morning or that he was to get through at any particular time\u201d; that he could work on this job whenever he wanted to; that nobody told him how to cut the trees; that Turner showed him where to chop and told him to chop any of the trees in that section, to cut all the trees into cord wood in a section indicated; that Turner did not at any time come on the job and tell him to cut a particular tree, and he in no way directed him how he was to do his work; that the only thing Turner told him was that he would have to cut the wood in four-foot lengths and that he would have to cut a cord before he was paid; that he was the only one working in that locality, but others were scattered throughout different sections of the woods; that on May 24, 1934, he and one Stanley Bagdonis were chopping side by side; that the tree was big, and they decided that they were both going to cut it; that at the particular time when he was injured he and Bagdonis were there cutting down this one tree and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>they agreed to cut that tree down, saw it up and cut it up into cord wood and then divide whatever money they received for cutting this particular tree.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">The reviewing board found that, the report of the single member \u201ccontains all the material evidence,\u201d and from such evidence found \u201cthat A. K. Turner was in the wood business, that he employed men to go into the woods and cut wood which he sold to his customers\u201d; that \u201cOn or about the first of April, 1934, he hired one Charles Sluzis to cut wood at $1.50 per cord and said to him, \u2018Here is the lot. You can take a strip right through here\u2019\u201d; \u201cthat the custom [usage] ... is such that the employee furnishes his own tools, works at such time as he sees fit and the weather permits, and is paid by the number of cords he actually cuts\u201d; that \u201cA person qualified to do this type of work needs no special supervision and the employee [claimant] testified in fact \u2018that he knew how long to cut the sticks of wood, that is, four feet long; that he knows how to cut and he has cut wood before\u2019 \u201d; and further found that the employer seldom exercises any control over the work because of this fact. It is to be here noted that the report contains no evidence of the usage of trade as respects the furnishing and care of tools nor any evidence of trade usage whereby, in the particular trade of wood chopping, \u201cThe employer seldom exercises any control over the work.\u201d It is settled law that the court cannot take judicial notice of usages of particular trades, and that the question of the existence or not of claimed usage is a question of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">The board also found \u201cthat A. K. Turner retained the right to direct and control the results to be reached and the means by which it was to be accomplished but no occasion arose in this particular case in which it was necessary to exercise this right\u201d; that \u201cHe retained the right at any time to discharge Sluzis and terminate his employment if he failed to do the work in a manner satisfactory to him or he could have employed other men to cut in the same section, had the demands of his business required it.\u201d There is no evidence in the report to support such a finding of reserved rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>The report purports to state the interview between Turner and the claimant when the contract was made. The claimant and Turner state, in substance, that no other terms were talked over. There is no dispute as to the material facts and circumstances of the hiring, of the work to be done, or of the manner of its performance. The burden of proof was upon the claimant to establish by a fair preponderance of the evidence all material facts necessary to entitle him to compensation benefits. <em>Sponatski\u2019s Case, </em>220 Mass. 526, 528. <em>De Felippo\u2019s Case, </em>245 Mass. 308. <em>Johnson\u2019s Case, </em>279 Mass. 481, 484. One of the essential facts was that the claimant was an employee and not an independent contractor. These facts must be established by evidence and not by conjecture. <em>Gorski\u2019s Case, </em>227 Mass. 456, 459. The facts being undisputed, a question of law is presented which is not limited by any conjectural finding or speculation of the reviewing board. <em>Schofield\u2019s Case, </em>272 Mass. 229. An employee is bound to follow the master\u2019s directions in the execution of the work, if required. A contractor undertakes to do the work, but may do it in his own way, so far as the terms of the contract do not prescribe how it is to be done. <em>McDermott\u2019s Case, </em>283 Mass. 74, 76-77, and cases cited. In the instant case we think the claimant as a matter of law was an independent contractor and not an employee of the subscriber, A. K. Turner. The case at bar is distinguishable from <em>Churchill\u2019s Case, </em>265 Mass. 117, <em>Hill\u2019s Case, </em>268 Mass. 491, and <em>McAllister\u2019s Case, </em>229 Mass. 193, because in each of those cases there were disputed facts requiring the finding of subsidiary facts upon which the board based its findings of the ultimate facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
