L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 263, \u00a7 6. It was presented on agreed facts, which denied to the court any power to draw inferences. <em>Cunningham </em>v. <em>Connecticut Fire Ins. Co. </em>200 Mass. 333. The defendant kept in cans for sale oil known as Previte Brand Olive Oil. Although the label bore the word \u201cblended,\u201d it bore also the words \u201cSuperfine Imported Olive Oil Guaranteed Pure,\u201d and the words \u201cAntonio Previte &amp; Figlio, Messina (Italy).\u201d The oil was in fact a blend containing fifteen per cent of olive oil imported from Italy and eighty-five per cent of cotton seed oil produced in America. It was blended and packed in Boston. The price was $1.10 a gallon, whereas pure imported'olive oil sold for $2.25 a gallon. Inspectors of the department of public health asked the defendant for a can of Previte Brand Olive Oil, and were offered a can of the blended oil. They opened the can, and from it filled two four-ounce bottles, which they sealed as well as the can, giving all an identifying number. One bottle and the can were left with the defendant, but later the inspectors returned and removed the can. They did not buy or intend to buy the samples or the can, but acted under the power conferred by G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 111, \u00a7 9. This occurrence was the basis of one of the complaints before us, on which the defendant was found guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">The other complaint, on which also a finding of guilty was made, was based on the following facts. The defendant sold to Joseph B asile for $1.15 a gallon can of oil, which was a blend containing twenty per cent of imported olive oil and eighty per cent of domestic cotton seed oil. The label on this can bore the word \u201cLucca\u201d (the name of a city in Italy), and the words \u201cOlive Oil Highest Quality\u201d preceded in a different line in much smaller letters by the word \u201cblended.\u201d The same inspectors bought the can from Basile for $1.50. In the presence of Basile they opened the can and from it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>filled a four-ounce bottle which they sealed as well as the can, giving both an identifying number. The bottle was left with Basile, and the can was taken by the inspectors for analysis. Four ounces of oil is enough for proper analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">The complaints are respectively for offering to deliver and for delivering an article of food (G. L. [Ter. Ed.] c. 94, \u00a7 191) misbranded within the meaning of \u00a7 187. The article of food was described as \u201colive oil.\u201d It would have been, better to describe it simply as \u201coil,\u201d and that would have foreclosed the argument that there was no misbranding because the olive oil contained in the blend was in fact genuine imported olive oil which complied with the highest possible construction of the label. But the article of food intended by the complaint, though called \u201colive oil,\u201d obviously was the blended oil and not one ingredient by itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">The second count in each complaint alleges that the oil was misbranded because \u201clabelled and branded so as to , . . deceive and mislead the purchaser.\u201d This count was based on a part of \u00a7 187 which was intended to protect the particular purchaser from deception, and was not directed at a package or label which \u201cbears any statement, design or device regarding the ingredients or substance contained therein which is false or misleading in any particular.\u201d That is dealt with later in the same section. The facts do not sustain a conviction under the second count. Basile and the inspectors were not purchasers deceived or misled.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">The first count in each complaint alleges that the oil was misbranded because \u201cfalsely branded as to the State and Country where the same was . . . manufactured.\u201d The defendant does not contend that this was not sufficient as an allegation that the oil purported \u201cto be a foreign product when not so,\u201d under \u00a7 187. The labels, fairly construed, falsely represented that the oil was wholly a product of Italy. But the domestic origin of the principal ingredient could not be proved except by the analysis made under \u00a7 189, and the defendant reserved his objection to the admissibility of the analysis. It becomes necessary, therefore, to deal with this question of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 94, \u00a7 189, provides that \u201cno evidence of the result of such analysis or test shall be received if the agent described in the preceding section has refused or neglected to seal and deliver the sample, or part thereof, if and as required in the preceding section.\u201d That section (\u00a7 188) provides: \u201cIf practicable, samples shall be collected in duplicate, or divided into two substantially equal parts, and each part shall be labelled with identifying marks. One of such parts or samples shall be delivered to the person from whom they were taken . . . Parts of samples divided as hereinbefore provided shall be sealed by said agent, at the time of the taking thereof, as provided by the regulations of the department of public health, with a seal provided for that purpose.\u201d The defendant contends that the analysis could not be shown because the statute was violated. The person from whom the samples were taken got only four ounces out of a gallon, although the general purpose of the statute to give that person enough for analysis was satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">The statute cannot be held wholly directory, like the statute in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>132 Mass. 261 (see also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilkins, </em>243 Mass. 356), for compliance with the provision for sealing and delivering a sample or part thereof is expressly made a condition of admissibility. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lockhardt, </em>144 Mass. 132. The condition is not restricted, as in certain liquor cases, to the introduction of the written analysis itself. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kendrick, </em>147 Mass. 444. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Slavski, </em>245 Mass. 405, 413, <em>et seq. Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stoler, </em>259 Mass. 109. <em>Snyder </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>291 U. S. 97, 107. Unless there is compliance with the statutory provision \u201cno evidence of the result of such analysis or test shall be received.\u201d \u00a7 189. Neither is the condition restricted, as it may be in the milk statute (G. L. [Ter. Ed.] c. 94, \u00a7 35), to the analysis of samples seized as distinguished from samples purchased. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>157 Mass. 460. Although the statute as to food and drugs contains provisions for the seizure of samples as well as for the purchase of them (G. L. [Ter. Ed.] c. 94, \u00a7 188; c. 111, \u00a7 9), the provision that the result of an analysis shall not be admissible unless there has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>compliance with the statutory condition applies to all samples, however obtained. St. 1910, c. 416. St. 1917, c. 208, \u00a7\u00a7 4, 5. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 94, \u00a7\u00a7 188, 189.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">But it is to be noticed that the statutory condition of admissibility is that the agent \u201cseal and deliver the sample, or part thereof, if and as required in the preceding section.\u201d \u00a7 189. We think that the preliminary division of the sample, \u201cif practicable,\u201d into \u201ctwo substantially equal parts\u201d is not included in the condition, but is a merely directory provision. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>132 Mass. 261. Likewise the requirement of \u00a7 188 that \u201cthe accompanying printed or written matter shall be noted by such agent\u201d is directory only, and confers no right on the defendant. <em>Clancy </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>288 Mass. 557, 566. The provisions of \u00a7 189 for preliminary notice and hearing before making complaint are likewise directory. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>222 U. S. 274. If compliance in every respect with the provisions of these statutes was intended to be a condition precedent to the maintenance of any prosecution, we- should expect the statute to say so in plain words.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">Accordingly there was no error in the conviction of the defendant on the first count of each complaint. The judgment on the second count of each complaint is reversed, and judgment for the defendant is to be entered instead. On the first count of each complaint the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
