Some months later, Crowell advised the plaintiff to replace a loan from State Street Trust Company of $20,000, secured by one thousand shares of stock of Massachusetts Investors Trust, by a loan of the same amount which Crowell undertook to obtain from the defendant The First National Bank of Boston upon his own note, secured by other stock that was to be bought with the proceeds of the sale of the stock of Massachusetts Investors Trust. \u201cCrowell further stated that in order to put the transaction through he would need stock powers and a permission to pledge signed by the plaintiff. He suggested that several stock powers would be advisable in order that the Massachusetts Investors stock might be split for sale.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b216-3\">Accordingly, the plaintiff signed five or six forms of transfer of stock with power to transfer the stock on the books of the corporation, the name of the transferee, the name of the stock and the number of shares being left blank, and delivered them to Crowell. The plaintiff further signed and delivered to Crowell a \u201cpermission to pledge,\u201d addressed to The First National Bank of Boston, authorizing a person whose name was left blank, who was described as \u201cthe Borrower\u201d and who was intended to be Crowell, to pledge \u201cthe following securities belonging to me,\u201d the space for the listing of such securities being left blank, \u201cAlso any securities of mine/ours or of which I/we am/are the holder of record, which the Borrower may hereafter deposit with you for the purposes aforesaid,\u201d as collateral security for whatever the \u201cBorrower\u201d might borrow.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">Armed with these papers, Crowell borrowed on his own note from the defendant The First National Bank of Boston, at first $20,000, later increased to $35,000, and as collateral security pledged the certificate for five thousand three hundred ninety-seven shares of Moxie stock. The officers of the bank filled in the description of the stock in both the forms just described, and the name of Crowell as \u201cBorrower\u201d in the \u201cpermission to pledge.\u201d At that time, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>Crowell was of good standing and reputation, and the defendant The First National Bank of Boston took the pledge in good faith, without notice of any facts making the transfer wrongful.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-3\">In December, 1932, more than a year after the pledge, Crowell was petitioned into bankruptcy and committed suicide. The plaintiff, who had supposed that the replacement of his loan of $20,000 was secured by a pledge of stocks bought with the proceeds of the sale of stock of Massachusetts Investors Trust, discovered that the defendant bank was holding, his Moxie stock as collateral security for Crowell\u2019s borrowings. The plaintiff brought this bill to restrain any sale of the Moxie stock and to compel the redelivery of the certificate to the plaintiff. The facts were found by a master, whose report was confirmed, and a final decree was entered dismissing the bill with costs. The plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">Apart from statute, a certificate of stock is not the embodiment of the shares represented by it. <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Hodges, </em>215 Mass. 112. See also <em>Kling </em>v. <em>McTarnahan, </em>277 Mass. 386. Neither the certificate nor the shares can be said to be fully negotiable, in the sense in which money or a negotiable instrument before maturity is negotiable. The owner of a certificate of stock, like the owner of an ordinary chattel, does not lose title when someone steals it and sells it to an innocent purchaser. <em>Pratt </em>v. <em>Higginson, </em>230 Mass. 256. That remains true at common law although the certificate when stolen bears an indorsement in blank signed by the owner. <em>Scollans </em>v. <em>E. H. Rollins &amp; Sons, </em>179 Mass. 346, 352, 354. <em>Russell </em>v. <em>American Bell Telephone Co. </em>180 Mass. 467, 469. <em>Barstow </em>v. <em>City Trust Co. </em>216 Mass. 330. <em>Casto </em>v. <em>Wrenn, </em>255 Mass. 72, 75. <em>National City Bank of Chicago </em>v. <em>Wagner, </em>216 Fed. Rep. 473. The only way in which the owner can lose title at common law to an innocent purchaser from a wrongdoer having no title, is by estoppel. An owner, entrusting to another a certificate of stock bearing the owner\u2019s indorsement in blank, knows that he is making actual deceit possible. When a business custom exists by which such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>certificate is accepted without inquiry into the title of the possessor unless special cause for suspicion exists \u2014 and such a custom has been proved in a number of cases \u2014 a purchaser or pledgee taking such a certificate without special reason to doubt the title is not put upon inquiry by the existence of a blank for the name of the transferee. <em>Scollans </em>v. <em>E. H. Rollins &amp; Sons, </em>173 Mass. 275, 279, 280. For this purpose, it is immaterial whether the owner knew of the custom or not. The owner, entrusting the certificate indorsed in blank to one who wrongfully sells or pledges it to another who takes it in reliance upon such a custom, is estopped to deny the title of that other. <em>Scollans </em>v. <em>E. H. Rollins &amp; Sons, </em>173 Mass. 275; <em>S. C. </em>179 Mass. 346. <em>Russell </em>v. <em>American Bell Telephone Co. </em>180 Mass. 467. <em>Clews </em>v. <em>Friedman, </em>182 Mass. 555, 558. <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Davie, </em>211 Mass. 429. <em>Loring </em>v. <em>Goodhue, </em>259 Mass. 495. In certain reported cases some element of estoppel has been lacking. <em>Barstow </em>v. <em>City Trust Co. </em>216 Mass. 330. <em>Marcotte </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Security Corp. </em>250 Mass. 246. <em>Casto </em>v. <em>Wrenn, </em>255 Mass. 72. There is no finding in this case that any custom existed of accepting documents purporting to be transfers of stock with the name of the stock left blank.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-3\">The uniform stock transfer act (G. L. [Ter. Ed.] c. 155, \u00a7 \u00a7 24-44) now governs the transfer of title in Massachusetts to shares in corporations of Massachusetts and other States having laws consistent with it. <em>Casto </em>v. <em>Wrenn, </em>255 Mass. 72, 75. <em>Turnbull </em>v. <em>Longacre Bank, </em>249 N. Y. 159, 165. The purpose of that act is to make stock certificates and the shares represented by them more nearly negotiable than they formerly were. <em>Warr </em>v. <em>Collector of Taxes of Taunton, </em>234 Mass. 279, 281, 282. <em>Turnbull </em>v. <em>Longacre Bank, </em>249 N. Y. 159, 164, 165. <em>Peckinpaugh </em>v. <em>H. W. Noble &amp; Co. </em>238 Mich. 464. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Peerless Portland Cement Co. </em>238 Mich. 476. <em>Connolly </em>v. <em>Peoples State Bank, </em>260 Mich. 352. By \u00a7 27 (b) a certificate and the shares represented thereby may be transferred \"by delivery of the certificate and a separate document containing a written assignment of the certificate or a power of attorney to sell, assign or transfer the same or the shares represented thereby, signed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>by the person appearing by the certificate to be the owner of the shares represented thereby\u201d; and this may be made out to a specified person or the name of the person may be left blank. By \u00a7 31 \u201cthe delivery of a certificate to transfer title in accordance with section twenty-seven shall be effectual,\u201d with an immaterial exception, \u201cthough made by one having no right of possession and having no authority from the owner of the certificate or from the person purporting to transfer the title.\u201d Under the corresponding section of the uniform stock transfer act it has been held in other States that even a thief may give a good title by delivery of a stolen certificate bearing an indorsement in blank. <em>Turnbull </em>v. <em>Longacre Bank, </em>249 N. Y. 159. <em>Commercial National Bank </em>v. <em>National Surety Co. </em>259 N. Y. 181. <em>Peckinpaugh </em>v. <em>H. W. Noble &amp; Co. </em>238 Mich. 464. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Peerless Portland Cement Co. </em>238 Mich. 476. We say that the exception in \u00a7 31 is immaterial, because by \u00a7 33 (1) it does not apply where \u201cthe certificate has been transferred to a purchaser for value in good faith without notice of any facts making the transfer wrongful.\u201d By \u00a7 26 a pledgee is a \u201cpurchaser,\u201d a taking of security even for an antecedent debt is a taking for value, and a thing is done in good faith if done honestly though done negligently. <em>Ironside </em>v. <em>Levi, </em>278 Mass. 18, 22, 23. <em>Ripley </em>v. <em>J. Murray Walker &amp; Co. Inc. </em>286 Mass. 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-3\">Nevertheless, if we confine our attention to the delivery of the stock certificate to the defendant bank, accompanied by the \u201cseparate document\u201d signed by the plaintiff, purporting to assign unnamed stock to an unnamed person, and ignore the \u201cpermission to pledge,\u201d no valid transfer to the defendant bank is shown. Section 27 of the uniform stock transfer act purports to state the \u201conly\u201d methods by which legal title may be transferred. <em>Place </em>v. <em>Chaffee, </em>251 Mass. 508, 510. <em>Good Fellows Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Silverman, </em>283 Mass. 173, 180. <em>Stuart </em>v. <em>Sargent, </em>283 Mass. 536, 542. Where, as in this case, the signature of the owner is on a \u201cseparate document,\u201d that document must purport to assign, or authorize the transfer of, the \u201ccertificate\u201d or \u201cthe shares represented thereby.\u201d When the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>bank first saw that document, it contained no reference to the certificate in question nor to Moxie shares. Apart from the \u201cpermission to pledge,\u201d the defendant bank, in taking that certificate and those shares, placed its reliance, not upon any apparent transfer over the signature of the plaintiff, but rather upon the representation of Crowell that he was authorized to make the plaintiff\u2019s signature apply to that certificate and those shares. It is no part of the purpose of the act to protect one who takes an irregular document on the faith of oral representations. No matter how high in reputation Crowell stood, the bank acted at its peril in relying on his word, as distinguished from an apparent transfer by the plaintiff of the Moxie stock. <em>France </em>v. Clark, 26 Ch. D. 257, 262. <em>Colonial Bank </em>v. <em>Cady, </em>15 App. Cas. 267. Compare <em>Fry </em>v. <em>Smellie, </em>[1912] 3 K. B. 282.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-3\">Much the same considerations apply to that part of the \u201cpermission to pledge\u201d which contemplated the insertion of a list of securities but was delivered to the defendant bank without the insertion of the name of any security. If the \u201cpermission to pledge\u201d had stopped there, the bank, in filling the blank with a description of the Moxie stock, would have been relying on Crowell\u2019s word rather than on anything signed by the plaintiff. The finding \u201cthat permission to pledge is frequently accepted by banks and brokerage houses in blank as to the name of the security pledged\u201d is not a finding of a general custom that would justify the bank in assuming that the plaintiff\u2019s signature might be applied to any certificate that Crowell might present. Besides, the master finds that no custom existed of accepting a \u201cpermission to pledge\u201d with the name of \u201cthe Borrower\u201d left blank, as it was in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">But the \u201cpermission to pledge\u201d signed by the plaintiff, in which the name of Crowell was rightfully inserted as \u201cthe Borrower\u201d in accord with the understanding of the parties, went on to authorize \u201cthe Borrower\u201d to pledge also, as security for loans to him, \u201cany securities of mine/ours or of which I/we am/are the holder of record, which the Borrower may hereafter deposit with you.\u201d The word <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>\u201chereafter\u201d does not mean subsequent to an initial pledge of named securities, but means subsequent to the signing of the \u201cpermission to pledge.\u201d There would be no point in limiting the initial pledge to named securities, and then giving an omnibus power to be exercised the next day or the next minute. The pledge of the Moxie certificate was made in strict accord with the apparent authority given Crowell, upon which the bank was expected to rely, to pledge \u201cany securities\u201d of the plaintiff which Crowell \u201cmay hereafter deposit.\u201d That apparent authority contained in the \u201cpermission to pledge\u201d carried with it the incidental authority to fill in, upon the \u201cseparate document\u201d of transfer of stock, the name of any stock included within the apparent authority to pledge. The bank was not affected by the true understanding between the plaintiff and Crowell, not communicated to the bank, by which the Moxie stock was to be held for safe keeping and not sold or pledged. <em>Brooks </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>197 Mass. 376, 380. <em>Globe Ticket Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Retail Grocers\u2019 Association, </em>290 Mass. 235.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">\n<em>Decree affirmed with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
