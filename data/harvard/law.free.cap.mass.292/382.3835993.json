The employee, once a regular worker, at the time of the injury was employed on a \u201cstagger\u201d system, by which he worked from Thursday morning until Wednesday night for a week\u2019s pay of $24, and then did no work and earned no more pay until Thursday morning of the following week. The result was that he earned a week\u2019s pay of $24 every two weeks, and thus averaged $12 a week. He contends that his average weekly wages were $24. The board found that they were $12, and that consequently the amount of compensation for total disability was $9 a week. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 34. A decree was entered accordingly. The employee appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">No formula for computing average weekly wages, contained in G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 1 (1), is applicable, for there is no evidence of the earnings of the employee or any other person during the twelve months immediately preceding the injury. <em>Gillen\u2019s Case, </em>215 Mass. 96. <em>Gorski\u2019s Case, </em>227 Mass. 456, 461. <em>Snow\u2019s Case, </em>252 Mass. 426. <em>McDermott\u2019s Case, </em>283 Mass. 74, 78. But an injured employee is entitled to have his average weekly wages computed in some way. In <em>Rice\u2019s Case, </em>229 Mass. 325, 328, where no statutory formula could be applied, the average weekly wages were \u201ccomputed by dividing the total amount earned by the number of weeks of employment.\u201d In the present case the employee was regularly employed as a part time worker. The principle of <em>Rice\u2019s Case </em>requires that the amount of money earned during the employment and the period required to earn it be set against each other in com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>puting the average weekly wages. <em>Ethier\u2019s Case, </em>286 Mass. 139. See also <em>Bartoni\u2019s Case, </em>225 Mass. 349; <em>Norman\u2019s Case, </em>278 Mass. 464. The amount was properly computed as $12. To sustain the contention of the employee would give him more money while totally disabled than he could earn while working.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-3\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
