When the plow was over the rails, he became aware of an approaching train and \u201cinstinctively and at once\u201d backed off the track. As he did so, \u201cthe tail of the truck\u201d struck the automobile, causing the damage complained of. The trial judge found for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>By reason of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 84, \u00a7 1, it was the duty of the defendant city to keep its ways in repair, \u201cso that they may be reasonably safe and convenient for travelers . . . at all seasons.\u201d Performance of that duty is a governmental function, from which the city derives no profit in its private or corporate capacity and for negligence in respect to which it is not liable, except as it has been expressly made so by \u00a7 15 under specified conditions for injuries caused by defects. <em>Oliver </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>102 Mass. 489, 499. <em>Monies </em>v. <em>Lynn, </em>121 Mass. 442, 444. <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>122 Mass. 344, 351, 357. <em>Moynihan </em>v. <em>Todd, </em>188 Mass. 301. <em>Ansell </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>254 Mass. 208, 212. The city\u2019s duty under the statute includes the removal of snow, G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 84, \u00a7\u00a7 7, 22, <em>Loker </em>v. <em>Brookline, </em>13 Pick. 343, <em>Hadden </em>v. <em>Somerville, </em>197 Mass. 480, although since St. 1896, c. 540 (see now G. L. [Ter. Ed.] c. 84, \u00a7 17), municipalities are no longer liable in private actions for injuries caused solely by snow or ice. <em>Newton </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>174 Mass. 181.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">The injuries to the plaintiffs arose out of the performance by the defendant city of its public statutory duty, and were not caused by any defect in the way. The defendant is not liable. The cases are plainly distinguishable from <em>Dickinson </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>188 Mass. 595, where it was said that the city undertook the enterprise of lighting its streets for its private benefit and not under any statutory requirement. <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>231 Mass. 372. It is unnecessary to discuss the requests for rulings in detail or to deal with other aspects of the cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">In each case the entry must be</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">\n<em>Order dismissing report affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
