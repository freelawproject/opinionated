Consequently, we affirm the decision of the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-21\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b183-22\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b183-23\">The facts of this case are sparse. At his deportation hearing, Madrid maintained that he illegally entered the United States sometime in 1977 or 1978, which he purported to prove with affidavits from friends. Officially, he obtained conditional permanent resident status on March 24, 1987, with the conditional status being removed in 1989. Madrid became deportable under INA \u00a7 241(a)(2)(B)(i)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> when he was convicted for possessing cocaine. The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) issued an order to show cause and ordered Madrid to appear before an Immigration Judge (IJ).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-24\">Before the IJ, Madrid conceded his deport-ability, but sought discretionary relief under \u00a7 212(c). The IJ never reached the discretionary aspects of the application, as she found that Madrid could not meet the seven year residence requirement. On appeal, the BIA upheld the IJ\u2019s decision, also concluding that Madrid was statutorily ineligible for discretionary relief. Madrid timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">A <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Madrid challenges the INS\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 212(c), which is a question of law reviewed de novo.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Yet, because Congress has delegated the administration of the statutory scheme to the INS, its interpretation is entitled to strong deference.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">B. <em>\u00a7 212(c) Discretion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">Section 212(c) of the INA allows the Attorney General in his discretion to grant relief from orders of deportation to \u201c[a]liens lawfully admitted for permanent residence who temporarily proceed abroad voluntarily and not under an order of deportation, and who are returning to a lawful unrelinquished domicile of seven consecutive years.\u201d Read strictly, this language provides the discretionary relief only to resident aliens outside of the United States. But, the Second Circuit found that limitation unconstitutional in <em>Francis v. INS,</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and the BIA has since provided such discretionary relief to aliens within the United States.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">For the last forty years, the BIA has interpreted this language as requiring that, to be statutorily eligible, the alien must have been a <em>lawful </em>permanent resident of the United States for at least seven years prior to his or her application for \u00a7 212(e) relief.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Two circuits have approved this reading: the Fourth Circuit in <em>Chiravackaradhikul v. </em>INS<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and the Ninth Circuit in <em>Castillo-Felix v. INS.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b184-21\">There is admittedly another possible reading of \u00a7 212(c): the petitioner (1) has been legally domiciled in the United States for seven years, and (2) is a permanent resident <em>at the time of his application, </em>but not necessarily for the entire seven year period. The Second Circuit adopted this approach in <em>Lok v. INS (Lok I),</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>although it subsequently recognized that the intent to remain must be lawful.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b184-22\">In <em>Brown v. </em>INS<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> we, like the D.C. Circuit in <em>Anwo v. INS,</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em> </em>found it unnecessary to choose either side of this circuit split. The petitioner in <em>Brown </em>argued that his period of residence in the United States on a student visa should count towards the seven year domicile requirement. We rejected that argument, reasoning that an alien student, by the terms of his student visa, could not lawfully possess an intent to remain in the United States; but if the student did in fact form such an intent, then he was in violation of his visa and was not here lawfully.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b184-23\">Building on the reasoning in <em>Brown, </em>we find that Madrid fails to meet even the more permissive <em>Lok </em>standard. The bare language of the statute requires a \u201clawful unre-linquished domicile of seven consecutive years.\u201d In simple terms, Madrid cannot meet the statutory \u201clawful domicile\u201d requirement given his admission that he entered the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>country illegally, with no immigrant visa. Certainly, if Madrid had no legal right to be in this country, he could not establish a lawful intent to remain. Moreover, it would be incongruous to hold that an alien <em>lawfully </em>residing in this country by virtue of a student visa cannot establish a lawful intent to remain, but an alien <em>unlawfully </em>in the United States could. Consequently, we extend today the reasoning of <em>Brown </em>and hold that an applicant for \u00a7 212(c) relief cannot meet the seven year lawful domicile requirement by counting time spent in this country illegally.

Although the Supreme Court has not spoken directly to this issue, its decision in <em>Elkins v. Moreno, </em>435 U.S. 647, 98 S.Ct. 1338, 55 L.Ed.2d 614 (1978), does address the question indirectly. In <em>Elkins, </em>the Court considered whether students holding visas as children of \"officers, or employees of ... international organizations\u201d could establish domicile for \"in-state\u201d status. The Court concluded that, although the issue whether the student could become domiciles of the state was one of state law, the students had the capacity under federal law to change domicile, as the visas were not expressly dependent on their retaining a foreign domicile. This is consistent with <em>Brown, </em>which held that foreign students could not form a lawful intent to remain, as their visas required retention of a foreign domicile.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
