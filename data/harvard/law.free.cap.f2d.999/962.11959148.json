Voinche filed suit under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i), arguing that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had failed to release certain documents pursuant to his FOIA request. The district court dismissed Voinche\u2019s suit because Voinche had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies regarding his challenge to the adequacy of the FBI\u2019s response to his FOIA request and because Voinche\u2019s suit under \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i) had been rendered moot by the FBI\u2019s response to his FOIA request.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-21\">Summary judgment is reviewed <em>de novo, </em>under the same standards the district court applies to determine whether summary judgment is appropriate. <em>Amburgey v. Corhart Refractories Corp., </em>936 F.2d 805, 809 (5th Cir.1991). It is proper when, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-movant, \u201c \u2018there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and ... the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-22\">The Freedom of Information Act requires exhaustion of administrative remedies prior to seeking judicial review. <em>Voinche v. United States Dep\u2019t of Air Force, </em>983 F.2d 667, 669 (5th Cir.), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>61 U.S.L.W. 3820 (May 17, 1993) (No. 92-1870). If an agency has not complied within the statutory time limits of an FOIA request, the requester shall be deemed to have exhausted his administrative remedies and bring suit. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(C). However, in an action based on \u00a7 552(a)(6)(C), the issue is not whether the requestor should have ultimate access to the records. <em>See Open America v. Watergate Special Prosecution Force, </em>547 F.2d 605, 607 (D.C.Cir.1976). The issue is under what time constraints administrative agencies should be compelled to act by the court at the behest of a requester. <em>Id. </em>at 607-08.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-23\">Although Voinche exhausted his administrative remedies pursuant to \u00a7 552(a)(6)(C) in order to challenge the tardiness of the FBI\u2019s response, he has not challenged the adequacy of the FBI\u2019s response administratively. Insofar as Voinche challenged the tardiness of the FBI\u2019s response, his claim was rendered moot by the FBI\u2019s response to his request. Because a suit pursuant to \u00a7 552(a)(6)(C) challenges only the timeliness of an agency\u2019s response, the issue whether the agency\u2019s response was adequate is not apposite.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1034-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>Because Voinche\u2019s claim was rendered moot by the FBI\u2019s response and because judicial review of the adequacy of the FBI\u2019s response is precluded by Voinche\u2019s failure to seek administrative review, there is no genuine issue of material fact. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1033-18\"> Because the purpose of a <em>Vaughn </em>index is to evaluate the adequacy of an agency\u2019s response to a FOIA request, Voinche\u2019s request for such was also correctly denied by the district court. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number><em>Vaughn v. Rosen, </em>484 F.2d 820, 828 (D.C.Cir.1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>415 U.S. 977, 94 S.Ct. 1564, 39 L.Ed.2d 873 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
