(Meineke), sued two of its former franchise owners. The district court ruled in favor of Meinehe finding that the franchisees, Wesley and Marion Jaynes (\u201cthe Jaynes\u201d), violated the licensing agreement, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>the Jaynes engaged in a civil conspiracy to interfere with business and contractual relations. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">I. <em>Prologue</em></p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">The Jaynes purchased a Meineke franchise from Robert Strange in 1980. Strange had a fifteen year licensing agreement with M\u00e9i-neke, valid by its terms until September 28, 1989, which he sold to the Jaynes with Mei-neke\u2019s approval. The district court found, and the Jaynes do not contest, that Meineke has performed all of its obligations under the licensing agreement. R. 3035, 3043.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">It is undisputed that before their licensing agreement with Meineke expired, the Jaynes entered into an operating agreement with Autocare Distribution d/b/a Mike\u2019s Muffler and Brake' (\u201cAutocare\u201d). The Autocare agreement called for the Jaynes to operate a \u201cMike\u2019s Muffler &amp; Brake\u201d automotive service center in the same location as their former Meineke franchise. On September 1, 1989, pursuant to the Autocare agreement, the Jaynes began operating \u201cMike\u2019s Muffler &amp; Brake Shop\u201d at the same location. ' This business offered the same products and services as the Meineke operation: \u2014 installation and repair of automotive exhaust systems, brakes and shocks.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">Meineke demanded that the Jaynes cease their activities, pointing out that the Jaynes were violating provisions of the Meineke-Jaynes licensing agreement. When these entreaties. went unheeded, Meineke sued the Jaynes, alleging that they: (1) violated the licensing agreement\u2019s \u201cCovenant Not to Compete;\u201d (2) conspired to interfere with contractual and business relations; (3) engaged in unauthorized use of Meineke\u2019s protected trademarks; and (4) engaged in unfair competition. R. 6-17. Meineke also sought attorney\u2019s fees under the terms of the licensing agreement. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b194-12\">The Jaynes answered Meineke\u2019s complaint, and also filed counterclaims and third party claims.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Following trial the district court concluded, <em>inter alia: </em>(1) The Jaynes breached the Meineke-Jaynes\u2019 licensing agreement by entering into the agreement with Auto-care, R. 3038; (2) the Jaynes and Autocare conspired to interfere with contractual and business relations existing between \u2022 the Jaynes and Meineke, <em>id.; </em>(3) the Jaynes had no standing to seek cancellation of Meineke\u2019s trademarks, <em>id. </em>at 3026; and (4) the Jaynes were unable to press their DTPA claims against Meineke, <em>id. </em>at 3023. For conspiring to breach the licensing agreement during its term, the court assessed actual damages of $4,420, and punitive damages of $6,000. The court awarded nominal damages of $10 for the Jaynes\u2019 post-termination violation of the licensing agreement\u2019s covenant not to compete, and for continuing to use the same telephone number for \u201cMike\u2019s Muffler &amp; Brake\u201d that was used by the Meineke operation. Over \u25a0 $560,000 in attorneys\u2019 fees and costs were also assessed against the Jaynes.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-13\">On appeal, the Jaynes raise a host of errors. We address each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-14\">II. <em>Covenant Not to Compete</em></p>\n<p id=\"b194-15\">The district court held that the Jaynes violated the licensing agreement\u2019s covenant not to compete.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Paragraph 18 of the agreement prohibits the franchisee from operating another competitive business during the duration of the agreement. The franchisee also agrees to not operate a competing business \u201cwithin the one (1) year period following the termination that is located within a radius of twenty (20) miles\u201d from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>Meineke location. R. 43. The Jaynes-Auto-care agreement, and the operation of \u201cMike\u2019s Muffler &amp; Brake\u201d at the exact location of the Jaynes\u2019 former Meineke franchise is a blatant violation of the licensing agreement. On appeal, the Jaynes do not contest the court\u2019s findings as to their actions;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> rather, they attack the legal validity of the covenant not to compete.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">We review this contract provision de novo. <em>See Technical Consultant Servs., Inc. v. Lakewood Pipe of Texas, Inc., </em>861 F.2d 1357, 1362 (applying Texas law). The starting point in our analysis is Tex.Bus. &amp; Com.Code \u00a7 15.50 (Supp.1993):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-5\">[A] covenant not to compete is enforceable to the extent that it:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-6\">(1) is ancillary to an otherwise enforceable agreement...., and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-7\">(2) contains reasonable limitations as, to time, geographic area, and scope of activity to be restrained that do not impose. a greater restraint than necessary to protect the goodwill or other business interest of the promisee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-8\"><em>Id.; see also Ruscitto v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., </em>777 F.Supp. 1349, 1354 (N.D.Tex.), <em>aff'd, </em>948 F.2d 1286 (5th Cir.1991), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 112 S.Ct. 1994, 118 L.Ed.2d 590 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-11\">First, we,agree with the district court that the covenant not to compete was ancillary to an otherwise enforceable agreement, <em>i.e. </em>the franchise license.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We next evaluate whether or not the restrictive aspects' of the agreement (time, geography, and scope) are reasonable. <em>See Henshaw v. Kroenecke, </em>656 S.W.2d 416, 418 (Tex.1983) (reasonableness of agreement not to compete is question of law). The burden was on the Jaynes to prove that the restraints were unreasonable. Tex.Bus. &amp; Com.Code \u00a7 15.51(b) (Supp.1993); <em>see also Butts Retail, Inc. v. Diversifoods, Inc., </em>840 S.W.2d 770, 772 (Tex.Civ. App. \u2014 Beaumont 1992, writ denied) (placing burden of proof on franchisee).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b195-18\">The Jaynes argue at length that the covenant\u2019s prescriptions on time and geography are unreasonable.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As a diversity court we <em>ate Erie </em>bound to apply Texas law, and using this benchmark, we conclude that the one year/twenty mile restriction is not unreasonable as a matter of law. <em>See Ruscitto, </em>777 F.Supp. at 1354 (applying Texas law, one year prohibition on soliciting customers reasonable); <em>Isuani v. Manske-Sheffield Radiology Group, P.A., </em>805 S.W.2d 602, 606 (Tex.Civ.App. \u2014 Beaumont 1991, writ denied) (one-year, fifteen mile limitation reasonable); <em>Property Tax </em>Assocs., <em>Inc. v. Staffeldt, </em>800 S.W.2d 349, 352 (Tex.Civ.App. \u2014 El Paso 1990, writ, denied), (two year, county-wide restraint reasonable); <em>Posey v. Monier Resources, Inc., </em>768 S.W.2d 915, 918-19 (Tex.Civ.App. \u2014 San Antonio .1989, writ denied) (salesman restrained from working in former sales, area for two years).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-20\">The restraints were reasonable considering Meineke\u2019s legitimate business interests. The district court .found that Meineke expended considerable resources to promote name-recognition for products and services being offered by its.franchises. R. 3037. The Appellants do not seriously contest this finding, and we conclude that the restrictions placed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>on the Jaynes under the licensing <em>agreement </em>\u201cdo not impose a greater restraint than necessary to protect the goodwill or other business interest of [Meineke].\u201d Tex.Bus. &amp; Com.Code \u00a7 15.50 (Supp.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">The Appellants\u2019 second point of error is likewise unavailing. They contend that the court erred by <em>reforming </em>the covenant, and then awarding damages. We have searched the record to ascertain where (and how) the court reformed the covenant. We find no reference to this action, and the Appellants\u2019 record cite does not support this argument.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This point of error is without merit.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> ,</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">III. <em>Conspiracy to Interfere with Contractual and Business Relations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">The district court held that the Jaynes conspired with Autocare to interfere with the contractual and business relations between Meineke and the Jaynes. Initially, they contend that the district court erred in refusing to direct a verdict in their favor at the close of Meineke\u2019s case-in-chief. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(c) (\u201cIf during a trial without a jury a party has been fully heard with respect to an issue ... the court may enter judgment as a matter of law against that party[.]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">The inquiry regarding a directed verdict request is the same on appeal as it is at the trial stage: All inferences from the evidence are drawn in favor of the nonmoving party, and a verdict should not be directed unless the facts point overwhelmingly in favor of the movant\u2019s position. <em>See Entente Mineral Co. v. Parker, </em>956 F.2d 524, 526 (5th Cir.1992) (citing <em>Boeing Co. v. Shipman, </em>411 F.2d 365 (5th Cir.1969) (en banc)).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">The Appellants argue that the only evidence of a conspiracy was the Autocare-Jaynes agreement, and that this failed to provide an adequate basis for the conspiracy claim. This argument is without merit. There was sufficient evidence supporting the nonmovant\u2019s (Meineke) position; a directed verdict would have been improper because the facts did <em>not </em>overwhelmingly stack-up in the Jaynes\u2019 favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-12\">A claim for civil conspiracy has five elements: (1) two or more persons; (2) have an objective to be accomplished; (3) a meeting of the participants\u2019 minds on the objective or course of action; (4) one or more unlawful, overt acts; and, (5) resulting damages. <em>Massey v. Armco Steel Co., </em>652 S.W.2d 932, 934 (Tex.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-13\">All elements are present in the instant case. There were at least two participants (the Jaynes and Autocare). An objective was present (establish competing business in contravention of Meineke-Jaynes licensing agreement). There was a meeting of the minds on this objective, as evidenced by the Autocare-Jaynes agreement. An unlawful interference with the existing licensing agreement resulted in damages to Meineke in the form of lost franchise and advertising fees. The district court found these facts, and .we conclude such findings are not clearly erroneous. Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a). With the factual predicate for this claim established, the court did not err in its legal conclusion that an actionable civil conspiracy between the Jaynes and Autocare resulted in damages to Meineke.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-14\">The Appellants argue that the conspiracy to \u25a0 breach the Meineke-Jaynes agreement \u201ccould only have been based on those breaches that occurred after the termination of the License Agreement.\u201d However, the Appellants incredulously gloss over the fact that they operated \u201cMike\u2019s Muffler &amp; Brake\u201d at the exact location of their former Meineke franchise while the Meineke-Jaynes license <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>agreement was still in effect. This in-term violation of the Meineke-Jaynes licensing agreement\u2019s covenant not to compete was the. basis for the civil conspiracy claim. R. 3038-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">IV. <em>DTPA Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">The Jaynes contest the district court\u2019s denial of their .claim under Texas\u2019 Deceptive Trade Practices-Consumer Protection Act. Tex.Bus. <em>&amp; </em>Com.Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 17.41-.63 (Vernon 1987 &amp; Supp.1993). The DTPA does not apply to wholly intangible property rights. <em>See Texas Cookie Co. v. Hendricks &amp; Peralta, Inc., </em>747 S.W.2d 873, 876 (Tex.Civ.App. \u2014 Corpus Christi 1988, writ denied). It has been applied to franchise situations where the collateral services provided to a franchisee formed the basis of the DTPA claim. <em>Id. </em>at 877; <em>see also Cameron v. Terrell &amp; Garrett, Inc., </em>618 S.W.2d 535, 539 (Tex.1981) (goods or services acquired must form the basis of DTPA claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">To proceed under the DTPA, a claimant must be a \u201cconsumer.\u201d <em>Eckman v. Centennial Sav. Bank, </em>784 S.W.2d 672, 674 (Tex.1990). To be a consumer, the DTPA claimant must (i) have sought or acquired goods<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> or services<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> by purchase or lease, <em>and </em>(ii) show that these same goods or services form the basis of the DTPA complaint. <em>Schmueser v. Burkburnett Bank, </em>937 F.2d 1025, 1028 (5th Cir.1991); <em>Cameron, </em>618 S.W.2d at 539.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">The Jaynes are not consumers for DTPA purposes. Their agreement with.Mei-neke allowed them to operate a Meineke franchise, and to receive all the accoutrements which accompany the operation of \u00e1 nationally recognized franchise operation. The Appellants\u2019 DTPA complaint focuses on the validity of Meineke\u2019s ownership of its trademarks and service marks. <em>See </em>R. 63-64 (\u201cMeineke Discount represented that the trademark' rights were fully established.... The representations by [Meineke] were false, misleading, and deceptive....\u201d). It is this intangible property right, and not any equipment or services provided by Meineke, 'that formed the basis of the Jaynes\u2019 DTPA claim. Because both prongs of the consumer status test are not met, the district court properly denied the Jaynes DTPA relief. <em>See Schmueser, </em>937 F.2d at 1028; <em>Kennedy v. Sale, </em>689 S.W.2d 890, 893 (Tex.1985); <em>Cameron, </em>618 S.W.2d at 539.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-16\">V. <em>Trademark Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b197-17\">The Jaynes attempted to cancel Mei-neke\u2019s federally ' registered trademarks. They, argued that by failing to disclose to the United States Patent and Trademark Office the previous use of the tradename \u201cBass &amp; Meineke,\u201d Meineke fraudulently obtained protection under the trademark laws. The Jaynes have no proprietary interest in \u201cBass &amp; Meineke,\u201d which is the tradename for an auto parts business that does not compete directly with Meineke. The Jaynes do not contend that they were restricted in their use of the Meineke trademarks, logos or other symbols during the term of their licensing agreement with Meineke.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-18\">The Meineke trade and service marks at issue were registered in 1982 and 1983. Because they have been registered for over five years, they have become \u201cincontes-tible,\u201d and can only be cancelled if: (1) the mark has become generic; (2) the mark was abandoned; (3) the registration was obtained fraudulently; or, (4) the mark was used to misrepresent the .source of the goods or services. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1064, 1065 (Supp. 1993); <em>Park \u2019N Fly, Inc. v. Dollar Park and Fly, Inc., 469 </em>U.S. 189, 197, 105 S.Ct. 658, 663, 83 L.Ed.2d 582 (1985); <em>Selva &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Nina Footwear, Inc., </em>705 F.2d 1316, 1326 (Fed.Cir.1983). The Appellants assert that fraud was used to register the marks under Meineke\u2019s ownership.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-19\">'The evidence supporting this contention is a letter dated October 30, 1972 from Mr. Edward Bass to Mr. Sam Meineke. R. 867. It confirms that Bass agreed not to use the name \u201cMeineke\u201d. in any fashion in any enter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>prise engaged in \u201cthe muffler shop business.\u201d This letter allegedly illustrates that the Ap-pellee falsely represented to the Patent Office that it was the first to use the \u201cMeineke\u201d tradename.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">The district court concluded that Meineke did not make false statements to the Patent Office and did not obtain the challenged registrations by fraud. R. 3040. We agree. To succeed on a claim of fraudulent registration, the challenging party must prove by clear and convincing evidence that the applicant made false statements with the intent to deceive the licensing authorities. <em>Money Store v. Harriscorp Finance, Inc., </em>689 F.2d 666, 670 (7th Cir.1982). The 1972 letter indicates that Messrs.-Bass and Mei-neke reached an agreement regarding which party had the right to use the tradename \u201cMeineke\u201d in connection with the automotive muffler installation and repair business. R. 867. Consequently, in its application for trademark protection, Meineke truthfully stated that, in the realm of automotive muffler specialists, it was in fact the first entity to use the trade name \u201cMeineke.\u201d <em>See </em>R. 161-62 (Nedell affidavit); R. 157 (letter from Patent Office stating that a search of the Office\u2019s records failed to show that Meineke\u2019s proposed marks resembled any registered marks \u201cwhen applied to [Meineke\u2019s] goods and/or services....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">VI. <em>Attorneys\u2019 Fees and Costs</em></p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">The district court awarded Meineke $564,748 in attorneys\u2019 fees, costs and expenses. The Jaynes contest this amount, arguing that Meineke has no basis from which to claim attorney\u2019s fees. This is incorrect; Meineke has both a contractual and statutory basis from which it can claim attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Meineke-Jaynes\u2019 licensing agreement provides that Meineke is entitled to \u201call costs incurred ... including, but not limited to, the cost of all telephone calls, telegrams, travel, correspondence, attorney fees and court costs.\u201d R. 45.. Texas statutory law also provides for the recovery of attorneys\u2019 fees when a party prevails on a contract claim. Tex.Civ.Prac. &amp; Rem.Code \u00a7 38.001(8) (Vernon 1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">We are unpersuaded that the district court erred in assessing the amount of fees and costs. Counsel for Meineke submitted detailed time sheets and expense records. <em>See </em>R. 3071-3329. The Jaynes were able to lodge objections to these figures. <em>See </em>R. 3445-3471. The district court carefully considered the factors <em>for </em>determining attorneys\u2019 fees- announced in <em>Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc., </em>488 F.2d 714 (5th Cir.1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-10\">A recitation of the court\u2019s <em>Johnson </em>analysis is unnecessary, as the Appellants have identified no error in the court\u2019s calculation of the fee amount, other than to point out that the fee award is almost sixty times greater than Meineke\u2019s. judgment damages. We are not unmindful of the disparity of these amounts. However, this alone will not support a reversal of the district court\u2019s decision. <em>See, e.g., Estate of Borst v. O\u2019Brien, </em>979 F.2d 511, 516 (7th Cir.1992) (\u201c[A]n attorneys\u2019 fee award need not be proportionate to the damage award.\u201d); <em>Reneau v. Mossy Motors, </em>622 F.2d 192, 196 (5th Cir.1980) (\u201c[T]he ceiling on a client\u2019s recovery should not operate as an impenetrable barrier to reasonable compensation.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-11\">The court properly exercised its discretion, and guided by the <em>Johnson </em>factors, assessed fees and costs against the Jaynes. We find no abuse of this discretion, and affirm. <em>See Fogleman v. Aramco, </em>920 F.2d 278, 285 (5th Cir.1991) (reviewing cost award for abuse of discretion); <em>Reneau, </em>622 F.2d at 195 (reviewing attorneys\u2019 fee award under same standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-12\">VII. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b198-13\">The Jaynes clearly breached their licensing agreement with Meineke by operating a competing business during the term of the agreement. They also violated the agreement\u2019s covenant not to operate a competing business fof a period of one year within a twenty-mile radius from the former Meineke franchise after the termination of the Mei-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>neke licensing agreement. These are reasonable restrictions on competition, and are tailored to protect Meineke\u2019s legitimate business interests. The Autocare-Jaynes agreement evinced a civil conspiracy to interfere with contractual and business relations between Meineke and the Jaynes. Finally, the award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs was proper. We do not reach Meineke\u2019s conditional cross-appeal on the issue of amending the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b194-8\">. The Jaynes did contest Meineke\u2019s representations regarding its trade and service marks. These contentions are without merit, and are discussed <em>infra </em>at \u00a7 V.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b194-9\">. The Jaynes have not appealed any judgments from their third-party claims. Consequently, we do not address these matters.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b194-10\">. The Jaynes seem to argue that since the district court denied Meineke's request for a preliminary injunction, the covenant not to compete is unenforceable. (The trial court initially held that Meineke did not have any protectable trade secrets which would warrant injunctive relief). This argument presupposes that the court's findings and conclusions after an abbreviated hearing on a preliminary injunction are binding as the law of the case. Such an argument is incorrect. <em>See University of Texas v. Camenisch, </em>451 U.S. 390, 395, 101 S.Ct. 1830, 1834, 68 L.Ed.2d 175 (1981); <em>Integrated Circuits Unlimited v. E.F. Johnson, Co., </em>875 F.2d 1040, 1043 (2nd Cir.1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b195-12\">. We accept these findings as correct. Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"ALK\">. An agreement is ancillary to an otherwise enforceable agreement if \"it is part of and subsidiary to an otherwise valid transaction or relationship which gives rise to an interest worthy of protection.... Examples of legitimate, protecta-ble interests include business goodwill, trade secrets, and other confidential or proprietary information.\" <em>DeSantis v. Wackenhut Corp., </em>793 S.W.2d 670, 682 (Tex.1990), <em>cert. denied, </em>498 U.S. 1048, 111 S.Ct. 755, 112 L.Ed.2d 775 (1991). The covenant not to compete was ancillary to the licensing agreement which created mutually enforceable interests in the operation of a Meineke franchise.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b195-21\">. <em>Butts Retail, Inc. </em>also negates the Appellants argument that the franchise agreement was a personal service contract. <em>See </em>840 S.W.2d at 773.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b195-22\">. We fail to see how territorial restrictions placed on post-termination activities as a li-censor or franchisor are relevant to this dispute. The Appellants operated a single competing business in the very same location as their former Meineke operation; they were not licensing or franchising any other enterprises. They cannot ask this court to engage in speculation as to what might have occurred had Meineke attempted to enforce the geographic limits of paragraph 18(b)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b196-9\">. The Jaynes assert that Conclusion of Law No. 10, R. 3029, amounts to a reformation of the covenant not to compete. This conclusion states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A79\">The covenant not to compete is reasonable as to time, geographical area and scope of activity. The restricted activity is only that which directly competes with Meineke.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A5-\">We read this passage as an affirmation of the validity of the covenant, not as a reformation of it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b196-15\">. The Appellants also argue that the district court erred by using an unenforceable covenant not to compete as a basis for awarding damages for conspiracy to interfere with contractual and business relations. We held previously that the covenant was reasonable and enforceable under Tex.Bus. &amp; Com.Code \u00a7 15.50 (Supp.1993). Therefore, the Appellants\u2019 third point of error is without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b197-12\">. \u201cGoods\u201d are statutorily defined as \u201ctangible chattels or real property purchased or leased for use.\u201d Tex.Bus. &amp; Com.Code \u00a7 17.45(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b197-20\">. \u201cServices\u201d are\u2019 defined as \u201cwork, labor, or service purchased or leased for use, including services furnished in connection with the sale or repair of goods.\u201d Tex.Bus. &amp; Com.Code \u00a7 17.-45(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b198-7\">.
