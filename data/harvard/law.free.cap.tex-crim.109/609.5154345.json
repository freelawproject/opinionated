The complaint in this bill is of the overruling of the motion for new trial, apparently sought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>on the ground of misconduct of the jury. The bill sets out the testimony of three jurors. We gather that appellant\u2019s purpose was to show by said parties their misappropriation of certain testimony. The claim was that the testimony was admitted for one purpose and that the jury misappropriated same and used it for another purpose. We do not believe it permissible for a juror to attempt to impeach his verdict in this manner. Esquival v. State, 246 S. W. 399; Sims v. State, 258 S.

More recent decisions on the point are Ross v. State, 100 Tex. Crim. Rep. 295, 273 S. W. 582; Thomas v. State, 101 Tex. Crim. Rep. 144, 274 S.
