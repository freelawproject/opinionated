Upon conviction his punishment was assessed at six months\u2019 imprisonment in the penitentiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-11\">The recognizance appearing in the record is fatally defective in that it recites only that appellant was adjudged guilty of \u201cdriving an auto while under the influence of intoxicating liquor.\u201d It is not an offense to drive an automobile while intoxicated unless it be driven on a public road or other prohibited place. Art. 802, P. C.; McFadden v. State, 300 S. W. 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-12\">This court acquires no jurisdiction under the recognizance and the appeal must be dismissed, and it is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-13\">\n<em>Dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b531-14\">ON MOTION TO REINSTATE.</p>\n<author id=\"b531-15\">HAWKINS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AeY\">Since the dismissal of the appeal because of a defective recognizance, appellant has filed a motion in which it is stated \u201cthat he desired to perfect the record on appeal and to have the court pass on said cause on its merits. Wherefore he prays the court to reinstate said appeal and permit him to file all necessary pleadings and papers in said cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-16\">The motion presents no matter of which this court can take cognizance. No amended record accompanies the motion. The only thing appellant could have done to restore jurisdiction to this court would have been to file proper appeal bond in lieu of the defective recognizance. There is nothing in the motion to indicate that this has been done or attempted.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-17\">The motion to reinstate is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-18\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
