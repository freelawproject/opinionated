C., 1925.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">The title of the Act in question is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">\u201cAn Act making it unlawful for the fradulent taking of any chicken or turkey, making such offense a felony or a misdemeanor, prescribing punishment therefor, and declaring an emergency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">It was expressly decided in the recent case of Redding v. State, No. 11485, opinion delivered April 4, 1928, not yet officially reported, that the aforesaid Act of the legislature was invalid in that its title, quoted above, was in direct violation of the Constitution. It was said in the Redding case, supra:</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">\u201cThe attempted making of a single act, namely, the taking of a chicken or a turkey a felony or a misdemeanor, would be the combining of incongrous enactments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">It was further said:</p>\n<p id=\"b562-10\">\u201cWe have in Texas wholly aside from this Act a theft statute which makes the taking of chickens, etc., an offense whose punishment depends on the value of the property taken. See Title 17, Chap. 8, P. C., 1925.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-11\">The language of the opinion in the Redding case, supra, is a sufficient answer to all of appellant\u2019s contentions. The quoted part of the said Act of the Thirty-ninth Legislature at its First Called Session, relied on by appellant as taking the instant case out of the general felony theft statute, being wholly invalid, could not have the effect either of repealing the statute under which this prosecution was instituted or of ameliorating the punishment, as claimed by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-12\">This is the only question briefed by appellant or apparently relied on by him for a reversal, and there being no merit in same, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-13\">. <em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b562-14\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
