Witness unlocked the door to the designated room and got six bottles of beer, for which he paid appellant 31-50. Witness also tetified that the beer was intoxicating. Appellant did not testify and offered no witness in his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">In a motion for new trial sworn to by appellant\u2019s attorney it is averred that appellant was at the time of trial and for more than a year prior thereto had been in such a mental condition due to advanced age that he did not realize at times what he did and was of such impaired mental capacity as not to be responsible for his acts; that he was helpless physically, aged, infirm and of failing memory; that these facts were unknown to appellant\u2019s attorney at the time of the trial because he was not employed as counsel until after the state had announced ready for trial and that appellant\u2019s counsel did not realize appellant\u2019s mental condition until after the trial was well under way, at which time he did not have an opportunity to investigate the matter, and that it was impossible for counsel to ascertain appellant\u2019s mental condition until after the trial was over. Attached to the motion is the affidavit of three witnesses to the effect that they had known appellant for many years, and that for some time prior to the date of the alleged offense and his trial therefor appellant had been in a helpless physical condition and was unable to go about without the aid of other persons; .that he was at an advanced age, probably well into the eighties, and did not seem to realize at all times clearly what he was doing, that he did not seem to realize he was to be tried for an offense and that his memory was failing him from the feebleness of old age.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">This court is confronted with a recital in the order overruling the motion for new trial as follows: \u201cThe court having heard the motion and the evidence thereon submitted is of the opinion that the same should be refused.\u201d No evidence heard on the motion is brought forward either by separate statement of facts or in a bill of exception complaining of the overruling of the motion. Under such circumstances we must presume that the evidence before the court authorized his action. Wilson v. State, 99 Tex. Crim. Rep. 561, 271 S. W. 104, and cases cited therein; Reese v.
