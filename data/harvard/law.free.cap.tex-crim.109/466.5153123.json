Appellant is a brother of Tim Ingram, appellant in that case, and was implicated by the state in the same occurrence and under the same circumstances, and by the same testimony. His defense also is that of an alibi, and a number of witnesses were introduced who testified that he was at another and different place on the night Mr. Allen\u2019s store was entered and he was held up and robbed of fifty dollars.
