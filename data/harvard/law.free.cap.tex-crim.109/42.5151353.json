F. Garrison owned a camp house on the shore of Lake Worth. It was kept closed and locked, but was used by Garrison for week-end vacations. While it was owned and possessed by him it was entered by force by someone in November. A number of articles were stolen. Part of the property, namely, the rug and floor pillows, were obtained from the abode of the appellant and were produced in court and identified by Garrison.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-12\">Appellant testified in his own behalf and disclaimed any connection with the burglary. He testified and introduced other testimony upon the subject of alibi. He denied that he had ever told Mrs. Massey that he had stolen the blanket.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-13\">There are three bills of exceptions. From the first bill it appears that on his direct examination the appellant testified that the blanket and pillow were first seen by him at his mother\u2019s house on the bed upon which he slept, he and his wife at that time residing with his mother. Appellant sought to testify that upon observing the blanket and pillow he asked his wife about them and that she told him \u201cthat she got them from a man and that she came into possession of them by lawful means.\u201d According to the state\u2019s testimony, the blanket and pillow were, at the request of Mrs. Hattie Massey (mother of the appellant\u2019s wife), moved from the home of the appellant\u2019s mother to that of the witness. Prior to the date of the removal mentioned, appellant and his wife had been living at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>the home of the appellant\u2019s mother. The witness testified that on the night after the articles were brought to her house, appellant told her that he got the blanket mentioned for his wife. Nadene Massey, the young sister of the appellant\u2019s wife, testified that she heard a conversation between her mother, the appellant and his wife, in which the appellant said: \u201cHow do you like the blanket I got for Thelma?\u201d Her mother replied: \u201cIt is all right. Where did you get it?\u201d Appellant said: \u201cI stole it out of a camp at Lake Worth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">It is to be observed that the state does not rely upon the circumstance of recent possession of stolen property alone, nor is the proffered testimony a declaration explaining the possession of recently stolen property made at the time the right to the possession was challenged. The proffered testimony seems more properly classified as an effort upon the part of the appellant to prove a hearsay. declaration of the wife explanatory of her possession of the property. The rule permitting proof of a declaration of the possession of stolen property relates to an explanation made when the right is first challenged. Cleveland v. State, 57 Tex. Crim. Rep. 356; and other authorities in Branch\u2019s Ann. Tex. P. C., Sec. 2465, Subd. 13; also Cameron v. State, 44 Tex. Rep. 652, and cases cited in Branch\u2019s Ann. Tex. P. C., Sec. 2464, Subd. 5. That the offered testimony was a declaration of the wife coincident with the appellant\u2019s first knowledge of her possession of the property rests upon his testimony alone. If, in fact, he had no previous knowledge of the burglary, he was not guilty of the offense, and the fact that his wife may have made an explanation of her possession of it would* have added nothing to his defense. It is believed, however, that the alleged declaration was properly excluded under the rule against hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">It appears from bill No. 2 that the appellant\u2019s wife was charged with burglary in connection with the same transaction as that upon which her husband was convicted. Upon her trial there was a verdict of guilty and the sentence suspended upon the recommendation of the jury. By Art. 711, C. C. P., 1925, co-indictees of the same offense are not available to each other as witnesses unless \u2019the prosecution against one of them is terminated by acquittal or dismissal. Until the prosecution is dismissed, one under a suspended sentence is not a competent witness for his co-indictees. See Majors v. State, 273 S. W. 267; Watts v. State, 75 Tex. Crim. Rep. 330; Sunday v. State, 77 Tex. Crim. Rep. 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>It appears from bill No. 3 that the state, over the objection of the appellant, proved the value of the stolen property to have been seventy-five dollars. This being a case of burglary in which the value of the stolen articles was not material, the proof mentioned was unnecessary, but we fail to perceive in what respect it could have injured the accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">We do not concur in the appellant\u2019s view that it was incumbent upon the court to instruct the jury upon the law of circumstantial evidence. It is believed that the confessions of the appellant which were proved were sufficient to classify the case as one not depending upon circumstantial evidence alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b67-8\">ON MOTION FOR REHE\u00c1RING.</p>\n<author id=\"b67-9\">LATTIMORE, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"ADX\">A vigorous assault is made upon our holding it not error to refuse to charge on circumstantial evidence. The complaint was brought forward in bill of exceptions No. 4. Upon more careful examination and reflection we have concluded that we were in error in this particular.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-10\">The offense charged was burglary. We based our holding that this was not a case of circumstantial evidence upon the proposition that that the state did not rely alone upon the circumstance of recent possession of stolen property, but that the confessions of appellant were in evidence and, therefore, the case was not one wholly dependent upon circumstantial evidence. The state relied upon the finding in the possession of the appellant\u2019s wife some weeks after the alleged burglary, of a Navajo blanket and pillow which were identified by the owner of the alleged burglarized premises as being his property, and as having disappeared from the burglarized camp house at or about that time. This property was found in the home of appellant\u2019s mother-in-law, which was apparently occupied by appellant\u2019s wife, her mother, and a sister and brother of appellant\u2019s wife. It is not quite clear that appellant was staying at said place at the time the alleged stolen property was found there. Inasmuch as nothing shows that said blanket and pillow were found in any such possession of appellant as would appear personal or exclusive in him, the weight of its finding as a guilty circumstance against appellant is very questionable. Russell v. State, 218 S. W. 1049.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-11\">The confessions referred to appear to be found in the testimony of appellant\u2019s mother-in-law, Mrs. Massey, and her daughter, Nadene Massey. Nadene\u2019s testimony is set out in the original opinion. She says she heard a conversation between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>her mother and appellant in which appellant said, \u201cHow do you like the blanket I got for Thelma ?\u201d, to which the mother replied, \u201cIt is all right. Where did you get it?\u201d and that appellant said, \u201cI stole it out of a camp at Lake Worth.\u201d The testimony of Mrs. Massey as to what appellant said, apparently on the same occasion, is as follows: She says appellant said to her, \u201cHow do you like Thelma\u2019s blanket; did you see Thelma\u2019s blanket?\u201d, to which witness replied, \u201cYes.\u201d Appellant then said: \u201cHow do you like it ?\u201d and witness said, \u201cIt is all right,\u201d and appellant replied, \u201cI got that for her.\u201d She avers that is all she heard. Giving to this alleged confession its strongest probative force, same falls short of any confession on the part of appellant of a burglary. Winn v. State, 198 S. W. 965; Beason v. State, 63 S. W. 633; Beason v. State, 67 S. W. 96; Cabrera v. State, 118 S. W. 1064 (citation and discussion of authorities collated in dissenting opinion by Ramsey, J.); Davis v. State, 295 S. W. 608. Practically the exact point was decided in some of the cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">The owner of the alleged burglarized premises testified that he had a camp house on Lake Worth and that he did not visit same for about three weeks during November, 1926. During the time of his absence the house was broken and entered and a large quantity of personal property taken. None of it was traced to appellant in any way save the blanket and pillow above mentioned. It is clear that after the screens were tom from the house and same was broken and entered at the time of the burglary, same was open to the entrance of any other person who may have desired to commit theft or any other depredation, such theft not being burglary. That appellant may have committed theft by entering the house after it was burglarized, and taking therefrom only the blanket and pillow in question, would be easily possible. This is said in order that it may be apparent that his confession of the theft would be tantamount to a confession of the burglary, in a case yrhose facts were as those before us. There might be cases where the burglary and theft were so closely related and in such juxtaposition that the confession of the one would be substantially an admission of the other, but it is plain, as is discussed in the cases above cited, that the confession of the theft is sometimes no more than a circumstance to be considered by the jury in determining the question of guilt of the burglary. We have no doubt of the fact that the court below was in error in assuming that the confession of theft of the blanket and pillow relieved this case of being one on circumstantial evidence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>Appellant excepted to the failure of the court to so charge, and asked a special charge on that phase of the case. For what we now believe to be the error of the court in this regard, the motion for rehearing is granted, the affirmance set aside, and the judgment reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
