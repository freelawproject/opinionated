He did not testify and called no witness to combat the incriminating facts proven against him. This statement disposes of bills of exception one and two, which challenge in different ways the sufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">As qualified bill of exception number three shows no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">Appellant objected to the argument of the District Attorney wherein he called attention to the fact that the indictment against appellant had been filed in December, 1925, but that an alias capias showed that he had not been arrested until January, 1927, the objection being that the alias capias was not in evidence, and that the remarks of the District Attorney was an insinuation that appellant had been \u201cdodging arrest.\u201d In approving the bill the learned trial judge explained that appellant\u2019s counsel had argued that one Wade had been convicted of the same offense with which appellant was charged, but that appellant had not been tried for more than a year after Wade\u2019s conviction, and commented upon the \u201cstrange procedureit was in reply to such argument that the District Attorney alluded to the alias capias. The learned trial judge further certifies that he instructed the jury that they were to consider nothing but the facts in evidence. Conceding that the District Attorney should not have referred to a return on ^the alias capias \u2014 it not having been introduced in evidence \u2014 still we can not regard the circumstance as calling for a reversal. Appellant\u2019s guilt appears plain and the minimum penalty only was awarded. Hence injury resulting from the incident seems unlikely.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">The court was not in error in refusing a special charge on accomplice testimony. The evidence does not appear to raise such an issue, especially in view of Art. 670, P. C.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b321-11\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b321-12\">LATTIMORE, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AfB\">Responding to appellant\u2019s courteous motion for rehearing, we have again examined the record with a view of determining the sufficiency of the testimony to show appellant guilty of transporting intoxicating liquor. The state witness testified positively that appellant came to her house at night with a grip which he asked to leave there for a while, the next morning witness looked in the grip and it contained whiskey. During the day appellant came, .and removed part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>of the liquor, and later he removed it all. It will thus be seen that he was guilty of transporting both ways.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-3\">Being unable to agree with the proposition that the evidence does not support the verdict, the motion for rehearing will be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
