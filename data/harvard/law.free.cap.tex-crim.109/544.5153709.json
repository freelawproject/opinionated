The former opinion will be found in 106 Tex. Crim. Rep. 564, 293 S. W. 1101.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">The only testimony came from an officer who made the search of appellant\u2019s premises by virtue of a search warrant and found in a hen-house near appellant\u2019s residence a quantity of whiskey in half-gallon fruit jars. The evidence of this witness was objected to because the search warrant was based upon an affidavit which upon its face shows to have been made solely upon \u201cinformation and belief,\u201d without stating any fact or information upon which such belief was founded. The affidavit is made a part of the bill of exception and verifies the truth of the objection urged. The evidence should have been rejected. Chapin v. State, 107 Tex. Crim. Rep. 477, 296 S. W. 1095. Many cases following Chapin will be found noted in Sutton v. State, 300 S. W. 630. More recent cases are McLennan v. State, 3 S. W. (2nd) 451; Stevenson v. State, 2 S. W. (2nd) 453; Dixon v.
