Although appellant\u2019s wife, who had become sick, was at the home of John Lucas at the time of the raid, we think the record reflects the fact that the house entered by the officers was appellant\u2019s private dwelling. The wife of appellant was, according to one of appellant\u2019s witnesses, staying at the home of John Lucas during her illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-15\">The affidavit upon which the search warrant was issued was made upon information and belief and the grounds of belief were not therein exhibited. Appellant timely objected to the testimony of the officers touching the results of the search and excepted to the action of the court in admitting the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-16\">A warrant to search a private dwelling occupied as such, based upon an affidavit made upon information and belief in which there is given no fact, circumstance, or detailed information showing or tending to show that the dwelling is-used for a purpose denounced by Art. 691, P. C., is unauthorized and a search thereunder is illegal. Chapin v. State, 296 S. W. 1095; Ferguson v. State, 300 S.
