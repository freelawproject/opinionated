By complaint and information it was charged that appellant and one Willie Bell had stolen an automobile of the value of 81,250 and that said act of theft constituted the parties delinquent children, it being alleged that they were under sixteen years of age. All of the elements of theft were properly set out in the complaint and information, which seems in all respects to comply with Art. 1085, C. C. P. The evidence seems to establish beyond question that on the night of December 16, 1927, appellant and said Willie Bell stole a Buick automobile of the value of |1,250 from in front of the schoolhouse in Crosbyton and started with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>it to New Mexico. This was proven not only by appellant\u2019s confession but was sworn to by him on this delinquency proceeding. No complaint is brought forward by bill of exception of any proceeding upon the trial. The facts show that appellant\u2019s father was present and testified at such time.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
