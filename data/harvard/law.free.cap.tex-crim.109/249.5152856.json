He said:</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">\u201cI don\u2019t know just what per cent of alcohol it did have in it. I did not have it analyzed. * * * I do not know how much alcohol it had in it, but a pretty good per cent though.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">When the witness said he did not have it analyzed, he added: \u201cI do not know whether that was the occasion or not, but I carried it up to Mr. Brouss, I believe I did.\u201d The State\u2019s Attorney then said: \u201cHere is the analysis.\u201d Counsel for the defendant objected to the analysis until somebody came and identified it. The objection was sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">Counsel for the defense, in his argument to the jury, said:</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">\u201cWhy didn\u2019t the state have this \u2018choc\u2019 analyzed, if it had any. alcohol in it? They ought not to ask a jury to guess a man into the penitentiary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-10\">Thereupon, State\u2019s Attorney said: \u201cIf you want the analysis, here it is.\u201d The court instructed the jury not to consider the remarks of the County Attorney. Other like exchanges of comments by the opposing counsel were made, and instructions to disregard those of the prosecution were given to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-12\">Under the facts, counsel for the state was not warranted in interrupting the remarks of appellant\u2019s counsel by tendering the analysis or tendering the paper which intimated that it was the analysis. The court properly sustained the objection to the document because there was no proof that it was the analysis. However, in view of the record, we fail to peirceive the possibility of harm to the appellant from the procedure. There was but one witness who testified, and his testimony was definite that he had tasted the liquid which was found upon the appellant\u2019s premises; that it was what was known as \u201cchoc beer\u201d and was intoxicating liquor. This was not controverted by any testimony. There was no effort to impeach the state\u2019s witness,</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>and no testimony was offerd by the appellant. In that state of the record, it seems manifest that there could have been no more favorable verdict to the appellant upon the undisputed facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b273-7\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b273-8\">LATTIMORE, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AQ2y\">In passing on the contentions made by appellant it must be borne in mind that the accused was given the lowest penalty, and that no testimony was before the jury save that of the one state witness who testified positively to the fact that he found in appellant\u2019s possession a large quantity of choc beer, that he drank some of it, and that it was, intoxicating liquor. In view of these facts we are unable to conclude that the conduct of the District Attorney either in what was done during the introduction of evidence or in the argument, even if deemed by the trial court to be of such nature as to call for an instruction to the jury not to consider it \u2014 should call for reversal. When the evidence is plain and a violation of the law is made out, and the lowest penalty inflicted, we do not reverse for matters whose only effect could be to create prejudice in the minds of the jury against the accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">The motion for rehearing will be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-10\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
