A few days prior to the killing appellant had a fight with Milford Long, brother-in-law of deceased. Appellant introduced evidence of communicated threats made by deceased against him to a third person when he heard of this fight; also that Milford Long, his brother Ben and deceased, all three, hunted for appellant on the day of the homicide, found him at a carnival stand, from whence appellant ran to an adjoining stand, pursued by the three, and where he was attacked by Ben Long with a scantling, at which time he shot Ben Long, and almost immediately thereafter shot deceased. The issue of manslaughter was overwhelmingly raised by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">In charging upon this issue, the court said in part: \u201cIn determining the adequacy of the provocation * * * if you find that by reason of anything deceased did <em>at the time, </em>or by reason of anything deceased and Ben Long did <em>at the time, </em>or by reason of any threats made by deceased, or. by Ben Long, made <em>to the defendant at the time,\u201d </em>etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-11\">This charge restricted the jury\u2019s consideration to acts and threats of Ben Long or deceased \u201cat the time\u201d of the killing. It eliminated a consideration by the jury of a joint attack, by the three, or at least the joint action of the three above set-out, and also eliminated previous threats made by deceased to third persons and thereafter communicated to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-12\">This charge was unduly restrictive under the facts of this case and has been many times condemned. Brookerson v. State, 242 S. W. 234; Norris v. State, 42 Tex. Crim. Rep. 567; Gant v. State, 55 Tex. Crim. Rep. 291.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-13\">If the facts showing adequate cause are collated, they should be correctly stated. Wheeler v. State, 54 Tex. Crim. Rep. 51; Branch\u2019s P. C., Sec. 2048. Especially is it error to mention a single attack when the evidence raises the issue of a joint one, and which further restricts the jury\u2019s consideration to matters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>happening at the very time of the homicide when there are in evidence matters happening prior thereto which might under all the facts in evidence constitute adequate cause. Miles v. State, 18 Tex. Crim. App. 170; Branch\u2019s P. C., Sec. 2049. It is always dangerous to give a charge attempting to group the facts showing adequate cause in a manslaughter case.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">A bill of exception appears in the record to the court\u2019s refusal to permit the witness Molin to testify to a purported res gestae statement of Milford Long to the effect that they (meaning himself, Ben Long and deceased) went out there \u201cto get appellant but he beat them to it.\u201d If the proximity of time and place and such circumstances as showed the spontaneity of this statement had been shown in the bill, it would present a serious question, but the bill is deficient in these respects and will not be considered. It is qualified in such manner as to show no error but the qualification was properly excepted to by appellant. We again call all trial courts\u2019 attention to the law which forbids our consideration of a qualification thus 'excepted to. Rochelle v. State, 294 S. W. 860; Ariola v. State, 289 S. W. 385. It is the trial court\u2019s duty to file a proper bill under such circumstances, failing in which, we will be forced to consider such bills without the qualifications. We say this in view of another trial and especially in view of the number of bills in the record in this condition, most of which, however, present frivolous matters not worthy of discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">The judgment of the trial court is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b137-9\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING BY STATE.</p>\n<author id=\"b137-10\">LATTIMORE, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"Ajn\">The state contends in its motion that we erred in holding the charge on adequate cause too restrictive. The court\u2019s charge on adequate cause is plainly so confusing and restrictive as to be capable of great harm. While same did in words tell the jury that they must consider all the facts and circumstances in the case in determining the adequacy of the provocation, yet in immediate connection therewith and as part of the same paragraph the court said:</p>\n<p id=\"b137-11\">\u201c* * * and if you find that by reason of anything the deceased did at the time or by reason of anything the deceased and Ben <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>Long did at the time, or by reason of any threat or threats made by the deceased or by said Ben Long made to the defendant, if any, at the time, that the defendant\u2019s mind at the time of the killing was incapable of cool reflection and that said facts and circumstances, if any, were sufficient to produce such state of mind in a person of ordinary temper, then the proof as to the sufficiency of the provocation satisfies the requirements of the law in this regard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">When the facts of a case show, as in this one, the presence of other prior facts and circumstances which might cause or contribute to produce the passion, excitement, etc., deemed by our statute to be adequate cause, and the possible acts of persons other than those named, the court should not in whole or in part restrict the jury\u2019s consideration of same to what occurs at the time, nor to the acts of the specified persons. As stated in the original opinion, threats and acts of said parties at other times and places were in evidence and might be considered by the jury in connection with what occurred at the time, in determining the question of adequate cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">The motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
