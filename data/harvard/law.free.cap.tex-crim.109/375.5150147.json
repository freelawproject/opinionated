A. <em>Dawson </em>of Canton, State\u2019s Attorney, for the State.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b398-6\">MARTIN, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AfRT\">Offense swindling, penalty $25.00 fine and ten days\u2019 confinement in the county jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">All the evidence given at the trial consists of four short paragraphs given by witness Rich. The substance of it is that appellant gave a check to one Arriola, who indorsed same to witness Rich, who in turn endorsed same to a \u201cLufkin bank and it was turned down by the bank when presented.\u201d Apprised of this, appellant agreed and did give to Rich a second check and received from Rich his first check. About this, witness testified:</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">\u201cFrank Parrott gave me the check upon which he is being prosecuted and it was turned down by the bank and I sent word to Mr. Parrott by mail that it had been refused by the bank fifteen days before this prosecution was instituted and it has never been paid yet. * * * The first check was no good but I would not have given it back to Frank if he had not given me this check. * * * I considered it worth its face value because of Mr. Arriola\u2019s endorsement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">The point is presented that since the check upon which the prosecution is based is shown to have been given for a former worthless check, the evidence is insufficient to constitute swindling, as nothing of value passed. The quoted testimony shows that proof was made apparently without objection that the check was worth its face value. It seems plain that an endorsed check might be a \u201cthing of value,\u201d as those words are used in Art. 1545 (4) of the Penal Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-10\">The latter check, upon which this prosecution was based, was not introduced in evidence and the record is utterly bare of any proof whatever that it was ever presented for payment to the bank on which it was drawn or payment ever refused by such bank, or for that matter, that it was ever legally presented for payment to any bank. It was turned down by \u201cthe bank.\u201d What bank? The information avers that Frank Parrott \u201cthen and there had no good reason to believe that said check would be paid by said bank when the same would be in the ordinary course of business presented to said bank for payment and said check was in due course of business presented to said bank and payment of said check was refused by said bank for want of sufficient funds,\u201d etc. There is an entire absence of testimony to support this allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>Any discussion by us of the constitutionality of the so-called \u201chot check\u201d law would be based upon an hypothesis not shown to exist in the instant case. We uniformly decline to be drawn into the discussion or decision of questions that are purely academic.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Because of the insufficiency of the evidence, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
