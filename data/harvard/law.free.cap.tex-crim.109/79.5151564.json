The word \u201ccock,\u201d according to modern lexicographers, has many meanings but none of them seem to be indecent or obscene. One of these definitions,\u201d according to Webster\u2019s International Dictionary, is: \u201cThe male of birds.\u201d Without some explanatory averment, we do not think the information is sufficient. Abendroth v. State, 34 Tex. Crim. Rep. 325; Edwards v. State, 47 Tex. Crim. Rep. 611. If in common parlance the picture and language had a vulgar meaning, the same should have been set out. We do not feel authorized to say that this court without any innuendo averment which makes it obscene and indecent meaning plain can judicially know that it would be interpreted by you as claimed by the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>Believing that the information is insufficient, the judgment is reversed and the prosecution ordered dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
