The statement of facts shows, however, that he had testified that the liquor was intoxicating.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-18\">It has been frequently held that the remark of a trial judge not calculated to operate prejudicially to the accused was hot reversible error. Wilson v. State, 17 Tex. Crim. App. 535. House v. State, 19 Tex. Crim. App. 239; Wofford v. State, 60 Tex. Crim. Rep. 628; Branch\u2019s P. C., Sec. 270. The effect of the remark of the court was merely to repeat the contention of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>counsel of appellant in the presence of the jury and we are not able to perceive how the same could have injured appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">The further contention is made that there was error because the District Attorney in his questions referred to the liquor in question as whiskey when it was in fact brandy. The court sustained appellant\u2019s objection but he seems to present the point that the mere asking of the question was so highly prejudicial as to constitute error. In a brief filed by appellant no authorities are cited and we do not believe any authority exists to support appellant\u2019s contention that a trifling matter of this kind would justify a reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">The evidence in our opinion being sufficient and no errors appearing in the record, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b363-9\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b363-10\">LATTIMORE, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"Ayx\">Appellant insists that we erred in practically each point decided in the original opinion. The testimony in the case was short. Four bills of exception were reserved. We have again reviewed each. We can not comprehend how the reference to the liquor sold by- appellant, as whiskey, by the District Attorney, could have inflicted injury. No testimony is offered supporting any inference that the jury were prejudiced or misled or influenced thereby. The second bill of exceptions which complains of repeated leading and suggestive questions, fails to set out any questions or any fact supporting the contention. The third bill sets out that while Smith Houston was being examined, he was asked whether or not the liquid was intoxicating. Counsel for appellant objected because this was but repetition. The court sustained the objection, saying \u201cHe has already testified he drank it and that it was intoxicating.\u201d The statute, Art. 707, C. C. P., says the court shall not comment upon the weight of the testimony, or its bearing on the case, nor make any remark calculated to convey to the jury his opinion of the case. It is held that for the court, in ruling upon an objection made, to say that the question has been answered is not erroneous. Bonners v. State, 35 S. W. 669; Smith v. State, 81 Tex. Crim. Rep. 368. This bill does not show that the question had not already been asked and answered in the affirmative. That it had been asked is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>evident from the very objection made, which was that it was a repetition. If the question had been asked and had been answered in the affirmative, then certainly the statement of that fact by the court was not a comment on the weight of the testimony, nor an indication of the court\u2019s opinion regarding the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">We are of opinion that the case was correctly decided, and the motion for rehearing will be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
