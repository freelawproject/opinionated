The jury accepted the state\u2019s evidence as true, which attributed the language to appellant and authorized the jury to find that he was intoxicated. Appellant and his witnesses attribute the language to one of appellant\u2019s companions and deny that appellant was drunk. The jury has settled the issue of fact in favor of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-10\">The trial term of court adjourned on the 11th day of November. Appellant\u2019s motion for new trial was overruled on the 7th day of November and sixty days\u2019 time allowed him in which to file bills of exception. A number of bills of exception are contained in the first supplemental transcript. Some of them were filed on the 1st day of February, and others on the 7th day of February. The sixty days allowed for filing them expired on the 6th day of January. None of the bills was approved by the trial judge or filed in the lower court until long after the time given had expired.
