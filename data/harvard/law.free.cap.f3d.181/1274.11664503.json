He did not appeal his sentences and is presently incarcerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-21\">In May 1996, appellant moved the district court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (1994) to vacate his sentences, contending that he had received ineffective assistance of counsel from his trial attorney because, at his sentencing hearing, his attorney failed (1) to seek an adjustment of his base offense level to reflect a mitigating role in the offense and (2) to argue that the amount of cocaine involved in the conspiracy (which the court used to establish appellant\u2019s base offense level) was not reasonably foreseeable to appellant. The court\u2018denied appellant\u2019s motion, and he did not appeal its ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-22\">In May 1998, appellant returned to the district court, this time with a petition for a writ of error coram nobis. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651(a) (1994). In his petition, appellant asked the court to vacate his sentence, and grant a new sentencing hearing, on the ground that, in fashioning his sentences, the court erroneously enhanced his base offense level for obstruction of justice. The court denied the writ, whereupon appellant lodged this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-23\">Coram nobis relief is unavailable to a person, such as the appellant, who is still in custody. <em>United States v. </em>Brown, 117 F.3d 471, 475 (11th Cir.1997). According<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1275\">*1275</page-number>ly, the district court properly denied appellant\u2019s application for the writ. The question alises as to whether we could treat appellant\u2019s application as a motion for relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (since it seeks the precise relief that \u00a7 2255 affords). A recent amendment to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A) (West Supp.1998), however, precludes us from doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-4\">As noted, appellant has already made one \u00a7 2255 attack on his sentence; thus, his application for coram nobis relief, if treated as a motion filed pursuant to \u00a7 2255, would be successive. Section 2244(b)(3)(A), as amended by \u00a7 106 of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Pub L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214, 1220-21, provides that a successive \u00a7 2255 petition may not be filed in the district court without leave of the court of appeals. Such leave may be granted only if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1345-5\">(A) the applicant shows that [his] claim relies on a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1345-6\">(B)(i) if the factual predicate for the claim could not have been discovered through due diligence; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1345-7\">(ii) the facts underlying the claim, if proven and viewed in the light of the evidence as a whole, would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that, but for the constitutional error, no reasonable fact finder would have found the applicant guilty of the underlying offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1345-8\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(2) (West Supp.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-9\">Because appellant does not seek leave to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, we treat his application to the district court as an application for a writ of coram nobis. Because the district court properly denied the application, we affirm its judgement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
