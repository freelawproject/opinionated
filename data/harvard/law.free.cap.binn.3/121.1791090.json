On this process <em>Alexander M'-Keehan </em>was in custody and discharged by the comptroller general. The money arising out of these sales after certain deductions, amounted to 1736 dollars and 40 cents. A question having been raised, whether <em>James Car others </em>and <em>Geortye M'-Keehan </em>. . . , , . <em>J </em>, \u201c , . wcre mtitled to this money, or the commonwealth, a written <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>agreement, dated 23d <em>March </em>1799, was therefore entered into between <em>Jared Ingersoll </em>and <em>Thomas </em>Duncan, which was in. these words: \u201c It is agreed by <em>Jared Ingersoll </em>on behalf \u201c of the commonwealth, and <em>Thomas Duncan </em>counsel for \u201c <em>James Carothers </em>and <em>George </em>M'-Keehan, claiming the \u201c moneys arising from these sales, that <em>Jacob Crevor </em>shall \u201c deposit in his own name in the bank of <em>Pennsylvania </em>the \u201c proceeds thereof as stated in this account, except the \u201cjudgment bond of <em>James </em>Blaine, for the sum of-dol~ \u201c Iars, which it is agreed <em>shall remain until the court deter- </em>\u201c <em>mine between the </em>claimants, <em>and the moneys deposited in the </em>\u201c <em>bank shall remain likewise subject to the decision of the </em>\u201c <em>court on a case </em>stated,, <em>or otherwise as may be agreed onP </em>This question was decided in favour of the commonwealth, and a demand made upon <em>Crevor </em>in <em>March </em>1805, and not before. <em>Jacob Crevor </em>did deposit the above money in the bank of <em>Pennsylvania </em>on the 23d <em>March </em>1799, but except a balance of 146 dollars and <em>50 </em>cents, it was taken out by him in <em>March, July, </em>and <em>August </em>1799, <em>December </em>1801, and <em>November </em>1802, and the balance was taken out in 1807.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-9\">The question for the Circuit Court was whether the commonwealth was intitled to interest upon the moneys thus deposited by <em>Crevor, </em>and if so, from what period.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-10\">After argument his honour was of opinion that the commonwealth was intitled to interest upon the respective items from the time they were taken from the bank, the presumption being that the sheriff made use of the money. And from this decision the defendant appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b130-11\"><em>Duncan </em>for the defendant</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AjX\">said, it did not appear that the -sheriff had not the money ready when he was bound to pay it, nor that he had made use of it; but if this were the case, still the question would be, whether when the principal is not demandable, interest accrues; and here the commonwealth consented not to demand the principal until the contest with <em>Carothers </em>and <em>M'-Keehan </em>should be settled. She in fact sufiered no damage, for she had agreed that the money should lie idle during the pendency of the dispute; and therefore the principle upon which interest is usually adjudged, does not apply. There has been no delay of payment, no refusal upon demand,,no loss to the party .claiming interest.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b131-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number><em>Gibson </em>and <em>Watts </em>for the commonwealth</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AbX\">answered, that the agreement, upon which alone a distinction could be attempted, was to be put out of view, because it had not been complied with. The commonwealth was willing, to lose \u00bfhe use of the money, in order to get a complete security for it, and to receive it.promptly when her right should be decided; but the defendant violated his agreement, and therefore he shall derive no benefit from it. If money is received by one for another, and retained without the consent of the owner, it carries interest. It is the same as money lent. <em>Rapelje </em>v. <em>Emory </em><footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark>, <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Willing </em><footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark>, <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Smith </em><footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark>. This was precisely the defendant\u2019s case. There could however be no doubt, that <em>Crevor </em>had used the money. It was a violent presumption from his taking it out of bank.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b131-12\"><em> </em>1 <em>Dali. </em>349.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"ATb\"> 4 <em>Dali. </em>286.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"(c)\">\n<p id=\"A98h\"> 4 <em>Dali. </em>389.-</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b131-4\">Tilgiiman C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ao5\">delivered judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">The defendant\u2019s argument is founded on a fallacy. He contends that interest should not be paid, because the commonwealth has suffered no damage; and to prove that no damage has been sustained, he relies on the agreement, that the money should be deposited in bank until it was decided whether the commonwealth was intitled to the principal. But the truth is, that the commonwealth has suffered damage by nonpayment of the money, to which it was intitled, and which was in the hands of the defendant; and the defendant does not pretend that interest would not have been recoverable, if the agreement was out of the question. But the defendant has broken the agreement; and it would be extraordinary indeed, if his case should be strengthened thereby. It is considered as settled that interest shall be recoveredagainstaman, who receives the money of another, and holds it against his consent. Now in this case, the defendant has withheld and no doubt made use of the money of the commonwealth, not only against the consent of the attorney ge ieral, but in direct violation of his agreement to leave it in bank. He has destroyed the security which he agreed to give, thereby depriving the commonwealth of all benefit of the agreement, yet insists that he himself is to take advantage of it. This is con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>trary to all ideas of justice. The commonwealth has the same right to interest, as if the agreement had never been made. The judgment of the Circuit Court must therefore be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-11\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
