He had therefore made out the list,in which were about forty master hatters. He expected they would prove something. Many of them would not tell him what they could prove, and he had no way to ascertain their knowledge, but by bringing them to court.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b423-4\"><em>Milnor </em>and <em>Candy </em>for the prosecution,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AK8W\">said that the case was in some respects peculiar. It was an indictment of seven defendants for a conspiracy, which required proof from a variety of persons as to their acts with each other, and with third persons. The conspiracy was an extensive one, and it became necessary to pursue it steadily and through all its windings. It happened that the first thirteen witnesses proved the case sufficiently, and therefore the rest were not called. But there was no evidence of oppression. The mere circumstance of there being many witnesses who were not called, is nothing. <em>De Benneville </em>v. <em>De Benneville. </em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>It was impossible to say how many would be wanted.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b423-12\"> 1 <em>Binn. </em>46.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b423-5\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AWS\">The number of witnesses summoned seems extravagant. We would not encourage the practice of the public prosecutor\u2019s permitting the man who institutes the prosecution, to summon as many as he pleases. This case is in some respects of a singular nature. There were seven defendants, and they were connected with others not defendants. The court will therefore allow the costs of <em>twenty-six, </em>witnesses, double the number sworn, provided the counsel can name so many, who in their opinion were material.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
