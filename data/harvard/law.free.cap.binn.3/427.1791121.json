The same section puts <em>amicable </em>actions upon a similar footing, unless otherwise provided in the agreement. <em>7 St. Laws </em>563. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>only question is whether if special bail is entered at the beginning of a suit, it does not supersede the necessity of entering it after the suit is ended? And why should it not? It is precisely the same security, at whatever time it is entered, and is of the same advantage to the plaintiff. The legislature did not intend that if special bail had been already entered, the defendant should procure it a second time. It would be a vain thing as it respects one party, and an oppressive one as to the other. Though it may be within the letter, it is not within the spirit and meaning of the law. There was no design that the special bail should be cumulative, but only that there should be bail for the forthcoming of the defendant\u2019s person, while he was seeking security for debt and costs; and it will answer that purpose if it has been entered at the beginning of the suit.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b436-8\"><em>A. Shoemaker </em>for the defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ATFj\">The privilege of a stay for thirty days is one to which the defendant below was not intitlqd at common law. The act gives it to him, and he must take it upon the terms of the act. It is enough that the law is so written, and it has been the practice to construe this arbitration law strictly. But there is a substantial reason for it. Bail which was not excepted to at the commencement of the suit, may become bad before the end of it. It may be insufficient for the debt; and the legislature in postponing the execution after a debt was ascertained, did not mean that the plaintiff should incur the least risk. In fact the defendant below shewed this to be his own construction of the law, by entering bail after judgment; but this having been excepted to and not justified, was of no effect.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b436-9\">Tilghman C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AF4\">This is a writ of error to the court of. Common Pleas of <em>Philadelphia </em>county. The error complained of, is in issuing the execution. It was an amicable action entered by agreement qn/t'he 8th of <em>December </em>1810, and submitted to arbitration. On the day of entering the action, special bail was entered by the defendant in 800 dollars. On the 11th <em>January </em>1811, a report of the arbitrators for 404 dollars 00 cents in favour of the plaintiff was- filed, and judgment entered; and on the 4th <em>February </em>1811, the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>tiff took outran execution. The plaintiff in error, who was defendant below, contends, that having entered special bail, he was intitled to a stay of execution for thirty days after the judgment. But this is denied by the defendant in error, who says that the law gave no stay of execution, because security in the nature of special bail was not entered <em>after </em>thejudgment.</p>\n<p id=\"AM3\">It is enacted in the eleventh section of the act regulating arbitrations (20th <em>March </em>1810,) that where judgment has been rendered for any sum of money, \u201c the like stay of exe- \u201c cution shall be had under the like regulations, as are pro- \u201c vided by the seventh section of an act, intitled an act to \u201cregulate arbitrations and proceedings in courts of justice, \u201c passed 21st <em>March </em>1806.\u201d The provision in the seventh section of the act referred to, is as follows. In all suits instituted by capias or summons, the execution shall be stayed on the judgment, if it shall not exceed 200 dollars, six months; if not exceeding 400 dollars, nine months; and if exceeding 400 dollars, twelve months from the first day of the term to which the original process was returnable, if the defendant in the opinion of the court, is possessed of a freehold estate, worth the amount of such judgment <em>dear of incumbrances,; </em>but if the defendant is not a freeholder <em>as </em>aforesaid, then execution may issue immediately, unless the defendant shall enter <em>security in the nature of special bail, </em>in which case there shall be a stay of execution thirty days; and if at or before the expiration of that time, the defendant shall give security for the amount of debt interest and costs, such defendant shall be intitled to the same stay of execution as if he was a freeholder, \u201c and the like stay of execution shall be had upon \u201cjudgments obtained in <em>amicable actions, </em>unless when it is \u201c differently provided for by the parties in their terms of \u201c agreement, counting from the date of the agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">The intent of this provision is very plain. If the defendant is a freeholder, possessed of <em>clear </em>real estate to the amount of the judgment, he is intitled to the stay of execution above mentioned, without giving any kind of bail or security. But if he is not <em>such a freeholder, </em>he is subject to <em>immediate </em>execution unless he gives security <em>in nature of special bail. </em>If such security is entered, the plaintiff is sufli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>ciently safe, and there shall be a stay of execution for thirty days from the judgment, in order to give the defendant time to enter security for debt and costs, if he shall think proper. But in the case before us, special bail was entered not after the judgment, but at the commencement of the action. It is out of the letter, but clearly within the <em>spirit </em>of the law. For what can be the occasion of entering <em>security in nature of special bail, </em>when <em>special bail itself </em>has been entered? What advantage will the plaintiff gain by it? It increases the costs, and oppresses the defendant for no useful purpose. This provision was made for the benefit of the defendant, and is intitled to a favourable construction, as far as it can be made without injuring the plaintiff. If the special bail entered before the judgment, was not in a sufficient sum to secure the amount recovered, there might be reason for entering security in the nature of special bail <em>after </em>the judgment. But that is not the present case. When such a case shall arise, it will be time enough to give an opinion on it. Here the bail was much more than sufficient. I am therefore of opinion that the defendant was intitled to a stay of execution for thirty days after the judgment, and consequently the execution was issued erroneously.</p>\n<author id=\"b438-7\">Yeates J.</author>\n<p id=\"A1HN\">I am unfortunate enough to dissent from the construction of the law as insisted on by the counsel of the plaintiffin error. I am bound to express my own opinion. The eleventh section of the \u201c act regulating arbitrations\u201d passed 20th <em>March 1810, </em>incorporates under certain provisions, the seventh section of the arbitration law of the 21st <em>March </em>1806 as to the stay of writs of execution upon judgments. 7 <em>St. Laws </em>563. The words of this seventh section are very general and comprehensive, and include \u201c all suits instituted \u201c either by capias or summons in any court of record within \u201c this commonwealth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">The now plaintiff in error, who was the defendant below, does not appear to be a freeholder, and therefore under the particular circumstances of the case, would be intitled to a stay of execution of twelve months, counting from the 8th, <em>December </em>1810 when the suit originated, provided he has, conformed to the act. In such case\u2019, th\u2019\u25a0 law directs, \u201c that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>41 execution may <em>immediately </em>issue, unless the defendant 44 shall enter surety in the nature of special bail, in which' 44 case there shall be a stay of execution for thirty days; and if 44 at or before the expiration of that term, the defendant 44 shall give security for the amount of debt interest and 44 costs, such defendant shall be intitled to the same stay of 44 execution, as if he was a freeholder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b439-3\">It is asked why shall the defendant enter special bail a second time? The law intended to grant a benefit to the debtor; but such a construction would be oppressive on him. 'It is answered that he thereby intitles himself to a stay of execution for thirty days, during which period he may provide other security for the payment of the debt interest and costs. The special bail first entered was, that the defendant should pay the condemnation money and costs, if cast in the action, or surrender himself a prisoner to the sheriff of the county. But by this new security he elects to have the benefit of the stay of execution; and the words 44 that exe44 cution may <em>immediately </em>issue unless &amp;c.\u201d are susceptible of no other construction. The entry of special bail to the action in its commencement, does not of itself prevent the plaintin from issuing execution after judgment, within the terms used by the lawmakers. Should this answer be deemed unsatisfactory, I have only to remark, that the intention of the legislature, whatever may be its grounds, is clearly and distinctly expressed in the clause under consideration. 1 <em>Black. Com. </em>94, <em>Christian's note </em>21. It embraces all suits originating by capias, wh\u00e9ther the defendant be admitted to bail, returned in custody, or his appearance be accepted. Such was the idea of the defendant\u2019s counsel in the Common Pleas, when <em>Ira Allen </em>entered into a recognisance after the judgment; but he was afterwards excepted to, and formally waived. It was therefore incumbent on the defendant below to find sufficient bail to intitle himself to the benefit of the act; and on failure thereof, I think the court were warranted in the award of execution. I am for affirming the judgment of the court of Common Pleas.</p>\n<judges id=\"b439-4\">Brackenridge J. expressed his concurrence with the Chief Justice.</judges>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">Execution set aside.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
