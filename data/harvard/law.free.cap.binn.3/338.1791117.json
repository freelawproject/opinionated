The present action was for <em>money had and </em>received, to recover the interest of <em>Swift </em>in the shipment, both as partner of Plumstead, and also in <em>Plumstead\u2019s </em>right, by assignment from the Bank of North America, who held the original bill of lading with a blank indorsement from <em>Plum-</em>Mead., as a security, and had transferred it to <em>Swift </em>upon being, paid their claim. Both the account and power of attorney, referred to in the decree of <em>the </em>court, spoke of <em>Plumstead </em>as being deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-10\">The referees reported in favour of <em>Swift </em>4924 dollars and 60 cents, being the whole amount principal and interest which the defendant had received from his attachment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-11\">The exceptions were two, 1. That the referees erred in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>fact, in taking for granted that <em>Swift </em>was jointly interested with <em>Plumstead </em>in the shipment to <em>St. Domingo; </em>whereas he' either was not so at all, or only in a small degree. 2. That they erred in law in not considering the attachment and proceedings in <em>St. </em>Domingo, relative to the property, as conclusive against <em>Plumstead, </em>Swift, and the Bank.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b347-9\">Upon their examination relative to the facts, the referees stated that they did not take <em>Swift\u2019s </em>interest for granted. They were satisfied from the evidence that <em>Swift </em>and <em>Plum-stead </em>were jointly concerned, and that the adventure was indebted to <em>Swift </em>as joint partner. They also stated that before the defendant ordered the attachment, he had notice of <em>Swift\u2019s </em>interest, although it did not appear that he had any knowledge of that of the Bank.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b347-11\"><em>B. Tilghman </em>for defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A5Aa\"><em>Thc first </em>exception is not made out; but I contend that the attachment is conclusive as to one half the property belonging to <em>Plumstead\\ </em>which he assigned to the Bank in whose place Mr. <em>Swift </em>stands. The case of <em>Rappelje </em>v. <em>Emory </em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>is in point. The defendant fairly recovered this money by the judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction as the property of <em>Plumstead; </em>and this judgment cannot be reversed in a collateral way. 4 <em>Cranch </em>511, 512., <em>app. </em>The Bank had opportunities of giving notice to the defendant, and neglected to do it. If they had an interest, they must be content to see it postponed to those who had as good claims against Plumstead, and were more vigilant in prosecuting them. As to <em>Swift\u2019s </em>part, in his own. right, I leave that to the court; it may be upon, a different footing from the other in consequence of the notice..</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b347-12\"><em>Condy </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aid\">There can be no doubt as to <em>Swift\u2019s </em>proportion, because after notice of his interest, it was manifestly against good conscience in the defendant to attach the property as <em>Plumstead\u2019s; </em>and in fact, the a \u2019venture owes <em>Swift </em>more than the award. The same principle goes further. He knew that <em>Plumstead </em>was dead, and that his property had vested in his administrators for the benefit of his creditors generally. Under such circumstances the attachment passed no right to the defendant. He held the property as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>it was held before, subject to the claims of <em>Plumstead\u2019\u2019s </em>as-signee the Bank, who have a superior equity. In fact the proceedings were altogether void, being against a dead man. The court should not have proceeded against him. No court professing to act upon principles of reason, would have countenanced the suit. A court of the revolted negroes is not intitledto the application of that principle which upholds the judgments of foreign judicatures. <em>Rappelje </em>v. <em>Emory </em>was quite different; there was a strong equity in Emory, but there is none in the defendant, lire attachment was there against the general effects of the debtor, it was here against specific effects. If a debt of <em>B </em>is attached as the debt of <em>A </em>and recovered, the plaintiff in the attachment may be safe; but if goods belonging to <em>B </em>are attached as the goods of <em>A </em>and rer covered, the plaintiff must answer to the real owner.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b348-5\"><em>Tilghman </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Azp\">The only question is whether the judgment of the court at <em>St. Domingo </em>against a dead man, known to be dead, is valid. The court knew that <em>Plumstead </em>was dead, for bv their decree they refer to papers which recited it; and therefore if is to be presumed that by the law of <em>St. Domingo </em>that circumstance did not alter the case. It is always to be presumed, until the contrary is shewn, that the proceedings of a foreign court are conformable to the law of the place; <em>Rappelje </em>v. <em>Emory, </em><footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> and that law must govern. <em>Burrows </em>v. <em>Jemino </em><footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark>, <em>Embree </em>v. <em>Hanna </em><footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark>. As to the competency of the tribunal, the blacks have the govei nment <em>de facto-, </em>and this court can recognise no tribunal that does not proceed from that source. The Bank and its assignee have no equity whatever, since they neglected to pursue their rights. <em>Swift </em>gave notice. We agree that the award should be confirmed as to his half.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b347-13\"><em> </em>2 <em>Dall, </em>51.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b348-9\"> 2 <em>Dall. </em>231.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b348-10\"> 2 <em>Stra. 733.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-4\" label=\"(c)\">\n<p id=\"b348-11\"> 5 <em>Johns. </em>102.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-5\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b348-6\">Tilghman C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Auj\">delivered the court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">The <em>first </em>exception in this case,' is founded in matter of fact. The arbitrators have been examined, and it appears that this exception has not been supported.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">In the second exception two points of law are involved. <em>fohn W. Swift </em>had claims in two distinct rights: one as surviving partner of <em>George Plumstead-, </em>the other by virtue of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>an assignment from the Bank of North America, who had received an assignment from <em>Plumstead </em>in his life. Before' the defendant laid the attachment in <em>St. </em>Domingo, he had received notice of <em>Swift\u2019s </em>claim, as surviving partner; but he had received no notice of the claim of the Bank. It is evident that the claim in his own right stands on much stronger ground than that derived from the bank. Accordingly the defendant\u2019s counsel, although they have urged serious objections against the assignment from the bank, have yet admitted that the defendant, having laid the attachment after notice of <em>Swift\u2019s </em>right as surviving partner, is responsible to <em>Swift </em>for the money recovered on the attachment, to the amount of the balance due to him from the partnership. Now this precludes the necessity of going into the claim derived from the Bank, because it appears from the proof made before the arbitrators, that the balance due to <em>Swift </em>from the partnership exceeds the sum awarded to him. We are therefore of opinion that the defendant has failed in all his exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-3\">Award confirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">A doubt having been afterwards expressed by the defendant\u2019s counsel, whether the amount of <em>Swift\u2019s </em>claim against the partnership was equal to the sum awarded, the court recommitted the report to the same referees to ascertain the amount of <em>Swift\u2019s </em>lien on the partnership stock, and directed judgment to be entered for it in vacation upon the return of the award.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
