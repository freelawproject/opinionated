But there is a still more solid reason for the objection here. It should appear that the notes were issued by an <em>incorporated </em>bank, for a felony cannot be committed in the taking of any other bank notes. It is questionable whether before the act of 30th <em>January </em>1810, 9 <em>St. laws </em>15, bank notes were included <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>within the description in the act of 15th <em>April </em>1790, \u201cpro- \u201c missory notes for the payment of money.\u201d The legislature appear to have thought not, by declaring in the late act, that the robbery or larceny of any bank note of any <em>incorporated </em>bank shall be punishable in the same manner as the robbery or larceny of any goods or chattels. It is a declaration that before that such a robbery was not so punishable; or at least it is a virtual repeal of the act of 1790 so far as it respects all bank notes. The law is intitled \u201c an act to <em>amend </em>the \u201c penal laws;\u201d and no doubt the legislature intended to put down unincorporated banks, by affording a distinct security to the notes of banks which had been incorporated. In the same session, they made it unlawful for any person to offer or to accept in payment the notes of an unincorporated bank; <em>Act of 19th March </em>1810, 9 <em>St. Laws </em>87; of course in contemplation of law such notes are without value, and therefore not a subject of property and of larceny. It does not appear that the notes in question were not of this description.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b542-3\"><em>Jenkins </em>and <em>Ellmaker </em>for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AN8\">It is not intended to support this indictment under the act of 30th <em>January </em>1810, but under that of 15th <em>April </em>1790. Thenotes stolen are described as promissory notes for the payment of money, to wit, bank notes, the amounts of which are set out. It has never been supposed heretofore that bank notes were not promissory notes for the payment of money. Such an objection was not started in <em>The Commonwealth </em>v. Boyer, and many convictions have taken place for that offence. The present notes could not have been such as it was unlawful to take, and therefore of no value, because the indictment sets forth that each five dollar note was of the value of five dollars. The value was a mixt question of law and of fact, which has been ascertained by the conviction; and by being so ascertained, it follows they were not the notes of an unincorporated bank. It is however not to be presumed that the legislature intended to repeal any part of the act of 1790, but merely that the true construction, was not given to that act. The late act has not either negative or repealing words; and the intention of putting down private banks by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>means of it, cannotbeattributedto the legislature, because the act for that purpose did not pass until two months afterwards. \u201c</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b541-27\"> t <em>Linn. </em>201.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b541-28\"> 4 <em>Burr. </em>2471-</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"(c)\">\n<p id=\"b541-29\"><em> </em>2 <em>Sira. m~</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b543-3\">Tilghman C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"ATOh\">This is a writ of error to the court of Quarter Sessions of <em>Dauphin </em>comity, where judgment was given against <em>Eve Spangler </em>on an indictment for stealing four bank notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">The plaintiff in error has made several points concerning the jurisdiction of the court of Quarter Sessions, and the process for summoning the jury, on which I shall give no opinion. It will be sufficient to consider the exceptions to the indictment. <em>Eve Spangler </em>is charged with stealing \u201c three several promissory notes for the payment of money, \u201c viz. three bank notes, each for the payment of five dollars, \u201c of the value each of five dollars lawful money of the <em>Uni- </em>\u201c <em>ted </em>States, and a promissory note for the payment of mo- \u201c ney, viz. a bank note foy the payment of ten dollars, of the \u201c value of ten dollars like lawful money, the property of \u201c <em>William Graydon </em>esq.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">The indictment is founded on the act of 5th <em>April </em>1790; by the fifth section of which it is enacted, that robbery or larceny of \u201c promissory notes for the payment of money,\u201d shall be punished in the same manner as robbery or larceny of any goods or chattels. I will not say whether the indictment might not have been supported, if the case had turned entirely on the act which has been mentioned. But it is necessary to take other acts into consideration. By the \u201c act \u201c to amend the penal laws,\u201d 30th <em>January </em>1810, it is enacted, that robbery or larceny of any bank note or bank notes of any <em>incorporated </em>bank, shall be punished in the same manner as the robbery or larceny of any goods or chattels of equal amount. Whether the legislature considered bank notes as included in the terms \u201c promissory notes for the \u201c payment of money\u201d in the act of 5th <em>April </em>1790, is not certain. The \u201c act to amend the penal laws\u201d contains no express repeal of any part of the act of 5th <em>April </em>1790; yet when larceny of the notes of <em>incorporated </em>banks is made punishable, one cannot help supposing that it was intended the notes of <em>unincorporated </em>banks should not be the subject of larceny. It is evident that in the year 1810 it was the ob~ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>ject of the legislature to suppress all unincorporated banks. This appears, not only from the act just mentioned, but still \u2018 * \u2019 <em>J </em>, \u201c , more clearly from another act passed the same session, lutu <em>March 1810, </em>which bears strohgly on the case before the court. By the first section of this last act, it is made unlawful, after 1st <em>May </em>1810, for any association of persons, who at the time of passing the act were, or thereafter should be connected for the purpose of banking, and who were not <em>incorporated by 'law, </em>to make, utter or issue, any, bills or notes in the nature of bank notes, payable to bearer, or order, or otherwise. The third section declares it to be unlawful for any person 44 to offer or accept in payment, any note is-44 sued from any unincorporated bank, knowing it to be 44 such.\u201d The fourth section contains a proviso, that 44 nothing 44 contained in the act, should be construed so as to dis-44 charge any person or persons, or any association of per-44 sons, who might before the passing of the act have become engaged for the payment of any sum of money, from such 44 engagements.\u201d Suppose now that a person should have knowingly received a note issued contrary to this law, and the bank had refused payment, no action would lie on it, because the courts of the commonwealth would not suffer themselves to be instrumental in inforcing the execution of an unlawful contract. This principle has been established in the cases of <em>Anthony\u2019s Exrs. v. Coulon, </em>and <em>Mitchell </em>v. Smith, both decided in this court. There may be bank notes therefore, which are of no value or validity in law, and consequently cannot be the subject of larceny. For although bank notes are 41 promissory notes for the payment of money,\u201d within the meaning of the act of 5th <em>April </em>1790, yet that act cannot be construed so as to afford protection to notes unlawfully issued, and unlawfully received. That being the ease, it is necessary that an indictment for stealing bank notes, should either aver in general, that they were issued by a bank incorporated by law, or name the bank and aver that it was incorporated, or shew in some sufficient ipanner that the notes were lawful. If this is not done, judgment cannot be entered, because it cannot appear to the court that any offence has been committed.</p>\n<p id=\"Ayq_\">Inasmuch then as this indictment is expressly for stealing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number><em>bank </em>notes, and does not shew that they were lawful notes, I am of opinion that the judgment of the court of Quarter' Sessions was erroneous.</p>\n<author id=\"b545-3\">Yeates J.</author>\n<p id=\"A-f\">It is certainly the duty of the court to pursue a middle line between the great mass of the community on the one hand, and individuals charged with offences on the other hand. Where an indictment states a criminal charge with sufficient certainty, so that the party may be fully informed thereby of the facts he is called upon to answer, and prepare for his defence, it is disreputable to the administration of the law that he should be suffered to escape with impunity for a mere slip of form, totally unconnected with the merits of the case. At the same time we well know, that too great a laxity in matters of this nature, will lead to consequences dangerous to innocence. To preserve uniformity of decisions we are necessarily obliged to follow precedents; the utmost uncertainty would ensue from our disregarding them.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">I do not feel the force of the exception taken to this indictment, on account of the omission of the bank or banks which issued the notes in question. The description of the notes is more precise and particular, than if the subject matter of the charge had been a bay horse or a piece of linen, stating the price and value, which would unquestionably be good. I deem it unnecessary however to give a decided opinion on this point. But it is perfectly clear that the crime must be so stated, as that the court should be at no loss or difficulty when called upon to pronounce sentence upon a conviction. It,, must be laid in the words of the act of assembly creating the offence, or at least in language plainly equipollent. Nothing can be taken by intendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Bank and promissory notes are mere choses in action; at common law they could not be stolen. But by the fifth section of our statute of the 5th <em>April </em>f 790 it is provided, that robbery or larceny of promissory notes for the payment of money, shall be punished in the same manner as robbery or larceny of any goods or chattels. This provision has undergone some modification from the words used in the act ot 30th <em>January </em>1810, that from and-after the passage of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>law, the robbery or larceny of any bank note or bank notes of any <em>incorporated </em>bank, should be punishable in the same manner as the robbery or larceny of any goods or chattels of equal amount. A subsequent law passed on the 19th <em>March </em>1810 has declared, that from and after the first day of <em>May </em>then next, it shall be <em>unlawful </em>for any association of persons, who now are or hereafter may be connected for the purpose of banking, and who are not incorporated by law, to make, utter, or issue any bills or notes in the nature of bank notes payable to bearer, or order, or otherwise &amp;c. By the legislature\u2019s making such notes, issued after the 1st <em>May </em>1810, <em>unlawful, </em>the)' necessarily withdraw from them the general protection first afforded them by the former law of -5th <em>April </em>1790. The day of the commission of this larceny is laid in the indictment to be on the 22d <em>January </em>1811. Now may not the notes stolen have been issued by an unincorporated bank after the 1st day of <em>May </em>1810? Nothing appears in the indictment, from which we can with certainty pronounce that the perpetrator of the offence was obnoxious to the punishment of a felony. And if by any possibility such judgment could not be rendered consistently with law, it is out of our power to affirm it. Though the facts stated in the indictment may be true, yet if they do not necessarily and unequivocally describe the offence of which the prisoner stands charged in a legal sense, such indictment is defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">We may be led from our sense of justice to regret the event of this prosecution; but we should carpy in our minds the observation of lord <em>Mansfield </em>in <em>Rex </em>v. Boyce, <em>4 Burr. </em>2082. \u201c Tenderness ought always to prevail in criminal \u201c cases, so far at least as to take care, that a man may not suf- \u201c fer otherwise than by due course of law, nor have any hard- \u201c ship done him, or severity exercised upon him, where the \u201c construction may admit of a reasonable doubt or difficulty.\u201d And again in <em>Rex </em>v. Wilkes, 4 <em>Burr. </em>2552. \u201c The court is \u201c bound to pronounce the law, as they think it is, al- \u201c ways leaning to the favourable side where they doubt; for \u201c so says the law.\u201d I deem it unnecessary to give an opinion On any of the other exceptions taken to the record in this cause. I have no doubt whatever that this indictment can<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>not support the judgment rendered thereon, and am therefore constrained to say that the judgment mus't be reversed. <em>J jo</em></p>\n<judges id=\"AZ1\">Brackenridge J. expressed his concurrence.</judges>\n<p id=\"Aqh6\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
