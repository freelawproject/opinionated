A </em>writ of inquiry was executed in <em>February </em>last, when damages were assessed at 2808 dollars; and a motion was now made to set aside the inquisition, upon the ground that the judgment had not been revived by <em>scire facias post annum et diem.</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b424-9\"><em>Meredith </em>and <em>Rancie </em>in support of the motion.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AvT\">The statute of 13 <em>Ed. 1. c. 45., </em>requires a <em>scire facias </em>in all judgments in personal actions; and the plaintiff cannot have a writ of inquiry after more than a year\u2019s delay upon an interlocutory judgment, without it. <em>Haw </em>v. <em>Cuton,6 Bac. Ab. 107., Scire Facias C, </em>As the present attachment was laid in the plaintiffs\u2019 hands, it was against equity in them to proceed without giving us notice.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b424-10\"><em>Dallas </em>and <em>Tilghman </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Afel\">The rule of reviving a judgment by <em>scire facias </em>before execution, was intended to prevent a surprise upon the defendant; <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Cue; </em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and therefore it does not apply to the case of a foreign attachment, which is a proceeding against an absentee, who if he were present, would not be permitted to give evidence to the jury of inquiry, <em>M'Clenachan </em>v. M'Carty; <footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and whose debt to the plaintiff, the garnishee is not permitted to dispute. A writ of <em>scirefacias </em>would answer no purpose, because there is nobody to warn.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b424-13\"> 2 <em>Burr. 660.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"AV-x\"> 1 <em>Dall. 375.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b424-11\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AHl\">We are of opinion that the case of a foreign attachment differs from other actions.
