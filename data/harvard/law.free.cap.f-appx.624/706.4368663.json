Madden, </em>733 F.3d 1314 (11th Cir.2013) <em>(\u2018Madden </em>7\u201d). We affirm the amended final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-15\">No purpose is served by recounting all of the facts underlying <em>Madden 1 </em>or the proceedings in th\u00e9 district court upon remand. We presume the parties\u2019 familiarity with those facts and proceedings. We recount only those facts and proceedings needed for the reader to understand our decision on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-16\">\u2022 The jury trial that culminated in <em>Madden I </em>respited in Madden\u2019s conviction of all three counts in a superseding indictment. <em>Madden I </em>affirmed two of the three convictions and sentences. <em>Madden I </em>\u25a0 affirmed the Count-1 conviction for cocaine trafficking. Madden received a life sentence for that conviction, which included prior-conviction enhancement imposed in accordance with 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Madden I </em>confirmed the Count 3 conviction for cocaine possession. Madden received a ninety-day sentence for that conviction to run concurrently with the Count 1 sentence. <em>Madden I </em>reversed Madden\u2019s conviction for possessing a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) (Count 2) because the district court\u2019s charge to the jury constructively amended th\u00e9 superseding indictment. The case was remanded to the district court for proceedings consistent with the <em>Madden I </em>opinion. 733 F.3d at 1323.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>On remand, the Government moved to dismiss Count 2 (DE 191). The district court granted the motion (DE 193). The district court entered an amended judgment (DE 192) that omits any reference to the Count 2 conviction or sentence and does not alter this court\u2019s disposition of the convictions or sentences with respect to Counts 1 and 3. This action by the district court complied with this court\u2019s mandate. <em>Madden I </em>\u201creversed Madden\u2019s conviction on Count 2\u201d and \u201caffirm[ed] Madden\u2019s other convictions.\u201d 733 F.3d at 1323. <em>Madden I </em>did not vacate the sentences imposed for the Counts 1 and 3 convictions. The court\u2019s judgment, \u201cissued as the mandate of [the] court,\u201d reads, \u201cit is hereby ordered, adjudged, and decreed that the opinion issued ... is entered as the judgment of this Court.\u201d (DE 97: Mandate in Case No. 11-14302 <em>{Madden I)).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">On this appeal, Madden contends that the district court should have held a resentencing hearing to determine whether the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>570 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013), impacted the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 prior-conviction enhancement of his Count 1 sentence. Because <em>Madden I </em>already had affirmed the Count 1 conviction and had not vacated the corresponding life sentence, which the mandate reflects, any action by the district court inconsistent with the mandate would have had to have satisfied one of the three exceptions to the mandate rule. <em>See United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 830 (11th Cir.2007) (explaining mandate rule and listing exceptions). Madden contends that <em>Alleyne </em>qualifies under the second exception, which is \u201ccontrolling authority [that] has since made a contrary decision of law applicable the [subject] issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-10\">First, <em>Alleyne </em>was decided two months before this court issued its opinion in <em>Madden I </em>and three months before issuance of the <em>Madden I </em>mandate. <em>Alleyne </em>is not controlling authority handed down <em>after </em>the mandate and <em>before </em>the district court\u2019s compliance with the mandate by entering its amended final judgment. <em>Alleyne </em>does not satisfy the criterion of the second exception to the mandate rule because it was decided before the <em>Madden I </em>mandate issued. We reject this contention as a basis for the relief Madden seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-11\">Second, even if this court assumes for the sake of argument that <em>Alleyne </em>constitutes an exception to the mandate rule and the district court erred in not considering Madden\u2019s Alleyne-based challenge, we must ignore the error because it did not affect Madden\u2019s substantial rights. Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(a) (\u201cAny error, defect, irregularity, or variance that does not affect substantial rights must be disregarded.\u201d) Madden\u2019s Alleyne-based argument is that his enhanced Count 1 sentence must be vacated because the fact that he had prior convictions was not submitted to the jury and was not found beyond a reasonable doubt by a jury. At least, he argues, the district court should have considered the impact of <em>Alleyne </em>on the Section 851 enhancement. This argument is foreclosed by the Court\u2019s holding in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> According to the <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>Court, the mere fact of a prior conviction, for which Section 851 imposes a sentence enhancement, is not an \u201celement\u201d of a crime that must be found by a jury. The <em>Alleyne </em>Court did not overrule <em>Almendarez-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number><em>Torres; </em>it remains good law. <em>See Alleyne, </em>570 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. at 2160, n. 1. Because the only enhancement to his Count 1 sentence that Madden challenges is the Section 851 enhancement, and because <em>Alleyne, </em>the only authority upon which his challenge is based, does not control, the district court\u2019s affording Madden a hearing on the issue was not required by the \u201ccontrolling authority\u201d exception to the mandate rule. We reject this contention as a basis for the relief Madden seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">Because Madden would not have been entitled to any relief related to his Count 1 sentence even if the district court had considered his <em>Alleyne </em>argument in a written response to the.Government\u2019s motion to dismiss submitted under the applicable local rule, or at a hearing, we further conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion by not awaiting Madden\u2019s response or by not affording him a hearing. Madden has .not demonstrated that he suffered any prejudice because he was not allowed to file a written response the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss. Without deciding whether the district court should have awaited a response as provided in its own local rule, we hold that-any such error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">The district court here correctly followed our mandate with the amended final judgment and correctly rejected Madden\u2019s argument that <em>Alleyne </em>necessitated resen-tencing under Count 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b737-12\">. The possession with intent to distribute violation comprising Count 1 of the superseding indictment alleges a violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(l)(A)(ii), and calls for penalty enhancement if there have been prior felony drag convictions as determined by the Section 851 procedure. Madden had four prior felony drug convictions when he was sentenced on Count 1 to life imprisonment, the statutory maximum.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b738-7\">. <em>Abnendarez-Torres </em>is not a prior drug conviction case, but tins court has applied it to Section 851 enhancements. <em>See United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1329 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
