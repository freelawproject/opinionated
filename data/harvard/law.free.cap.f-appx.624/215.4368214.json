The district court imposed an above-guidelines sentence of 63 months of imprisonment to be followed by a three-year term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-18\">Among other conditions of supervised release are the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-22\">[T]he defendant shall register with state and local law enforcement as directed by the probation officer in each jurisdiction where the defendant resides, is employed, or is a student.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-23\">The defendant shall provide all information required in accordance with state registration guidelines.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-24\">Initial registration shall be completed within 3 business days after release from confinement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-25\">The defendant shall provide written verification of registration to the probation officer within 3 business days following registration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-26\">This registration shall be renewed as required by the defendant\u2019s assigned tier.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AgK\">The defendant shall, no later than three business days after each change of name, residence, employment, or student status, appear in person in at least one jurisdiction and inform that jurisdiction of all changes in the information required in the sex offender registry.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AyF\">The court\u2019s written judgment included a verbatim recitation of the conditions pronounced at sentencing. Although the standard judgment form contains a box where the court could indicate that the defendant was required to comply with the requirements of the Sex Offender Registration and Notification ACT (SORNA), the district court did not check that box. The government filed a motion to correct the written judgment suggesting that the court\u2019s failure to check the SORNA box was a clerical error. The district court denied the motion, noting that the box was \u201csurplusage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-28\">Roberts challenges the length of his custodial sentence and the lawfulness of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>registration requirement. With respect to the latter issue, he also moves to remand so that the district court can clarify whether it imposed a SORNA registration obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">Roberts first argues that the term of imprisonment was unreasonable because it was based, in part, on his rehabilitative needs. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(a); <em>Tapia v. United States, </em>564 U.S. 319, 131 S.Ct. 2382, 2392, 180 L.Ed.2d 357 (2011). At sentencing, defense counsel objected only to the reasonableness of the sentence without mentioning the court\u2019s alleged consideration of Roberts\u2019s rehabilitative needs. Accordingly, our review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Wooley, </em>740 F.3d 359, 368 (5th Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">The court gave a lengthy and detailed explanation of its reasons for imposing the sentence that referred to the section 3553(a). <em>See </em>The district court made only a single comment about Roberts\u2019s rehabilitative needs. That remark came in response to defense counsel\u2019s statement that Roberts was in need of an \u201cinterdiction.\u201d Although the court noted that Robert\u2019s need for help \u201calso\u201d supported a longer sentence, it emphasized that the interest in \u201cprotecting the public\u201d as justification for the length of the sentence imposed. Roberts has not demonstrated a clear or obvious <em>Tapia </em>error. We therefore reject the challenge to the prison term.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Roberts next argues that the district court\u2019s judgment was ambiguous as to whether the sex offender registration requirements imposed by the district court are identical to, in addition to, or in lieu of SORNA. If the district court did impose a SORNA requirement, Roberts contends that the law does not apply to his conviction because section 1470 is not a \u201csex offense\u201d under SORNA. <em>But see United States v. Schofield, </em>802 F.3d 722 (5th Cir.2015) (holding that attempting to transfer obscene material to a minor in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1470 \u201ccan qualify as a sex offense under SORNA\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> If the district court did not impose SORNA registration and instead ordered registration as an independent condition of supervised release, Roberts argues that this order was an abuse of discretion because he is not legally required to register under SORNA and neither state nor federal law has a mechanism for voluntary sex offender registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-10\">We agree that it is not clear whether the district court imposed a SORNA requirement or instead some other registration obligation. Some requirements are at odds with SORNA. For example, the district court required that Roberts register within three business days after release <em>from </em>imprisonment. Yet SORNA requires registration before completion of the prison sentence. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 16913(b)(1). As previously mentioned, the court did not check the SORNA box on the judgment. And the district court did not specifically invoke SORNA in the registration requirement. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(d) (\u201cThe court shall order, as an explicit condition of supervised release for a person required to register under the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act, that the person comply with the requirements of that Act.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-11\">But there are other indications that the district court did impose a SORNA obligation. The district court ordered Roberts to renew his registration as required by his assigned \u201ctier,\u201d which refers to the SORNA registration scheme. <em>See 42 </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 16915 (the length of an offender\u2019s duty to register under SORNA depends on the \u201ctier\u201d assigned to the offense). And, in denying the motion to alter the judgment, the district court explained that checking the SORNA box would be \u201csur-plusage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Rather than engaging in guesswork about whether the district court intended to impose the registration requirement pursuant to SORNA, the better course is to remand to the district court to clarify the source and scope of the registration requirement it was imposing.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">The custodial sentence imposed by the district court is AFFIRMED. We GRANT Roberts\u2019s motion to remand for the limited purpose of allowing the district court to clarify whether it intended Roberts to register pursuant to SORNA.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b245-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b246-7\">. <em>Schofield </em>was decided after Roberts was sentenced and after Roberts filed his brief in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
