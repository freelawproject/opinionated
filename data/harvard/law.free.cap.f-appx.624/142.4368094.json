Refaei brings various claims arising out of his termination from a residency program at the William Beaumont Army Medical Center in El Paso, Texas. The district court dismissed Refaei\u2019s state law claims and granted summary judgment in favor of the Government on his federal discrimination claims. For the following reasons, we AFFIRM in part, VACATE in part, and REVERSE and REMAND in part the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-11\">I. Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b173-12\">Plaintiff-Appellant Mohd N. Refaei, a practicing Muslim, was born in 1965 in what is today the United Arab Emirates and became a naturalized United States citizen in 2001. Refaei obtained his medical degree in 2005 at the Belize Medical College. In 2008, Refaei was accepted into an internal medicine residency program with the Department of Veterans Affairs at the William Beaumont Army Medical Center (the \u201cWBAMC\u201d) in El Paso, Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-19\">Each residency program at the WBAMC is headed by a Program Director, a specialist responsible for the day-to-day operations of the program. In addition, the WBAMC has a General Medical Education Committee (the \u201cGMEC\u201d), which supervises the various programs and Program Directors. The GMEC is comprised of representatives of the WBAMC\u2019s residency programs and is chaired by the Director of Medical Education (the \u201cDME\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Moreover, each residency program has its own education committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-20\">Disciplinary action against residents at the WBAMC may take various forms, three of which are relevant here. First, there is Program Level Remediation (\u201cPLR\u201d) \u2014 which typically lasts 60 days\u2014 during which program leadership provides additional resources to residents who are struggling in their residency program. If a resident\u2019s deficiencies persist, the resident may be placed on probation. This is a formal method of discipline, with more structured guidelines and expectations for the resident\u2019s improvement; generally, probation is given where it is believed that a resident is not academically prepared to be an independent practitioner. If the WBAMC ultimately determines that a resident lacks necessary skills to perform as an independent practitioner, he or she may be terminated from the program and not allowed to graduate. A Program Director does not have the authority to take formal disciplinary action against a resident. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>Rather, a Program Director may make a recommendation of discipline \u2014 either PLR, probation, or termination \u2014 to the program\u2019s education committee. With respect to PLR, if the education committee agrees that such remediation is needed, the resident is placed on PLR. With respect to formal discipline \u2014 probation or termination \u2014 if the education committee agrees that such action is appropriate, the recommendation is forwarded to the GMEC. The GMEC then conducts a hearing, during which both the Program Director and the resident (who may be represented by counsel) have the opportunity to present their cases. After the hearing, the GMEC casts anonymous ballots on whether to take formal disciplinary action. If the GMEC recommends probation, the resident is placed on probation. If the GMEC recommends termination, the recommendation is forwarded to the Deputy Commander. If the Deputy Commander agrees, the resident may appeal to the Commander. After considering the evidence, the Commander then makes a final decision regarding termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">The WBAMC\u2019s three-year internal medicine residency program consists of three levels: PGY-1, PGY-2, and PGY-3. A resident must successfully complete each level in order to complete the program. As a PGY-1 resident, Refaei struggled. After a recommendation of the Program Director at the time, Dr. Kent DeZee, the internal medicine education committee voted to place Refaei on PLR in September 2008. Because Refaei continued to have deficiencies in patient care, practice-based learning, and professionalism, Dr. DeZee recommended that Refaei be placed on probation in November 2008. The internal medicine education committee concurred, as did the GMEC, and Refaei was placed on 90-day probation in December 2008. Refaei showed some improvement, completed his probationary period, and ultimately completed PGY-1. During Refaei\u2019s second year, as a PGY-2 resident, Refaei was again placed on PLR for deficiencies in medical knowledge and professionalism; at this time, Dr. Michael Cole was the Program Director. Refaei ultimately made it to his PGY-3 year, during which he was again placed on probation on Dr. Cole\u2019s recommendation. Refaei\u2019s probation, beginning in July 2011, was triggered by, among other concerns, a report that Re-faei gave a poor sign-out to the oncoming night resident and failed to check the progress of both of his interns\u2019 work. On July 28, 2011, Refaei was given a notice of probation, which advised Refaei of the minimum acceptable standards required to be an independent physician, including: (1) \u201cprovide appropriate AND adequate documentation on all clinical notes including the documentation of your \u2018Assessment and Plan\u2019 sections that is representative of a PGY[-]3 level resident;\u201d (2) \u201c[p]rovide appropriate AND adequate sign-out to your fellow residents;\u201d and (3) \u201c[djemons-trat[e] that you are ready to take a leadership role ... by accomplishing all of the above while teaching junior trainees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">Two days after receiving the notice of probation, Refaei engaged in conduct prompting his termination from the program. According to the recommendation for termination written by Dr. Cole, Refaei was the senior resident on duty when one of his patients went into severe distress, prompting intervention from the WBAMC\u2019s Rapid Response Team. Refaei failed to transfer the patient to the intensive care unit, and failed to inform the attending physician of the significant change in his patient\u2019s status. Moreover, Refaei failed to ensure that the incident was adequately documented in the patient\u2019s record. The recommendation for termination noted that Refaei\u2019s conduct was in violation of the first and third con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>ditions of probation discussed above. The internal medicine education committee voted unanimously to recommend Refaei\u2019s termination, as did the GMEC (after a hearing at which Refaei was represented by counsel). The decision was affirmed both by the Deputy Commander and, after an appeal, by the Commander.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Refaei filed the present action on June 18, 2013.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Refaei asserted claims for: (1) discrimination, under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (\u201cADEA\u201d), on the basis of national origin (Emerati), religion (Muslim), and age (over 40); (2) breach of contract; (3) intentional infliction of emotional distress (\u201cIIED\u201d); and (4) defamation. The Government filed a motion to dismiss the latter three claims, in response to which Refaei abandoned his claims for IIED and defamation. The district court dismissed the breach of contract claim with prejudice, concluding that the claim was preempted under Title VII, the ADEA, and the Civil Service Reform Act. The Government moved for summary judgment on the remaining claims, and the district court granted the motion. Refaei timely appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s order granting a defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, applying the same standard as did the district court. <em>Adams v. Travelers Indem. Co. of Conn., </em>465 F.3d 156, 163 (5th Cir.2006). \u201cSummary judgment is appropriate \u2018if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Johnston &amp; Johnston v. Conseco Life Ins. Co., </em>732 F.3d 555, 561 (5th Cir.2013) (quoting Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(a)). We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>United Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Hixson Bros. Inc., </em>453 F.3d 283, 285 (5th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-11\">\u201cWe review questions of subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo.\u201d Bissonnet Invs. LLC v. Quinlan (In re Bissonnet Invs. LLC), </em>320 F.3d 520, 522 (5th. Cir.2003).'</p>\n<p id=\"b175-12\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b175-13\">A. Discrimination Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b175-14\">Refaei contends that he was terminated on the basis of his-age, his religion, and his national origin. Because Refaei seeks to prove these claims through circumstantial evidence, we review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment under the burden-shifting framework delineated in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802-04, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). <em>See Squyres v. Heico Cos., LLC, </em>782 F.3d 224, 231 (5th Cir.2015) (applying the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework to ADEA claims).' \u201cUnder that framework, the plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination, which requires a showing that the plaintiff (1) is a member of a protected group; (2) was qualified for the position at issue; (3) was discharged or suffered some adverse employment action by the employer; and (4) was replaced by someone outside his protected group or was treated less favorably than other similarly situated employees outside the protected group.\u201d <em>McCoy v. City of Shreveport, </em>492 F.3d 551, 556 (5th Cir.2007) (per curiam). \u201cIf the plaintiff makes a prima facie showing, the burden then shifts -to the employer to articulate a legitimate, nondiseriminatory ...- reason for its employment action.\u201d <em>Id) </em>at 557. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>\u201c[I]f the employer meets its burden of production, the plaintiff then bears the ultimate burden of proving that the employer\u2019s proffered reason is not true but instead is a pretext for the real discriminatory ... purpose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We need not address whether Refaei has sufficiently proven that the Government\u2019s reason for his termination was pretextual, as we conclude that Refaei has failed to establish a prima facie case' of discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">In order to establish his prima facie case, Refaei was required to show that \u201che was treated less favorably because of his membership in that protected class than were other similarly situated employees who were not members of the protected class, under nearly identical circumstances.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Lee v. Kansas City S. Ry. Co., </em>574 F.3d 253, 259 (5th Cir.2009). Making that showing requires that Refaei provide evidence of sufficient \u201ccomparators.\u201d <em>See id. </em>Refaei has failed to do so. The only evidence of such comparators comes from Refaei\u2019s own affidavit summarizing other residents\u2019 \u201cegregious mistakes,\u201d for which they were not terminated. Even assuming such evidence meets the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> it is nonetheless insufficient to fulfill this element of Refaei\u2019s prima facie case. As an initial matter, because the affidavit fails even to identify the ages, national origins, or religions of these other residents, Refaei has failed to show that these employees \u201cwere not members of [Refaei\u2019s] protected class[es].\u201d <em>Lee, </em>574 F.3d at 259; <em>see also Jefferson v. Christus St. Joseph Hosp., </em>374 Fed.Appx. 485, 491-92 (5th Cir.2010) (unpublished) (per curiam) (\u201cThe Summary Report does not include any information regarding the race or national origin of these supposed comparators \u2014 Accordingly, appellants have failed to demonstrate a prima facie case of race or national origin discrimination as to all appellants.\u201d). Refaei also fails to provide sufficient context with respect to these purported violations, such that we can determine whether these residents were indeed \u201csimilarly situated\u201d to Refaei. For example, Refaei fails to identify the time frame of these .other residents\u2019 purported violations. <em>See Lee, </em>574 F.3d at 259 (\u201cEmployees ... who were the subject of adverse employment actions too remote in time from that taken against the plaintiff generally will not be deemed similarly situated.\u201d). Moreover, from the information Refaei has provided, it appears that none of these comparators was treated more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>favorably than Refaei \u201cunder nearly identical circumstances,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 260, as none of the residents violated terms of their probation (nor does it appear that any were placed on probation multiple times), <em>see id. </em>(\u201cThe employment actions being compared will be deemed to have been taken under nearly identical circumstances when the employees being compared ... have essentially comparable violation histories. And, critically, the plaintiffs conduct that drew the adverse employment decision must have been \u2018nearly identical\u2019 to that of the proffered comparator who allegedly drew dissimilar employment decisions.\u201d (footnote omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">Accordingly, because Refaei has failed to establish this element of his prima facie case, the district court properly granted summary judgment in the Government\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">B. Hostile Work Environment Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">Refaei also asserts hostile work environment claims under both Title VI\u00cd and the ADEA. To prove such a claim under Title VII, a plaintiff must prove that he:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-8\">(1) belongs to a protected group; (2) was subjected to unwelcome harassment; (3) the harassment complained of was based on [the protected class]; (4) the harassment complained of affected a term, condition, or privilege of employment; (5) the employer knew or should have known of the harassment in question and failed to take prompt remedial action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-9\"><em>Hernandez v. Yellow Transp., Inc., </em>670 F.3d 644, 651 (5th Cir.2012) (quoting <em>Ramsey v. Henderson, </em>286 F.3d 264, 268 (5th Cir.2002)). \u201cHarassment affects a term, condition, or privilege of employment if it is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim\u2019s employment and create an abusive working environment.\u201d <em>Id.- </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Similarly, in order to prove-a hostile work environment-claim under the ADEA, a plaintiff must establish that \u201cthe employee was subjected to harassment, either through words or actions, based on age\u201d and that \u201cthe nature of the harassment was such that it created an objectively intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment.\u201d <em>Dediol v. Best Chevrolet, Inc., </em>655 F.3d 435, 441 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-12\">' [2] Refaei fails to meet these standards. In support of his hostile work environment claims, Refaei cites to only two purportedly discriminatory comments made by Dr. Cole. First, Dr. Cole commented to Refaei that he should take Ari-cept, a medicine intended to slow the progression of memory loss. Second, on one occasion when Dr. Cole, Dr. Refaei, and other residents were watching an episode of Jeopardy that made mention of a Fifth Century Muslim physician, Dr. Cole stated: \u201cMuslim Physician? That\u2019s something new.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Refaei also relies on several comments made by Dr, Cole that do not appear related to any protected class \u2014 e.g., that Refaei was a \u201cbonehead,\u201d a \u201cliar,\u201d and a \u201cconfabulator.\u201d These occasional comments, though offensive, did not create an environment so \u201cpermeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult, that [was] .sufficiently pervasive to alter the conditions of [Refaei]\u2019s employment.\u201d <em>Reed v. Neopost USA, Inc., </em>701 F.3d 434, 443 (5th Cir.2012) (internal, quotation marks omitted); <em>see id. </em>(denying ADEA hostile work environment claim where \u201cco<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>workers called [the plaintiff] names like \u2018old man,\u2019 \u2018old fart,\u2019 \u2018pops,\u2019 and \u2018grandpa\u2019 \u201d); <em>Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, </em>524 U.S. 775, 788, 118 S.Ct. 2275, 141 L.Ed.2d 662 (1998) (\u201c[S]imple teasing, offhand comments, and isolated incidents (unless extremely serious) will not amount to discriminatory changes in the terms and conditions of employment.\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)); <em>Stewart v. Miss. Transp. Comm\u2019n, </em>586 F.3d 321, 330 (5th Cir.2009) (\u201cThese occasional statements did not create a hostile work environment because they were not severe, physically threatening, or humiliating; at most, they were unwanted and offensive.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">Accordingly, the district court properly granted summary judgment in the Government\u2019s favor with respect to the hostile work environment claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">C. Breach of Contract Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">Finally, although Refaei does not challenge the district court\u2019s dismissal of his breach of contract claim on the merits, he contends for the first time on appeal that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over this claim. An issue of subject matter jurisdiction nonetheless \u201ccan never be forfeited or waived,\u201d \u201cregardless of whether the error was raised in district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Cotton, </em>535 U.S. 625, 630, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002); <em>see also Arbaugh v. Y &amp; H Corp., </em>546 U.S. 500, 514, 126 S.Ct. 1235, 163 L.Ed.2d 1097 (2006) (\u201c[C]ourts ... have an independent obligation to determine whether subject-matter jurisdiction exists, even in the absence of a challenge from any party\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-11\">Under the Tucker Act, the Court of Federal Claims has exclusive jurisdiction over claims sounding in breach of contract against the United States that exceed $10,000. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(a)(1); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(a)(2); <em>see also Humphries v. Various Fed. USINS Emps., </em>164 F.3d 936, 941 (5th Cir.1999) (\u201c[T]he law of this circuit is clear that the Court of Claims has exclusive jurisdiction of a Tucker Act claim in excess of $10,000.\u201d (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted)). \u201cWe have consistently refused to allow district courts to adjudicate issues which belong solely to the Court of Claims, even though some other statute conferring jurisdiction would otherwise allow the district court to hear the case.\u201d <em>Wilkerson v. United States, </em>67 F.3d 112, 118 (5th Cir.1995). Here, Refaei\u2019s Complaint is silent as to the amount of damages he seeks in relation to his breach of contract claim, and that reason alone may preclude the district court\u2019s jurisdiction. <em>See Sheehan v. Army &amp; Air Force Exch. Serv., </em>619 F.2d 1132, 1137 n. 7 (5th Cir.1980) (stating, in the Tucker Act context, that \u201ca complaint is fatally defective unless it contains a proper allegation limiting the recovery sought,\u201d though the court allowed the plaintiff to amend his complaint to cure the defect on appeal), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>456 U.S. 728, 102 S.Ct. 2118, 72 L.Ed.2d 520 (1982); <em>Enplanar, Inc. v. Marsh, </em>25 F.3d 1043, No. 93-7633, 1994 WL 261088, at <em>*2 </em>(5th Cir. June 2,1994) (unpublished) (per curiam) (affirming the district court\u2019s dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under the Tucker Act because \u201cthe action seeks an unspecified amount of monetary damages, thus rendering it fatally defective\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In any event, even considering the allegations in the Complaint and the evidence submit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>ted below, we conclude that Refaei seeks in excess of $10,000 for this claim. Although Refaei admits on appeal that he was owed only approximately $6,000 under his contract for the remainder of his term as a resident, he also seeks consequential damages relating to his loss in career advancement, as well as \u201c[c]osts, including reasonable expert fees,\u201d \u201c[attorney\u2019s fees,\u201d and \u201c[p]rejudgment and post-judgment interest.\u201d Moreover, Refaei makes clear in his briefing on appeal that he is seeking at least $10,000 in relation to his breach of contract claim. <em>Cf. Chichakli v. Szubin, </em>546 F.3d 315, 317 (5th Cir.2008) (concluding that, although \u201c[i]t is not clear from the face of the Complaint that [the plaintiff] is seeking greater than $10,000 in damages,\u201d the plaintiffs allegations, \u201calong with [the plaintiffl\u2019s failure to dispute the Government\u2019s allegation that his claim is in excess of $10,000, justify a finding that his claim is for more than $10,000\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">The Government argues that Refaei cannot now complain about the district court\u2019s lack of jurisdiction over this claim, as he invoked the jurisdiction of the district court by filing his lawsuit. However, \u201c[l]it-igants cannot bestow subject matter jurisdiction on federal courts by waiver or consent.\u201d <em>Elam v. Kansas City S. Ry. Co., </em>635 F.3d 796, 802 (5th Cir.2011). Accordingly, we VACATE the district court\u2019s holding on preemption of the breach of contract claim, REVERSE the district court\u2019s judgment as to that claim and REMAND to the district court with instructions that the claim be transferred to the Court of Federal Claims. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631 (\u201cWhenever a ... court finds that there is a want of jurisdiction, the court shall, if it is in the interest of justice, transfer such action or appeal to any other such court in which the action or appeal could have been brought at the time it was filed or noticed.... \u201d); <em>see also Amoco Prod. Co. v. Hodel, </em>815 F.2d 352, 368 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED in part, VACATED and REVERSED in part, and REMANDED with instructions to transfer the contract claim to the Court of Federal Claims.

Jack In The Box, Inc., </em>376 F.3d 305, 309 (5th Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, Refaei has provided no evidence that he was replaced by someone younger or outside his protected class. In support of\u2019 his prima facie case, Refaei relies exclusively on evidence that other similarly situated residents were treated more favorably than he was. In order to show that he was otherwise discharged because of his age via such disparate treatment, Refaei was required to show that he was treated less favorably than younger \"similarly situated\u201d employees in \"nearly identical circumstances.\u201d <em>Berquist v.

Dr. Cole stated in an affidavit that he likely made the first comment, but that \u2018\u2018[w]hen persons have a difficult time remembering something, [he] often joke[s] that [he] can prescribe Aricept for them.\u201d Dr. Cole stated that he has no recollection of making the second comment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b178-7\">. Refaei\u2019s Complaint does not expressly limit his requested damages to less than $10,000. <em>Cf. Woodard </em>v. <em>Marsh, </em>658 F.2d 989, 992 (5th Cir.1981) (\u201cIn his amended complaint, Woodard waived all claims for damages in excess of $9,999.99. Therefore, the district court had jurisdiction of his monetary claims.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
