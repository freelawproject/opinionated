The government expressly declines to rely on the waiver and asks that we reverse the district court\u2019s order and remand this matter for adjudication of Gatson\u2019s motion. Because the parties agree that the waiver should not prevent the district court from reaching the merits of Gatson\u2019s motion, and because the district court identified no other ground of waiver, we will vacate and remand the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>judgment with instructions that the district court should consider as non-waived Gatson\u2019s claim that his attorney was constitutionally ineffective for not objecting to the application of the Armed Career Criminal Act at his sentencing. We imply no view as to whether such a claim has any merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b775-16\">. Gatson also claims that his sentence is unconstitutional because some parts of the Armed Career Criminal Act that affected his sentence are unconstitutionally vague. That claim does not fall within the scope of the certificate of appealability (COA) in this case, and \u201cour review of an unsuccessful \u00a7 2255 motion is limited to the issues enumerated in the COA.\u201d <em>McKay v. United States, </em>657 F.3d 1190, 1195 (11th Cir.2011). Accordingly, we do not consider Gatson\u2019s vagueness argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
