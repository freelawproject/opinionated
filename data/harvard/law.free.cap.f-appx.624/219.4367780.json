Cox appeals the concurrent 37-month sentences imposed following his guilty plea convictions for two counts of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. Cox argues that the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>committed procedural error in imposing an upward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3. Cox\u2019s presentence report calculated a guidelines range using a Category IV criminal history score, and Cox argues that the court failed to explain why a Category V criminal history score was inadequate when it departed to a range based on a Category VI criminal history score. Because Cox did not present this argument to the district court, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 361 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">Section 4A1.3(a)(l) provides that, where \u201creliable information indicates that the defendant\u2019s criminal history category substantially under-represents the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal history or the likelihood that [he] will commit other crimes, an upward departure may be warranted.\u201d Though the district court did not explicitly state its reasons for rejecting a guidelines range with a Category V criminal history score, the court gave extensive reasons that made clear why it found the intermediate Category V score inadequate. Thus, Cox does not show clear or obvious error. <em>See United States v. Zuniga-Per-alta, </em>442 F.3d 345, 348 n. 2 (5th Cir.2006). Moreover, even if the error was clear or obvious, Cox does not show a reasonable probability that he would have received a lesser sentence but for the district court\u2019s lack of explanation. <em>See United States v. Blocker, </em>612 F.3d 413, 416 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b249-32\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
