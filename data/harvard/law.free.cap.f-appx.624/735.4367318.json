The district court found a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction is not warranted because Disla (1) abused his position as a United States Customs and Border Protection Officer (CBPO) in the commission of his underlying offense and (2) engaged in obstructive conduct during his trial. Disla argues the district court abused its discretion by relying on these two factors and failing to consider his post-sentencing rehabilitation and conduct.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion. Thus, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>I. <em>Abuse of CBPO Position</em></p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">Disla first asserts the district court erred in relying on his abuse of his CBPO position because this conduct was already \u201cfully accounted for and punished\u201d by the sentencing court. But, whether the sentencing court considered this conduct is inapposite. District courts have discretion to deny a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion based on the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), which include \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1); <em>United States v. Hamilton, </em>715 F.3d 328, 337-38 (11th Cir.2013). Disla\u2019s abuse of his position as a CBPO during the commission of his crime clearly relates to the nature and circumstances of his offense. As such, the district court did not abuse its discretion in considering this conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">II. <em>Obstruction During Trial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">Next, Disla argues the district court erred because its finding that he engaged in obstructive conduct during trial is both inconsistent with the original sentencing court\u2019s findings and unsupported by the record. <em>See Hamilton, </em>715 F.3d at 340 (during a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, a district court may make new findings supported by the record but it \u201cmay not enter any new finding that is inconsistent with a finding ... made in the original sentence proceeding\u201d). He also asserts that a prisoner\u2019s trial conduct is an impermissible consideration in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. However, these arguments are unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">First, Disla\u2019s argument that the district court\u2019s \u201cobstruction\u201d conclusion is inconsistent with the sentencing court\u2019s findings is baseless. The sentencing court did not make a determination as to Dis-la\u2019s trial conduct. In addressing this issue, the court explained, \u201cwhile I might think that [Disla] committed perjury ... I am not going to reach that issue ... because it is not necessary.\u201d Given the sentencing court did not rule on whether Disla obstructed his trial, the district court\u2019s conclusion is not inconsistent with the sentencing court\u2019s findings. Second, the district court\u2019s conclusion is supported by the record; Disla\u2019s Presentence Investigation Report (PSI) includes undisputed statements that Disla committed perjury at trial. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>587 F.3d 1300, 1303 (11th Cir.2009) (per cu-riam) (holding that a court can \u201cmake factual findings based on the undisputed statements in the PSI\u201d). Third, Disla\u2019s trial conduct relates to \u201cthe history and characteristics of the defendant\u201d \u2014 a factor Usted in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1). Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion in relying on its conclusion that Disla obstructed his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-10\">\n<em>III.Post-Sentencing Rehabilitation and Conduct</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b766-11\">Finally, Disla asserts the district court abused its discretion by failing to consider his post-sentencing rehabilitation and conduct. This argument is without merit; consideration of post-sentencing rehabilitation and conduct is within the district court\u2019s discretion. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. 1(B) (stating that the district court \u201cmay\u201d consider the prisoner\u2019s post-sentencing conduct); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>557 F.3d 1254, 1256 (11th Cir.2009) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-12\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b766-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b765-11\">. We review a district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b766-8\">. Following the district court's denial of his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, Disla filed a motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>reconsideration. The district court then denied the motion. Disla also appeals this denial. However, his challenge to this denial is solely based on his assertion that the district court did not properly consider his post-sentencing rehabilitation and conduct. As discussed above, the district court has discretion to consider these factors. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Disla\u2019s motion for reconsideration.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
