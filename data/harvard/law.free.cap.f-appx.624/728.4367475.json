Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-21\">In Social Security appeals, we review the decision of an ALJ as the Commissioner\u2019s final decision when the ALJ denies benefits and the Appeals Council denies review of the ALJ\u2019s decision. <em>Doughty v. Apfel, </em>245 F.3d 1274, 1278 (11th Cir.2001). We review the Commissioner\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de novo </em>and consider whether the Commissioner\u2019s factual findings are supported by substantial evidence. <em>Lewis v. Barnhart, </em>285 F.3d 1329, 1330 (11th Cir.2002). \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Lewis v. Callahan, </em>125 F.3d 1436, 1440 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-22\">Eligibility for SSI requires that the claimant is under a disability. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382(a)(l)-(2). In relevant part, a claimant is under a disability if she is unable to engage in substantial gainful activity by reason of a medically determinable impair<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>ment that can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of at least 12 months. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1382e(a)(3)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">In order to determine whether a claimant is disabled, the Social Security Administration applies a five-step sequential evaluation. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920(a). Under the first step, the claimant has the burden to show that she is not currently engaged in substantial gainful activity. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 416.920(a)(4)(f). At the second step, the claimant must show that she has a severe impairment or combination of impairments. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 416.920(a)(4)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">At step three, the claimant has the opportunity to show that she has an impairment that meets or equals the criteria contained in one of the Listings. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 416.920(a)(4)(iii). If the claimant demonstrates that her condition meets or equals the criteria for a Listing, she is conclusively presumed to be disabled. <em>Crayton v. </em>Callahan&gt; 120 F.3d 1217, 1219 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">As indicated above, this case involves Listing 12.05, the listing for mental retardation. \u201cMental retardation refers to significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning with deficits in adaptive functioning initially manifested\u201d before age 22. 20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1, \u00a7 12.05. In this case, there is no dispute that Bouler\u2019s full scale IQ score of 61 constitutes a valid IQ score between 60 and 70. This creates a rebuttable presumption that she manifested deficits in adaptive functioning at age 22, a presumption the Commissioner may rebut by presenting evidence relating to her daily life. <em>See Hodges v. Barnhart, </em>276 F.3d 1265, 1269 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-10\">We conclude that substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s determination that Bouler did not manifest deficits in adaptive functioning and thus did not meet the diagnostic criteria for Listing 12.05. While her IQ score of 61 gave rise to a presumption that her adaptive deficits arose before age 22, the ALJ implicitly determined that the Commissioner rebutted this presumption. Two examination reports supported the ALJ\u2019s finding that Bouler was able to care for her personal needs, drive, and shop.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Furthermore, one examining doctor wrote that Bouler visited her boyfriend, played games, and engaged in. simple but logical conversation during the evaluation, which supported the ALJ\u2019s finding that she could communicate effectively. Finally, Bouler mainly received B\u2019s and C\u2019s in her high school classes, which supports the ALJ\u2019s implicit determination that Bouler did not have a deficit in her functional academic skills.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-11\">Because substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s finding that Bouler did not have the deficits in adaptive functioning necessary to meet the diagnostic criteria for Listing 12.05, the judgment of the District Court affirming the Commissioner\u2019s decision is</p>\n<p id=\"b759-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b759-8\">. At the time of her appearance before the ALJ, Bouler, was 45 years old and was living with her three children, one a minor. Her husband was deceased.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
