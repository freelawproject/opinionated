(\u201cSedgwick\u201d). The district court dismissed Oswalt\u2019s employment discrimination claim because, after he filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition, the bankruptcy trustee was the only person with standing to prosecute Oswalt\u2019s claims. On appeal, Oswalt argues that he regained prudential standing when he reopened his bankruptcy cas\u00e9 to properly list his lawsuit against BellSouth and Sedg-wick. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-23\">Standing \u201cis a jurisdictional prerequisite to suit in federal court.\u201d <em>Alabama v. United States Envtl. Protection Agency, </em>871 F.2d 1548, 1554 (11th Cir.1989). We review standing determinations <em>de novo. Tanner Advert. Group, L.L.C. v. Fayette County, </em>451 F.3d 777, 784 (11th Cir.2006). <em>Pro se </em>appellants are afforded a liberal construction of their pleadings. <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998). However, issues not raised by <em>pro se </em>appellants in their pleadings are considered abandoned. <em>Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-24\">The start of a bankruptcy case creates an estate made up of nearly all of the debtor\u2019s assets. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541(a)(1). According to the Bankruptcy Code,, the estate includes \u201call legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Causes of- action belonging to a debtor at the initiation of bankruptcy become part of the bankruptcy estate. <em>Parker v. Wendy\u2019s </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number><em>Int'l. Inc., </em>365 F.3d 1268, 1272 (11th Cir. 2004); <em>Barger v. City of Cartersville, </em>348 F.3d 1289, 1292 (11th Cir.2003). After the cause of action becomes part of the bankruptcy estate, the trustee, as the representative of the estate, becomes the only party with standing to bring that cause of action. <em>Parker, </em>365 F.3d at 1272; <em>Barger, </em>348 F.3d at 1292-93. The rights of the debtor to the cause of action are therefore eliminated, unless the trustee abandons the property in accordance with 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 554. <em>Parker, </em>365 F.3d at 1272. When property is not administered and not abandoned according to \u00a7 554, then it remains in the estate' unless it falls under \u00a7 521(a)(2). 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 554(c)-(d); <em>see also </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 521(a)(1). However, when a debtor does not list their interest in a cause of action on the bankruptcy schedule, the cause of action remains in the bankruptcy estate after the estate is discharged. <em>Parker, </em>365 F.3d at 1272.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">In this ease, Oswalt\u2019s claims against BellSouth and Sedgwick became a part of Oswalt\u2019s bankruptcy estate when he filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. <em>See id. </em>Once the claim became part of the bankruptcy estate, the trustee became the sole person with standing to bring the claim. <em>See id.; Barger, </em>348 F.3d at 1292-93. Since the trustee never abandoned the cause of action, and Oswalt failed to properly disclose the cause of action to the bankruptcy court, the cause of action is still property of the bankruptcy estate and the trustee is the only party with standing to bring the cause of action. <em>See Parker, </em>365 F.3d at 1272. Oswalt\u2019s petition to re-open his bankruptcy case and amend his list of assets to properly include the lawsuit, in and of itself, does not remedy Oswalt\u2019s lack of standing. A trustee, should the bankruptcy court appoint one, would have standing and would have the right to sue Sedgwick and BellSouth, but Oswalt does not. <em>See Barger, </em>348 F.3d at 1292-93. Further, any claim that Oswalt may have standing for his equitable relief claims \u2014 separate from his standing for his rest of his claims \u2014 was abandoned when Oswalt failed to raise it in his appellate brief. <em>See Barger, </em>348 F.3d at 1297; <em>Timson, </em>518 F.3d at 874. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
