After review,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-23\">The sentencing court explicitly determined that Anderson was a career offend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>er under the Sentencing Guidelines. Therefore, Anderson\u2019s offense level remains unchanged even after the application of Amendment 782. Because Amendment 782 did not have the effect of lowering Anderson\u2019s guideline range, no reduction in sentence is authorized. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C., \u00a7 3582(c)(2); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B), p.s.; <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1330 (holding that where a defendant has been sentenced as a career offender and the offense level in the drug quantity table did not play a role in.the calculation of the guideline range, no reduction is authorized by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">The sentencing court denied Anderson\u2019s motion for a downward departure but chose to vary Anderson\u2019s sentence below the guideline range after considering the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. There is no indication that the sentencing court considered the drug quantity table when it varied Anderson\u2019s- sentence. <em>C.f. Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1330 (Where there is no \u201cindication that the court based [the defendant\u2019s] sentence- on the guideline range that would have applied -absent the career offender designation ... there is no basis for concluding that the reduction- of [the defendant\u2019s] base offense level lowered the sentencing range relied upon by the district court in determining his sentence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b750-8\">. \"In a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, we review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u2019\u2019 <em>United States v.
