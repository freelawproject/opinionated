It is therefore VACATED, and this opinion is issued in its stead.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-17\">Versiah Taylor, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal of his complaint under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915. In it, \u25a0 he alleged that Internal Revenue Service (IRS) agents unlawfully inspected and disclosed his tax return information to various third parties, including a Channel 13 News employee and suspects in other criminal investigations, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6103(k)(l) and 7431(a)(1). The district court dismissed Taylor\u2019s complaint without prejudice for failure to state a claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). The district court further found that any attempt to amend it would have been futile because (1) his claims were Heck-barred;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (2) exceptions to \u00a7\u00a7 6103(k)(6) and 7431(b)(1), including a good-faith exception, applied to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>the IRS agents\u2019 alleged conduct. After careful consideration, we vacate the district court\u2019s order and remand to allow Taylor to amend his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">We first consider whether Taylor\u2019s claims were Nec/c-barred. Under <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>a prisoner may not bring a civil suit for damages if \u201ca judgment in favor of the plaintiff would necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction.\u201d 512 U.S. 477, 487, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 2372, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). Thus, the question here is whether a judgment in favor of Taylor under \u00a7 6103 would necessarily imply the invalidity of the convictions for which he, is in prison, which included filing false claims against the government, wire fraud, and aggravated identity theft, among other things.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">\u25a0 Under \u00a7 6103, federal- government employees must keep tax return information confidential except for specific purposes. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6103(a). A taxpayer may sue the United States for damages if a federal officer or employee discloses his tax return information in violation of \u00a7 6103. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 7431(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\"><em>Heck </em>does not bar a \u00a7 7431 wrongful-disclosure suit because winning a \u00a7 7431 suit would not necessarily imply the invalidity of Taylor\u2019s convictions. Though this Court has not addressed it, other Circuits have indicated that there is no exclusionary -remedy for \u00a7\u00a7 6103 and 7431 violations. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Michaelian, </em>803 F.2d 1042, 1050 (9th Cir.1986) (\u201cEven if a violation of \u00a7 6103 occurred, dismissal or suppression are improper remedies.\u201d); <em>Marvin v. United States, </em>732 F.2d 669, 673 (8th Cir.1984) (\u201cAssuming ... that a violation of section 6103 occurred, we hold that in this case ... suppression ] of copies of the seized records is not an available remedy.\u201d). And this Court has held that exclusion is not a remedy under \u00a7\u00a7 6103 and 7431 for purposes of a redetermination of deficiencies' in tax liability. <em>See Nowicki v. C.I.R., </em>262 F.3d 1162, 1163 (11th Cir.2001) (per cu-riam) (\u201cThere . is no statutory provision requiring exclusion of evidence obtained in violation of \u00a7 6103 and we will not invent one.\u201d). Thus, Taylor would not have been entitled to an exclusionary remedy if he prevailed in his \u00a7 7431 claims, and his success would therefore not imply that his convictions were necessarily invalid.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ARm\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-12\">We next address whether the district court erred' by dismissing Taylor\u2019s complaint <em>sua sponte. </em>We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii), viewing the allegations in the complaint as true. <em>Hughes v. Lott, </em>350 F.3d 1157, 1159-60 (11th Cir.2003). A district court may <em>sua sponte </em>dismiss a prisoner\u2019s <em>informa pauperis </em>complaint for failure to state a claim before process is served. <em>Vanderberg v. Donaldson, </em>259 F.3d 1321, 1323 (11th Cir.2001); <em>see also </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00ae. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6)\u2019s standards govern our review of <em>sua sponte </em>dismissals under - \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00ae. <em>Mitchell v. Farcass, </em>112 F.3d 1483, 1485 (11th Cir.1997). To survive a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, the complaint must contain -sufficient facts, ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>cepted as true, to state a claim for relief that is plausible on its face. <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">A party may amend his pleading \u201conce as a matter of course\u201d within 21 days after serving it, and, in other cases, the district court should freely grant a party leave to amend \u201cwhen justice so requires.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 15(a)(l)-(2). We review denials of motions to amend for an abuse of discretion. <em>Bryant v. Dupree, </em>252 F.3d 1161, 1163 (11th Cir.2001) (per curiam). In general, \u201ca plaintiff must be given at least one chance to amend the complaint before the district court dismisses the action with prejudice,\u201d unless amending the complaint would be futile. <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">Here, Taylor\u2019s complaint is deficient because he named as defendants individual IRS agents, rather than the United States. <em>See </em>\u00a7 7431(a)(1) (providing that a taxpayer may bring a suit \u201cagainst the United States\u201d); <em>see also Mid-S. Music Corp. v. Kolak, </em>756 F.2d 23, 25 (6th Cir.1984) (\u201c[U]nder 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7431(a)(1) the only proper defendant to such a suit is the United States, and ... no claim is stated against the individual defendants----\u201d (footnote omitted)). He also incorrectly filed his complaint on the <em>form for </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 actions. Thus, the relevant question is whether amending Taylor\u2019s complaint to name the United States as defendant and use the correct form would be futile.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">Under \u00a7 6103(a), \u201creturn information\u201d is confidential and no officer or employee of the United States may disclose any return information except for specific, authorized reasons. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6103(a). \u201cReturn information\u201d includes, among other things, \u201ca taxpayer\u2019s identity\u201d and \u201cwhether the taxpayer\u2019s return was, is being, or will be examined or subject to other investigation or processing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 6103(b)(2)(A). \u201c \u2018[Disclosure\u2019 means the making known to any person in any manner whatever a return or return information.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 6103(b)(8). However, importantly here, IRS officers</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-10\">may, in connection with [their] official duties relating to any audit, collection activity, or civil or criminal tax investigation or any other offense under the internal revenue laws, disclose return information to the extent that such disclosure is necessary in obtaining information, which is not otherwise reasonably available, with respect to the correct determination of tax, liability for tax, or the amount to be collected or with respect to the enforcement of any other provision of this title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-11\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 6103(k)(6). Return information may also be disclosed \u201cpursuant to and upon the grant of an ex parte order by a Federal district court judge or magistrate [judge]\u201d and subject \u201cto inspection by, or disclosure to, officers and employees of any Federal agency who are personally and directly engaged in\u201d (1) \u201cpreparation' for any judicial or administrative proceeding pertaining to the enforcement of a specifically designated Federal criminal statute (not involving tax administration)\u201d; (2) \u201cany investigation which may result in such a proceeding\u201d; or (3) \u201cany Federal grand jury proceeding pertaining to enforcement of such a criminal statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 6103(i)(l)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-12\">The district court concluded that amendment to Taylor\u2019s complaint would be futile because any disclosure was necessary for law enforcement purposes under \u00a7 6103(k)(6). We agree that it is unlikely that Taylor -could raise a plausible claim based on disclosures to other federal law enforcement officers involved in his criminal investigation, any judge, or a grand jury. However, Taylor\u2019s allegations \u2014 taken as true \u2014 that IRS agents disclosed his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>return information \u201cto an employee of Channel 13 News\u201d and to various criminal suspects and various other non-law-enforcement individuals could not be justified by the exceptions listed in \u00a7 6103, and therefore would not be futile.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Of course, \u00a7 7431 also prevents liability for any inspection or disclosure that resulted \u201cfrom a good faith, but erroneous, interpretation of section 6103.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 7431(b)(1). The good faith exception to \u00a7 7431(a) liability is judged by an objective standard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-6\">[T]he good faith exception applies, and thus bars a plaintiff from recovering damages under \u00a7 7431, where 1) the agent or agents who disclosed tax return information in violation of \u00a7 6103 <em>followed the relevant agency regulations and/or manuals, </em>and 2) the regulations and/or manuals followed by those agents constituted a reasonable interpretation of the law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b725-7\"><em>Comyns v. United States, </em>155 F.Supp.2d 1344, 1350 (S.D.Fla.2001) (emphasis added), <em>affd </em>287 F.3d 1034 (11th Cir.2002) (per curiam). The district court did not engage in a good-faith analysis as described in <em>Comyns. </em>Beyond that, Taylor\u2019s allegations that the IRS agents disclosed his return information to numerous third parties do not appear to fall within the bounds of applicable regulations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> If that is the case, the good-faith exception would not apply, and Taylor\u2019s amended complaint would not be futile for the alleged disclosures to the media and other criminal suspects.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-12\">We next address whether the district court\u2019s dismissal <em>without </em>prejudice prevents us from permitting Taylor to amend his complaint. A dismissal without prejudice is tantamount to a dismissal with prejudice if it has the effect of precluding the plaintiff from refiling his claim due to the running of the statute of limitations. <em>Justice v. United States, </em>6 F.3d 1474, 1481-82 &amp; n. 15 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-13\">Here, the district court\u2019s dismissal without prejudice was tantamount to a dismissal with prejudice because, accepting the allegations in Taylor\u2019s complaint as true, the limitations period had probably expired for some of Taylor\u2019s claims before the court dismissed the complaint. The statute of limitations for bringing a claim under \u00a7 7431 is \u201c2 years after the date of discovery by the plaintiff of the unauthorized inspection or disclosure.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7431(d). Taylor alleged in his complaint that many of the improper disclosures occurred between February 12 and May 14, 2012 \u2014 the date the district court dismissed his complaint in 2014. Assuming Taylor learned of the disclosures around the time that they happened,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the two-year statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>of limitations has expired. In short, the district court\u2019s dismissal without prejudice was tantamount to a dismissal with prejudice, and Taylor should be given leave to amend his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">Finally, we address Taylor\u2019s constitutional claims that appear both in his objections to the Magistrate Judge\u2019s report and recommendation and in his brief before this Court. Construed liberally, Taylor\u2019s objections to the R &amp; R constituted a motion requesting leave to amend his complaint in order to add claims under <em>Bivens</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>alleging that his Fourth- and Fifth-Amendment rights were violated. However, because the district court summarily denied Taylor\u2019s R &amp; R objections, we do not know whether the court considered his allegations under the Fourth and Fifth Amendments. Since we are remanding to allow Taylor leave to amend his complaint, he may choose to raise his constitutional claims more clearly, and the district court can rule on them specifically.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">We vacate and remand with instructions that Taylor be afforded an opportunity to amend his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b722-9\">. <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S.' 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b723-9\">. The Magistrate Judge found that Taylor\u2019s claims were barred by <em>Heck </em>in part because his complaint sought \u201cthe termination of his criminal liability, immunity and damages for his time in jail.\u201d However, the mere fact that Taylor requested such relief does not mean that he is entitled to it or that his success as to any of his objectives would necessarily invalidate his convictions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b725-8\">. The relevant regulations \u2014 similar to the statutory language itself \u2014 state that IRS officers \"may [in connection with their official duties relating to civil or criminal investigation] disclose return information, of any taxpayer, to the extent necessary to obtain information relating to such official duties or to accomplish properly any activity connected with such official duties.\u201d 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 301.6103(k)(6)-l(a)(l). Additionally, IRS employees \"may identify themselves, their organizational affiliation ... and the nature of their investigation, when making an oral, written, or electronic contact with a third party witness.\" <em>Id, </em>\u00a7 301.6103(k)(6)-l(a)(3). Finally, the regulations provide that return information may be disclosed to federal employees and by federal employees who are directly involved in a criminal investigation or proceeding, if doing so is necessary. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 301.6103(i) \u2014 1(a)\u2014(b). The regulations contain no exception for disclosures to the media or other criminal suspects.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b725-15\">. Attached to Taylor\u2019s complaint is a memorandum of a conversation that occurred on May 9, 2012 between Taylor and IRS agents in which Taylor said that he had heard the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>IRS was looking for him and that the IRS \"took documents from his office that don\u2019t pertain to him.\u201d This attachment suggests that he knew of some of the disclosures by May 2012.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b726-23\">. <em>Bivens v.
