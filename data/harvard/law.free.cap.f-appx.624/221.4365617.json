Yusuff, </em>218 F.3d 448, 451 (5th Cir.2000). Section 2255 provides the primary means of collaterally attacking a federal conviction and sentence. <em>Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 877 (5th Cir.2000). Section 2241 is generally used to attack the manner in which a sentence is executed. <em>Id. </em>A petition filed, under \u00a7 2241 attacking errors that occurred at trial or sentencing should be construed as a \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See id. </em>at 877-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-20\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>Laureano Chirino Rivera, federal prisoner # 79091-004, appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his habeas corpus petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 224\u00cd. The district court determined that Rivera\u2019s claims attacked the validity of his convictions and sentences for conspiracy to commit robbery and conspiracy to carry a firearm during a crime of violence, which were imposed in the Southern District of Florida. The district court determined that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>Rivera could not pursue relief under \u00a7 2241 because he failed to show that the remedy under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 would be inadequate or ineffective, as is required by the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e). We review the dismissal of a \u00a7 2241 petition de novo. <em>Kinder v. Purdy, </em>222 F.3d 209, 212 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">The district court correctly determined that the claims raised in Rivera\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition challenged his underlying convictions and sentences rather than the manner in which his sentences are being executed. Because Rivera\u2019s claims arise under \u00a7 2255, he may bring them in a \u00a7 2241 petition only if he can meet the requirements of \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause by showing that the remedy under \u00a7 2255 would be \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d \u00a7 2255(e); <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 901 (5th Cir.2001). To make such a showing, he must establish that his claims are \u201cbased on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that the petitioner may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense\u201d and that the claims were \u201cforeclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim[s] should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 904.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">In his appellate brief, Rivera renews several claims set forth in his \u00a7 2241 petition, but he makes no attempt to establish that his claims meet the requirements of the savings clause. He has faded to show error in the district court\u2019s dismissal of his \u00a7 2241 petition. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">Rivera has now filed a total of four unmeritorious \u00a7 2241 petitions attacking the same convictions and sentences. He has also, on at least three occasions, sought authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. He is hereby WARNED that filing frivolous or repetitive challenges to these convictions or sentence in this court or in any court subject to the jurisdiction of this court will invite the imposition of sanctions. Rivera is DIRECTED to review any pending matters to ensure that they are not frivolous or repetitive.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b251-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
