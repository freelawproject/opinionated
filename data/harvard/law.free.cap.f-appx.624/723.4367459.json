The district court found that Cook\u2019s prior conviction for fleeing and eluding a police officer, in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.1935, qualified as a violent felony under the Armed Career Criminal Act\u2019s residual clause, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). Cook objected, arguing that the residual clause was unconstitutionally vague. The court overruled that objection and sentenced him as a career criminal based on that conviction and two other uncontested prior convictions. This is his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-19\">In 2015, while Cook\u2019s appeal was pending, the Supreme Court invalidated the residual clause as unconstitutionally vague in <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>576 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 2556-57, 2563, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015). Because of <em>Johnson, </em>Cook\u2019s fleeing and eluding conviction can serve as a predicate offense only if it qualifies as a violent felony under a different ACCA provision. It does not. The government agrees that Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.1935(l)-(2) does not have \u201cas an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another,\u201d is not \u201cburglary, arson, or extortion,\u201d and does not involve the \u201cuse of explosives.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i)-(ii). Because the ACCA applies only if the defendant has three qualifying offenses, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1), Cook is one offense short of that requirement. For that reason, we vacate his sentence and remand for re-sentencing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b753-22\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b753-17\">. He also contends that his mandatory minimum sentence under the ACCA-is unconstitutional in light of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Because the ACCA does not apply, we need not consider that contention.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
