PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b751-26\">Ronald Lawrence appeals <em>pro se </em>the dismissal of his-complaint, that Thornburg Mortgage Home Loans, Inc., Cenlar Federal Savings Bank, and McCalla Raymer, LLC, conspired to retaliate and to defraud Lawrence in a.loan transaction that ended with a non-judicial foreclosure on his real, property: <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The district court <em>sua sponte </em>dismissed the complaint against Thornburg Mort<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>gage as violative of the automatic stay in its proceedings under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Act. The district court dismissed Lawrence\u2019s complaint against Cen-lar Bank and McCalla Raymer for failure to state a claim for relief, Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), and for failure to plead with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud, Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">Lawrence has abandoned any challenge that he could have made to the dismissal of his complaints against Thornburg Mortgage and McCalla Raymer. \u201cWhile we read briefs filed by pro se litigants liberally, issues not briefed on appeal by a <em>pro se </em>litigant are deemed abandoned.\u201d <em>Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008) (internal citations omitted). Lawrence does not mention, much less dispute, the determination that his action against Thornburg Mortgage violated the automatic stay imposed during its bankruptcy proceeding. And Lawrence does not mention McCalla Raymer in his brief on appeal other than to list the law firm in his certificate of interested persons. We deem abandoned any disagreement that Lawrence might have with the dismissal of his complaints against Thornburg Mortgage and McCalla Raymer.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">The district court did not err by dismissing Lawrence\u2019s complaint against Cenlar Bank. Lawrence complained about a conspiracy to violate his civil rights, but he failed to allege that Cenlar Bank acted under color of state law, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, or that it \u201creached an understanding\u201d with another defendant to deprive Lawrence of any right under state or federal law, <em>see Bailey v. Bd. of Cty. Comm\u2019rs of Alachua Cnty., Fla., </em>956 F.2d 1112, 1122 (11th Cir.1992). Lawrence\u2019s conclusory allegations that \u201cdefendants collectively and individually participated in a conspiracy to retaliate\u201d and \u201cto commit fraud, misrepresentation and to violate well established laws\u201d were insufficient to withstand the motion by Cenlar Bank to dismiss. <em>See Fullman v. Graddick, </em>739 F.2d 553, 556-57 (11th Cir.1984). Lawrence also complained about fraud, but he failed to allege when or what fraudulent representations were purportedly made by Cenlar Bank. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b); <em>Am. Dental Ass\u2019n v. Cigna Corp., </em>605 F.3d 1283, 1291 (11th Cir.2010). Lawrence argues, for the first time, that during the judicial non-foreclosure the defendants sought \u201cto recover on a promissory note\u201d and \u201cto prove up a claim of damages,\u201d but we decline to \u201cconsider issues not presented in the first instance to the [district] court,\u201d <em>BUC Int\u2019l Corp. v. Int\u2019l Yacht Council Ltd., </em>489 F.3d 1129, 1140 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">The district court also did not abuse its discretion when it denied Lawrence\u2019s motion for reconsideration. As the district court stated, Lawrence failed to provide \u201csufficient reason ... to reconsider\u201d the order of dismissal because his motion \u201cmerely repackaged the arguments that he originally asserted in his pro se complaint\u201d and failed to identify any \u201cnew evidence, intervening development or change in the controlling law, or clear error or manifest injustice that would justify ... reconsideration of its [earlier] dismissal order.\u201d <em>See Arthur v. King, </em>500 F.3d 1335, 1343 (11th Cir.2007). And the district court was entitled to dismiss Lawrence\u2019s complaint without <em>sua sponte </em>granting leave to amend because amendment would have been futile. <em>See Cockrell v. Sparks, </em>510 F.3d 1307, 1310 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">We AFFIRM the dismissal of Lawrence\u2019s complaint.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
