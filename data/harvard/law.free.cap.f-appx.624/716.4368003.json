On appeal, Gilbert reiterates the merits of his claims and argues that the district court erred by dismissing his complaint because the defendants were not entitled to any forms of immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-11\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, accepting all factual allegations in the complaint as true and construing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 872 (11th Cir.2008). We liberally construe the pleadings of <em>pro se </em>parties, <em>Campbell v. Air Jamaica Ltd., </em>760 F.3d 1165, 1168 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 759, 190 L.Ed.2d 628 (2014), but <em>pro se </em>litigants still must conform to procedural rules, <em>Albra v. Advan, Inc., </em>490 F.3d 826, 829 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-15\">Rule 8(a)(2), Fed.R.Civ.P., requires a complaint to include \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader, is entitled to relief.\u201d Although there is no \u201ctechnical form,\u201d the plaintiffs allegations \u201cmust be simple, concise, and direct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>8(d)(1). The purpose of Rule 8(a)(2)\u2019s requirement is \u201cto give the defendant fair notice of what the claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.\u201d <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1964, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007) (ellipsis, citation, and internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (\u201c[T]he pleading standard Rule 8 announces does not require \u2018detailed factual allegations,\u2019 but it demands more than an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation.\u201d (citing <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 555, 127 S.Ct. at 1964)).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-16\">To survive a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6), Fed.R.Civ.P., \u201ca complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. at 678, 129 S.Ct. at 1949 (internal quotation marks omitted). Where it appears that a more carefully drafted complaint might state a claim, a <em>pro se </em>plaintiff \u201cmust be given at least one chance to amend the complaint before the district court dismisses the action with prejudice.\u201d <em>See Bank v. Pitt, </em>928 F.2d 1108, 1112 (11th Cir.1991), <em>overruled in part by Wagner v. Daewoo Heavy Indus. Am. Corp., </em>314 F.3d 541, 542 (11th Cir.2002) <em>(en </em>banc) (holding that this rule does not apply to counseled plaintiffs). But the district court need not grant leave to amend \u201cwhere amendment would be futile.\u201d <em>Corsello v. Lineare, Inc., </em>428 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>1008, 1014 (11th Cir.2005); <em>see Bank, </em>928 F.2d at 1112-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">Here, Gilbert filed a \u201cshotgun\u201d pleading. <em>See Weiland v. Palm Beach Cty. Sheriff\u2019s Office, </em>792 F.3d 1313, 1319-20 (11th Cir.2015) (explaining and categorizing shotgun pleadings). His complaint names thirty-two defendants but does not identify which defendant is responsible for what alleged constitutional violation. Additionally, the complaint is not divided into separate paragraphs, each describing a \u201csingle set of circumstances,\u201d as required by the rules. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 10(b). The defendants\u2019 various motions to dismiss raised multiple grounds for dismissal, including failure to state a claim, several types of immunity, insufficient service of process, the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, and the defense that the complaint was a shotgun pleading that failed to give fair notice of the claims raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">The district court granted the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss, but it gave little indication of its reasoning for doing so. The court concluded simply as follows: \u201cThe Plaintiff fails to allege a plausible claim for relief. The Defendants\u2019 Motions, to Dismiss [Doc. 6, 7, 8 &amp; 9] are GRANTED. This action is DISMISSED.\u201d Although the court cited <em>Iqbal </em>and <em>Twombly </em>and found that Gilbert failed to state a claim, it did not address any of the allegations or explain how they failed to meet Rule 8(a)(2)\u2019s pleading standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">\u201cMany times, and in many contexts, this Court has admonished district courts that their orders should contain sufficient explanations of their rulings so as to provide this Court with an opportunity to engage in meaningful appellate review.\u201d <em>Danley v. Allen, </em>480 F.3d 1090, 1091 (11th Cir. 2007). The district court\u2019s order in this case is \u201cdevoid of any facts and any legal analysis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As such, it is difficult for this Court to conduct a meaningful review. <em>See id. </em>at 1091-92.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-11\">Moreover, the district court dismissed the complaint without giving Gilbert the opportunity to amend his complaint or finding that amendment would be futile. <em>See Corsello, </em>428 F.3d at 1014; <em>Bank, </em>928 F.2d at 1112. And at no time before dismissing the action did the court advise Gilbert of the deficiencies in his complaint and instruct him to file an amended complaint. Where allegations are vague and ambiguous and the defendants and court must guess at precisely what the claims are, the court should require the plaintiff to replead his claims. <em>See Byrne v. Nezhat, </em>261 F.3d 1075, 1128-33 (11th Cir.2001); <em>see also </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(e) (permitting the court to order repleader).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-12\">It is \u201cthe responsibility of the district court in the first instance\u201d to review the record and render a reasoned decision on the sufficiency of the allegations in Gilbert\u2019s complaint. <em>Danley, </em>480 F.3d at 1092. Accordingly, we vacate the dismissal of Gilbert\u2019s complaint and we remand for the district court to develop the record and determine, in the first instance, whether Gilbert should be instructed to replead his claims or whether amendment would be futile.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-13\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b748-7\">.

Feld-man, </em>460 U.S. 462, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
