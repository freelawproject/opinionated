We granted Hamilton a certificate of ap-pealability on whether his right to due process was violated when Detective Dean told the jury that Hamilton refused to provide a post-arrest and <em>post-Miranda </em>statement. Hamilton argues that the detective\u2019s testimony infringed on his right to remain silent and denied him due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-8\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a habeas petition <em>de novo, </em>and its factual findings for clear error. <em>Ward v. Hall, </em>592 F.3d 1144, 1155 (11th Cir.2010). However, we may affirm on any ground supported by the record. <em>Trotter v. Sec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Corrs., </em>535 F.3d 1286, 1291 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-10\">It is questionable whether Hamilton fairly presented this claim to the state courts, but, even if he did, his claim would fail on the merits, and we may affirm on that ground. <em>See Trotter, </em>535 F.3d at 1291. Hamilton does not dispute the facts of the testimony at trial. Detective Dean\u2019s testimony at trial reveals that Hamilton did provide a <em>post-Miranda </em>statement, and, consequently, there can be no prejudice from the detective\u2019s comments on Hamilton\u2019s right to remain silent, as Hamilton never exercised' that right. Therefore, Hamilton has not shown a violation of his right to remain silent or a denial of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
