Miranda argues that: (1) the immigration judge (\u201cU\u201d) exhibited bias in his removal proceedings and erred in concluding that his children\u2019s medical conditions did not constitute exceptional and extremely unusual hardship; and (2) the BIA erred in affirming the IJ\u2019s decision and that reopening should have been granted in light of those errors. After thorough review, we dismiss the petition in part and deny it in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-20\">We review our subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Chao Lin v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>677 F.3d 1043, 1045 (11th Cir.2012). Typically, we review for abuse of discretion the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen removal proceedings, and our review, is limited to determining whether the BIA exercised its discretion in an arbitrary or capricious manner. <em>Zhang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>572 F.3d 1316, 1319 (11th Cir.2009). Where a petitioner seeks review of the denial of a motion to reopen based on the BIA\u2019s sua sponte authority, however, we lack jurisdiction over that claim. <em>Lenis v. U.S. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number><em>Att\u2019y Gen., </em>525 F.3d 1291, 1292-93 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">As an initial matter, the law-of-the-case doctrine bars Miranda\u2019s challenge to his final order of removal. Under this doctrine, an appellate court\u2019s fact-findings and conclusions of law are generally binding in all later proceedings in the same case. <em>Mega Life &amp; Health Ins. Co. v. Pieniozek, </em>585 F.3d 1399, 1405 (11th Cir.2009). The law-of-the-case doctrine may only be overcome if: (1) new and substantially different evidence is produced; (2) controlling authority has changed; or (3) the prior decision was clearly erroneous and would result in a manifest injustice. <em>Oladeinde v. City of Birmingham, </em>230 F.3d 1275, 1288 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">To the extent that Miranda seeks to challenge the BIA\u2019s final order affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of his application for cancellation of removal, the law of the case doctrine applies. Miranda presents the same arguments on that issue in the instant appeal as he did in <em>Miranda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen. (\u201cMiranda </em>I\u201d), 561 Fed.Appx. 809 (11th Cir.2014) (unpublished), and we previously concluded that we lacked jurisdiction to review that claim because Miranda\u2019s petition for review was untimely. Furthermore, Miranda has not presented any new or substantially different evidence, does not contend that controlling authority has changed, and has not demonstrated that <em>Miranda I </em>was clearly erroneous. Accordingly, we deny Miranda\u2019s petition to the extent that it challenges his final order of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">As for his challenge to the denial of his second motion to reopen, we lack jurisdiction to review it. Under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), an alien may file one motion to reconsider within 30 days of the BIA\u2019s final order of removal, specifying the errors of law or fact in the BIA\u2019s order. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6); 8 C.F.R. 1003.2(b). An alien may also file one motion to reopen removal proceedings within 90 days of the BIA\u2019s final order of removal, which must state new facts that would be proven at a hearing if the motion were granted and be supported by affidavits or other evidence. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c). Further, the BIA retains the authority to reopen removal proceedings or reconsider a prior decision sua sponte at any time. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-9\">We liberally construe pleadings filed by <em>pro se </em>litigants, holding them to a less stringent standard than those prepared by lawyers. <em>Campbell v. Air Jamaica Ltd., </em>760 F.3d 1165, 1168 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 759, 190 L.Ed.2d 628 (2014). Nevertheless, \u201cissues not briefed on appeal by a <em>pro se </em>litigant are deemed abandoned,\u201d and will not be considered. <em>Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-11\">Contrary to the government\u2019s assertions, Miranda expressly claimed in his brief that he sought review of that decision and argued that reopening was warranted based on the IJ\u2019s errors. Thus, Miranda has not abandoned his challenge to the BIA\u2019s March 2015 denial of his second motion to reopen. Nevertheless, we lack jurisdiction to review that decision. As the BIA noted, Miranda\u2019s motion was time- and number-barred, since it was filed more than 90 days after the issuance of the BIA\u2019s final order of removal and was Miranda\u2019s <em>third </em>motion seeking reconsideration and/or reopening. Consequently, the BIA only could have granted reopening through its sua sponte authority. In fact, Miranda explicitly requested that the BIA exercise its sua sponte authority to reopen his removal proceedings. Because we lack jurisdiction to review a petition challenging the denial of a motion to reopen based on the BIA\u2019s sua sponte authority, we dismiss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>the part of Miranda\u2019s petition challenging the BIA\u2019s March 2015 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">DENIED in part and DISMISSED in part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
