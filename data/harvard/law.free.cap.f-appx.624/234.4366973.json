The district court sentenced Damian to 240 months of imprisonment following his guilty-plea conviction of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine and more than 500 grams of methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-23\">Section 3582(c)(2) of title 18 is narrow in scope, permitting the discretionary modification of a defendant\u2019s sentence only in certain situations. <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 825-26, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010); <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F,3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.2009). We review the district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-24\">Damian addresses neither \u00a7 3582 nor the district court\u2019s determination that he did not meet one of the situations in which \u00a7 3582 permits reduction of a sentence. Rather, Damian challenges the district court\u2019s failure, at his original sentencing, to account for and advise him of the disparate impact of sentences upon deportable aliens. Motions under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), however, may not be used to challenge the correctness of the sentence as it was originally imposed. <em>United States v. Cooley, </em>590 F.3d 293, 297 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-25\">The Second Chance Act, on which Damian relies for his second claim, amended the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>statutory provisions authorizing the Bureau of Prisons to determine an inmate\u2019s eligibility for placement in a halfway house. <em>See </em>Second Chance Act of 2007, Pub.L. No. 110-199, \u00a7 251(a), 122 Stat. 657, 692-93 (April 9, 2008) (codified at \u00a7 17501). Such administrative decisions, however, do not fall within the purview of \u00a7 3582(c) for reducing an inmate\u2019s sentence and also do not provide an independent basis for a sentence reduction. <em>See United States v. Bridges, </em>116 F.3d 1110, 1112 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">We decline to review Damian\u2019s assertion that his appeal is also a Bivens<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> action, which he raises for the first time on appeal. <em>See Leverette v. Louisville Ladder Co., </em>183 F.3d 339, 342 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">The decision of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b264-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b265-23\">. <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed.
