We review the BIA\u2019s denial under a highly deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gomez-Palacios v. Holder, </em>560 F.3d 354, 358 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-16\">Yang contends that the BIA violated her due process rights when it failed to \u201cgive full and fair consideration\u201d to all of her evidence and arguments in support of her motion. She faults the BIA for refusing to consider persuasive authority from other circuits, and she asserts that the BIA wrongly ignored unspecified portions of the 2013 Congressional-Executive Commission on China Annual report she submitted. Yang urges that the BIA\u2019s denial of due process requires remand without further analysis of the underlying merits of her motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-21\">The BIA denied Yang\u2019s motion to reopen both because it determined that she had failed to show materially changed circumstances in China since her 2006 hearing and because she had failed to make a prima facie showing that she would be subjected to torture or persecution if returned to China so as to be eligible for relief from removal. As the Government points out, Yang fails to brief any argument challenging the BIA\u2019s separate, dis-positive conclusion that she failed to make a prima facie showing of eligibility for relief from removal. <em>See INS v. Abudu, </em>485 U.S. 94, 104-05, 108 S.Ct. 904, 99 L.Ed.2d 90 (1988) (stating that, independent of whether a showing of changed circumstances has been made, the BIA may deny a motion to reopen if it determines that the applicant \u201chas not established a prima facie case for the underlying relief sought.\u201d). Yang has thus waived any challenge to that determination. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003). Consequently, she cannot show that the BIA abused its discretion in denying her motion to reopen. <em>See Gomez-Palacios, </em>560 F.3d at 358; <em>see also Abudu, </em>485 U.S. at 104-05, 108 S.Ct. 904.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-22\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b244-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
