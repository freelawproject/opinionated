Collins challenged, for the first time on appeal, his classification as a career offender, <em>see </em>United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 4B1.1 (Nov. 2013), on \u2018the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>ground that his prior conviction for resisting an officer with violence, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 843.01, did not qualify tas a crime of violence under the residual clause. At our direction, the parties have filed supplemental letter briefs addressing what, if any, effect <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>576 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015), has on this appeal. Because Collins now concedes that there is no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">Collins acknowledges that the district court did not err, much less plainly err, by sentencing him as a career offender. In his supplemental brief, Collins concedes that his challenge to the use of his prior conviction as a predicate offense is foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Hill, </em>799 F.3d 1318 (11th Cir.2015), where we \u201cheld that a prior conviction for resisting an officer with violence categorically qualifies as a violent felony\u201d under the elements clause of the career offender guideline. <em>Id. </em>at 1322-23. In the alternative, Collins also concedes that any argument that the residual clause of the career offender guideline is void for vagueness is foreclosed by our recent decision in <em>United States v. Matchett, </em>802 F.3d 1185 (11th Cir.2015). As we explained in <em>Matchett, </em>\u201c[bjecause there is no constitutional right to sentencing guidelines \u2014 or, more generally, to a less discretionary application of sentences than that permitted prior to the Guidelines \u2014 the limitations the Guidelines place on a judge\u2019s discretion cannot violate a defendant\u2019s right to due process by reason of being vague.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1194-95 (quoting <em>United States v. Wivell, </em>893 F.2d 156, 160 (8th Cir.1990)). Collins disagrees'with our precedents, but \u201c[ujnder the prior precedent rule, we are bound to follow a prior binding precedent unless and until it is overruled by this court <em>en banc </em>or by the Supreme Court,\u201d <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>606 F.3d 1303, 1305 (11th Cir.2010) (quoting <em>United States v. Vega-Castillo, </em>540 F.3d 1235, 1236 (11th Cir.2008)).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">We AFFIRM Collins\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
