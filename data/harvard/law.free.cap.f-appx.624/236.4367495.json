The district court sentenced Tapia above the advisory guidelines range to 48 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-17\">In his sole issue on appeal, Tapia challenges his above-guidelines sentence as substantively unreasonable. He argues that the district \u201ccourt was wrong to treat the oldest offenses on equal footing with the newest [offenses]\u201d and that his older offenses \u201chave far less bearing\u201d on his history and characteristics.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-22\">We review sentences for reasonableness. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). An above-guidelines sentence is unreasonable if the district court (1) did not account for a factor that should have received significant weight, (2) gave significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor, or (3) made a clear error of judgment in balancing the sentencing factors. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 708 (5th Cir.2006). We must consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence based on \u201cthe totality of the circumstances, including the extent of any variance from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>United States v. Brantley, </em>537 F.3d 347, 349 (5th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201cIn making this determination, we must give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u201d <em>United States v. Gerezano-Ro-sales, </em>692 F.3d 393, 401 (5th Cir.2012) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-23\">Tapia\u2019s argument that the district court gave too much weight to his criminal history is unavailing. The record reflects that the district court gave Tapia\u2019s counsel, and Tapia himself, an opportunity to speak before the sentence was imposed. The district court noted that Tapia had \u201can extensive criminal history,\u201d including five DWI convictions, three prior convictions for immigration offenses, 11 \u201capprehensions by the Border Patrol,\u201d and two convictions for false or fraudulent documents, amounting to \u201ca total of ten prior convictions, eight of which received, zero criminal history <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>points.\u201d Based on this information, the district court made an individualized assessment that a sentence within Tapia\u2019s 10-to-16 month guidelines range would not adequately address the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 807 (5th Cir.2008). Tapia has not shown that the district court committed clear error in balancing the sentencing factors. <em>See Smith, </em>440 F.3d at 708.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">Although Tapia complains that his 48-month sentence is \u201cthree-times the high end of the guideline range,\u201d we have affirmed similar or greater variances as substantively reasonable where the district court based its upward variance on permissible considerations. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Key, </em>599 F.3d 469, 475-76 (5th Cir.2010); <em>Brantley, </em>537 F.3d at 348-50; <em>United States v. Smith, </em>417 F.3d 483, 492 (5th Cir.2005). Here, the district court based its upward variance on factors found in \u00a7 3553(a). Accordingly, the 48-month sentence, which was 32 months above the top of the guidelines range of 10 to 16 months of imprisonment, is substantively reasonable. <em>See Smith, </em>440 F.3d at 708, 710.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b266-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
