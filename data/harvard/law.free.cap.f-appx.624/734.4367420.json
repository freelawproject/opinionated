The district court granted summary judgment to the defendants on the ground that Anderson failed to make a prima facie case of employment discrimination. Anderson then filed a borderline frivolous motion to alter or amend the judgment, which the district court properly denied. <em>See Anderson v. Fla. Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Prot., </em>567 Fed.Appx. 679, 680 (11th Cir.2014). He now moves, under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(d)(3), for relief from the district court\u2019s judgment, arguing that it was the product of fraud on the court. This latest motion \u2014 which is based on a conclu-sory assertion, that the defendants\u2019 case rested on perjury and fabricated evidence \u2014 is also without merit. In any event, perjury and fabricated evidence do not constitute fraud on the court because they can and should be exposed at trial. <em>Travelers Indem. Co. v. Gore, </em>761 F.2d 1549, 1552 (11th Cir.1985). Fraud on the court is \u201climited to more egregious forms of subversion of the legal process, ... those we cannot necessarily expect to be exposed to by the normal adversary process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Great Coastal Express v. Bhd. of Teamsters, </em>675 F.2d 1349, 1356 (4th Cir.1982)). Because the fraud Anderson alleges does not rise to the level of \u201cfraud on the court,\u201d the district court was correct to deny his Rule 60(d)(3) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
