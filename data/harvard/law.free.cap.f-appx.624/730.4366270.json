After Jackson pleaded guilty to both counts, the district court imposed a sentence of 90-months imprisonment, which was at the low end of the range provided by the United States Sentencing Guidelines. On appeal, Jackson argues that this sentence was substantively unreasonable in light of the. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. He contends that the district court did not properly consider his history of mental illness and the nature of the sting operation that secured his conviction in refusing to grant him a downward variance from the guideline sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-17\">We review for abuse of discretion the substantive reasonableness of a sentence, considering the totality of the circumstances. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The party challenging the sentence bears the burden of showing its unreasonableness in light of the record and. the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. <em>United States v. Tome, </em>611 F.3d 1371, 1378 (11th Cir.2010). We ordinarily expect that a sentence imposed by the district court within the guideline range is reasonable. <em>United States v, Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-18\">A district court must consider a variety of factors under \u00a7 3553(a) when imposing a sentence, including: the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the need for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense, the need to deter criminal conduct and protect the public from future crimes of the defendant, the U.S. Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statements, and the advisory guideline range. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The weight given to each \u00a7 3553(a) factor is committed to the sound discretion of the district court, and we will not substitute our judgment in weighing the relevant factors. <em>United States v. Dougherty, </em>754 F.3d 1353, 1361 (11th Cir.2014). We will not vacate a sentence unless we \u201care left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>tence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir.2008) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">We find the sentence imposed by the district court to be reasonable. Jackson argues that the district court did not adequately consider his mental illnesses and their impact on his criminal conduct when imposing his sentence. However, the district court clearly considered Jackson\u2019s mental illnesses as required under \u00a7 3553(a). The court listened to Jackson\u2019s mental health arguments at the sentencing hearing and noted Jackson\u2019s \u201cdocumented history of serious mental disease.\u201d The court explicitly stated that it was sympathetic to people with mental health problems, but reasoned that it \u201cha[d] to be concerned primarily for the safety of the community.\u201d The court also stated that it had considered Jackson\u2019s presentence report and each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Beyond that, the court imposed a sentence at the bottom end of the guideline range and \u201cstrongly reeommend[ed] mental health treatment\u201d for Jackson, in recognition of his mental illnesses. The district court did not abuse its considerable discretion in deciding how to weigh each \u00a7 3553(a) factor and imposing a sentence of 90-months imprisonment. <em>See Dough-erty, </em>754 F.3d at 1361.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">After careful review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
