Stat. \u00a7 893.13(1) qualified him as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although he concedes that this Court previously determined, in <em>United States v. Smith, </em>775 F.3d 1262 (11th Cir.2014), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 2827, 192 L.Ed.2d 864 (2015), that a violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13(1) qualifies as a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d for purposes of the Sentencing Guidelines\u2019 career offender enhancement, Humphrey argues, for the purpose of preserving his appellate rights, that <em>Smith </em>was incorrect.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-23\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s decision to classify a defendant as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>United States v. Gibson, </em>434 F.3d 1234, 1243 (11th Cir.2006). This Court is \u201cbound to follow a prior binding precedent unless and until it is overruled by this court en bane or by the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>United States v. Vega-Castillo, </em>540 F.3d 1235, 1236 (11th Cir.2008) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-24\">A defendant is a career offender if, <em>inter alia, </em>he has at least two prior felony convictions for a controlled substance offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a). A \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d is \u201can offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>prohibits the manufacture, import, export, distribution, or dispensing of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) or the possession of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) with intent to manufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4B1.2(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">Under Florida law, it is a crime to \u201csell, manufacture, or deliver, or possess with intent to sell, manufacture,'or deliver, a controlled substance.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13(l)(a). Where the offense involves cocaine, it is a second-degree felony and carries a 15-year maximum term of imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 893.13(l)(a)(l), <em>cross-referencing id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 775.082(3)(d), 893.03(2)(a)(4). In 2002, the Florida legislature eliminated knowledge of the illicit nature of a substance as an element of controlled substance offenses under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13(1). <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 893.101(2). Subsequently, this Court has determined that a prior conviction under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13(1) is a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(b) and, therefore, qualifies as a predicate felony for the purposes of the career offender enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a). <em>Smith, </em>775 F.3d at 1267-68. \u201cNo element of <em>mens rea </em>with respect to the illicit nature of the controlled substance is expressed or implied\u201d in the Guidelines\u2019 definition of a controlled substance offense. <em>Id. </em>at 1267.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">The district court did not err in determining that Humphrey\u2019s prior convictions under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13(1) were controlled substance offenses for purposes of the career offender enhancement. <em>See id. </em>at 1267-68. As Humphrey concedes, his argument on appeal is foreclosed by our decision in <em>Smith.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b754-16\">. Humphrey\u2019s offense level was 31, and his criminal history category was VI, yielding an advisory guidelines range of 188 to 235 months.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b754-17\">. One felony drug conviction was in 2004, and the other in 2007. The government contended that Humphrey also had a third prior qualifying conviction, namely, his 2003 drug conviction, but that prior conviction is not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"A96\">.Humphrey actually argues that neither of his prior convictions should qualify as a \"serious drug offense,\u201d but he is quoting language from the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), which is not relevant in this case. We presume Humphrey means to argue that neither of his prior convictions should qualify as a \"controlled substance offense\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
