Lamour sought a reduction under Amendment 782 to the Sentencing Guidelines, but the district court ruled that Lamour, as a career offender, was ineligible for a reduction. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-21\">Lamour pleaded guilty to conspiring to possess with intent to distribute one kilogram or more of heroin. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. Lamour\u2019s presentence investigation report assigned him a base offense level of 37 because he qualified as a career offender based on his two prior convictions for drug offenses, <em>see </em>United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 4B1.1 (Nov. 2008), and reduced that level by three points for his acceptance of responsibility, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 3E1.1. With an offense level of 34 and a criminal history of VI, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 4B1.1, Lamour\u2019s presentence investigation report provided an advisory guideline range between 262 and 327 months of imprisonment. Lamour argued that his classification as a career offender overstated his criminal conduct and asked for a downward variance based on the statutory sentencing factors, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and his cooperation with the government. The government stated that it was too early to move for a reduction of sentence, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1, but if it were to file such a motion, it would request a reduction of 25 percent. The district court \u201cgrant[ed] a variance based upon the proffer made by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>the government\u201d and sentenced Lamour to 196 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">\u201cThis Court reviews <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding its own authority under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Davis, </em>587 F.3d 1300, 1303 (11th Cir.2009). A district court may reduce a term of imprisonment only when the defendant\u2019s guideline range is lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c). Any reduction must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission,\u201d <em>id., </em>which preclude a \u201cfull resentencing of the defendant,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(3); <em>see Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 831, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2694, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">The district court did not err when it denied Lamour\u2019s motion to reduce his sentence; Because Lamour\u2019s sentence is based on the career offender guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, not on the drug quantity tables, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 '2D1.1, he is ineligible for a sentence reduction under Amendment 782. <em>See United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1321 (11th Cir.2012); <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1327-30 (11th Cir.2008). Lamour challenges his classification as a career offender on the ground that one of his prior convictions no longer qualifies as a predicate offense under the guidelines, but when considering a reduction of sentence \u201call original sentencing determinations remain unchanged,\u201d <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000). The district court lacked authority to reduce Lamour\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-8\">We AFFIRM the denial of Lamour\u2019s motion to reduce.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
