A rule to show cause issued but of this Court and return has been made showing, the relevant facts and circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-13\">The District Court after hearing ruled upon the matters presented for its determination and, under settled doctrine, we can find no occasion for mandamus. <em>Ex parte Roe, </em>234 U. S. 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-14\">Involved in the cause are questions touching the liability of the Director General of Railroads as Agent designated by the President under the Transportation Act of 1920 for maritime torts committed by vessels un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>der federal control; his power to enter appearance by counsel without prior service of process; and whether in the same proceeding he may take different and antagonistic positions, first as the agent of one railroad system and then of another.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">We cannot say the court below was clearly without jurisdiction to determine all the points presented. Moreover, by appeal in the ordinary way possible errors can be corrected; and there is no imperative reason for awarding a writ of prohibition. <em>Ex parte Gordon, </em>104 U.
