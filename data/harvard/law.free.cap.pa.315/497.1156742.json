Watkins obtained a policy of insurance from the appellant company in which the latter agreed to pay the insured\u2019s wife, Elizabeth M. Watkins, the sum of $20,000 upon receipt of due proof of the death of the insured during the continuance of the policy. It also agreed to pay the beneficiary \u201cthe further sum of $20,000 upon receipt of due proof that such death of the insured occurred during the continuance of said policy while there was no default in the payment of premium, as a result, directly and independently of all other causes, of bodily injuries, effected solely through external, violent and accidental means, of which, except in the case of drowning or of internal injuries revealed by an autopsy, there is a visible contusion or wound on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>exterior of the body, and that such death occurred within sixty days of the accident, provided, however, that no accidental death benefit shall be payable if such death resulted from suicide \u2014 whether sane or insane; from having engaged in aviation or submarine operations. ......\u201d On March 19, 1928, Watkins obtained another policy from the same company providing for the payment of sixty monthly installments of $200 each, upon the happening of the same contingencies as those specified in the first policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s statement sets forth that on April 16, 1931, \u201cthe insured, while engaged in his own pursuits in his garage, without intention on his part, but accidentally, inhaled carbon monoxide gas, as a result of which, directly and independently of all other causes, he died\u201d on the same day. Defendant contested the suit on the ground that the inhalation was not accidental but intentional. The plaintiff claimed $20,000, being the amount of the accidental death benefit under the first policy, and also three installments of $200 each due in April, May and June, 1931, under the second policy, making a total claim of $20,600 with interest. The case was tried before a jury and a verdict was returned for the plaintiff in the sum of $22,582.85. Defendant asked for a new trial. Upon refusal, this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">The first assignment of error is that the court charged the jury as follows: \u201cWhere it is shown, as it is here, that death resulted from external and violent means, there is a presumption that it was accidental and that it was not intentional.\u201d The second assignment of error is that the court charged the jury as follows: \u201cTherefore, the plaintiff\u2019s case goes to you necessarily, upon the showing that the death of Mr. Watkins was by external and violent means, and the necessary element of accidental death is, prima facie, supplied by the presumption against suicide.\u201d The third assignment of error is based upon an excerpt from the court\u2019s charge to the same effect as the foregoing. The fourth assignment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>error was the affirmation of plaintiff\u2019s first point, reading as follows: \u201cNorman C. Watkins haying died a violent death, viz.: by carbon monoxide poisoning, the law presumes that his death was not by suicide but was accidental.\u201d The fifth assignment of error was the affirmation of plaintiff\u2019s second point, reading as follows: \u201cThis presumption has the same probative force and effect as direct evidence of accidental death.\u201d The sixth assignment of error was the affirmation of plaintiff\u2019s sixth point, reading as follows: \u201cUnless the jury find that the evidence of the defendant outweighs the presumption that Norman C. Watkins did not commit suicide, the verdict must be for the plaintiff.\u201d The eighth assignment of error was the refusal of defendant\u2019s fourth point, reading as follows: \u201cThere is no presumption in this case that Norman C. Watkins died an accidental death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ANq0\">The court erred in giving to the so-called \u201cpresumption against suicide\u201d the weight of a probative fact, thereby casting upon the defendant the burden of proving that the insured\u2019s death was something other than the kind of death insured against. Considerable confusion appears in judicial opinions as to the nature of presumptions and their function in the administration of justice. They are not evidence and should not be substituted for evidence. Presumptions are generally grouped into two major classes: (1) of law; and (2) of fact. The former usually have the force of legal maxims and become rules of law, with definite procedural consequences. As Mr. Justice Agnew said in Tanner v. Hughes and Kincaid, 53 Pa. 289: \u201cA legal presumption is the conclusion of the law itself of the existence of one fact from others in proof, and is binding on the jury, prima facie till disproved, or conclusively, just as the law adopts the one or the other as the effect of proof.\u201d Justice Agnew also refers to the other kind of presumption as merely \u201ca natural probability,\u201d i. e., \u201can inference of fact of the probability.\u201d Wigmore on Evidence, 2d edition, volume 5, section 2491, says: \u201cThe distinc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>tion between presumptions \u2018of law\u2019 and presumptions \u2018of fact\u2019 is in truth the difference between things that are in reality presumptions and things that are not presumptions at all. A presumption is in its characteristic feature a rule of law laid down by the judge, and attaching to one evidentiary fact certain procedural consequences as to the duty of production of other evidence by the opponent. It is based, in policy, upon the probative strength, as a matter of reasoning and inference, of the evidentiary fact; but the presumption is not the fact itself, nor the inference itself, but the legal consequence attached to it.......A \u2018presumption of fact,\u2019 in the loose sense, is merely an improper term for the rational potency, or probative value, of the evidentiary fact, regarded as not having this necessary legal consequence. \u2018They are, in truth, but mere arguments,\u2019 and \u2018depend upon their own natural force and efficacy in generating belief or conviction in the mind.\u2019 (Greenleaf, Evidence, section 44.) They have no significance so far as affects the duty of one or the other party to produce evidence, because there is no rule of law attached to them, and the jury may give to them whatever force or weight it thinks best....... So long as the law attaches no legal consequences in the way of a duty upon the opponent to come forward with contrary evidence, there is no propriety in applying the term \u2018presumption\u2019 to such facts, however great their probative significance. The employment here of the term \u2018presumption\u2019 is due simply to historical usage, by which \u2018presumption\u2019 was originally a term equivalent, in one sense, to \u2018inference.\u2019 ...... There is in truth but one kind of presumption; and the term \u2018presumption of fact\u2019 should be discarded as useless and confusing. Nevei\u2019theless, it must be kept in mind that the peculiar effect of a presumption \u2018of law\u2019 (that is, the real presumption) is merely to invoke a rule of law compelling the jury to reach the conclusion <em>in the absence of evidence to the contrary </em>from the opponent.\u201d Wigmox*e says further in section 2492: \u201cIn strictness, there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>eannot be such a thing as a \u2018conclusive presumption.\u2019 Wherever from one fact another is conclusively presumed, in the sense that the opponent is absolutely precluded from showing by any evidence that the second fact does not exist, the rule really provides that, where the first fact is shown to exist, the second fact\u2019s existence is wholly immaterial for the purpose of the proponent\u2019s case; and to provide this is to make a rule of substantive law, and not a rule apportioning the burden of persuading as to certain propositions or varying the duty of coming forward with evidence. The term has no place in the principles of evidence (although the history of a \u2018conclusive presumption\u2019 often includes a genuine presumption as its earlier stage), and should be discarded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">It is obvious that what are originally mere inferences may in time become presumptions of law. If, for example, \u201cin the beginning,\u201d 100 human beings had been created, and sometime later 51% or more had died, there would then have arisen an inference that all men are mortal. Later in the course of time, with additional data all supporting the same inference, it would become a presumption of law that all men are mortal. Judge Baldwin of the Supreme Court of Errors of Connecticut has admirably characterized the nature of presumption as follows, in Ward v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 33 A. 902, 904: \u201cThe term \u2018presumption\u2019 is used to signify that which may be assumed without proof, or taken for granted....... It is asserted as a self-evident result of human reason and experience. In its origin, every presumption is one of fact, and not of law. It may, in course of time, become a presumption of law, and even an indisputable one. Its truth may be so universally accepted as to elevate it to the position of a maxim of jurisprudence. Its convenience, as a rule of decision, may be so generally recognized- as to place it in the rank of legal fictions. But,, so long as it retains its original character as a presumption of fact, it has simply the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>force of an argument: 1 Greenleaf, Evidence, section 44; Steph. Dig. Evidence 246.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-3\">\u201cPresumptions of fact are at best but mere arguments, and are to be judged by the common and received tests of the truth of propositions and the validity of arguments\u201d: Lawhorn v. Carter, 11 Bush. 7. Professor Thayer in his Storrs Lectures, 1896, before the Law School of Yale University, said: \u201cBy a loose habit of speech, the presumption is occasionally said to be, itself, evidence, and juries are told to put it on the scale and weigh it...... A presumption itself contributes no evidence, and has no probative quality. It is sometimes said that the presumption will tip the scale when the evidence is balanced. But, in truth, nothing tips the scale but evidence, and a presumption \u2014 being a legal rule or a legal conclusion \u2014 is not evidence. It may represent and spring from certain evidential facts; and these facts may be put in the scale. But that is not putting in the presumption itself. A presumption may be called \u2018an instrument of proof,\u2019 in the sense that it determines from whom evidence shall come, and it may be called something \u2018in the nature of evidence,\u2019 for the same reason; or it may be called a substitute for evidence, and even \u2018evidence\u2019 \u2014 in the sense that it counts at the outset, for evidence enough to make a prima facie case. But the moment these conceptions give way to the perfectly distinct notion of evidence proper \u2014 i. e., probative matter, which may be a basis of inference, something capable of being weighed in the scales of reason and compared and estimated with other matter of the probative sort \u2014 so that we get to treating the presumption of innocence or any other presumption, as being evidence in this its true sense, then we have wandered into the region of shadows and phantoms.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">As they deliberated on this case the jurors had the right to bear in mind the fact that to the average- human being, life is more attractive than death. They were thus entitled to consider, on , an even balance of the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>as between accidental death and suicide, the probabilities against suicide; but the court below erred in its interpretation and application of the so-called \u201cpresumption against suicide.\u201d The court gave to the ordinary probability that a human being will not commit suicide the force of a fact in evidence shifting the burden, of proof to the defendant. The court charged the jury (as above noted) : \u201cThe necessary element of accidental death is, prima facie, supplied by the presumption against suicide.\u201d \u201cNorman C. Watkins having died a violent death, viz., by carbon monoxide poisoning, the law presumes that his death was not by suicide but was accidental.\u201d These instructions made the fact of <em>accidental </em>death such a to-be-expected concomitant of a <em>violent death by carbon monowide poisoning </em>as to render it unnecessary for the plaintiff, after prima facie proving the latter, to offer further testimony in support of the cause of action sued upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">It is true that there is a reasonable inference against death being self-inflicted, but this inference does not have a sufficiently broad factual base to warrant its projection to the height of a presumption of law. Presumptions are not fact suppliers; they are guide-posts indicating whence proof must come; for example, in criminal cases, the presumption of innocence mantling an accused is a challenge of proof, to the asserter of guilt. Sometimes the party who has the burden of persuading the jury does not have all through the case the burden of coming forward with affirmative evidence; as for example, in a criminal case if insanity is pleaded, the burden of proving it is on the defendant, who <em>presumably </em>is sane.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">Presumptions arise as follows: They are either (1) a procedural expedient, or (2) a rule of proof production based upon the comparative availability of material evidence to the respective parties, or (3) a conclusion firmly based upon the generally known results of wide human experience, or (4) a combination of (1) and (3). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>The presumption as to the survivorship of husband and wife meeting death in a common disaster is a procedural expedient. It is not based upon extensive data arising from human experience. An unexplained absence for seven years raises the presumption of the death of the absentee upon the expiration of the last day of the period. This also is a procedural expedient \u2014 an arbitrary but necessary rule for the solution of problems arising from unexplained absences of human beings. An example of (2) is the rule requiring persons on trial for doing certain acts which are illegal if done without a license to produce evidence that they belong to the class privileged by license. See Com. v. Wenzel, 24 Pa. Superior Ct. 467. The following are examples of (3) : (a) an envelope properly addressed and stamped will reach the addressee if the latter is alive; (b) a child born during the wedlock of its parents is legitimate; (c) a person who drives across a railroad crossing will show due care. If the driver is killed at such a crossing, the presumption that he showed due care shifts the burden of proof to the party who defends the action on the ground of the victim\u2019s want of care. (In this example, the presumption of the victim\u2019s due care is merely the converse of the statement that the burden of proof rests on the asserter of the victim\u2019s negligence.) A presumption that a debt is paid after a lapse of a definite long period of time is both a procedural expedient (1) and a conclusion based on the results of wide human experience (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-3\">The so-called \u201cpresumption against suicide\u201d is neither a procedural expedient (1) nor a rule rooted in the consideration that one of the litigants has possession of the most available evidence determinative of the issue trying (2), nor is it a conclusion based on the known results of wide human experience (3). It is merely a permissible consideration of the nonprobability of death by suicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">In judicial trials, as in the other affairs of life, probabilities are always being weighed by those who have to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>decide questions of fact, but probabilities are not legal presumptions. That a witness who has an interest in the outcome of a lawsuit will \u201ccolor his testimony\u201d accordingly, is a probability which jurors have a right to consider, but it is not a presumption. Any fabrication of testimony gives rise to a permissible inference by the jury of the lack of credibility of the entire testimony of the fabricator, but this legitimate inference does not amount to a legal presumption that his entire testimony is false. In the instant case the general probability against suicide did not shift the burden of producing evidence upon the party against whom it operated. Here the burden of proving that the death of the insured was caused through \u201cexternal, violent and accidental means\u201d was squarely placed on the plaintiff. Under the contract of insurance she, in order to make out a cause of action against the defendant for the amount claimed, had to incorporate in her statement these averments. For a commensurate recovery her proof had to sustain them. What the trial judge aptly called \u201cthe necessary element of accidental death\u201d was not (as he said it was) \u201csupplied by the presumption against suicide.\u201d No presumptions ever take the place of proof. The so-called \u201cpresumption against suicide\u201d is merely an inference or argument; it is not what Justice Agnew, in the opinion above cited, properly designates as a \u201clegal presumption binding on the jury, prima facie, till disproved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">Accidental death, as opposed to self-inflicted death, is no more to be legally presumed than suicide is to be presumed as against homicide. There are thousands of homicides annually, still more suicides and the number of the latter is surpassed by the number of fatal accidents.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Yet it might easily happen in some years that the ratios would be reversed. Chief Justice Gibson said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>in Burr v. Sim, 4 Wharton 149,171, that perils of the sea are not to be presumed. \u201cThey are such as may or may not occur.\u201d He said further: \u201cA natural presumption arises only from a violent probability, because it is a conclusion drawn by experience from the usual current of things; but no violent probability of death arises from a peril, which, though possible, is remote.\u201d When the issue is death by accident against death by suicide, the data as to the respective total number of deaths from these two causes is not in the average mind so decisively balanced against the probability of death by suicide as to \u201charden\u201d the inference against death by suicide into a presumption of law which shifts the burden of proof to the defendant in a suit on an insurance policy against death as a result \u201cof bodily injuries, effected solely through external, violent and accidental means.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b533-3\">An examination of many cases concerning presumptions, particularly \u201cpresumptions against suicide,\u201d reveals what has been aptly characterized as \u201ca welter of loose language and discordant decisions concerning presumptions.\u201d The confusion of thought and expression in the understanding and application of this so-called \u201cpresumption against suicide\u201d has arisen from three main causes: (1) the treating of an ordinary permissible deduction as a compellable assumption, i. e., as a presumption, putting on the person on whom it operates the burden of coming forward with opposing evidence, or suffering the penalty of having the so-called presumption accepted as verity; (2) the treating of this permissible deduction as evidence; and (3) the failure to distinguish between suits on insurance policies like the one here sued on, which insure against death as a result \u201cof bodily injuries effected solely through external, violent and accidental means\u201d and suits on those policies which insure against death but which contain a proviso avoiding the policy if the insured dies by his own act. As to (1), this we have already discussed. As to (2), \u201cIt is a fallacy to attribute (as do some judges) an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>artificial probative force to a presumption, increasing for the jury the weight of the facts, even when the opponent has come forward with <em>some </em>evidence to the contrary\u201d : Wigmore on Evidence, 2d edition, volume 5, section 2491. \u201c...... No presumption can <em>be </em>evidence; it is a rule about the duty of producing evidence\u201d: Ibid., section 2511. Presumptions are always independent of evidence. Chief Justice Shaw in Webster\u2019s Case, 5 Cushing 295, 320, was careful to note this in his charge. There he said: \u201cAll the presumptions of law independent of evidence are in favor of innocence.\u201d In Agnew v. United States, 165 U. S. 36, counsel for the plaintiff in error (who was the defendant below) asked the trial court to instruct the jury that the presumption of innocence was \u201cto be treated as evidence giving rise to resulting proof to the full extent of its legal efficacy.\u201d This instruction was refused. The Supreme Court of the United States, in an opinion by Chief Justice Fuller, said that the instruction was well declined \u201con the ground of its tendency to mislead.\u201d In Lisbon v. Lyman, 49 N. H. 553, the issue was as to the emancipation of a minor, and the jury was instructed that there was a presumption that children under twenty-one are not emancipated, and that the jury was to take this element into account and weigh it in connection with all the testimony. The Supreme Court of New Hampshire held: \u201cThe presumption against the freedom of minors was not an element of evidence and could not be weighed as evidence.\u201d As to (3), when in a suit on a policy containing a provision avoiding the policy if the insured dies by his own hand, plaintiff makes out a prima facie case, and defendant seeks to avail itself of the substantive defense reserved in the policy that the loss was due to a cause or risk <em>specifically excepted in the policy, </em>the defense becomes an affirmative one and has the burden of proof. See Bowers v. Great Eastern Casualty Co., 260 Pa. 147, 103 A. 536; Carnes v. Iowa Traveling Men\u2019s Assn., 76 N. W. 683, and Home Benefit Assn. v. Sargent, 142 U. S. 691.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>An instruction that jurors trying the issue presented here, in balancing the evidence for and against the conflicting theories of accidental death and suicide, may keep in mind the general probability against suicide \u2014 a probability arising from \u201cthe usual current of things\u201d\u2014 is proper. But, to charge the jury that after plaintiff proved the insured\u2019s death through external and violent means, the balance of the proof required to maintain the cause of action, that is, \u201cthe necessary element \u00f3f accidental death is, prima facie, supplied by the presumption against suicide,\u201d is erroneous. Reason leads to this conclusion and authority supports it.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-3\">In Grosvenor v. Fidelity &amp; C. Co., 102 Neb. 629, 168 N. W. 596, where the plaintiff in an action on an accident policy alleged that the insured lost his life by accidental carbolic acid poisoning, and the defendant\u2019s answer contained a general denial and allegation that the insured took his own life by drinking a deadly poison, it was held that the burden was on the plaintiff to show that death was accidental, and that she must do so by evidence of the actual facts, or a situation from which accident is the reasonable and not <em>a </em>reasonable inference or possibility, and that the plaintiff having offered no evidence a directed verdict in her favor was error. The Supreme Court of Nebraska, in its opinion, stated: \u201cBecause men love life and fear death, they instinctively avoid obvious danger. This fact, drawn from experience, is the basis of a presumption, relied upon by plaintiff, that when the cause or manner of death is unknown we infer that it was not suicidal. The inference is not based upon a law of nature which is invariable. Men do frequently commit suicide. It is one of a multitude of legitimate inferences, in which we infer the unknown from the known, having greater or less degrees of probability, which we use in reasoning to arrive at the ultimate fact....... When, knowing only that one has died from drinking carbolic acid, you say you are in doubt as to cause, and then, bringing into service the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>presumption against suicidal intent, you finally conclude that the death was accidental, are you not guilty of that error known in logic as petitio principii? Had you not, in reaching your first conclusion, given the theory of accident the benefit of the truth upon which the presumption is founded? Had you assumed as a fact that the deceased contemplated suicide or was indifferent to life, you might not have entertained the doubt. Let us suppose experience has shown that of all the persons who have died from drinking carbolic acid three out of four were cases of suicide; then, would it not be palpably absurd to infer in the given case that the death was not intentional? ...... The presumption against intentional death can no longer prevail as prima facie proof. The burden was and remained upon plaintiff to prove his case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">In Keefer v. Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co., 201 Pa. 448, 51 A. 366, this court held that when the burden is upon the plaintiff, as it is here, to prove the death of the insured was caused by external, violent and accidental means, the proof could not be based either upon conjecture or presumption. Justice Potter there said: \u201cThere could be no presumption as between disease and accidental means, within the terms of the policy.\u201d We say here that there can be no presumption between accidental cause and suicide, within the terms of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">In Merrett v. Preferred Masonic Mut. Acc. Assn. of America (Supreme Court of Michigan), 57 N. W. 169, it was held: \u201cUntil there was some evidence tending to show that death resulted from accident, rather than design, or from natural causes, such as apoplexy or heart failure, there was nothing to go to a jury. There was not a prima facie case of accidental death. The burden of proving accidental death is upon a plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">In Whitlatch v. Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co. of New York (Court of Appeals), 149 N. Y. 45, 43 N. E. 405, it was held to be error for the trial judge to refuse to charge in a suit on an accident policy as follows: \u201cWhile the law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>does not presume from death alone that it was suicidal, and evidence must be adduced to show that the deceased did take his life, still the burden of proof is upon the plaintiff to show by a preponderance of evidence that it was done by accident, and without intention to take his life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-3\">In Trust Co. v. Siefke, 144 N. Y. 354, 39 N. E. 358, which was a suit upon an accident policy, the Court of Appeals of New York in an opinion by Chief Justice Andrews said: \u201cThe burden is upon a plaintiff to establish his cause of action when it is in proper form denied by a preponderance of evidence. See Perley v. Perley, 144 Mass. 104, 10 N. E. 726.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">In Johns v. Northwestern Mutual Relief Assn., 90 Wis. 332, 41 L. R. A. 587, the Supreme Court of Wisconsin in an opinion by Cassoday, J., said: \u201cUnder the contract of insurance in the case at bar the plaintiff could only recover by showing that the death was the result of, or brought about by, \u2018some external cause or accident, and not by disease or any voluntary act of the member.\u2019 The burden of proving such facts was upon the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">In the case of Hill v. Central Accident Ins. Co., 209 Pa. 632, 59 A. 262, this court approved the emphatic statement of the trial court that when plaintiff alleges in a declaration that a \u201cdeceased came to his death by violent, external and accidental means, he should be compelled to prove it.\u201d It was there held that \u201call the circumstances surrounding the tragedy\u201d were admissible in evidence and that \u201cthere is no reason why circumstantial evidence should not be considered in a civil as well as a criminal case,\u201d and that, \u201cwhen there is evidence that death resulted from violent and external means, and there are conflicting theories as to how the death occurred, it is for the jury to pass upon the facts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">The conclusions that the foregoing lead to are these:</p>\n<p id=\"AUs\">1. The operative facts of the insurance policy sued upon were \u201cexternal, violent and accidental means\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>causing the insured\u2019s death, and any evidence, whether direct or circumstantial, that tends to prove the operative facts, is admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">2. If there are in evidence credited facts or circumstances or both from which the jury may infer legitimately that the insured\u2019s death resulted from accidental means, plaintiff is entitled to recover. As to the test of submissibility of evidence to a jury, see Brown v. Schock, 77 Pa. 471, at 479.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">3. On plaintiff rests the burden of proving all the operative facts by a fair preponderance of the evidence. An even balancing of the evidence on the issue of death by accidental means or death by suicide denotes that plaintiff fails to sustain her burden of proof and the verdict should be for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">Causes of action are always set forth affirmatively and if they are to prevail they must be supported either (1) by facts tending to prove directly the cause of action pleaded or (2) by legitimate inferences from circumstances which have met the tests of admissibility. Mere guesses and conjectures cannot be substituted for legal proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">In the deliberations of the jury there are permissible inferences (sometimes miscalled \u201cpresumptions\u201d) rooted in general human experience and which have weight when the evidence, respectively, for and against a fact in issue leaves the jury in a \u201ctwilight zone\u201d of doubt as to that fact. Such \u201cpresumptions may be looked upon as legally recognized phantoms of logic, flitting in the twilight, but disappearing in the sunshine of actual facts\u201d :<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Mackowik v. Kansas City, St. J. &amp; C. B. R. Co. (Supreme Court of Missouri), 94 S. W. 256.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">Here plaintiff pleaded as her cause of action that the insured \u201cwithout intention on his part, but accidentally, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>inhaled carbon monoxide gas, as a result of which he died.\u201d She proved that the death was caused by external and violent means, and the trial judge then said that this much being proved, \u201cthe law presumes that his [the insured\u2019s] death was not by suicide but was accidental\u201d and that \u201cthis presumption has the same probative force and effect as direct evidence of accidental death.\u201d This was error, for, as already pointed out by us, plaintiff\u2019s invoking of a mere \u201cpresumption against suicide\u201d (a presumption unsupported by relevant evidence) cannot serve, on the pivotal issue, as an adequate substitute for the proof the well-pleaded cause of action requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-3\">The assignments of error heretofore specified are sustained. The judgment is reversed with a venire.</p>\n<judges id=\"b539-4\">Mr. Justice Linn concurred in the result.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b532-5\"> For the year 1932 (statistics for which are the latest available), the number of homicides occurring in the United States Death Registration Area, exclusive of Utah, was 11,016; suicides, 20,880; fatal accidents, 85,474; deaths from all other causes, 1,186,739.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b538-9\"> This is a slight paraphrase o\u00a3 the actual quotation which reads as follows: \u201cPresumptions may be looked on as the bats of the law, flitting in the twilight, but disappearing in the sunshine of actual facts.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
