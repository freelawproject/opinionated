Superior Ct. 341.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b326-8\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"AcSR\">Mr. Justice Linn,</author>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">Plaintiff appeals from an order restricting to the mortgaged premises the lien of a judgment on a bond accompanying a mortgage. The statement of questions involved presents but one point for review: whether, in a suit by a bona fide assignee of the bond, parol evidence is \u201cadmissible to prove a contemporaneous agreement that judgment on the bond should be restricted to the mortgaged premises only.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b326-10\">In view of the course of the oral ai\u2019gument, the case may be stated somewhat fully. June 17, 1927, defendant Melvin, by writing, agreed to buy from P. J. and J. T. Whelan, certain real estate and to give in pax\u2019t payment a first mortgage of $37,000, payable within three years, settlement to be made on or before September 20, 1927. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>There was no agreement that defendant should give a bond. In July, 1927, one of the Whelans stated to defendant that they should also like to have a bond; Melvin replied he had not agreed to give one, but, after some conversation on the subject, agreed to give his bond, good for three years, on condition that it should be \u201crestricted\u201d ; i. e., collectible only out of the mortgaged property. No additional consideration was given for the bond. September 19, 1927, the parties met for settlement at the Integrity Trust Company, Whelan meanwhile having prepared the bond and mortgage. When they were produced at the settlement for Melvin\u2019s signature, he called attention to the fact that the bond was unrestricted and not in compliance with the understanding, and refused to execute it. Whelan stated that the restriction agreed upon had been omitted from the bond by mistake, and, to avoid delaying the settlement (the time for which expired next day), asked Melvin to sign it upon condition that he would immediately give Melvin a letter or agreement protecting him and restricting the obligation of the bond to default within three years and to the mortgaged real estate. Melvin then executed the papers and Whelan delivered the letter.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> There is no dispute about these facts. None of this testimony was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>contradicted, and, as to what happened at the settlement, not only defendant and one of the Whelans, but Wildey, the Whelans\u2019s agent in the transaction, testified. On September 21, 1927, Whelan assigned the bond and mortgage to the Integrity Trust Company, as additional security for a preexisting collateral loan. October 20, 1927, Melvin sold the premises fo one Quigley and thereafter had no interest in them. October 29, 1927, the Integrity Trust Company sold the bond and mortgage to Allinger, the present use-plaintiff and appellant. The mortgage was, of course, duly recorded. Neither the Integrity Trust Company nor Allinger were advised of the existence of the agreement restricting liability on the bond. Neither of them inquired of Melvin whether he had any defense, nor did they ask for a declaration of no set-off. Melvin did nothing that induced them to refrain from inquiring for defenses or obtaining a declaration of no set-off.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">On June 8, 1932, judgment was entered on the bond. Defendant filed a petition to open the judgment with leave to defend, setting forth, inter alia, the above facts. An answer was filed and the judgment was opened. The case then came on for trial. Evidence was introduced by witnesses and by stipulation signed by counsel for both parties. The court directed a verdict for the plaintiff, but submitted certain interrogatories to the jury,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>answers to which subsequently became the basis for limiting the lien to the mortgaged premises, the action now complained of.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">In Volk v. Shoemaker, 229 Pa. 407, 410, 78 A. 933, we repeated what has been the law of Pennsylvania as far back as Rundle v. Ettwein, 2 Y. 22, (1795), \u2014 that \u201cthe assignee of a bond, who fails to make inquiry of the obligor, takes it subject to any defense to which it was subject in the hands of the obligor: Lane v. Smith, 103 Pa. 415; Janes v. Benson, 155 Pa. 489, 492; Stokes v. Dewees, 24 Pa. Superior Ct. 471. The same rule applies to the assignee of a mortgage: Myerstown Bank v. Roessler, 186 Pa. 431; Carothers v. Sims, 194 Pa. 386.\u201d See, too, Eldred v. Hazlett\u2019s Admr., 33 Pa. 307, 315; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>Ashton\u2019s App., 73 Pa. 153, 161; Restatement, Contracts, section 167. This rule is not questioned in the brief filed on behalf of the appellant. His contention here is merely that, though no inquiry was made of the obligor, and though appellant might have learned of the restriction by such inquiry, the rule excluding parol evidence in certain cases deprives Melvin of the benefit of the contract which it is not denied was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">The proceeding to open the judgment and to limit the recovery to the mortgaged premises is governed by equitable principles. One of them is that where fraud, accident or mistake is shown, the written instrument will be reformed, in order to prevent fraudulent use of it, provided the' evidence is clear, precise and indubitable and sufficient within the rule: Gump\u2019s App., 65 Pa. 476; Pender v. Cook, 300 Pa. 468, 473, 150 A. 892; Bispham, Equity, sections 468-70. In view of the finding of the jury, based on the evidence of both parties to the contract, there can be no question that Whelan made a mistake in omitting from the bond the agreed-upon restrictions, that Melvin detected the mistake, refused to execute the papers, and ultimately did so only on Whelan\u2019s promise to correct the mistake, as was in fact done by the letter and supporting oral evidence received. The principle governing the decision in Gianni v. Russell, 281 Pa. 320, 126 A. 791 (in which case the evidence in support of the oral agreement was not, as here, uncontradicted), and cases following it, on which appellant relies, has no application to a record like this. Those cases hold that \u201cif the matter proposed to be shown by parol is the subject of a covenant in the agreement, which is complete, such evidence to alter its terms cannot be received\u201d (Cridge\u2019s Est., 289 Pa. 331, 338, 137 A. 455), unless it is admitted that the whole of the agreement is not set forth in the writing: Ward v. Zeigler, 285 Pa. 557, 132 A. 798. Here both parties to the contract agree that the instrument, as Whelan drew it, did not express their agreement, and that it would not have been exe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>cuted unless the supplementary agreement had been made. Proof of such agreement was proper: Restatement, Contracts, sections 504, 507; Schweyer v. Walbert, 190 Pa. 334, 42 A. 695; Humbert v. Meyers, 279 Pa. 171, 123 A. 733; Janes v. Benson, 155 Pa. 489, 26 A. 752. See also Roberts v. Roesch, 306 Pa. 435, 439, 159 A. 870; Cridge\u2019s Est., supra; Citizens\u2019 Nat. Bank of Waynesburg v. Wisecarver, 300 Pa. 60, 150 A. 103; Wheatley v. Neidich, 24 Pa. Superior Ct. 198; Irwin v.
