As courts cannot take, judicial notice of statutes until pleaded as required by section 963 of the Penal Code, and as no public offense under the general law is stated, defendant is entitled to his discharge on <em>habeas corpus.

In this state, however, even in the superior courts, it is sufficient to refer to them by title and date of passage, whereupon the court must take judicial notice of them. (Pen. Code, sec. 963.) But when the proceeding is in a municipal court, instituted for the express purpose of enforcing the municipal ordinances, and vested with full jurisdiction for that purpose, the rule ought to be and is different. In such case, the ordinances are the peculiar law of that forum, and it is bound to take notice of their existence. To such laws it holds the same relation that the superior courts hold to the laws enacted by the legislature, and may notice their provisions because they are among the things which, as to it, are established by law. (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 1875, subd. 2.) The following authorities bear out this view: <em>Solomon </em>v. <em>Hughes, </em>24 Kan. 211; <em>McPherson </em>v. <em>Nichols, </em>48 Kan. 430; note to <em>Lanfear </em>v. <em>Mestier, </em>89 Am. Dec. 668, 669; <em>State </em>v. <em>Leiber, </em>11 Iowa, 407; <em>Laporte </em>v. <em>Goodfellow, </em>47 Iowa, 572.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">These cases show that the practice in municipal courts, with respect to municipal ordinances, constitutes an exception, and a proper and necessary exception, to the rule invoked by the petitioner. The complaint, therefore, was sufficient, if there was an ordinance prohibiting the acts charged,, and, as to that, we must pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>sume, in this proceeding, which raises only the question of jurisdiction, that there was such an ordinance of which the recorder\u2019s court took judicial notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">Prisoner remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
