(Rules of the Supreme Court, rule II, subd. 4, v; <em>Hickinbotham </em>v. <em>Monroe, </em>28 Cal. 489; <em>Faris </em>v. <em>Lampson, </em>73 Cal. 191; <em>Drexler </em>v. <em>Seal Rock Tobacco Co., </em>78 Cal. 624; <em>Mix </em>v. <em>Boothe, </em>54 Cal. 589; <em>Van Slyke </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>60 Cal. 411; <em>Shain </em>v. <em>People\u2019s Lumber Co., </em>98 Cal. 120.) Where an appeal is not taken in good faith, when there is no error in the record, when it is frivolous or without merit, and is taken for the purpose of hindering and delaying respondent in the collection of his judgment, respondent will be allowed damages. (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 975; <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Stebbins, </em>2 Cal. 149; <em>Pacheco </em>v. <em>Bernal, </em>2 Cal. 150; <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Williams, 2 </em>Cal. 158; <em>Escolle v.

It has been held here that upon a motion to dismiss the appeal, and for damages, this court will not, in considering said motion, look into the record to see if the appeal be frivolous; and that damages would not be awarded upon that ground until the final disposition of the appeal; but it has also been held that where an uncontradicted affidavit shows that the appeal was taken for delay, damages will be allowed on the dismissal of the appeal. This was expressly held in <em>Duncan </em>v. <em>Grady, </em>99 Gal. 552, and in <em>Koelling </em>v. <em>Rutz, </em>108 Gal. 664. The same ruling seems to have been made in <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Stebbins, </em>2 Gal. 149, and in <em>Pacheco </em>v. <em>Bemal, </em>2 Cal. 150. It is not necessary to determine here how far we would look into conflicting evidence as to the delay, if there had been such evidence; for, as in the cases above cited, the statement in the affidavit filed by the respondent is not controverted.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">The case at bar, we think, clearly calls for the imposition of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">The appeal is dismissed with one hundred dollars damages as part of his costs of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">Temple, J., and Henshaw, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
