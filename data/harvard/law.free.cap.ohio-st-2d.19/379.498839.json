In refusing to arrest judgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b373-10\">2. In refusing a new trial, and</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b373-11\">3. In the charge to the jury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b373-12\">1. The arrest of judgment. The indictment is defective in this, that it does not charge and allege specifically, an intent to commit a murder, either in the first or second degree, as defined in the statute of Ohio. There are no offenses indictable in Ohio, except such as are made so by statute. An indictment under a statute must follow the statute strictly, and recite it substantially. 2 Hawk. P. C., ch. 25, \u00a7 110. The general rule as there stated, is, \u201c that neither the words <em>contra for-mam statuti, </em>nor any periphrasis, intendment, or conclusion, will make good an indictment which does not bring the fact prohibited in the doing of which the offense consists, within <em>all the material words of the </em>statute.\u201d See also 1 Hale, P. C., 517 and 526; 2 Hale, P. C., 170; Foster 424; 1 Chitty Crim. L. 280, \u201982.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b373-13\">So, an indictment which may apply to either of two definite offenses, and does not <em>specify </em>which, is bad, for the reason that it leaves it uncertain what is really intended to be relied on to support \"the accusation. Wharton\u2019s Crim. L. 81; 1 Mood. C. D., 158, <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Marshall.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b373-14\">Now the words of the statute under which this indictment is framed, are, \u201c if any person shall- assault another, with intent to commit a murder,\u201d not a murder at common law, for there are no common law offenses here but a murder as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>defined by the statute of Ohio. The indictment in this case charges an assault with intent <em>\u201c </em>to commit a murder, willfully, and of their malice aforethought.\u201d This is a charge of murder at common law, but it is not a charge of murder either in the first or second degree, as defined by our statute. The words, \u201c of malice aforethought,\u201d do not define murder in the <em>first </em>degree under our statute, because they do not <em>necessarily </em>import deliberation, nor do they define the second degree of murder under our statute, for they <em>necessarily </em>import premedi tation, while the statute declares the second degree of murder to be a killing <em>\u201c </em>without premeditation,\u201d and the first degree to be a killing \u201c with deliberation.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b374-4\">Is it not clear that this indictment would be bad, if the charge were murder, instead of an assault with intent, etc., and if the words in the 17th section, \u201c a murder,\u201d means a murder as defined by our statute, then, for the same reason, the indictment is bad in this case. We submit that an indictment under the 17th section, should charge either \u201c an assault with intent, purposely, and of deliberate and premedi tated malice to commit a murder,\u201d or an assault \u201c with intent, purposely and maliciously, but without deliberation and premeditation to commit a murder.\u201d Nor can the words, <em>\u201c </em>of malice aforethought,\u201d be rejected as surplusage, for they constitute a substantive charge of <em>premeditated </em>malice, a necessary allegation of an indictment, charging an assault with intent to commit a murder in the first degree, and only defective by-reason of the omission to insert, also, the words, \u201c and with deliberation.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b374-5\">In the case of the <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Atwood, 11 Mass. Rep. 93, the court say, \u201c a substantive charge not sufficiently alleged in an indictment, can never be rejected as surplusage.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b374-6\">If the words be rejected, the indictment remains bad, for the reason that it does not define what degree of murder was intended by the assault. It will not aid this indictment to say, that the defect is immaterial, that the punishment is the same, whether the intent was to commit murder of the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>or second degree. The punishment is the same in kind only, not in degree. The court have a discretion as to the term of imprisonment, and we suppose this discretion is given, and is-intended to be exercised, by reason of the fact, that an assault with an attempt to commit murder in the second degree, is less atrocious than an assault with intent, purposely and of deliberate and premeditated malice, to murder.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b375-5\">2. The refusal to grant a new trial. To sustain this verdict, the testimony must show that, had death ensued from the alleged assault, the offense would have been murder, and the intent, as it forms the whole gist of the offense, must be proved as laid. Wharton\u2019s Crim. Law 316; 2 Term. Rep. 6; <em>State v. Negro </em>Bill, 3 Harrington 571; 2 Stark. 52; 1 East, P. C., 411; Archbold\u2019s Crim. Pld. 432.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b375-6\">All the evidence in the case, is upon the record, and it leaves-no doubt that this assault was the result of a sudden quarrel between Thomas Sharp and Walton, and that the plaintiff in error engaged in the affray, only when his father was in imminent peril at the hands of Walton. The conclusion cannot well be resisted, that had Walton died of this assault, the offense of the plaintiff in error would, at most, have been manslaughter, a killing upon a sudden quarrel, in heat of blood, and in defense of his father, in peril of life or limb. If, in case of death from this assault, the offense of .plaintiff in error would have been only manslaughter, then, upon all authority, the verdict is wrong, and the court erred in refusing a new trial.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b375-7\">3. The charge to the jury. The court erred in charging \u201c that the jury might return a general verdict of guilty, although the proof should convince them that the assault was made <em>without the intent of malice aforethought to commit a </em>murder.\u201d If the allegation of this indictment, that the assault was with intent of malice aforethought to murder Walton, be a <em>substantive </em>allegation, as we have shown it is, the state was bound to prove it as laid, though defectively set forth, and the court erred in charging that the jury might disregard it. In the case of the <em>United States </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>3 Day\u2019s Cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>283, the court held, that an allegation not impertinent to the cause, must be proved, though the prosecution might have been sujoported without such allegation. We claim that the allegation was \u201c pertinent to the cause,\u201d though defectively set forth, as a part of the necessary words in a charge of assault with intent to commit a murder in the first degree.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b376-4\">The court further erred in charging that the jury in determining <em>the intent </em>with which plaintiff in error joined in the affray and assaulted Walton, should not take into consideration the fact that the father of plaintiff in error was, <em>at the </em>time, in imminent peril of great bodily injury or death, at the hand ot Walton. Had Walton commenced this affray, most clearly the plaintiff in error, by reason of his father\u2019s peril at the time, from the assault being made upon him by Walton, would have <em>been </em>justified in killing Walton. 1 Hale, P. C., 484; 4 Black. 182 ; 1 Russell 542.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b376-5\">As the facts are, however, in this case, although his father commenced an assault upon Walton, without sufficient provocation, yet the plaintiff in error was still bound to interfere for the defense of his father, and if he carried the interference for defense so far as to have killed Walton, it would have been only manslaughter \u2014 a killing upon a sudden quarrel, and in heat of blood. It is well said by Hale, \u201c that in mortal combats, upon sudden quarrels, it mattereth not who gave the first blow.\u201d 1 Hale, P. C., 456; and see Foster 295.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b376-6\">Hence it was, that on behalf of the plaintiff in- error, we asked the court to charge that, in passing upon <em>the intent </em>with which plaintiff in error assaulted Walton, they should consider the great peril of his father at the time. This the court refused to do, and gave the charge as above stated, adding that \u201c if the father commenced the assault, (which was not denied) the son, by joining in the affray, would be aiding his father in an unlawful assault.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b376-7\">It was a fact clearly proved, that his father was, at the time, in peril, from Walton; was it not the right and duty of the son to interfere \u2014 not to aid a further assault upon Wal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>-ton \u2014 but to protect and save his father from great injury\u2014 and was it not exclusively the province, and clearly the duty of the jury to determine whether the plaintiff in error joined in that affray to defend his father merely, or with intent to commit a murder, as alleged against him ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b377-5\">But if the charge of the court be right, then it follows that, if a father strike the first blow upon a sudden quarrel, and thereby put himself in peril of immediate death from the attack of his adversary, a son, who witnesses the contest, must look on with cool resignation, while his father is being cut to pieces, lest by coming to his father\u2019s relief, in the language of the court, he aid in committing \u201c an unlawful assault.\u2019\u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b377-6\">If this be law, it contravenes alike the instincts of nature, the duties of humanity, and the deductions of reason.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b377-7\">This novel ruling of the court has worked a result as novel. The father who commenced the affray is acquitted, while the son, who obeyed the stern mandate of nature, and the holy impulse of filial affection, in coming to his father\u2019s defense, is convicted and sentenced, as guilty of an assault, with intent of malice aforethought, to do a murder.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b377-8\"><em>James Gray </em>(prosecuting attorney), for the state, submitted the case without argument.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b377-9\">Avery, J.</author>\n<p id=\"An7\">This case has been examined upon an application for a writ of error to the court of common pleas for Tuscarawas county.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">An indictment was found by the grand jury, at the November term, 1850, of the said court, against Thomas Sharp and said Henry Sharp, for an assault with an attempt to murder John E. Walton.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-11\">The defendants were tried at the same term, by a petit jury, who found said Henry guilty, as charged in the indictment, and said Thomas guilty of an assault and battery only.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-12\">The counsel, in behalf of Henry Sharp, asked the court upon the trial, to give certain instructions to the jury, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>the court refused to give, whereupon the counsel excepted; they excepted also to certain instructions which were given.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">The counsel for Henry Sharp, after the verdict was returned, moved the court to grant him a new trial, because the verdict was against the evidence, and because the court erred in their charge to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">The evidence is set out in the bill of exceptions, and a copy given of the instructions asked, as well as of the instructions actually given.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">The first- count in the indictment charges the offense in the following words, to wit:</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">\u201c That Thomas Sharp,, late of the county of Tuscarawas aforesaid, and Henry Sharp, late of the county of Tuscarawas aforesaid, on the fifteenth day of September, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and fifty, with force and arms, in the county of Tuscarawas aforesaid, in and upon the body of one John F. Walton, then and there being, unlawfully did make an assault, and him, the said John F. Walton, then and there did beat, wound and ill-treat, with intent in and upon him, the said John F. Walton, then and there feloniously, willfully, and of their own malice aforethought, to commit a murder and other wrongs, etc.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">The intent is described in the second ' count as follows: <em>\u201c </em>With intent him, the said John F. Walton, then and there feloniously, willfully, and of their malice aforethought to kill and omurder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">After an examination of the evidence as shown by the bill of exceptions, the court can find no error in the refusal to grant a new trial on the alleged ground, that the verdict was against the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-10\">The first instruction requested for the jury was this : \u201c If they were convinced by the testimony, the said Henry Sharp made said assault and battery, without the intent purposely, and of malice aforethought, to murder said Walton, the jury should find said defendant guilty of an assault and battery only.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>This instruction the court refused to give, but charged the jury, if they were convinced by the proof, that the defendants, or either of them, had assaulted said Walton, with deliberate and premeditated malice, willfully and maliciously, with intent to murder, or had made such assault without premeditation and deliberation, but wilfully and maliciously, with intent to murder, then the jury should find one or both guilty, as the proof might convince them. This was instructing substantially in the words of the statute, as found in the two sections defining murder in the first and second degrees. Swan\u2019s Statutes 229.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">The charge was doubtless right, in holding that by the law, under which -the defendants were prosecuted, the jury might convict them of an assault with intent to murder, whether it was murder in the first or second degree ; and in the opinion of this court, the words used in the indictment to set out the intent, could not limit the power or obligation of the jury so to convict.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">There was no error in this charge of the court, nor in the refusal to charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">The next instruction requested was in these words: \u201c That in inquiring for the intent with which said defendant, Henry, assaulted said Walton, it was proper for the jury, and they should consider the relation or kindred \u00f3f said Henry Sharp to the said Thomas Sharp, in connection with the condition and circumstances of his father, the said Thomas Sharp, at the time when the said assault was made by the said Henry.\u201d Which charge the court refused to give.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">A majority of this court find no error in the refusal to give the charge as requested. We do not deny the principle applying to some of the natural and civil relations, which is held to furnish an excuse to persons under certain circumstances, and an exemption from civil punishment, because they are so related. It is conceded that parent and child, husband and wife, master and servant would be excused, should they even kill an assailant in the necessary defense of each other. But not unfrequently it will happen, from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>the facts proved upon the trial, that this principle can have no application, and therefore in such cases it need not be brought to the notice of the jury: for it could not be allowed properly to influence their verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">If a father and son combine to assail another, and commit violence upon his person, they may both stand in the relation of principal offenders, and be held liable in the same manner as if either had combined with any other person to commit similar violence. And in such case no intent to aid or defend each other on account of the relationship subsisting between them, can be inferred by court or jury. '</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">In the case under examination there was evidence, coming from Walton and others, that Thomas Sharp, the father, ran into the house and came out, bringing in his hands a poker; that he struck Walton several blows with it, one of which, according to the testimony of Walton, broke his arm. There is testimony also, from which an inference may be drawn, that at the time when the blows were inflicted by the father, the son was striking his knife into the body of Walton. It is true, it may be inferred from the evidence, that Walton was flourishing his knife at the same time, and even that he designed to use it against the father. Yet from the manner of the attack upon Walton, as described by the witnesses, the inference is still admissible, that the intent of Henry Sharp was not to defend his father, but in connection with him to make a murderous assault upon Walton. In such a case, their relationship would be a matter of no consequence in determining upon the guilt of either. Henry Sharp was at liberty, no doubt, to give evidence, that his intent really was, to protect his father from violence or imminent danger, and so he was at liberty, if he could find the proof, to show that the act was done with any intent, other than that alleged in the indictment, the intent to commit a murder. But the court, being in possession of all the evidence, may have considered, that there was no foundation for the claim put forth for him on-the trial. Whether, however, they so considered or not, they were not bound, nor at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>liberty, to assume in their charge, that the relationship ought, as a matter of course, to be taken into account by the jury; that in inquiring for the intent of Henry Sharp, when he made the assault, it was the duty of the jury to consider how he stood related to Thomas Sharp.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Error is not to be presumed, it must be shown. The call upon the court might have been easily put in a shape to secure a charge upon the point of law involved, to wit: the right of one of the prisoners, growing out of his relationship to the other. In such a case it is to be presumed the court would give the charge. A refusal to do so would furnish sufficient ground to reverse their judgment, but there was no error in the refusal to charge as above requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">The charge which was actually given, after that request,. is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-7\">\u201c That it was true, as a principle of law, that a son might justify an assault in defense of his father, if the father were not in the wrong. But if Thomas Sharp had wantonly made the first assault upon Walton, and this fact should appear from the proof, then Henry, the son, could not avail himself of this relation, in his defense, if it appeared from the proof that he, Henry, came into the conflict for the purpose of aiding his father in an unlawful assault.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">We are all of the opinion that there was no error in this charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">The counsel of Henry Sharp having failed in their motion for a new trial, urged before the court below a motion in arrest of judgment, and assigned the following reasons :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-10\">\u201c 1st. The indictment is defective in this, that it sets forth no crime known to the laws of the State..</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-11\">\u201c 2d. It charges the assault upon Walton with intent feloniously, willfully, and of their malice aforethought, to commit a murder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-12\">\u201c 3d. It does not charge a murder either in the first or second degree, as defined by the statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-13\">\u201c 4th. The indictment is in other respects illegal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-14\">We are of the opinion that the indictment is sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>It was framed upon the 17th section of the act providing for the punishment of crimes. Swan\u2019s Statutes 232. The offense embraced in this section is an assault with intent to commit a murder, rape, or robbery. The crime defined in the section, as an assault with intent to murder, is a single offense, and as such may be described in a single count in the indictment. No principle, it is believed, nor any benefit likely to result from the practice, requires the offense to be set out in two counts; one charging the intent to commit a murder in the first degree, and the other in the second degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">This indictment does not contain the specific allegations requisite in an indictment for murder in the first or second degree under the statute. It copies, in that part which sets out the intent, the common law form for describing such intent, as found in the indictment for an assault with intent to murder. Malice aforethought, as here set out, will be found charged also in the common law indictment for murder. The jury, however, under the indictment for murder, may return a verdict for manslaughter, which excludes the idea of malice aforethought, and the introduction in this case of the words malice aforethought, should not have the effect of restricting the jury to the finding merely of an intent to commit murder in the first degree. Under our statute, when there is but a single count in the indictment, which specifically alleges deliberate and premeditated malice, the prisoner may, notwithstanding, be convicted of the lesser crime of murder in the second d\u00e9gree, or of manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">The crime of rape, under our statute, like the crime of murder, \u201cis very different, both in its description and punishment, as found in two separate sections of the statute. Swan\u2019s Stat. 230. Under one of these, the 4th section, a person having carnal knowledge of his daughter or sister, against her will, is deemed guilty of a rape, .and on conviction to be imprisoned in the penitentiary for .life.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">By the 5th section, if any person shall have carnal knowledge of any other woman, or a female child,' or if any male <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>person of the age of seventeen years and upwards, shall carnally know and abuse a female child under ten years, with her' consent, such person shall be deemed guilty of a rape, and upon conviction, imprisoned not more than twenty nor less than ten years. The law describing the offense of an assault like that in the 17th section, with intent to commit a rape, came under examination before this court, in the case of Bowles,v. <em>The State of </em>Ohio, 7 Ohio Rep., part 2, 248. There the court allude to a distinction to be taken in passing upon the requisite averments, between an indictment for the crime of rape itself, and one drawn upon the section punishing an assault with intent to commit the crime.. And they decide, that an indictment in this last case, need not specifically characterize the person upon whom the assault was made. The person assaulted was described in the count on which the verdict of guilty had been rendered, as Eliza Johnson, a child.
