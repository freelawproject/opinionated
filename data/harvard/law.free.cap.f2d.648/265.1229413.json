Our acceptance of the Commission\u2019s action cannot stand, they assert, particularly in the face of that agency\u2019s modification of its method for arriving at appropriate investment additives. In our initial opinion in this rate proceeding, 642 F.2d 112 (5th Cir. 1981), we remanded the case to the Commission for reconsideration of its finding on the maximum reasonable rate for this coal traffic. Particular emphasis was given to the Commission\u2019s allowance of a differential pricing additive. Nothing said in our earlier opinion should be construed to deny the parties on remand the opportunity to develop a finding on the maximum reasonable rate based on costing methods currently used by the Commission with the approval of the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">The Petition for Rehearing is DENIED and no member of this panel nor Judge in regular active service on the Court having requested that the Court be polled on rehearing en banc, (Rule 35 Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure; Local Fifth Circuit Rule 16) the Petition for Rehearing En Banc is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
