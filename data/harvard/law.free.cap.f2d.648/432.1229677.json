This is an appeal from an order of the district court granting plaintiffs a preliminary injunction. The court\u2019s order enjoins the school district from refusing to admit illegal alien children into the Dallas public schools pursuant to \u00a7 21.031 of the Texas Education Code<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the administra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>tive regulations promulgated by DISD pursuant thereto.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">The district court initially denied plaintiffs\u2019 motion for preliminary injunction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, after Justice Powell\u2019s decision as Circuit Justice in <em>Certain Named and Unnamed Non-Citizen Children and Their Parents v. Texas, </em>448 U.S. 1327, 101 S.Ct. 12, 65 L.Ed.2d 1151 (1980) (Powell, J., in chambers),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the district court reversed its position and granted the preliminary injunction against DISD, finding that such relief would not result in serious or irreparable injury to the school district.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b517-17\">Because the dispositive issue involved in this case has recently been decided by this court, <em>see Doe v. Plyler, </em>628 F.2d 448 (5th Cir. 1980), <em>probable jurisdiction </em>noted,U.S. -, 101 S.Ct. 2044, 68 L.Ed. 347 (1981), the district court\u2019s order granting a preliminary injunction is affirmed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AGm\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b516-16\">.

The district court concluded that classifications based on alienage are suspect and may require strict judicial scrutiny, but that application of strict scrutiny rests on the assumption that the aliens in question are legally within this country. In addition, the court found that Tex.Educ.Code Ann. \u00a7 21.031 and DISD Administrative Regulation \u00a7 5118(a) \u201care rationally related to preserving the limited resources available for public education for citizens and legally admitted aliens.\u201d The district court further determined that the public interest would both be served and disserved by admission of illegal alien children into the Dallas schools at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-22\">\u201cAfter balancing the four relevant factors (probability of success on the merits, irreparable injury to plaintiffs, impact on defendants, and the public interest),\u201d the court concluded \u201cthat those factors militating against preliminary injunctive relief outweigh those favoring preliminary relief. ...\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b517-23\">. In <em>Certain Named and Unnamed Non-Citizen Children, </em>Justice Powell vacated this court\u2019s stay of an order of the district court for the Southern District of Texas (Seals, J.) that held Tex.Educ.Code Ann. \u00a7 21.031 unconstitutional as a violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and enjoined the State of Texas from denying free public education to any child on account of his or her immigration status.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b517-24\">. Justice Powell indicated that if a school \u201cdistrict can demonstrate that, because of the number of undocumented alien children within its jurisdiction or because of exceptionally limited resources, the operation of the injunction [enjoining all school districts in Texas from refusing to admit illegal alien children] would severely hamper the provision of education to all its students during the coming year, the granting of a stay would be justified.\u201d <em>Certain Named and Unnamed Non-Citizen Children, </em>448 U.S. at 1334, 101 S.Ct. at 16.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b517-25\">.

Therefore, since this court has already held the exclusion of illegal alien children from free public education in Texas to be unconstitutional, the issue of whether the granting of preliminary injunctive relief was proper in this case vanishes. Because we are controlled by the decision in <em>Doe v. Plyler, </em>we do not review the record herein to determine whether the criteria for preliminary ' injunctive relief (excluding the plaintiffs\u2019 probability of succeeding on the merits) are met. If illegal aliens possess the right to a free public education equally with citizens <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>and aliens lawfully residing within Texas, then the school district cannot deny that right no matter how the interests balance.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b518-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>REAVLEY, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A9_\">with whom</p>\n<judges id=\"Abkq\">CHARLES CLARK, Circuit Judge, joins, specially concurring:</judges>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">As a member of a panel of this court I am without power to \u201cdisregard the precedent set by a prior panel, even though [I conceive] error in the precedent.\u201d <em>Davis v. Estelle, </em>529 F.2d 437, 441 (5th Cir. 1976). Absent some intervening contrary authority from the Supreme Court or this court sitting <em>en banc, </em>I am bound to follow the decision in <em>Doe v. Plyler, </em>628 F.2d 448 (5th Cir. 1980), <em>probable jurisdiction </em>noted,U.S. -, 101 S.Ct. 2044, 68 L.Ed. 347 (1981). I can, however, write to express my disagreement with the panel\u2019s decision in <em>Doe v. Plyler.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">In <em>Doe v. Plyler, </em>the panel first determined that Tex.Educ.Code Ann. \u00a7 21.031 did not impermissibly conflict or interfere with federal law in the sphere of immigration regulation and, therefore, was not preempted by the supremacy clause of the constitution. 628 F.2d at 453. In considering the equal protection challenge to \u00a7 21.-031, the court initially concluded that aliens illegally within the territorial boundaries of the United States are entitled to equal protection of the laws as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court then discussed the appropriate standard of judicial scrutiny to be applied in reviewing the Texas statute to determine whether it denied illegal alien children within that State equal protection of the laws. Although noting that Texas\u2019 statutory classification excluding illegal aliens from free public education may be deserving of strict scrutiny,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the panel concluded that it was not necessary to address that difficult question because it found \u00a7 21.031 to be unconstitutional under the rational basis test. 628 F.2d at 458. It is with this holding \u2014 that no rational basis exists to support the classification made by \u00a7 21.031 \u2014 that I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-13\">\u201cUnder traditional equal protection analysis, a legislative classification must be sustained, if the classification itself is rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest.\u201d <em>United States Department of Agriculture v. Moreno, </em>413 U.S. 528, 533, 93 S.Ct. 2821, 2825, 37 L.Ed.2d 782 (1973). Under the rational basis test, a reviewing court presumes the constitutionality of the statutory discrimination. <em>City of New Orleans v. Dukes, </em>427 U.S. 297, 303, 96 S.Ct. 2513, 2516, 49 L.Ed.2d 511 (1976) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-14\">In <em>Doe v. Plyler, </em>the State of Texas urged that decreasing its educational costs was a rational justification for excluding illegal aliens from the state-provided bounty of free public education. Moreover, the State also asserted that by denying illegal alien children free public education the incentive for aliens to illegally enter this country would be lessened.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-15\">In response to the State\u2019s first asserted justification, the panel concluded that \u201ccost, <em>in and of itself, </em>could [not] justify the ex-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>elusion of any group of people from any government program that requires funding.\u201d 628 F.2d at 459 (citing <em>United States Department of Agriculture v. Moreno, </em>413 U.S. 528, 93 S.Ct. 2821, 37 L.Ed.2d 782 (1973)) (emphasis in original). The panel\u2019s statement is too broad. Cost of a government funded program is a legitimate governmental interest. A challenged classification will be sustained if it rationally furthers such a legitimate governmental interest.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\"><em>Moreno, </em>upon which the panel relies, stands only for the proposition that a bare legislative \u201cdesire to harm a politically unpopular group cannot constitute a <em>legitimate </em>governmental interest\u201d and that a purpose to discriminate against an unpopular group, e. g., \u201chippies\u201d or illegal aliens, \u201ccannot, in and of itself and without reference to [some independent] considerations in the public interest,\u201d justify the challenged classification.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 413 U.S. at 534-35, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>93 S.Ct. at 2825-26 (emphasis and brackets in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">I find that a legitimate governmental interest exists to which the denial of free public education to illegal aliens is rationally related. It is the State\u2019s interest in providing universal education, consistent with the historical policies underlying the establishment of publicly funded education in this country, while at the same time preserving its limited resources from unwarranted dilution. The major governmental policy interest behind the free public education movement in this country during the 19th century was that an enlightened electorate is necessary to maintain our democratic form of government and to preserve the liberty of the people. <em>See, e. g., </em>T. Jefferson, Notes on Virginia, in 4 Works of Thomas Jefferson (Federal Edition 1904), pp. 60-65 <em>(Jefferson\u2019s explanation of his \u201cBill For The More General Diffusion of Knowledge\u201d), reprinted in </em>S. Goldstein, Law and Public Education, pp. 4-7 (BobbsMerrill Co. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">This policy was recognized by the Supreme Court in <em>Brown v. Board of Education, </em>347 U.S. 483, 74 S.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873 (1954). In <em>Brown, </em>the Court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-6\">\u201cToday, education is perhaps the most important function of state and local governments. <em>Compulsory school attendance laws and the great expenditures for education both demonstrate our recognition of the importance of education to our democratic society. It is required in the performance of our most basic public responsibilities, </em>even service in the armed forces. <em>It is the very foundation of good citizenship. </em>Today it is a principal instrument in awakening the child to cultural values, in preparing him for later professional training, and in helping him to adjust normally to his environment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">347 U.S. at 493, 74 S.Ct. at 691 (emphasis added). Moreover, in <em>Ambach v. Norwick, </em>441 U.S. 68, 75, 99 S.Ct. 1589, 1594, 60 L.Ed.2d 49 (1979), the Court noted that \u201c[t]he importance of public schools in the preparation of individuals for <em>participation as citizens, </em>and in the preservation of the values on which our society rests, long has been recognized by our decisions ....\u201d (Emphasis added). In <em>Ambach, </em>the court also acknowledged that social scientists have confirmed the general perception of the public schools \u201cas inculcating fundamental values necessary to the maintenance of a democratic political system .. . . \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 77, 99 S.Ct. at 1595.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-10\">I conceive that the Texas Legislature, on agreeing that education is \u201cthe very foundation of good citizenship,\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> could reasonably have concluded that it should not dilute its limited resources by providing free public education to illegal alien children, who can never \u2014 absent some form of amnesty \u2014 become citizens, exercise the franchise, or serve in the armed forces of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-11\">In <em>Nyquist v. Mauclet, </em>432 U.S. 1, 11, 97 S.Ct. 2120, 2126, 53 L.Ed.2d 63 (1977), the Supreme Court addressed the governmental interest in the enhancement of the educational level of the electorate. There the state, as a condition for granting college tuition assistance, required students to be citizens or to have made application for citizenship or, if not qualified for citizenship, to submit a statement of intent to apply for citizenship when eligible. The Court held the statute unconstitutional un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>der the equal protection clause because the state\u2019s claimed interest \u2022 in educating the electorate did not provide a justification under the <em>compelling state interest </em>test;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201calthough such education is a laudable objective, it hardly would be frustrated by including <em>resident aliens </em>[/. e. those lawfully residing in this country], as well as citizens, in the State\u2019s assistance programs.\u201d <em>Nyquist, </em>432 U.S. at 11, 97 S.Ct. at 2126 (emphasis added). The implication of the Court\u2019s statement is that including illegal aliens in a state\u2019s educational assistance programs <em>might indeed frustrate </em>the state\u2019s objective of the enhancement of the educational level of the electorate.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Texas\u2019 interest in educating the electorate is clearly frustrated in this case. The record reveals that DISD has a total enrollment of 120,000 students and that the district is presently facing an enrollment of 8,700 Spanish-speaking students requiring bilingual education. DISD is already short of bilingual teachers and faces a problem of recruiting qualified bilingual teachers. With the projected enrollment of 2,000 to 5,000 illegal alien children from Mexico during the school year, the quality of education for Spanish-speaking citizens and legal resident aliens, who require bilingual education, will certainly decline.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> I conclude that \u00a7 21.031 is rationally related to Texas\u2019 interest in educating the electorate and in avoiding a diminution of the quality of such education. Moreover, unlike the statute in <em>Nyquist, </em>the Texas statute does not discriminate against aliens legally admitted into this country. It provides free public education for citizens \u2014 who, upon attaining the age of 18, are entitled to vote \u2014 and for aliens who possess documents establishing lawful admittance into this country \u2014 who if classified as resident aliens, are eligible to become naturalized citizens after a period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">With respect to the second justification advanced by the State of Texas in <em>Doe v. Plyler, </em>the panel held that the classification made by \u00a7 21.031 was not rationally related to the asserted goal of lessening the incentive for aliens to illegally enter this country. 628 F.2d at 461. The panel observed that although the asserted goal was entirely consistent with federal immigration policy, \u201cthe number of illegal aliens who bring their children to the United States is a small percentage of the total number of aliens illegally residing in the United States.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 460-61. Therefore, the panel concluded, the challenged classification \u201cis aimed at only a small part of the total illegal immigration problem.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 461. Although recognizing that \u201ca state is not required to \u2018choose between attacking every aspect of a problem or not attacking a problem at all,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>(citing <em>Dandridge v. Williams, </em>397 U.S. 471, 486, 90 S.Ct. 1153, 1162, 25 L.Ed.2d 491 (1970); <em>Williamson v. Lee Optical, </em>348 U.S. 483, 489, 75 S.Ct. 461, 465, 99 L.Ed. 563 (1955)), the panel reasoned that because the State failed to enact the measure most likely to lessen the incentive for aliens to illegally enter this country,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> serious doubt was cast on the <em>motive </em>of the Texas Legislature in enacting \u00a7 21.031. \u201cThis doubt, coupled with the district court\u2019s finding that Section 21.031 is an ineffectual means of discouraging illegal immigration, [led the panel] to conclude that the statute is not rationally related to its asserted goal.\u201d 628 F.2d at 461.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>I disagree with the panel in <em>Doe v. Plyler </em>because it incorrectly applied the traditional equal protection analysis. Under the rational basis test, the judiciary is not concerned with the verification of a state legislature\u2019s motive for enacting a statute. The test is not whether the challenged classification is rationally related to the legislature\u2019s <em>motive </em>in enacting the statute; it is whether the classification is rationally related to a <em>legitimate governmental interest See United States Department of Agriculture v. Moreno, </em>413 U.S. at 534-35, 93 S.Ct. at 2825-26 (where the Court, after noting that the challenged classification was clearly irrelevant to the stated purposes of the statute and that the legislative history indicated Congress\u2019 intent to exclude \u201chippies\u201d from the food stamp program, nonetheless applied the traditional equal protection analysis to the legitimate governmental interest in minimizing fraud in the program and held the classification to be wholly without any rational basis).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">Under the rational basis test, the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is violated \u201conly if the [challenged] classification rests on grounds wholly irrelevant to the achievement of the State\u2019s objective.\u201d <em>McGowan v. Maryland, </em>366 U.S. 420, 425, 81 S.Ct. 1101, 1104, 6 L.Ed.2d 393 (1961). Moreover, \u201c[a] statutory classification will not be set aside if <em>any </em>state of facts reasonably may be conceived to justify it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 426, 81 S.Ct. at 1105, <em>quoted in Dandridge v. Williams, </em>397 U.S. at 485, 90 S.Ct. at 1161 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">I would hold that the Texas Legislature could reasonably find that the exclusion of illegal aliens from free public education would be a step towards lessening the incentive for aliens to illegally enter and remain in this country and in the State of Texas.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> A state legislature is free to implement its objectives in social and economic areas<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201cstep by step ..., adopting regulations that only partially ameliorate a perceived evil and deferring complete elimination of the evil to future regulations.\u201d <em>City of New Orleans v. Dukes, </em>427 U.S. at 303, 96 S.Ct. at 2517; <em>see also Dandridge v. Williams, </em>397 U.S. at 485, 90 S.Ct. at 1161. Although the district court in <em>Doe </em>may have found the challenged classification to be an ineffectual means of eliminating the perceived evil, 628 F.2d at 461, such a finding itself, or coupled with a doubt about the legislature\u2019s motive for enacting the measure, does not lead to the conclusion that the statute is not rationally related to a legitimate governmental objective. The efficacy of legislation is not the province of the judiciary. A statute fails the rational basis test only if it rests on grounds wholly irrelevant to the achievement of a legitimate government objective. <em>McGowan v. Maryland, </em>366 U.S. at 425, 81 S.Ct. at 1104. I cannot say that this ground on which \u00a7 21.031 rests \u2014 that is, that denying illegal aliens free public education will discourage aliens from illegally entering and residing in this country \u2014 is irrelevant to the legitimate governmental objective of lessening the incentive for illegal entry and residence in the United States.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>The panel in <em>Doe v. Plyler </em>lays great significance on the failure of Texas to enact a statute prohibiting employers from hiring illegal aliens. Such a statute, the panel concludes, would be the measure most likely to achieve the goal of lessening the incentives for aliens to illegally enter the country. I suggest that the Texas Legislature could have concluded that it was more important to eliminate the incentive to illegal immigration in the form of the state and locally funded bounty of free public education,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> as opposed to the incentive of employment, which is for the most part in the private sector, since the policy of affording free public education to illegal aliens would be contrary to and in conflict with national immigration policy as established by Congress. Can it be denied that free education is an incentive to move across the Rio Grande? <em>Cf. Graham v. Richardson, </em>403 U.S. 365, 376-80, 91 S.Ct. 1848, 1854-56, 29 L.Ed.2d 534 (1971) (holding that a state\u2019s alien residency requirements for welfare benefits conflicts with federal immigration law because it discourages entry into or continued residency in the state by aliens lawfully within this country, the practical result of which is that aliens lawfully admitted under federal law are denied the privileges conferred by such admission);<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Sugarman v.

However, I am concerned by the Supreme Court\u2019s consistent and careful language indicating that the term \u201cperson\u201d as used in the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment \u201cencompasses <em>lawfully admitted </em>resident aliens as well as citizens .... \u201d <em>Graham v.

Therefore, it is conceivable that the Supreme Court might conclude for policy reasons<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> that an alien, who is not lawfully residing in this country, does not constitute a \u201cperson within [a state\u2019s] jurisdiction\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and, therefore, is not entitled to equal protection of the laws. <em>Cf.

Plyler </em>correctly noted that the Supreme Court has thus far only held that aliens lawfully residing in this country are entitled to equal protection and has never squarely addressed the issue of whether the equal protection clause extends to illegal aliens. 628 F.2d at 454, 458 n.25.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b518-11\">. The panel suggested that a strict scrutiny test may be applicable because illegal aliens as a class might constitute a suspect classification. This is so because illegal aliens fall within the Supreme Court\u2019s definition of. groups entitled to suspect status. \u201c[S]uspect status is accorded those groups that are \u2018saddled with such disabilities, or subjected to such a history of purposeful unequal treatment, or relegated to such a position of political powerlessness as to command extraordinary protection from the majoritarian political process.\u201d <em>Doe v. Plyler, </em>628 F.2d at 458 (quoting <em>San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 1, 28, 93 S.Ct. 1278, 1294, 36 L.Ed.2d 16 (1973)). The panel found \u201cno solid constitutional precedent for determining that some kind of access to basic education is a fundamental interest sufficient to invoke strict scrutiny.\u201d 628 F.2d at 457. However, in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s language in <em>Rodriguez </em>that there was no evidence therein that the Texas educational financing system operated as an absolute deprivation of free public education, the panel in <em>Doe v. Plyler </em>declined to hold that a denial of free public education to some children is not a denial of a fundamental right.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b519-5\">. The panel in <em>Doe v. Plyler </em>also cited <em>Graham v. Richardson, </em>403 U.S. 365, 91 S.Ct. 1848, 29 L.Ed.2d 534 (1971), and <em>Shapiro v. Thompson, </em>394 U.S. 618, 89 S.Ct. 1322, 22 L.Ed.2d 600 (1969), in support of its conclusion that cost, in and of itself, cannot justify exclusion of a group from a government funded program. However, in both of these cases the Supreme Court subjected the challenged classifications to strict scrutiny as opposed to the traditional equal protection analysis of rational basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">In <em>Graham, </em>the Court held that the states had a legitimate governmental interest in preserving the fiscal integrity of their welfare programs and that they can legitimately attempt to limit expenditures on these programs. But the Court held that the states cannot accomplish such a purpose by invidious discrimination because the challenged classifications (excluding lawfully admitted resident aliens from welfare assistance) were inherently suspect. 403 U.S. at 371-76, 91 S.Ct. at 1851-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">In <em>Shapiro, </em>the Supreme Court applied the compelling state interest test and held unconstitutional a state classification that imposed a one-year waiting period before new residents could become eligible for public welfare assistance. The Court recognized that a state has a legitimate interest in attempting to limit its expenditures on welfare assistance, but that the state\u2019s classification was invidious because it impinged on the fundamental right of interstate travel without promoting a compelling state interest. 394 U.S. at 633, 638, 89 S.Ct. at 1330, 1333. The state in <em>Shapiro </em>had first asserted that the challenged classification was justified because it discouraged indigents from migrating to the state solely to obtain larger welfare benefits. The state also urged that the challenged classification was justified as an attempt to distinguish between newer and older residents on the basis of their contributions to the community in taxes. Although acknowledging the state\u2019s valid interest in preserving its fiscal integrity, the Court held that the first two asserted justifications were not constitutionally permissible, legitimate state objectives. 394 U.S. at 631-33, 89 S.Ct. at 1329-30. After stating that \u201c[t]he saving of welfare costs cannot justify an otherwise invidious classification,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 633, 89 S.Ct. at 1330, the court footnoted its decision in <em>Rinaldi v. Yeager, </em>384 U.S. 305, 86 S.Ct. 1497, 16 L.Ed.2d 577 (1963), which involved a state statute requiring prisoners who took unsuccessful appeals to reimburse the state for the cost of furnishing a trial transcript out of their institutional earnings. In <em>Rinaldi, </em>the Court indicated, it held the state statute unconstitutional as a denial of equal protection \u201cbecause it did not require similar repayments from unsuccessful appellants given a suspended sentence, placed on probation, or sentenced only to a fine. There was <em>no rational basis </em>for the distinction between unsuccessful appellants who were in prison and those who were not.\u201d <em>Shapiro, </em>394 U.S. at 633 n.ll, 89 S.Ct. at 1330 n.ll (emphasis added). Therefore, it is clear that cost, in and of itself, can justify a classification if a rational basis exists for it \u2014 assuming that no constitutionally impermissible state objective exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-10\">In <em>Shapiro, </em>the state also asserted two governmental objectives that were not constitutionally impermissible as justifications for the challenged classification. These were administrative convenience and the prevention of fraud. 394 U.S. at 634, 89 S.Ct. at 1331. The Court concluded that even under the rational basis test the challenged classification would be unconstitutional because the state did not use and had no need to use the one-year waiting requirement for these last two governmental purposes suggested. <em>Id. </em>at 638, 89 S.Ct. at 1333.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b519-11\">. In <em>Moreno, </em>the Government contended that the challenged classification (excluding households of unrelated persons from eligibility for food stamps) should be upheld \u2014 even though the little legislative history that existed suggested that Congress through the challenged classification intended to prevent so-called \u201chippies\u201d from participating in the food stamp program \u2014 \u201cas rationally related to the clearly legitimate governmental interest in minimizing fraud in the administration of the food stamp program.\u201d 413 U.S. at 535, 93 S.Ct. at 2826. The Supreme Court held that the challenged classification did not operate so as rationally to further the prevention of fraud because the practical effect of the classification was to ex-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>elude \u201cfrom participation in the food stamp program, <em>not </em>those persons who are \u2018likely to abuse the program,\u2019 but rather, <em>only </em>those persons who are so desperately in need of aid that they cannot even afford to alter their living arrangements so as to retain their eligibility.\u201d 413 U.S. at 538, 93 S.Ct. at 2827 (emphasis in original). This was so because unrelated persons living together and constituting a single household under the statutory definition could alter their living arrangements so as to constitute two separate households and thus retain their food stamp eligibility. 413 U.S. at 537, 93 S.Ct. at 1333.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b520-13\">. <em>See </em>Tex.Const. art. 7, \u00a7 1, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-14\">\u201cA general diffusion of knowledge being essential to the preservation of the liberties and rights of the people, it shall be the duty of the Legislature of the State to establish and make suitable provision for the support and maintenance of an efficient system of public free schools.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b521-6\">.

In this case there is testimony from immigration and naturalization officials that free public education for their children is a definite attraction to certain aliens who illegally enter this country with their families. In its findings of fact on plaintiffs\u2019 first motion for preliminary injunction, the district court found that it was probable that 2,000 to 5,000 undocumented alien children reside within the boundaries of the Dallas Independent School District. Although the panel in <em>Doe v. Plyler </em>omnisciently observed that the number of illegal aliens who bring their children with them into this country is a small percentage of the aliens who illegally reside here, 2,000 to 5,000 illegal alien children within DISD alone is not an insignificant number of even the estimated 675,000 illegal aliens in the entire State of Texas. <em>See Doe v.

Footnote 60 of the Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Rodriguez </em>does <em>not </em>stand for the proposition that education might be a fundamental right if a statute results in a complete and absolute deprivation of public education. Rather, footnote 60 only stands for the proposition that if a statute which, by requiring payment of tuition, results in an absolute deprivation of education to those unable to pay, then a clearly defined class of \u201cpoor\u201d people might be entitled to a greater judicial solicitude in the form of a closer scrutiny of such a statute. This case does not involve wealth discrimination. Section 21.031 classifies on the basis of being an undocumented alien, not wealth. Moreover, the DISD regulation, unlike the school district\u2019s regulation in <em>Doe v.

Tex.Educ.Code Ann. \u00a7 21.031 does not classify on the basis of alienage.

Although illegal aliens as a class may possess the traditional indicia of suspectness, <em>see Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. at 28, 93 S.Ct. at 1293; <em>Doe v.
