The district court granted summary judgment for plaintiff, 480 F.Supp. 149 (N.D.Ga.1979). On appeal Termplan contends that the district court erred in holding that the manner in which the term \u201cloan fee\u201d was disclosed underneath the federally required term \u201cprepaid finance charge\u201d constituted an inconsistent disclosure proscribed by 12 CFR \u00a7 226.6(c). The regulation prohibits creditors from mingling state and federal disclosure requirements \u201cso as to mislead or confuse the customer ... or contradict, obscure, or detract attention from the information required by [Regulation Z] to be disclosed.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">Among the disclosures required by federal law is the \u201cprepaid finance charge,\u201d 12 CFR \u00a7 226.8(d)(2). Termplan included this disclosure in the upper portion of the loan agreement containing other federally required disclosures. However, Termplan purported to describe the prepaid finance charge in the following manner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-12\">PREPAID FINANCE CHARGE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AKH\">LOAN FEE LOAN FEE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-13\">$NONE $33.60</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-14\">In conformity with \u00a7 226.6(c)(2)(iii), Termplan also made disclosures required by Georgia law in the lower portion of the loan document beneath the heading \u201cSTATE DISCLOSURES THAT ARE INCONSISTENT WITH THE FEDERAL TRUTH IN LENDING ACT.\u201d Among those disclosures is a breakdown of the loan fee:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-15\">Loan Fee (4%) $None</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-16\">Loan Fee (8%) $33.60</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-17\">The loan fee disclosures in the state disclosure portion of the loan agreement are an attempt to comply with Georgia law. Ga. Code Ann. \u00a7 25-319 requires a licensed lender to disclose information to the borrower, including the amount of interest and fees, and \u00a7 25-315(b) allows a lender to charge a \u201cfee for making loan\u201d of 8% on the first $600 of the face amount and 4% on any excess.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-18\">Presumably the disclosure in the federal portion is an attempt to provide the borrower with additional information, that is, to describe as \u201cprepaid finance charge\u201d the loan fee calculated in the manner permitted by Georgia law. The restatement in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>federal portion simply does not accomplish this objective of conveying useful additional information and, moreover, creates an internal inconsistency with the federal portion.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">The prepaid finance charge consisting of a \u201cloan fee\u201d cannot be both \u201cnone\u201d and \u201c$33.60\u201d in the same transaction. In another context this inconsistency could produce a suit on the contract \u2014 is the borrower due to pay a prepaid finance charge of $33.60 or no charge at all or, if charged $33.60 can he return later and urge that a mistake was made, that the charge was to be \u201cnone\u201d and he is due back $33.60? This inconsistency of the two \u201cloan fee\u201d prongs of \u201cprepaid finance charge\u201d is exacerbated by there being no indication that the prepaid finance charge is the total of the two \u201cloan fee\u201d items. The loan here was less than $600, so the charge calculated at 8%, and the 4% range did not come into play. The same inconsistency would exist if the loan were $1,000 and the two items appeared as \u201cloan fee $48\u201d (8% on $600) and \u201cloan fee $16\u201d (4% on the $400 excess). Is there then one finance charge, and if so is it $48 or $16 or the total of $64, or are there two finance charges? Rather than disclosing meaningful additional information, the manner of describing the prepaid finance charge confuses the borrower and detracts attention from the required federal disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">With support from an amicus brief<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Termplan vigorously argues we are bound by precedent and by Federal Reserve Board opinion letters from finding that its itemization of the prepaid finance charge constitutes an inconsistent state disclosure. It relies on <em>Blalock v. Aetna Finance Co., </em>511 F.Supp. 33 (N.D.Ga. 1980) <em>aff\u2019d. </em>641 F.2d 878 (5th Cir. 1981), where we affirmed without opinion the district court\u2019s finding that itemizing the prepaid finance charge under the subheadings \u201c4% fee (A)\u201d and \u201c8% fee (B)\u201d was not an inconsistent state disclosure. <em>Blalock </em>is distinguishable. The subheadings in <em>Blalock </em>clearly inform the borrower that the prepaid finance charge comprises two separate calculations. Merely subdividing the prepaid finance charge into two identical subheadings, as Termplan has done, does not convey such useful additional information. In fact, it provides little or no additional information and because of the risk of confusion may be \u201cworse than meaningless,\u201d <em>see Mason v. General Finance Corp. of Va., </em>542 F.2d 1226, 1233 (4th Cir. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">Termplan also points to a Federal Reserve Board public opinion letter that endorses the terminology \u201cPrepaid Finance Charge (Loan Fee),\u201d FRB Pub. Op. Letter No. 1267, Cons. Cred. Guide (CCH) \u00b6 31,753 (Dec. 5, 1977). While we agree with the proposition that courts should not substitute their interpretations for those of the Board, <em>see Ford Motor Credit Co. v. Milhollin, </em>444 U.S. 555, 100 S.Ct. 790, 63 L.Ed.2d 22 (1980), we find Letter No. 1267 inapposite. It merely allows the lender to add \u201cloan fee\u201d as a parenthetical after \u201cprepaid finance charge\u201d where the prepaid finance charge is composed of a single-element loan fee. Moreover, although the Board has indicated that itemizing the elements of a prepaid finance charge does not necessarily constitute an inconsistent disclosure, <em>see e. g. </em>FRB Pub. Info. Letter No. 240, Cons. Cred. Guide (CCH) \u00b6 30,275 (Feb. 5, 1970), we are unaware of any interpretive ruling by the Board supporting Termplan\u2019s contention that a lender may \u201citemize\u201d the prepaid finance charge into identical \u201cloan fee\u201d subheadings without giving the borrower some indication that these identical subheadings refer to different elements that are, or may be, involved in calculating a total loan fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b397-9\">. 12 CFR \u00a7 226.6(c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-10\">(c) Additional information.
