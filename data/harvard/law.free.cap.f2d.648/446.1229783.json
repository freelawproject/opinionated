It cannot be determined with the degree of certainty required in capital cases that the instruction did not make a critical difference in the jury\u2019s decision to impose the death penalty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-24\">The petition for rehearing is DENIED. No member of this panel nor Judge in regular active service on the Court having requested that the Court be polled on rehearing en banc, (Rule 35 Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure; Local Fifth Circuit Rule 16) the petition for rehearing en banc is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
