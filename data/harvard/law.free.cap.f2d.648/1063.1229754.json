Alleging the negligence of bargeowner Nicklos Drilling Co. (Nicklos) as the cause of his injuries, Poirrier filed suit in tort in the state courts of Louisiana. The defendant Nicklos, invoking the diversity jurisdiction of the federal courts, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332, removed the action to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana pursuant to the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441. Poirrier then moved the district court to remand the case on grounds that its removal violated the express provisions of the \u201csaving to suitors\u201d clause. That motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-23\">Poirrier now seeks review of the district court\u2019s order denying remand through the alternative vehicles of appeal or petition for a writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-24\">An order denying remand of a case removed to federal court is not a final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1065\">*1065</page-number>order within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and, standing by itself, it cannot be appealed unless certified by the district court according to the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Capital Bancshares, Inc. v. North American Guaranty Ins. Co., </em>433 F.2d 279, 282 (5th Cir. 1970); <em>Lewis v. E. I. DuPont De Nemours &amp; Co., </em>183 F.2d 29, 31 (5th Cir. 1950); 1A Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00b60.169[2.-3], at 580 (2d ed. 1979); 14 Wright, Miller &amp; Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 3740, at 768-69 (1976); 15 <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3914, at 547-48. Such certification was not obtained in the present case and we are therefore without jurisdiction to review this order on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-5\">Where the circumstances are appropriate, appellate court review of an unappealable interlocutory order may be obtained through a petition for a writ of mandamus. 1A Moore\u2019s Federal Practice, <em>supra, </em>K 0.169[2.-3], at 581; 15 Wright, Miller &amp; Cooper, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 3914, at 548. <em>See Humble Oil &amp; Refining Co. v. Bell Marine Serv., Inc., </em>321 F.2d 53, 54-55 &amp; n. 4 (5th Cir. 1963). This case, however, does not present the \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d that would \u201cjustify the invocation of this extraordinary remedy.\u201d <em>See Will v. United States, </em>389 U.S. 90,95, 88 S.Ct. 269, 273,19 L.Ed.2d 305 (1967); <em>Wilkins v. American Export-Isbrandtsen Lines, Inc., </em>401 F.2d 151, 151 (2d Cir. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-6\">The district court did no more than deny remand where, on the face of the removal statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441, and the grant of diversity jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332, removal was entirely proper. Through his petition for mandamus, Poirrier challenges the power of a federal diversity court to retain jurisdiction of an action brought originally in state court under the \u201csaving to suitors\u201d clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1333 \u2014 a challenge he would characterize as raising a basic and as yet undecided question in this circuit. We do not believe the question here raised, however, is of a kind sufficient to justify the exercise of our \u201cadvisory\u201d mandamus power. <em>See Will v. United States, supra, </em>389 U.S. at 107, 88 S.Ct. at 280; <em>Schlagenhauf v. Holder, </em>379 U.S. 104, 110, 85 S.Ct. 234, 238, 13 L.Ed.2d 152 (1964); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hughes, </em>413 F.2d 1244, 1248-49 (5th Cir. 1969); <em>Sanders v. Russell, </em>401 F.2d 241, 243-44 (5th Cir. 1968); 9 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice, <em>supra, </em>f 110.28; 16 Wright, Miller, Cooper &amp; Grossman, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 3934.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-12\">This circuit has already recognized the removability, on diversity grounds, of maritime actions brought in state courts under the aegis of the \u201csaving to suitors\u201d clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1145-13\">In <em>Romero v. International Terminal Operating Co., </em>1959, 358 U.S. 354, 79 S.Ct. 468, 3 L.Ed.2d 368, which was decided since this action was commenced in the lower court, it was made clear that <em>except in diversity cases, </em>maritime litigation brought in state courts could not be removed to federal courts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1145-14\"><em>Gaitor v. Peninsular &amp; Occidental S. S. Co., </em>287 F.2d 252, 254 (5th Cir. 1961) (ordering remand to state court of removed maritime action for lack of requisite jurisdictional amount) (emphasis added). <em>See also </em>14 Wright, Miller &amp; Cooper, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 3674. Far from contradicting this view, the cases cited by Poirrier expressly support it. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1066\">*1066</page-number><em>Pacific Far East Line, Inc. v. Ogden Corp., </em>425 F.Supp. 1239, 1242-43 (N.D.Cal.1977); <em>J. J. Ryan &amp; Sons, Inc. v, Continental Ins. Co., </em>369 F.Supp. 692, 695 (D.S.C.1974); <em>Hill v. United Fruit Co., </em>149 F.Supp. 470, 472 (S.D.Cal.1957). The \u201csaving to suitors\u201d clause does no more than preserve the right of maritime suitors to pursue nonmaritime <em>remedies. </em>It does not guarantee them a nonfederal <em>forum, </em>or limit the right of defendants to remove such actions to federal court where there exists some basis for federal jurisdiction other than admiralty. <em>See </em>14 Wright, Miller &amp; Cooper, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 3674.</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-4\">The appeal is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction; the petition for writ of mandamus is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1144-13\">.

The Court of Appeals may thereupon, in its discretion, permit an appeal to be taken from such order, if application is made to it within ten days after the entry of the order: <em>Provided, however, </em>That application for an appeal hereunder shall not stay proceedings in the district court unless the district judge or the Court of Appeals or a judge thereof shall so order.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
