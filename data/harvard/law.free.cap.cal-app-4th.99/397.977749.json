Mora of assault with a firearm (Pen. Code, \u00a7 245, subd. (a)(2))<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> while personally using a firearm (\u00a7 12022.5) and inflicting great bodily injury (\u00a7 12022.7), being a felon in possession of a firearm (\u00a7 12021, subd. (a)), making a terrorist threat (\u00a7 422), false imprisonment (\u00a7\u00a7 236/ 237), assault with a deadly weapon (\u00a7 245, subd. (a)(1)), inflicting corporal injury on a spouse or cohabitant (\u00a7 273.5), and dissuading a witness by force (\u00a7 136.1, subd. (c)(1)). In superior court case No. SF90038 Mora entered a negotiated guilty plea to possessing marijuana for sale (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11359). The court sentenced him to 14 years four months in prison: the four-year upper term for assault with a firearm enhanced five years for personal firearm use, with consecutive eight-month terms for being a felon in possession of a firearm and making a terrorist threat (one-third the middle term), one year for assault with a deadly weapon (one-third the middle term) enhanced one year four months for personally using a firearm (one-third the middle term), one year for dissuading a witness (one-third the middle term), and eight months for possessing marijuana for sale in case No. SF90038 (one-third the middle term). In June 2001, the Department of Corrections advised the trial court that section 1170.15 provides for a full consecutive three-year term for dissuading a witness. On July 3, 2001, the trial court amended the abstract of judgment, ex parte, to provide for a full three-year term for dissuading a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-10\">In both the appeal and habeas corpus petition Mora contends amending the abstract of judgment in his absence was error and that increasing his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>sentence places him in double jeopardy. (See <em>People v. Mustafaa </em>(1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 1305 [28 Cal.Rptr.2d 172].) The People agree that the trial court erred in resentencing him in his absence. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Arbee </em>(1983) 143 Cal.App.3d 351, 356 [192 Cal.Rptr. 13].) We remand for resentencing and choose not to consider the double jeopardy issue absent a full record of the proceedings on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Mora\u2019s February 2002 motion to vacate the judgment, treated as a petition for writ of habeas corpus, raises the same issues as the appeal. In light of our decision to remand for resentencing, the petition is dismissed as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">The convictions are affirmed. The sentence is reversed and matter is remanded for resentencing in Mora\u2019s presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">Kremer, P. J., and O\u2019Rourke, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b328-11\">All statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
