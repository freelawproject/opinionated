J.</author>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">I. Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b379-10\">Defendant, Art Gonzalez, appeals from his first degree murder conviction. (Pen. Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7 187.) The jury further found defendant personally used a firearm in the commission of the murder. (\u00a7 12022.5, subd. (a).) In the published portion of this opinion, we discuss the \u201cquite limited\u201d sua sponte duty to instruct on a target offense as it relates to a natural and probable consequences theory of aiding and abetting liability. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Prettyman </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 248, 269 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 827, 926 P.2d 1013]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Dawson </em>(1997) 60 Cal.App.4th 534, 544 [71 Cal.Rptr.2d 33].) Defendant argues, for the first time on appeal, that the trial court should have instructed on its own initiative on the target offense of simple assault as a predicate for a finding that a prosecution witness was an accomplice on a natural and probable consequences aiding and abetting theory. Since the witness could have been viewed as an accomplice under a natural and probable consequences aiding and abetting theory, defendant reasons there was a sua sponte duty to instruct pursuant to CALJIC No. 3.02 and the elements of the target offense of simple assault. We disagree with the contention there was a sua sponte duty to so instruct concerning accomplice testimony and affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-11\">II. Factual Matters</p>\n<p id=\"AbD\">A. <em>The Competing Theories</em></p>\n<p id=\"b379-12\">The prosecution theory was that defendant personally shot and killed a rival gang member, Alfonso Ortega. An integral part of the prosecution case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>was the testimony of defendant\u2019s fellow gang member, Mario Lopez. Mr. Lopez testified defendant fatally shot Mr. Ortega, the rival gang member. By contrast, defendant testified that Mr. Lopez murdered Mr. Ortega.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">B. <em>Prosecution Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">The key prosecution witness was Mr. Lopez. Defendant and Mr. Lopez belonged to a gang that was the rival of another gang. Mr. Lopez was originally charged with the murder of the decedent, Alfonso Ortega. Mr. Lopez agreed to testify truthfully against defendant. As a result, Mr. Lopez would be permitted to plead guilty to voluntary manslaughter and receive .an 11-year state prison sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">On May 10, 1997, defendant and Mr. Lopez were eating at a hamburger stand in south Los Angeles. Mr. Lopez did not have a gun in his possession. Mr. Lopez did not see defendant with a gun. Mr. Lopez did not know defendant had a gun. Mr. Ortega, a member of a rival gang, and a Black individual named Milbert Cyiark, came into the restaurant. Defendant and Mr. Lopez gave Mr. Ortega and Mr. Cyiark intimidating looks. Mr. Ortega returned the intimidating looks. Mr. Ortega and Mr. Cyiark left the hamburger stand. They walked to a nearby liquor store. Defendant and Mr. Lopez then walked outside the hamburger stand. Mr. Lopez was on his bicycle. Defendant was walking behind Mr. Lopez. Mr. Lopez believed a fight might occur. Mr. Lopez continued to ride his bicycle in the parking lot of an adjacent laundromat. Mr. Ortega and Mr. Cyiark approached a public telephone. According to Mr. Lopez, defendant appeared to be arguing with Mr. Ortega. Mr. Lopez had previously told defendant, \u201c[H]it them up.\u201d Mr. Lopez testified that \u201chit them up\u201d is a confrontational term which means to inquire about their neighborhood. Mr. Lopez heard a gunshot. Mr. Lopez saw defendant running with the gun. Mr. Lopez also saw Mr. Ortega on the ground and Mr. Cyiark near the door of the hamburger stand. Mr. Lopez took the gun from defendant. Mr. Lopez gave the bicycle to defendant. The two separated. Mr. Lopez took the gun to a fellow gang member named Anthony Delgado whose gang moniker was \u201cLittle Beaver.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">Other witnesses confirmed Mr. Lopez\u2019s testimony. Angela Sepulveda was eating at the hamburger stand on May 10, 1997. She saw defendant and Mr. Lopez in the hamburger stand. She knew Mr. Lopez from school. Ms. Sepulveda saw Mr. Ortega and Mr. Cyiark enter the hamburger stand. Mr. Ortega exchanged acknowledgements with one another. Ms. Sepulveda believed the men were \u201cmad dogging\u201d one another. Thereafter Mr. Ortega and Mr. Cyiark left the hamburger stand. They walked toward the nearby liquor store. Defendant and Mr. Lopez put one fist, on top of one another\u2019s fist and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>then walked out of the hamburger stand. Mr. Lopez began riding his bicycle around the laundromat parking lot. Ms. Sepulveda heard a shot. Immediately thereafter, Mr. Cyiark ran into the hamburger stand. Mr. Cyiark said: \u201cMy homeboy got shot. My homeboy got shot. Call 9-1-1.\u201d Ms. Sepulveda saw defendant run across the street. Mr. Lopez rode his bicycle across the street. Ms. Sepulveda believed Mr. Lopez had continued to ride around in circles in the parking lot until he rode away. Ms. Sepulveda saw Mr. Ortega lying under the phone booth.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Juana Alcazar worked as a cashier at the hamburger stand on May 10, 1997. Ms. Alcazar saw defendant and a \u201cLatin\u201d man walk into the hamburger stand. They ordered food, ate inside the hamburger stand, then got up, and moved toward the exit. Ms. Alcazar did not see them leave. However, approximately three to five minutes later, she heard a gunshot. Thereafter, a Black man came into the hamburger stand. He asked to have his food quickly because, \u201cA guy has been killed by the telephone.\u201d Ms. Alcazar followed him outside. Once outside, Ms. Alcazar saw the man who had been shot. Los Angeles County Deputy Sheriff Richard Lopez investigated Mr. Ortega\u2019s murder. In the course of that investigation, he showed a photographic lineup to Ms. Alcazar. Although Ms. Alcazar identified defendant as the individual who had been inside the hamburger stand just prior to the shooting, she refused to sign a photo identification form or statement. Ms. Alcazar was afraid to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">Jose Correa was driving past the hamburger stand on May 10, 1997. He saw three young individuals outside the hamburger stand. One individual was close to the pay phone. Two others appeared to be threatening the man next to the pay telephone. Defendant was one of the two men. The other man was small and shorter. Defendant raised his shirt as if he were showing something to the victim. Because the situation appeared ominous, Mr. Correa described what he did: \u201cI decided to make a U-turn just in case something would happen, and if the young man would need some help.\u201d As he made the turn, Mr. Correa heard a gunshot. Defendant ran in front of Mr. Correa\u2019s car. Defendant was carrying a gun in his left hand. Mr. Correa saw a young man lying near the phone. Mr. Correa stopped his car. Mr. Correa\u2019s attempt to telephone for emergency assistance was unsuccessful. Mr. Correa went to help the young man. Mr. Correa directed others who had gathered to get towels. Mr. Correa also called the operator. Mr. Correa subsequently identified defendant\u2019s picture from a photographic lineup. Mr. Correa was 97 percent certain of his identification. Mr. Correa did not recall seeing a bicycle.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">Mr. Lopez was arrested for drinking a few days after the shooting. He denied any involvement in the shooting. However, while in custody, a letter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>written by Mr. Lopez to another gang member was intercepted by law enforcement officers. The letter, which described the killing of Mr. Ortega, identified defendant as the individual who fired the shots. The letter described the shooting of Mr. Ortega in great detail. The letter also indicated that \u201cLittle Beaver,\u201d the gang moniker used by Mr. Delgado, had been arrested with the gun after the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">Mr. Delgado had been arrested on a weapons possession charge on May 12, 1997. Detective Lopez retrieved the gun from evidence in Mr. Delgado\u2019s case. A round fired from that gun was subsequently compared to the bullet removed from Mr. Ortega\u2019s head. The bullet appeared to be consistent with a small-caliber gun such as that in Mr. Delgado\u2019s possession. An autopsy revealed Mr. Ortega died of a bullet wound to the forehead, which lodged in his brain. Based upon the stippling around the entry wound, a pathologist concluded that the shot was fired from less than two feet from Mr. Ortega\u2019s forehead.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">C. <em>The Defense Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">Defendant was the sole defense witness. Defendant admitted that he was a gang member and was eating at the hamburger stand on May 10, 1997. Defendant\u2019s fellow gang member, Mr. Lopez, was also eating at the hamburger stand. Mr. Ortega and Mr. Cyiark walked into the hamburger stand. Mr. Lopez began giving continuous dirty looks at Mr. Ortega. While seated at the hamburger stand, defendant did not direct any dirty looks towards Mr. Ortega or Mr. Cyiark. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Ortega and Mr. Cyiark left.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">Mr. Lopez said to defendant, \u201cWhat you want me to do?\u201d Defendant testified as to his interpretation of that question as follows, \u201cI thought it was, do we want to fight them one on one or do you want to jump them?\u201d Defendant testified that he thought as a gang member it was his responsibility to engage in \u201cfist fighting.\u201d Defendant indicated that fistfights were a common thing in his gang. In fact, defendant testified that he was \u201cgood at fist fighting.\u201d Defendant wanted to impress Mr. Lopez, who was an older gang member. Defendant responded, \u201cI\u2019ll get down with him[.]\u201d Defendant and Mr. Lopez then followed Mr. Ortega and Mr. Cyiark out of the hamburger stand. Defendant followed Mr. Ortega and Mr. Cyiark to a nearby liquor store. Defendant then used a pay phone to call a cousin.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">Eventually, defendant called out, \u201cHey.\u201d Mr. Ortega then said, \u201cWhat you want?\u201d Defendant responded, \u201cWhere you from?\u201d This, according to defendant, was a form of a challenge to a fistfight. Mr. Ortega responded by identifying his street gang. Mr. Ortega then made a disrespectful comment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>about defendant\u2019s gang. Defendant answered: \u201cWhat\u2019s up? Let\u2019s get down.\u201d Mr. Ortega responded: \u201cFor what? You guys ain\u2019t nothing.\u201d Defendant began stating, \u201cWhat\u2019s up,\u201d as a prelude to a fistfight. As the two opposing gang members argued, Mr. Lopez said, \u201cGet out of the way.\u201d Mr. Lopez then shot Mr. Ortega.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Mr. Lopez then handed the gun to defendant. Defendant said to Mr. Lopez, \u201cWhy did you do that for him[?]\u201d Defendant then began running away from the scene of the shooting holding the gun that had been fired by Mr. Lopez. Defendant testified that he was shocked by what had occurred. As they were running, Mr. Lopez said to defendant, \u201cGive me the gun.\u201d Defendant then went home. Defendant admitted that committing crimes was a way to \u201cmake a name for yourself\u2019 in his gang. Defendant never told police that Mr. Lopez shot Mr. Ortega.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">\n<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">Prior to arguing to the jury, the prosecutor requested the standard shared-intent aiding and abetting instructions in CALJIC Nos. 3.00 and 3.01 set forth in the margin b\u00e9 given to the jury.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (See <em>People </em>v. <em>McCoy </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 1111, 1118 [108 Cal.Rptr.2d 188, 24 P.3d 1210]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Beeman </em>(1984) 35 Cal.3d 547, 560 [199 Cal.Rptr. 60, 674 P.2d 1318].) The deputy district attorney did not request the jury be instructed pursuant to CALJIC No. 3.02 on a natural and probable consequences aiding and abetting theory, including instructions of any target offenses. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>McCoy, supra, </em>25 Cal.4th at p. 1117; <em>People v. Sakarias </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 596, 627-628 [94 Cal.Rptr.2d 17, 995 P.2d 152].) Additionally, the prosecutor requested that the jury be given accomplice instructions in connection with the testimony of Mr. Lopez. As can be noted from his testimony, Mr. Lopez, a fellow gang <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>member of defendant, was a <em>potential </em>accomplice in the fatal shooting of Mr. Ortega. Hence, the prosecutor requested, and the trial court gave, modified provisions of CALJIC Nos. 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.14, 3.18, and 3.19.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The only request offered by defense counsel was that the jury should be instructed that the testimony of accomplice must be viewed with \u201cdistrust\u201d rather than in compliance with CALJIC No. 3.18. The trial court instructed pursuant to CALJIC No. 3.18 as required by <em>People </em>v. <em>Guiuan </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 558, 564-570 [76 Cal.Rptr.2d 239, 957 P.2d 928], \u201cTo the extent an accomplice gives testimony that tends to incriminate the defendant, it should be viewed with caution.\u201d Defense counsel interposed no other objections and did not request any other modification to the standard accomplice instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">For the first time on appeal, defendant argues that the trial court failed to properly instruct the jury on accomplice liability as related to Mr. Lopez\u2019s testimony. Defendant argues as follows: \u201cThe trial court\u2019s failure to instruct on this doctrine prevented appellant\u2019s jury . . . from correctly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>determining whether [Mr.] Lopez was an accomplice, and whether his testimony needed corroboration and whether his testimony should be viewed with caution. Had the jury been properly instructed, it would have deemed [Mr.] Lopez an accomplice if it found that he aided and abetted an assault on [Mr.] Ortega, and that the assault had homicide as its natural and probable consequence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Typically, there is a sua sponte duty to give standard accomplice instructions. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Guiuan, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at pp. 564-565; <em>People </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 1268, 1314 [248 Cal.Rptr. 834, 756 P.2d 221].) But when a standard accomplice instruction, such as a particular witness\u2019s testimony is to be viewed with distrust, is given without objection, a defendant cannot complain the instruction was too general or incomplete. In <em>People v. Guiuan, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at page 570, the Supreme Court held: \u201cGuiuan did not object. Neither did she request modification. She may not be heard now. \u2018Generally, a party may not complain on appeal that an instruction correct in law and responsive to the evidence was too general or incomplete unless the party has requested appropriate clarifying or amplifying language.\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Andrews </em>(1989) 49 Cal.3d 200, 218 [260 Cal.Rptr. 583, 776 P.2d 285].)\u201d Nor is there a sua sponte duty to modify the standard instruction on corroboration to indicate it applies to both in and out-of-court statements of the potential accomplice. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Andrews, supra, </em>49 Cal.3d at pp. 217-218.)</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">In order for the jury to be properly instructed under defendant\u2019s theory, the trial court would be required, on its own initiative, to give an instruction along the lines of CALJIC No. 3.02.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\n                   The Supreme Court described the natural and probable consequences doctrine as applied to aiders and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>abettors as follows in <em>People v. Prettyman, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th 248 at page 267: \u201cTo apply the \u2018natural and probable consequences\u2019 doctrine to aiders and abettors is not an easy task. The jury must decide whether the defendant (1) with knowledge of the confederate\u2019s unlawful purpose, and (2) with the intent of committing, encouraging, or facilitating the commission of any target crime(s), (3) aided, promoted, encouraged, or instigated the commission of the target crime(s); whether (4) the defendant\u2019s confederate committed an offense <em>other than </em>the target crime(s); and whether (5) the offense committed by the confederate was a natural and probable consequence of the target crime(s) that the defendant encouraged or facilitated. Instructions describing each step in this process ensure proper application by the jury of the \u2018natural and probable consequences\u2019 doctrine.\u201d (Original italics; see <em>People v. Dawson, supra, </em>60 Cal.App.4th at p. 544.) As can be noted, inherent in the natural and probable consequences rule is the requirement the jury be instructed on target offenses. <em>(People v. Sakarias, supra, </em>22 Cal.4th at pp. 627-628; <em>People v. Gonzales </em>(2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 1, 8-9 [104 Cal.Rptr.2d 247].) In this case, defendant argues that a simple assault could have been the target offense,  Intrinsic in defendant\u2019s contention is that the accomplice testimony instructions should have been augmented with CALJIC No. 3.02 and a requirement that the jury should have been instructed, without request by any party, on the target offense of simple assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">However, the California Supreme Court has explicitly held that there is no sua sponte duty to instruct on target offenses in the context of prosecution based in part upon a natural and probable consequences aiding and abetting theory. In <em>People v. Prettyman, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at page 269, the Supreme Court set forth the \u201cquite limited\u201d circumstances under which the sua sponte duty to instruct on target offenses as follows: \u201cWe recognize that the workload of our already heavily burdened trial courts is increased whenever we impose on trial judges an obligation to provide a particular jury instruction sua sponte. We also recognize that \u2018the trial court cannot be required to anticipate every possible theory that may fit the facts of the case before it and instruct the jury accordingly.\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wade </em>(1959) 53 Cal.2d 322, 334 [1 Cal.Rptr. 683, 348 P.2d 116].) But the sua sponte duty to instruct that is imposed here is quite limited. It arises only when the prosecution has elected to <em>rely </em>on the \u2018natural and probable consequences\u2019 theory of accomplice liability and the trial court has determined that the evidence will support instructions on that theory. The trial court, moreover, need not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>identify <em>all </em>potential target offenses supported by the evidence, but only those that the prosecution wishes the jury to consider. [^Q The trial court should grant a prosecutor\u2019s request that the jury be instructed on the \u2018natural and probable consequences\u2019 rule only when (1) the record contains substantial evidence that the defendant intended to encourage or assist a confederate in committing a target offense, and (2) the jury could reasonably find that the crime actually committed by the defendant\u2019s confederate was a \u2018natural and probable consequence\u2019 of the specifically contemplated target offense. If this test is not satisfied, the instruction should not be given, even if specifically requested.\u201d (Fn. omitted, original italics; see <em>People v. Dawson, supra, </em>60 Cal.App.4th at p. 544.) The omitted footnote in <em>Prettyman </em>states, \u201cIf the prosecutor requests that the jury be instructed on the \u2018natural and probable consequences\u2019 doctrine, but fails to identify potential target crimes, the trial court should inquire about the particular target offenses on which instruction is desired.\u201d <em>(People v. Prettyman, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at p. 269, fn. 9.) Quite obviously, there is no sua sponte duty to give instructions on target offenses unless the prosecutor relies on a natural and probable consequences theory. If the prosecutor fails to identify any potential target crimes, then no instruction may be given pursuant to CALJIC No. 3.02 on a natural and probable consequences aiding and abetting theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">No doubt, <em>Prettyman </em>involves instructions on the liability of a charged offense\u2014murder. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Prettyman, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at p. 254.) Defendant attempts to distinguish <em>Prettyman, </em>which concludes no sua sponte duty existed under the circumstances, by arguing that the present case involves a potential target offense which relates to possible aiding and abetting liability and cautionary accomplice testimony instructions. But we fail to distinguish any meaningful difference between this case and holding in <em>Prettyman </em>as to the \u201cquite limited\u201d sua sponte duty to instruct on a target offense. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 269; <em>People v. Dawson, supra, </em>60 Cal.App.4th at p. 544.) If there is no sua sponte duty to instruct on target offenses as it relates to an element of charged crime, then no justification in reason or law warrants imposing such a responsibility on a trial court to act on its own initiative in connection with accomplice testimony. We have already detailed the exceptions to the sua sponte duty to instruct on accomplice testimony in <em>People v. Guiuan, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at page 570, and <em>People </em>v. <em>Andrews, supra, </em>49 Cal.3d at page 218. Instructing on a target offense to support a CALJIC No. 3.02 natural and probable consequences aiding and abetting theory as a basis for potential accomplice liability falls within the scope of an exception to the normal sua sponte obligation to instruct in this area just as <em>Guiuan </em>and <em>Andrews </em>recognize no duty to instruct on the trial court\u2019s own motion concerning testimony by an accused\u2019s confederate exists in other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>\n<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">IV.

Each principal, regardless of the extent or manner of participation is equally guilty. Principals include: [IQ 1. Those who directly and actively commit the act constituting the crime, or [ID 2. Those who aid and abet the commission of the crime.\u201d The jury also was instructed pursuant to a modified version of CALJIC No. 3.01 as follows: \u201cA person aids and abets the [commission] [or] [attempted commission] of a crime when he or she, [10 (1) With knowledge of the unlawful purpose of the perpetrator and [10 (2) With the intent or purpose of committing or encouraging or facilitating the commission of the crime, and [10 (3) By act or advice aids, promotes, encourages or instigates the commission of the crime. [10 Mere presence at the scene of a crime which does not itself assist the commission of the crime does not amount to aiding and abetting. [ID Mere knowledge that a crime is being committed and the failure to prevent it does not amount to aiding and abetting.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b384-5\">The jurors were instructed in the following fashion pursuant to modified provisions of CALJIC Nos. 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.14, 3.18, and 3.19: \u201cAn accomplice is a person who is subject to prosecution for the identical offense charged in Count One against the defendant on trial by reason of aiding and abetting. HD You cannot find a defendant guilty based upon the testimony of an accomplice unless that testimony is corroborated by other evidence which tends to connect the defendant with the commission of the offense. HD Testimony of an accomplice includes any out-of-court statement purportedly made by an accomplice received for the purpose of proving that what that accomplice stated out-of-court was true. [ID To corroborate the testimony of an accomplice there must be evidence of some act or fact related to the crime which, if believed, by itself and without any aid, interpretation or direction from the testimony of the accomplice, tends to connect the defendant with the commission of the crime charged. HD However, it is not necessary that the evidence of corroboration be sufficient in itself to establish every element of the crime charged, or that it corroborate every fact to which the accomplice testifies. HD In determining whether an accomplice has been corroborated, you must first assume the testimony of the accomplice has been removed from the case. You must then determine whether there is any remaining evidence which tends to connect the defendant with the commission of the crime. HD If there is no independent evidence which tends to connect defendant with the commission of the crime, the testimony of the accomplice is not corroborated. [ID If there is independent evidence which you believe, then the testimony of the accomplice is corroborated. HD Merely assenting to or aiding or assisting in the commission of a crime without knowledge of the unlawful purpose of the perpetrator and without the intent or purpose of committing, encouraging or facilitating the commission of the crime is not criminal. Thus a person who assents to, or aids, or assists in, the commission of a crime without that knowledge and without that intent or purpose is not an accomplice in the commission of the crime. HD To the extent an accomplice gives testimony that tends to incriminate the defendant, it should be viewed with caution. This does not mean, however, that you may arbitrarily disregard that testimony. You should give that testimony the weight you think it deserves after examining it with care and caution and in the light of all the evidence in the case. [ID You must determine whether the witness Mario Lopez was an accomplice as I have defined that term. HD The defendant has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that Mario Lopez was an accomplice in the crime charged against the defendant.\u201d Additionally, the jury was instructed on the definition of preponderance of the evidence pursuant to CALJIC No. 2.50.2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b385-7\"> The 2000 re-revision of CALJIC No. 3.02 states: \u201cOne who aids and abets [another] in the commission of a crime [or crimes] is not only guilty of [that crime] [those crimes], but is also guilty of any other crime committed by a principal which is a natural and probable consequence of the crime[s] originally aided and abetted. HQ In order to find the defendant guilty of the crime[s] of \u2022 [as charged in Count[s]_,] you must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that: HQ 1.

The issue is to be decided in light of all of the circumstances surrounding the incident. A \u2018natural consequence\u2019 is one which is within the normal range of outcomes that may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>reasonably expected to occur if nothing unusual has intervened. \u2018Probable\u2019 means likely to happen.]\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b388-12\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 475.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b388-7\">MOSK, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Affr\">I concur in the result. I believe that the trial court erred by not giving the CALJIC No. 3.02 instruction concerning liability for natural and probable consequences for purposes of determining whether a witness was an accomplice, but that the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">Because the jury was not instructed with CALJIC 3.02, the jury could have found that Mario Lopez (Lopez) was an accomplice only if it found that he knew of and intended to further defendant\u2019s unlawful purpose, i.e., murder. That is not a complete statement of accomplice law. Lopez also could have been found to be an accomplice if he aided and abetted a crime\u2014here assault\u2014(a \u201ctarget offense\u201d), the natural and probable consequence of which was murder. (See generally <em>People </em>v. <em>Prettyman </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 248, 259-263 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 827, 926 P.2d 1013].)</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">If the jury had been instructed with CALJIC No. 3.02, then the jury could have found that Lopez was an accomplice even if it believed he did not know that defendant intended to shoot the victim. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gonzales </em>(2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 1 [104 Cal.Rptr.2d 247].) If Lopez engaged in a criminal act, the natural and probable consequence of which was murder, then he was an accomplice, and his testimony required corroboration and had to be viewed with distrust.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-10\"><em>Prettyman </em>and its requirement that the prosecution rely on the target offense as a prerequisite to the duty to instruct on that offense is not applicable here in determining whether the trial court had a sua sponte duty to instruct the jury on natural and probable consequences. <em>Prettyman </em>concerns the sua sponte duty to instruct on target offenses relevant to the natural and probable consequences principle in connection with the prosecution of a <em>defendant </em>pursuant to that principle. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Prettyman, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at p. 269.) The <em>Prettyman </em>discussion is not determinative with regard to an accomplice instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-11\">Although I agree that appellate courts should \u201cavoid loading yet another sua sponte instructional duty on trial courts\u201d <em>(People v. Prettyman, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at p. 278 (cone. opn. of Mosk, J.)), the duty I find here has already <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>been established. When there is sufficient evidence that a witness is an accomplice, the trial court is required on its own motion to instruct the jury on the principles governing the law of accomplices. <em>(People v. Frye </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 894, 965-966 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 25, 959 P.2d 183]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gordon </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 460, 469-470 [110 Cal.Rptr. 906, 516 P.2d 298].) When there is evidence that a witness\u2014rather than acting as a direct aider and abettor\u2014aided and abetted a target offense, the natural and probable consequence of which is the charged crime, the law of accomplices necessarily requires the jury to be so instructed. The trial court erred by failing to give the CALJIC No. 3.02 instruction because the instruction, in this case, is part of the law of accomplices, not because the instruction was required by <em>Prettyman </em>in connection with the accomplice liability of a defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">A conviction will not be reversed for failure to instruct on these principles if a review of the entire record reveals sufficient evidence of corroboration. <em>(People v. Frye, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at p. 966; <em>People </em>v. <em>Arias </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 92, 143 [51 Cal.Rptr.2d 770, 913 P.2d 980].) Corroboration need only be slight. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Fauber </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 792, 835 [9 Cal.Rptr.2d 24, 831 P.2d 249].) \u201cIt [the evidence] need not corroborate every fact to which the accomplice testified or establish the corpus delicti, but is sufficient if it tends to connect the defendant with the crime in such a way as to satisfy the jury that the accomplice is telling the truth.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 834; see also Pen. Code, \u00a7 1111.)</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Here, the error was harmless because Lopez\u2019s testimony was independently corroborated. Among other evidence, Jose Correa testified that he saw defendant lift his shirt as if showing something to the victim, and he thereafter heard a gunshot and saw defendant running with a gun in his hand. Hence, any error in failing to instruct the jury on the natural and probable consequences doctrine was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied September 11, 2002. Kennard, J., was of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
