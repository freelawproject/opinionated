The dispositional order is reversed and the matter remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1155\">*1155</page-number>\n<em>Procedural History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-5\">On October 26, 2000, Brandon admitted a residential burglary allegation in a petition filed in the San Mateo County Juvenile Court (San Mateo court). The court then transferred the case to San Francisco County Juvenile Court (San Francisco court) where Brandon had already been declared a ward of the court on October 6, 2000. Brandon lives in San Francisco County.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-6\">In the San Francisco court, Brandon moved to set aside his admission of the burglary in San Mateo County. The motion alleged that Brandon had been advised by his San Mateo County attorney that if he admitted the burglary, he would be transferred to San Francisco and released. The San Francisco court declined to hear the motion and instead transferred the case back to the San Mateo court for a ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-7\">The San Mateo cotut appointed counsel for Brandon. A motion to set aside the plea was made, but then withdrawn. The San Mateo court once again transferred the matter to the San Francisco court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-8\">In San Francisco, Brandon renewed his motion to withdraw the plea, but the court declined to hear the motion, stating, \u201cI\u2019m not willing to entertain the motion to withdraw a neighboring county\u2019s plea here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-9\">At disposition, the court found Brandon\u2019s San Mateo County burglary to be a felony, and committed him to out-of-home placement with recommended drug and alcohol treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-10\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-11\">I. <em>Jurisdiction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1017-12\">The San Francisco court has jurisdiction to hear Brandon\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-13\">Penal Code section 859a concerns adult criminal defendants whose guilty pleas were entered in municipal court and certified to superior court. Upon written motion to withdraw the guilty plea, such a defendant has a right to have his motion heard in municipal court. As explained in <em>People </em>v. <em>Mesa </em>(1985) 174 Cal.App.3d 58, 60 [219 Cal.Rptr. 720], the legislative purpose of the provision is to have the motion heard by the judge who accepted the plea and is familiar with the circumstances. However, \u201c[a]l-though it may be desirable in most cases for the same magistrate to hear the motion, nothing in the language of section 859a requires that result.\u201d <em>(People </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1156\">*1156</page-number>v. <em>Batt </em>(1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1044, 1048 [30 Cal.Rptr.2d 109].) The statute requires only that a motion to withdraw a plea be heard by the same court, not the same judge. <em>(People v. Valdez </em>(1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1633, 1638 [39 Cal.Rptr.2d 818].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-4\">There is no provision analogous to Penal Code section 859a for juveniles accused of criminal conduct. Unlike adult defendants, juveniles are subject to the intercounty transfer provision of Welfare and Institutions Code section 750.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Pursuant to section 750, the entire case may be transferred to the juvenile court of the county where the minor or his custodian resides if the petition is filed in a county other than that of the minor\u2019s residence, or if the residence of the person entitled to his custody changes to another county after the petition is filed. (See also Cal. Rules of Court, rule 1425(a), (c), (d).)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court shall not transfer the case unless it determines that the transfer will protect or further the child\u2019s best interests. (Rule 1425(e).) The transfer may be made only after the original court has made findings of facts upon which it has exercised jurisdiction over the minor. On the receipt and filing of the findings and order of transfer, the receiving juvenile court must take jurisdiction of the case. (Rule 1425(h).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-5\">Brandon\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea does not change the fact that a jurisdictional order was made by the San Mateo court and that the matter was properly transferred. \u201cA final order of transfer permanently removes the entire case from the original court.\u201d (10 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (9th ed. 1989) Parent &amp; Child, \u00a7 470, p. 515.) Once the San Mateo court transferred the matter, the San Francisco court had jurisdiction over Brandon for all purposes. The code specifically mandates that the court to which a case is transferred <em>\u201cshall </em>take jurisdiction.\u201d (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 750.) There is no statutory provision for a transfer <em>back </em>to the original court or for any kind of joint jurisdiction. The court erred in determining that San Francisco was not the proper court to hear the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1157\">*1157</page-number>II. <em>Waiver</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1019-5\">\n<em>Disposition*</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-6\">McGuiness, P.
