Cristian contends the order is not supported by substantial evidence. We conclude a parent may challenge the sufficiency of evidence supporting a child\u2019s adoptability, despite the parent\u2019s failure to raise the argument below. Because substantial evidence does not support the juvenile court\u2019s finding of adoptability, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b488-10\">Brian was bom in 1997. He was declared a dependent of the juvenile court on November 3, 1999. On March 2, 2001, the court terminated Brian\u2019s mother\u2019s reunification services and set a hearing under Welfare and Institutions Code section 366.26<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for June 22, 2001. No services had been ordered for Cristian, because the Alameda County Social Services Agency (the Agency) had been unable to locate him and his paternity had not been established. A status review report prepared on January 10 noted: \u201cThe minor was first assessed for adoption[] on June 20, 2000 [and] at that time the minor was approved for adoptive services because of lack of parental compliance with the case plan. The minor was reassessed on 1-10-01 and found to be a proper subject for adoption.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b488-11\">On June 21, the Agency filed a memorandum stating that the section 366.26 hearing needed to be continued, because Cristian had come forward <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>and contacted the child welfare worker. The worker reported that Cristian told her he was an undocumented alien, and Brian\u2019s mother, Janelle P., had \u201ccontinually stated that she would contact immigration services to have him deported if he attempted to have contact with [Brian].\u201d Cristian told the worker he had relatives who were legal residents, and he was interested in having them adopt Brian if possible. The worker stated that Cristian, who was not identified as the father on Brian\u2019s birth certificate, \u201cneeds the opportunity to establish paternity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">The hearing was continued until August 24, and counsel was appointed for Cristian. The report for the section 366.26 hearing was dated August 20, 2001. The child welfare worker who prepared the report had only recently been assigned to the case, on July 13. The worker recommended a permanent plan of long-term foster care \u201cat the present time,\u201d while the Agency looked for an adoptive home. The report noted that Brian\u2019s foster mother was not interested in adopting him. A maternal cousin was considering adoption. A referral had been made to the Agency\u2019s adoption unit, and the Agency would be looking for an adoptive home. But the worker stated \u201c[t]here is not clear and convincing evidence that it is likely the child will be adopted at this time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">The worker noted that Brian, now four and a half years old, \u201chas made excellent progress over the past year. He is almost able to dress himself, and is now toilet trained. Brian has begun to speak and his gait has improved.\u201d The report described Brian as \u201ccautious but friendly with adults, and it takes him some time to warm up and trust adults. He appears to enjoy the attention from his foster mother\u2019s large extended family. He especially enjoys playing with the 5 year old, and he has emerged even more from his protective shell. When playing he can be just as loud and rambunctious as any other child his age.\u201d Brian did not make a statement for the report, because \u201c[although Brian is speaking more now, he has been unable to make a statement. Brian\u2019s smiles, and gestures to his foster mother give the appearance that [he] is receiving the nurturing that he needs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">As for the likelihood of adoption, the worker repeated verbatim the January 10 report of assessments performed on June 20 and January 10, and added: \u201cThe Agency is looking for an adoptive home, and the maternal cousin is still considering adoption. [5Q The likelihood of adoption is very good, but it is not [im]minent at this time.\u201d The worker also noted: \u201cIf paternity is established, the father\u2019s relatives may be considered for placement as well.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">Two reports from a social worker associated with the foster family agency, dated March and May 2001, were appended to the section 366.26 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>hearing report. Both expressed concern over the negative effects of Brian\u2019s visitation with his mother Janelle, who frequently failed to appear for visits. The May report noted that when Brian was first placed in foster care at the age of two and a half, he was sickly and developmentally delayed. \u201cHe did not speak, walked with an unsteady gait and could not even attempt to dress himself.\u201d However, \u201calmost [t]wo years after placement Brian has blossomed into a happy, healthy little boy, who loves learning in pre-school and playing with his peers.\u201d The March report stated: \u201cBrian continues to improve developmentally. His gait is becoming less awkward and his speech improves daily.\u201d This report also noted: \u201cHe is eating and sleeping well, dresses himself, and has been successfully toilet trained.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">At the hearing on August 24, Cristian appeared before the court. Janelle did not. County counsel explained to the court that the recommendation in the report for a permanent plan of long-term foster care was \u201cincorrect.\u201d The reason for the confusion was Cristian\u2019s recent appearance in the proceedings. His paternity had been confirmed just prior to the hearing. Counsel asked the court for a continuance of the section 366.26 hearing so that Cristian\u2019s relatives could be assessed as potential adoptive parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">The court responded that Brian had been deemed adoptable when the hearing was set, and unless there were some change in the Agency\u2019s position, \u201cthen I don\u2019t see a basis for a change in the recommendation.\u201d Counsel assured the court that the Agency \u201cdoes agree that the minor is adoptable,\u201d but said the Agency wanted a continuance for the purpose of finding an adoptive home. Janelle\u2019s counsel noted that \u201cif we terminate parental rights, we have the danger of creating a judicial orphan with no adoptive home in sight.\u201d The court, however, pointed out that a prospective adoptive home is not a prerequisite for terminating parental rights, and stated it was \u201cprepared to hear this as a contested matter.\u201d Cristian\u2019s counsel advised the court that his client was living with his aunt, and wanted her to be considered as \u201ca suitable placement.\u201d The court stated that placement issues were not before it at this hearing, and were not grounds for a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">The child welfare worker who prepared the section 366.26 hearing report testified briefly. She said she had intended to recommend continued foster care when she wrote the report, but realized she had made an error after speaking to counsel, who informed her that \u201c[w]e were recommending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>termination of parental rights.\u201d The worker also retracted, with some confusion, her proposed finding on the lack of clear and convincing evidence of adoptability.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">Cristian also testified briefly. He said he first learned Brian was in foster care about six months before the section 366.26 hearing. Janelle would not tell him where Brian was, though. She only wanted money from Cristian. He had last seen Brian \u201ca long time ago.\u201d He had asked for custody repeatedly, but Janelle always said no.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">In closing, county counsel made no mention of Brian\u2019s adoptability, but asked the court to terminate parental rights because Cristian had made insufficient efforts to care for Brian, had no parental bond, and had not seen Brian for six months. Counsel pointed out that Janelle had also failed to bond with Brian, her visitation had been detrimental for the child, and she had failed to appear for the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">Cristian\u2019s counsel complained that the case was \u201cfraught with various errors.\u201d He protested that Cristian had not been properly notified of earlier hearings, and had never been provided with reunification services. Counsel also objected that he had only received the section 366.26 hearing report the day before the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">Janelle\u2019s counsel again argued that the court should not \u201cengage in creating judicial orphans.\u201d He urged the court to follow the report\u2019s recommendation of long-term foster care.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">Brian\u2019s counsel said he gave \u201cspecial credence\u201d to the part of the report finding the likelihood of adoption \u201cvery good\u201d if not imminent. He urged the court to establish adoption as the permanent plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-10\">The court found there was clear and convincing evidence that Brian was likely to be adopted. It terminated the parental rights of Cristian and Janelle, and prohibited any visitation. The court noted that the Agency was required to evaluate any relatives who were interested in being considered as adoptive parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">1. <em>The Waiver Issue</em></p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Cristian contends no substantial evidence supported the finding that Brian was likely to be adopted. The Agency disputes this claim, but also asserts that Cristian waived it by failing to object to the adoptability finding below. Cristian concedes that defects in the adoption assessment required by section 366.21, subdivision (i) may be waived.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>\n                   However, he argues no objection is necessary to preserve a claim that there was a failure of proof. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">A similar waiver argument was raised in <em>In re Lukas B. </em>(2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 1145 [94 Cal.Rptr.2d 693]. The court decided to consider the issue of adoptability \u201cif only to demonstrate that trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to argue the issue,\u201d but observed there was authority that would support deeming the issue waived. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1153-1154, citing <em>In re Crystal J. </em>(1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 407, 411-412 [15 Cal.Rptr.2d 613]; <em>In re Aaron B. </em>(1996) 46 Cal.App.4th 843, 846 [54 Cal.Rptr.2d 27]; and <em>In re Urayna L. </em>(1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 883, 886 [89 Cal.Rptr.2d 437].)</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>Of the cases cited by the <em>Lukas B. </em>court, only <em>Crystal J. </em>actually supports the proposition that the ultimate issue of whether the child is likely to be adopted can be waived by failing to argue the point at the section 366.26 hearing. Both the <em>Aaron B. </em>and <em>Urayna L. </em>courts made it clear that it was objections to the adequacy of the adoption assessment report that were waived. In <em>Urayna L., </em>the appellant did not contest the sufficiency of the evidence. <em>(In re Urayna L., supra, </em>75 Cal.App.4th at p. 885.) The <em>Aaron B. </em>court evidently addressed the sufficiency of the evidence in an unpublished part of the opinion. <em>(In re Aaron B., supra, </em>46 Cal.App.4th at pp. 844, 846.) The <em>Crystal J. </em>court, however, went further and stated that not only were objections to the sufficiency of the assessment reports waived, but \u201csubstantive insuffien[cy] to establish requisite findings . . . too, was waived by the failure to raise it at the trial level.\u201d <em>(In re Crystal J., supra, </em>12 Cal.App.4th at. pp. 411-412.)</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">We believe the <em>Crystal J. </em>court overstated the scope of the waiver doctrine. The court itself subsequently recognized that \u201c[djeficiencies in an assessment report surely go to the weight of the evidence, and if sufficiently egregious may impair the basis of a court\u2019s decision to terminate parental rights.\u201d <em>(In re Crystal J., supra, </em>12 Cal.App.4th at p. 413.) The court then decided that in the case before it, the totality of the evidence (including the reports) was sufficient to support the juvenile court\u2019s findings and judgment. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">When the merits are contested, a parent is not required to object to the social service agency\u2019s failure to carry its burden of proof on the question of adoptability. (See <em>In re Chantal S. </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 196, 210 [51 Cal.Rptr.2d 866, 913 P.2d 1075] [agency has burden of presenting evidence to support allegations and requested orders]; <em>Cynthia D. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 242, 254 [19 Cal.Rptr.2d 698, 851 P.2d 1307].) \u201cGenerally, points not urged in the trial court cannot be raised on appeal. [Citation.] The contention that a judgment is not supported by substantial evidence, however, is an obvious exception to the rule.\u201d <em>(Tahoe National Bank v. Phillips </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 11, 23, fn. 17 [92 Cal.Rptr. 704, 480 P.2d 320]; see also <em>In re Joy M. </em>(2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 11 [120 Cal.Rptr.2d 714]; <em>Robison </em>v. <em>Leigh </em>(1957) 153 Cal.App.2d 730, 733 [315 P.2d 42].) Thus, while a parent may waive the objection that an adoption assessment does not comply with the requirements provided in section 366.21, subdivision (i), a claim that there was insufficient evidence of the child\u2019s adoptability at a contested hearing is not waived by failure to argue the issue in the juvenile court.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">2. <em>The Merits</em></p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">We review the juvenile court\u2019s order to determine whether the record contains substantial evidence from which a reasonable trier of fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>could find clear and convincing evidence that Brian was likely to be adopted, which was the basis for the court\u2019s termination of Cristian\u2019s parental rights. <em>(In re Lukas B., supra, </em>79 Cal.App.4th at p. 1154; \u00a7 366.26, subd. (c)(1).)  \u201cClear and convincing\u201d evidence requires a finding of high probability. The evidence must be so clear as to leave no substantial doubt. <em>(In re Jerome D. </em>(2000) 84 Cal.App.4th 1200, 1205 [101 Cal.Rptr.2d 449].)</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">The issue of adoptability requires the court to focus on the child, and whether the child\u2019s age, physical condition, and emotional state make it difficult to find a person willing to adopt. <em>(In re Sarah M. </em>(1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 1642, 1649 [28 Cal.Rptr.2d 82]; <em>In re Jeremy S. </em>(2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 514, 523 [107 Cal.Rptr.2d 280].) It is not necessary that the child already be placed in a preadoptive home, or that a proposed adoptive parent be waiting. (\u00a7 366.26, subd. (c)(1); <em>In re Sarah M., supra, </em>at p. 1649.) However, there must be convincing evidence of the likelihood that adoption will take place within a reasonable time. <em>(In re Amelia S. </em>(1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 1060, 1065 [280 Cal.Rptr. 503].)</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Such evidence was sorely lacking in this case. The juvenile court did not have the benefit of an adoption assessment report, which would have presented the kind of facts needed to support a finding of adoptability.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Agency relies on the references in the record to adoption assessments conducted on June 20, 2000, and January 10, 2001. However, these references are devoid of any facts about Brian. The June 20 \u201cassessment\u201d merely concluded that Brian was \u201capproved for adoptive services because of lack of parental compliance with the case plan.\u201d This says nothing about his adopt-ability. The January 10 \u201cassessment\u201d concluded only that Brian was \u201cfound to be a proper subject for adoption.\u201d The <em>likelihood </em>of an adoption was not mentioned. Nor did the child welfare worker supply more facts in her testimony at the hearing. She merely reiterated the Agency\u2019s position that Brian was adoptable. While the section 366.26 report did include a bare statement that the chances of adoption were \u201cvery good,\u201d this hardly amounts to clear and convincing evidence. A social worker\u2019s opinion, by itself, is not sufficient to support a finding of adoptability. <em>(In re Kristin W. </em>(1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 234, 253 [271 Cal.Rptr. 629].)</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">The facts about Brian\u2019s age, physical condition, and emotional state that can be gleaned from this record raise as many questions as assurances about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>his adoptability. While he had \u201cblossomed\u201d into a healthy four-and-a-half-year-old boy after his early developmental difficulties, he had only recently learned to dress himself. His speech and gait were still in the process of improving. He was unable to make a statement to his child welfare worker, who relied on facial expressions and gestures to infer that he was happy in his foster placement. This fragmentary and ambiguous evidence was not enough to buttress the Agency\u2019s position that Brian was adoptable. The court erred by finding clear and convincing evidence of adoptability.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">Because we agree with Cristian\u2019s primary claim on appeal, we need not resolve his other contentions, one of which is that the court abused its discretion by denying a continuance.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We note, however, that the evidentiary problems in this case could have been avoided had the court granted the continuance requested by the Agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">The juvenile court\u2019s order is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">Corrigan, Acting P.

The child\u2014\u201d Counsel attempted to terminate the questioning at this point, but the worker continued: \u201cThe child is likely to be adopted at this time. Currently, we do not have an adoptive home; but he is considered adopted\u2014adoptable.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b492-7\"> Section 366.21, subdivision (i) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">\u201cWhenever a court orders that a hearing pursuant to Section 366.26 shall be held, it shall direct the agency supervising the child and the licensed county adoption agency, or the State Department of Social Services when it is acting as an adoption agency in counties that are not served by a county adoption agency, to prepare an assessment that shall include:</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">\u201c(1) Current search efforts for an absent parent or parents or legal guardians.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">\u201c(2) A review of the amount of and nature of any contact between the child and his or her parents or legal guardians and other members of his or her extended family since the time of placement.

Cristian contends he had no notice of the setting order, and therefore should be allowed to challenge it on this appeal. However, the court made no finding on services for Cristian on March 2, 2001, because on June 28, 2000, it had ordered that services need not be provided until his paternity was established. The time for challenging that finding has long since passed.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-11\">Cristian protests that he had no notice of any proceedings before the section 366.26 hearing because the Agency made insufficient efforts to find him. On this record, we are not prepared to say that the Agency failed to make a reasonable effort to locate Cristian, a homeless undocumented alien who did not seek to participate in the proceedings until the last minute. If Cristian desires to pursue a claim for reunification services, he may do so by filing a section 388 petition in juvenile court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
