Defendants move to dismiss the appeal because Muao\u2019s appellate claim is not reviewable at this time. We conclude that under California law, the appeal must be dismissed as premature. Additionally, we reject Muao\u2019s argument that review of the arbitration order is permissible at this time under section 16(a)(3) of the Federal Arbitration Act. (9 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(a)(3).) However, to correct the erroneous dismissal of the action, we remand the matter to the trial court to vacate the dismissal and to dispose of defendants\u2019 motion for a stay of the action pending arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-10\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b949-11\">Muao sued his employer, Grosvenor Properties, Ltd., and certain current and former employees of the company (hereafter referred to collectively as Grosvenor), seeking money damages based on a claim of wrongful termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-12\">In lieu of an answer, Grosvenor petitioned to compel arbitration of Muao\u2019s claims under sections 1281.2 and 1281.7 of the Code of Civil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1088\">*1088</page-number>Procedure<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and moved to stay the action pursuant to section 1281.4. The request for arbitration was based on a written agreement signed by Muao, which provided for arbitration of all claims arising from Muao\u2019s employment with the company, excluding claims of workers\u2019 compensation, unemployment insurance, and any matter within the jurisdiction of the California Labor Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">Muao opposed the petition to compel arbitration, arguing that the arbitration agreement was procedurally and substantively unconscionable, and against public policy. Additionally, Muao argued he had been coerced into signing the agreement. In reply, Grosvenor argued Muao had not established that the agreement violated public policy or was unconscionable, or that the circumstances under which he signed the agreement were oppressive.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">After argument, the trial court granted Grosvenor\u2019s petition to compel arbitration, but severed a provision requiring Muao to pay his own attorney\u2019s fees. At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court asked Grosvenor\u2019s counsel, \u201c[I]s there any reason I shouldn\u2019t dismiss this or stay it? I mean, [the proposed order] provide[s] for dismissal here.\u201d Grosvenor\u2019s counsel replied, \u201cThere is nothing left.\u201d The court then filed an order dated May 23, 2001, which provided: \u201cIt Is Hereby Ordered that [Muao\u2019s] claims are all subject to a valid, enforceable and irrevocable arbitration agreement. Accordingly, the Court grants [Grosvenor\u2019s] petition to compel arbitration, provided that the provision in the arbitration agreement stating that each side bear its own attorneys fees is stricken. Therefore, the above-referenced matter is dismissed.\u201d This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b950-7\">1. <em>Under California Law, the Order Compelling Arbitration Is Not Appealable at This Time</em></p>\n<p id=\"b950-8\">Section 1294 lists the orders and judgments that are appealable in judicial proceedings to enforce arbitration agreements.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>\n                   \u201c[A]n order directing arbitration, not being one of those orders listed in section 1294 . . . , is not appealable.\u201d <em>(Laufman </em>v. <em>Hall-Mack Co. </em>(1963) 215 Cal.App.2d 87, 88 [29 Cal.Rptr. 829, 94 A.L.R.2d 1068].) Such an order is reviewed on appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1089\">*1089</page-number>from the judgment entered after the arbitration is completed or in exceptional circumstances, not present here, by writ of mandate. <em>(Mid-Wilshire Associates v. O\u2019Leary </em>(1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1450, 1454 [9 Cal.Rptr.2d 862].) Because no judgment has been entered on an arbitration award, the order compelling arbitration is not reviewable at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">Muao argues, however, that we may review the order compelling arbitration at this juncture because the order includes a provision dismissing his action at law. It is true, as Muao notes, that the dismissal of the action is deemed a final judgment (\u00a7 58Id) and therefore appealable under section 904.1. However, section 906 provides, in relevant part, that \u201c[u]pon an appeal pursuant to 904.1 . . . , the reviewing court may review\u201d only an \u201cintermediate . . . order . . . which involves the merits or necessarily affects the judgment . . . appealed from or which substantially affects the rights of a party. . . .\u201d Here, the trial court\u2019s order resolved two separate proceedings before it: Muao\u2019s action at law and Grosvenor\u2019s petition under section 1281.2, \u201cwhich is in essence a suit in equity to compel specific performance of the arbitration agreement. . . .\u201d <em>(Brock v. Kaiser Foundation Hospitals </em>(1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1790, 1795 [13 Cal.Rptr.2d 678], fn. and citation omitted, declined to extend on another issue by <em>Engalla </em>v. <em>Permanente Medical Group, Inc. </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 951, 982, fn. 14 [64 Cal.Rptr.2d 843, 938 P.2d 903] <em>(Brock).) </em>\u201c[T]he fate of the action at law has no direct effect on the <em>contractual </em>arbitration proceedings.\u201d <em>(Brock, </em>at p. 1793.) That Grosvenor filed the petition to compel arbitration in lieu of an answer \u201cdoes not mean . . . that the arbitration is a subsidiary proceeding which necessarily falls within the paramount legal action. . . . [W]hen no legal action has been filed, a petition to compel arbitration may nevertheless be filed. (\u00a7 1281.2.)\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1799, fn. 7.) The trial court \u201cretains a separate, limited jurisdiction over the contractual arbitration which was the subject of the section 1281.2 petition: \u2018After a petition has been filed <em>under this title </em>[i.e., \u201ctitle 9\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 1280-1294.2)], the court in which such petition was filed retains jurisdiction to determine <em>any subsequent petition </em>involving the same agreement to arbitrate and the same controversy, and <em>any such subsequent petition </em>shall be filed in the same proceeding.\u2019 (\u00a7 1292.6.)\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1796, italics added.) Thus, the order compelling arbitration cannot be said to involve the merits nor does it necessarily affect the order of dismissal of the action at law. (\u00a7 906.) Additionally, requiring the parties to proceed to arbitration at this time does not \u201csubstantially affect[]\u201d Muao\u2019s rights. (\u00a7 906; <em>Laufman </em>v. <em>Hall-Mack Co., supra, </em>215 Cal.App.2d 87, 89.) Muao may prevail at the arbitration proceeding. If he loses, he can challenge the order compelling arbitration on appeal from any judgment entered on the arbitration award. (\u00a7\u00a7 1294, 1294.2; <em>Laufman </em>v. <em>Hall-Mack Co., supra, </em>at pp. 89-90.)</p>\n<p id=\"b952-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1090\">*1090</page-number>2. <em>Section 16 of the Federal Arbitration Act Does Not Govern the Appealability of the Order Compelling Arbitration in This State Court Proceeding</em></p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">As an alternative basis for invoking our appellate jurisdiction at this time, Muao argues that because the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) governs the arbitration proceeding, an immediate appeal of the order compelling arbitration is permitted under section 16(a)(3) of the FAA. (9 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(a)(3).) We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">It is not disputed that this arbitration proceeding is governed by the FAA; and that had the trial court\u2019s order been issued by a federal court, the order compelling arbitration would be immediately appealable as \u201ca final decision with respect to an arbitration\u201d under section 16(a)(3) of the FAA. <em>(Green Tree Financial Corp.-Ala. v. Randolph </em>(2000) 531 U.S. 79, 84-89 [121 S.Ct. 513, 518-521, 148 L.Ed.2d 373] <em>(Green Tree).)</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> Green Tree, </em>however, does not address the applicability of its holding to state court proceedings governed by the FAA. Therefore, we are not bound to follow <em>Green Tree\u2019s </em>\u201cfederal construction\u201d of what constitutes a \u201c \u2018final decision\u2019 \u201d under section 16 of the FAA for purposes of determining the applicability of that section to this state court proceeding. <em>(Johnson v. Fankell </em>(1997) 520 U.S. 911, 916 [117 S.Ct. 1800, 1803, 138 L.Ed.2d 108].)</p>\n<p id=\"b952-6\">While our courts have not explicitly addressed the applicability of section 16 of the FAA to state court proceedings in California, we do not write on an entirely clean slate. Our Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal, Second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1091\">*1091</page-number>District, Division Five have addressed the applicability of other sections of the FAA to state court proceedings. (See <em>Rosenthal </em>v. <em>Great Western Fin. Securities Corp. </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 394, 405-410 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 875, 926 P.2d 1061] (Rosenthal) [\u00a7 4 of the FAA]; <em>Siegel v. Prudential Ins. Co. </em>(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 1270, 1272-1291 [79 Cal.Rptr.2d 726] [\u00a7\u00a7 10 and 12 of the FAA].) In those cases, the courts determined that our state procedural rules regarding the use of summary procedures to determine petitions to compel arbitration (\u00a7\u00a7 1281.2, 1290.2) and judicial review of an arbitration award (\u00a7 1286.2) are not preempted by the procedural rules in FAA\u2019s sections 4 (jury trial to determine petition to compel arbitration), 10 (grounds for vacating an award) and 12 (procedure for motion to vacate award). <em>(Rosenthal, supra, </em>at pp. 405-410; <em>Siegel v. Prudential Ins. Co., supra, </em>at pp. 1272-1291.) Additionally, before <em>Green Tree, </em>other states with appellate rules similar to ours have held that their state rule, which postponed an appeal of an order compelling arbitration until completion of arbitration, governed in their state court proceedings subject to the FAA even though the order under review would have been immediately appealable under section 16 of the act had the proceeding been in federal court. (See <em>Weston Sec. Corp. v. Aykanian </em>(1998) 46 Mass.App. 72, 74-78 [703 N.E.2d 1185, 1187-1190], review den. (1999) 429 Mass. 1107 [710 N.E.2d 604]; <em>Marr v. Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. </em>(1992) 116 Or.App. 517, 520-524 [842 P.2d 801, 802-805], review den. (1993) 315 Or. 442 [847 P.2d 409].)</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">We acknowledge that section 16 of the FAA<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> does not by its express language limit its application to federal cases.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> More importantly for our analysis, it does not explicitly state that it governs state court proceedings. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1092\">*1092</page-number>Additionally, at issue is not a federal substantive right to appeal, but only the procedural matter of \u201cthe <em>timing </em>of the exercise of the right of appeal from an order compelling arbitration.\u201d <em>(Weston Sec. Corp. v. Aykanian, supra, </em>46 Mass.App. at p. 76 [703 N.E.2d 1185, at p. 1189].) Therefore, \u201c[l]ike other federal procedural rules,\u201d section 16 of the FAA is not binding on our state court proceedings, \u201c <em>\u2018provided applicable state procedures do not defeat the rights granted by Congress.\u2019 </em>[Citation.].\u201d <em>(Rosenthal, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at p. 409, italics in original; see <em>Volt Info. Sciences v. Leland Stanford Jr. U. </em>(1989) 489 U.S. 468, 479 [109 S.Ct. 1248, 1255, 103 L.Ed.2d 488] [FAA does not \u201cprevent[] the enforcement of agreements to arbitrate under different rules than those set forth in the Act itself\u2019].)</p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">Contrary to Muao\u2019s contention, the timing of the appeal of the order compelling arbitration does not \u201cstand \u201c \u2018as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\u201d\u201d [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Rosenthal, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at p. 409.) \u201cThe object that Congress sought to achieve [by enacting section 16 of the FAA] is simply that the aggrieved party ha[s] a right to appeal at some time.\u201d <em>(Marr v. Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co., supra, </em>116 Or.App. at p. 524 [842 P.2d at p. 804].) As we have noted, Muao will have the opportunity to challenge the order compelling arbitration on appeal from the judgment entered on the arbitration award. (\u00a7\u00a7 1293, 1294, 1294.2; <em>Laufman </em>v. <em>Hall-Mack Co., supra, </em>215 Cal.App.2d at pp. 89-90.) Concededly, section 16(a)(3) of the FAA, as interpreted by the United States Supreme Court, \u201cpreserves immediate appeal of any \u2018final decision with respect to an arbitration,\u2019 regardless of whether the decision is favorable or hostile to arbitration.\u201d <em>(Green Tree, supra, </em>531 U.S. at p. 86 [121 S.Ct. at p. 519].) Nevertheless, our state court procedure is consistent with the overall purpose of the FAA to encourage, rather than discourage, the use of arbitration, and \u201cis even more encouraging of the use of arbitration than is the federal procedure.\u201d <em>(Laufman </em>v. <em>Hall-Mack Co., supra, </em>215 Cal.App.2d at p. 89 [\u00a7 1294, requiring dismissal of appeal from order directing arbitration, not preempted by National Labor Relations Act, which would permit immediate appeal of order had proceeding been in federal court]; see also <em>Rosenthal, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at p. 409, fn. 7.) Further, the postponement of this appeal until after entry of judgment after arbitration is \u201cneutral as between state and federal law claims\u201d and will not \u201c \u2018frequently and predictably produce different outcomes\u2019. . .\u201d involving the ultimate resolution of the case. <em>(Rosenthal, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at p. 409, citations omitted; see <em>Johnson v. Fankell, supra, </em>520 U.S. at p. 921 [117 S.Ct. at p. 1806].) We therefore conclude that section 16(a)(3) of the FAA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1093\">*1093</page-number>does not allow us to now review Muao\u2019s substantive challenge to the order compelling arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">3. <em>Trial Court\u2019s Erroneous Dismissal of Action Requires Remand to Trial Court to Vacate Dismissal and for Entry of Proper Disposition of Grosvenor\u2019s Motion for Stay of Action Pending Arbitration</em></p>\n<p id=\"b955-6\">No appeal would have been attempted if the trial court had not dismissed Muao\u2019s action at law.  Grosvenor initially sought the proper relief from Muao\u2019s action at law by petitioning to compel arbitration and moving to stay the action at law pending arbitration. (\u00a7\u00a7 1281.2, 1281.7, 1281.4; <em>Brock, supra, </em>10 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1795-1796.) That Grosvenor thereafter incorrectly requested, and the trial court granted, dismissal of the action at law does not provide a basis for reviewing the order compelling arbitration at this time. Section 906 permits us to \u201creverse or modify any judgment or order appealed from and . . . direct the proper judgment or order to be entered.\u201d Therefore, we exercise our jurisdiction to correct the erroneous dismissal of the action by remanding the matter to the trial court with directions to vacate the dismissal and enter an order granting Grosvenor\u2019s motion to stay the action pending arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b955-8\">The appeal from the order compelling arbitration is dismissed as premature. The matter is remanded and the trial court shall (1) modify the May 23, 2001 order by striking the sentence, \u201cTherefore, the above-referenced matter is dismissed,\u201d and (2) enter an order granting defendants\u2019 motion to stay the action pending arbitration. Each side is to bear its own costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-9\">McGuiness, P. J., and Poliak, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b949-13\">In his notice of appeal, Muao refers to the order by its label, \u201cOrder Compelling Arbitration\u201d and there is no specific mention of the provision dismissing the action. In the absence of prejudice to Grosvenor, we deem the notice of appeal to include the provision dismissing Muao\u2019s action. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 1(a)(2); cf. <em>Holden v.
