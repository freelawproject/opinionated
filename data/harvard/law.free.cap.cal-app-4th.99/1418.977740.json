Mayle </em>(9th Cir. 2002) 283 F.3d 1019. In that decision, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held \u201cthat the California Court of Appeal decisions upholding 25-year-to-life sentences for petty theft were contrary to and unreasonable applications of clearly established Supreme Court law.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1020.) Although the Ninth Circuit applies what it characterizes as the more stringent reasonable-application standard of the Supreme Court law as stated in <em>Andrade v. Attorney </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1422\">*1422</page-number>General of State of California (9th Cir. 2001) 270 F.3d 743,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> it does so in a manner which would invalidate use of petty theft with a prior as a third strike, regardless of defendant\u2019s prior criminal record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-4\">We do not concede that all of the California decisions affirming 25-year-to-life sentences, under California\u2019s \u201cThree Strikes\u201d law, for felony petty theft, including our opinion today, are \u201ccontrary to\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or involve an \u201cunreasonable application\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of United States Supreme Court precedent as to justify a writ of habeas corpus, under 28 United States Code section 2254 <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Our appellate courts have properly considered a defendant\u2019s recidivism, and have properly followed \u201cthe required Supreme Court analysis as enunciated in <em>Rummel </em>v. <em>Estelle, </em>445 U.S. 263 [100 S.Ct. 1133, 63 L.Ed.2d 382] (1980), <em>Solem v. Helm, </em>463 U.S. 277 [103 S.Ct. 3001, 77 L.Ed.2d 637] (1983), and <em>Harmelin </em>v. <em>Michigan, </em>501 U.S. 957 [111 S.Ct. 2680, 115 L.Ed.2d 836] (1991).\u201d <em>(Brown v. Mayle, supra, </em>283 F.3d 1019, 1025.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-5\">Since we do not agree with <em>Brown\u2019s </em>expansive and creative reading of the Supreme Court cases, we reject defendant\u2019s contention that his three strikes sentence for stealing a magazine constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-6\">Procedural Background and Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-7\">Lawrence Romero appeals his sentence of 25 years to life, under Penal Code section 667, subdivision (e),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> on the ground that it constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the federal or state Constitution. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1423\">*1423</page-number>Defendant also contends that the trial court abused its discretion when it refused to dismiss a prior strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-5\">On November 9, 1999, two deputy sheriffs arrested the 38-year-old defendant for stealing a $3 magazine from Jackman Adult Bookstore. A subsequent search of defendant revealed \u201ca glass pipe\u201d and \u201ca cellophane plastic . . . bag containing a white powdery rock substance.\u201d The district attorney charged defendant with the following: (1) felony petty theft, in violation of section 666; (2) possession of a controlled substance, in violation of Health and Safety Code section 11377, subdivision (a); and (3) possession of a smoking device, in violation of Health and Safety Code section 11364. The information also alleged defendant had two prior felony convictions pursuant to section 667, subdivisions (b) through (i).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1233-6\">The jury found defendant guilty of (1) felony petty theft and (2) possession of a smoking device. A mistrial was declared as to count 2, possession of a controlled substance. The court found defendant had sustained two prior felony convictions pursuant to section 667, subdivisions (b) through (i).</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-7\">Defendant filed a motion with the trial court requesting it to dismiss one of his prior felony convictions, pursuant to the court\u2019s discretionary power under section 1385. The court denied the motion. The court stated, \u201cI don\u2019t see anything in Mr. Romero\u2019s Ufe that would lead me to think that he is outside of the spirit of the three-strikes law.\u201d For the offense of felony petty theft, the court ordered defendant to serve, under section 667, subdivision (e), 25 years to Ufe.</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-8\">In sentencing defendant, the trial court properly considered defendant\u2019s recidivism. Since the age of maturity, defendant has been in constant contact with the criminal system. In September of 1981, at the age of 19, defendant was convicted of petty theft and given 24 months\u2019 probation and one day in jail. In 1983, defendant was convicted of first degree burglary.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The probation officer recommended defendant \u201cbe sentenced to . . . [pjrison for the . . . term of two (2) years,\u201d but defendant was given 36 months\u2019 probation and 180 days in jail. Defendant violated probation, and was sentenced to two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1424\">*1424</page-number>years in state prison. In 1987, defendant was paroled, violated parole and was forced to finish the remainder of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-4\">In 1987, defendant was convicted of hit-and-run, battery on a peace officer and obstructing a peace officer. He was given 180 days in county jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-5\">In 1990, defendant was convicted of lewd conduct with a child under age 14.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The probation officer recommended defendant be sentenced to serve six years in state prison, but defendant was given probation and a jail sentence of 270 days. He violated probation and was sentenced to six years in state prison. Defendant was paroled three times, and each time violated parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-6\">Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-7\">Does defendant\u2019s sentence of 25 years to life, under California\u2019s Three Strikes law, for stealing a magazine constitute cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the federal or state Constitution when the defendant has the requisite prior convictions, which include first degree burglary and lewd conduct with a child under age 14?</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-8\">We hold that defendant\u2019s sentence of 25 years to life, under California\u2019s Three Strikes law, for stealing a magazine does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the federal or state Constitution. As noted above, we disagree with the recent Ninth Circuit decisions that purport to eliminate third strike sentencing when the third strike is felony petty theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-10\">I. <em>Application of the Eighth Amendment.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1234-11\">\n<em>A. Does the Eighth Amendment Contain a Proportionality Guarantee?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-12\">The Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution states, \u201cExcessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.\u201d (U.S. Const., 8th Amend.) Defendant contends that the right against cruel and unusual punishment, under the federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1425\">*1425</page-number>Constitution, \u201cincludes a requirement of proportionality.\u201d Whether the Eighth Amendment contains a proportionality guarantee has generated much debate amongst the justices of the Supreme Court. An independent review of the relevant Supreme Court cases will not only assist us in our determination of this issue and case, but also demonstrate that the California appellate court decisions that were reversed in <em>Andrade </em>and <em>Brown </em>were reasonable and supported by relevant decisions of the United States Supreme Court. The Supreme Court cases that are instructive on this matter are <em>Rummel v. Estelle, supra, </em>445 U.S. 263, <em>Solem </em>v. <em>Helm, supra, </em>463 U.S. 277, and <em>Harmelin </em>v. <em>Michigan, supra, </em>501 U.S. 957.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-5\">In <em>Rummel, </em>the defendant was convicted of obtaining $120.75 by false pretenses and sentenced to life imprisonment, under Texas\u2019s recidivist statute. <em>(Rummel v. Estelle, supra, </em>445 U.S. at pp. 265-266 [100 S.Ct. at pp. 1134-1135].) Rummel would become eligible for parole \u201cin as little as 12 years.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 280 [100 S.Ct. at p. 1142].) The defendant had previously been convicted of \u201cfraudulent use of a credit card to obtain $80 worth of goods or services\u201d and \u201cpassing a forged check in the amount of $28.36.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 265-266 [100 S.Ct. at pp. 1134-1135], fn. omitted.) The Supreme Court acknowledged that it had \u201con occasion stated that the Eighth Amendment prohibits imposition of a sentence that is grossly disproportionate to the severity of the crime,\u201d but held that Rummel\u2019s sentence did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 271, 285 [100 S.Ct. at pp. 1137-1138, 1145].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-6\">The Supreme Court reasoned that \u201cthe interest of the State of Texas here is not simply that of making criminal the unlawful acquisition of another person\u2019s property; it is in addition the interest, expressed in all recidivist statutes, in dealing in a harsher manner with those who by repeated criminal acts have shown that they are simply incapable of conforming to the norms of society as established by its criminal law.\u201d <em>(Rummel </em>v. <em>Estelle, supra, </em>445 U.S. at p. 276 [100 S.Ct. at p. 1140].) Under Texas\u2019s recidivist statute, \u201ca recidivist must twice demonstrate that conviction and actual imprisonment do not deter him from returning to crime once he is released.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 278 [100 S.Ct. at p. 1141].) The Supreme Court also noted that \u201cbecause parole is \u2018an established variation on imprisonment of convicted criminals,\u2019 [citation], a proper assessment of Texas\u2019 treatment of Rummel could hardly ignore the possibility that he will not actually be imprisoned for the rest of his life.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 280-281 [100 S.Ct. at pp. 1142-1143], quoting <em>Morrissey v. Brewer </em>(1972) 408 U.S. 471, 477 [92 S.Ct. 2593, 2598, 33 L.Ed.2d 484].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-7\">In <em>Solem, </em>\u201cHelm was charged with uttering a \u2018no account\u2019 check for $100.\u201d <em>(Solem </em>v. <em>Helm, supra, </em>463 U.S. at p. 281 [103 S.Ct. at p. 3005].) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1426\">*1426</page-number>After Helm pled guilty, the court sentenced him to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, under South Dakota\u2019s recidivist statute. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 282-283 [103 S.Ct. at pp. 3005-3006].) Helm had previously been convicted of six nonviolent felonies.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>(Id. </em>at p. 279 [103 S.Ct. at p. 3004].) The Supreme Court stated, \u201cas a matter of principle ... a criminal sentence must be proportionate to the crime for which the defendant has been convicted.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 290 [103 S.Ct. at p. 3009].) The Supreme Court adopted a tripartite test<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> to guide its review of proportionality. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 290-292 [103 S.Ct. at pp. 3009-3011].) Applying the tripartite test, the Supreme Court held that Helm\u2019s sentence was \u201csignificantly disproportionate to his crime, and is therefore prohibited by the Eighth Amendment.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 303 [103 S.Ct. at pp. 3016-3017], fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-4\">The Supreme Court realized that \u201ca State is justified in punishing a recidivist more severely than it punishes a first offender,\u201d but noted that Helm\u2019s status could not be viewed in the abstract. <em>(Solem </em>v. <em>Helm, supra, </em>463 U.S. at p. 296 [103 S.Ct. at p. 3013].) \u201cHis prior offenses, although classified as felonies, were all relatively minor. All were nonviolent and none was a crime against a person.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 296-297 [103 S.Ct. at p. 3013], fn. omitted.) The Supreme Court distinguished <em>Rummel v. Estelle, supra, </em>445 U.S. 263, on the fact that South Dakota\u2019s recidivist statute forbids the possibility of parole. <em>(Solem, </em>at pp. 301-303 [103 S.Ct. at pp. 3015-3017].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-5\">Since <em>Solem, </em>the Supreme Court has spoken on the issue of proportionality and, in doing so, has called into question the validity of <em>Solem. </em>In <em>Harmelin, </em>Justice Scalia delivered the opinion for the court, holding that the imposition of a life sentence without possibility of parole for possession of 650 grams of cocaine did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment. <em>(Harmelin v. Michigan, supra, </em>501 U.S. at pp. 961, 994-996 [111 S.Ct. at pp. 2684, 2701-2702] (lead opn. of Scalia, J.).) The Supreme Court arrived at a disposition of the case, but five separate opinions were filed discussing the issue of proportionality. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 961-1029 [111 S.Ct. at pp. 2684-2720].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-6\">Justice Scalia, joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist, stated, \u201cWe conclude from this examination that <em>Solem </em>was simply wrong; the Eighth Amendment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1427\">*1427</page-number>contains no proportionality guarantee.\u201d <em>(Harmelin v. Michigan, supra, </em>501 U.S. at p. 965 [111 S.Ct. at p. 2686] (lead opn. of Scalia, J.).) Justice Kennedy, joined by Justices O\u2019Connor and Souter, stated, \u201cThe Eighth Amendment does not require strict proportionality between crime and sentence. Rather, it forbids only extreme sentences that are \u2018grossly disproportionate\u2019 to the crime. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1001 [111 S.Ct. at p. 2705] (conc. opn. of Kennedy, J.), citing <em>Solem v. Helm, supra, </em>463 U.S. at pp. 288, 303 [103 S.Ct. at pp. 3008-3009, 3016-3017].) Justice White, joined by Justices Blackmun and Stevens, stated, \u201cBecause there is no justification for overruling or hmiting <em>Solem, </em>it remains to apply that case\u2019s proportionality analysis to the sentence imposed on petitioner.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>(Harmelin, </em>at p. 1021 [111 S.Ct. at p. 2716] (dis. opn. of White, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-5\">Last year, the Ninth Circuit attempted to reconcile the Supreme Court cases on proportionality. <em>(Andrade v. Attorney General of State of California, supra, </em>270 F.3d at pp. 754-759, cert, granted <em>sub nom. Lockyer v. Andrade, </em>supra,__ U.S __ [122 S.Ct. 1434].) In <em>Andrade, </em>the Ninth Circuit held that the \u201cCalifornia Court of Appeal unreasonably applied clearly established United States Supreme Court precedent when it held\u201d that a 50-year-to-life sentence for two petty thefts did not violate the Eighth Amendment. <em>(Andrade, supra, </em>270 F.3d at p. 747.) The Ninth Circuit concluded \u201cthat <em>Solem </em>remains good law after <em>Harmelin, </em>recognizing that we need not consider <em>Solem\u2019s </em>second and third factors if we conclude under the first factor that a defendant\u2019s sentence does not raise an inference of gross disproportionality to the crime. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 758, citing <em>Harmelin v. Michigan, supra, </em>501 U.S. at p. 1005 [111 S.Ct. at p. 2707] (conc. opn. of Kennedy, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-8\">Due to the harshness of the penalty and gravity of the offense, the Ninth Circuit opined that Andrade\u2019s sentence gave rise to an inference of gross disproportionality. <em>(Andrade v. Attorney General of State of California, supra, </em>270 F.3d at p. 761, cert, granted <em>sub nom. Lockyer v. Andrade, </em>supra, __ U.S. __ [122 S.Ct. 1434].) The \u201cunavailability of parole for a half century\u201d made Andrade\u2019s \u201csentence ... the functional equivalent of the sentences at issue in <em>Solem </em>and Harmelin\u2014life in prison without the possibility of parole.\u201d <em>(Andrade, supra, </em>270 F.3d at pp. 758-759.) Andrade was 37 years of age at the time of sentencing. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 759.) He would have to survive an additional 10 years beyond the average life expectancy of 77<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> in order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1428\">*1428</page-number>become eligible for parole. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The Ninth Circuit also opined that \u201cAndrade\u2019s crimes did not pose a \u2018grave harm to society\u2019 . . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1238-4\">More recently in <em>Brown, </em>the Ninth Circuit extended <em>Andrade </em>when it held \u201cthat the California Court of Appeal decisions upholding 25-year-to-life sentences for petty theft were contrary to and unreasonable applications of clearly established Supreme Court law.\u201d <em>(Brown v. Mayle, supra, </em>283 F.3d 1019, 1020.) As can be observed from the various opinions in <em>Harmelin, </em>the Supreme Court law is not \u201cclearly established\u201d within the meaning of 28 United States Code section 2254.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-5\">B. <em>Defendant\u2019s Sentence Does Not Raise an Inference of Gross Disproportionality.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1238-7\">For the sake of argument, we will accept and apply the grossly disproportionate test. If defendant\u2019s sentence does not give rise to an inference of gross disproportionality, we need not conduct an intrajurisdictional and interjurisdictional analysis. <em>(Andrade </em>v. <em>Attorney General of State of California, supra, </em>270 F.3d at p. 758, cert. granted <em>sub nom. Lockyer </em>v. <em>Andrade, </em>supra, __ U.S. __ [122 S.Ct. 1434], citing <em>Harmelin v. Michigan, supra, </em>501 U.S. at p. 1005 [111 S.Ct. at p. 2707] (cone. opn. of Kennedy, J.).) \u201cA proper analysis of gross disproportionality requires a comparison to all three cases: <em>Rummel, Solem, </em>and <em>Harmelin.\u201d (Andrade v. Attorney General of State of California, supra, </em>270 F.3d at p. 766.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-10\">Similar to <em>Rummel, </em>California\u2019s recidivist sentence of 25 years to life is inapplicable unless the criminal defendant has two prior felony convictions as defined in section 667, subdivision (d). California\u2019s recidivist statute does not require actual imprisonment,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> but defendant has served a two-year and six-year state prison term for his prior felony convictions. Defendant, like Rummel, will be eligible for parole. Although defendant will not be eligible for parole until he has served a minimum sentence of 25 years,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> this does not compel a different holding than <em>Rummel. </em>Defendant\u2019s prior felony convictions are much more serious than Rummel\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-12\">Unlike <em>Solem, </em>California\u2019s recidivist statute does not bar the possibility of parole. (\u00a7 667, subds. (b)-(i).) Unlike Helm\u2019s nonviolent felony convictions, defendant\u2019s 1990 conviction for lewd conduct with a child under the age of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1429\">*1429</page-number>14 was a violent crime,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the 1990 conviction being a crime committed directly against a person, i.e., a child. While Helm\u2019s property crimes may affect the wallets of consumers and retailers, defendant\u2019s sex crime affects the mental health of the victim.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Under California\u2019s Three Strikes law, defendant\u2019s first degree burglary conviction constitutes a serious crime.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1239-5\">\n<em>Justice Kennedy\u2019s Opinion in Harmelin</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-6\">The facts of <em>Harmelin </em>are inapposite,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> but the underlying principles and rationale articulated by Justice Kennedy are relevant to defendant\u2019s Eighth Amendment challenge. In <em>Harmelin, </em>Justice Kennedy enumerated several principles that \u201cgive content to the uses and limits of proportionality review.\u201d <em>(Harmelin </em>v. <em>Michigan, supra, </em>501 U.S at p. 998 [111 S.Ct. at p. 2703] (conc. opn. of Kennedy, J.).) First, \u201c \u2018reviewing courts . . . should grant substantial deference to the broad authority that legislatures necessarily possess in determining the types and limits of punishments for crimes.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 999 [111 S.Ct. at pp. 2703-2704] (conc. opn. of Kennedy, J.), quoting <em>Solem </em>v. <em>Helm, supra, </em>463 U.S. at p. 290 [103 S.Ct. at p. 3009].)  California\u2019s Three Strikes law is entitled to great deference, because the Legislature enacted the law and the people of California approved the legislation with the passage of Proposition 184.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1239-7\">The Legislature has provided trial courts and district attorneys substantial discretion to ensure that the three strikes sentence fits the criminal. For example, the district attorney has the discretion to charge petty theft with a prior as a misdemeanor or felony. Upon conviction, the trial court has the discretion \u201cto treat the offense as either a misdemeanor or a felony.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bouzas </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 467, 471 [279 Cal.Rptr. 847, 807 P.2d 1076].) The district attorney \u201cmay move to dismiss or strike a prior felony conviction allegation in furtherance of justice pursuant to Section 1385 . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 667, subd. (f)(2).) The California Supreme Court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Romero) </em>extended this principle when it held that section 1385 allows a trial court, on its own motion, to strike a prior felony conviction in cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1430\">*1430</page-number>brought under section 667, subdivisions (b) through (i). <em>(People v. Superior Court (Romero) </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 497, 504 [53 Cal.Rptr.2d 789, 917 P.2d 628].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-4\">Defendant contends that California has the most severe recidivist scheme in the nation. Justice Kennedy\u2019s second principle proposes \u201cthat the Eighth Amendment does not mandate adoption of any one penological theory. \u2018The principles which have guided criminal sentencing . . . have varied with the times.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Harmelin v.

The Supreme Court has also stated, \u201cEven were we to assume that the statute employed . . . was the most stringent found in the 50 States, that severity hardly would render [the] punishment \u2018grossly disproportionate\u2019 to [the] offenses or to the punishment . . . received in the other States.\u201d <em>(Rummel </em>v. <em>Estelle, supra, </em>445 U.S at p. 281 [100 S.Ct. at p. 1143].)

In <em>Brown, </em>the Ninth Circuit criticizes the California Court of Appeal\u2019s opinion for failing to consider \u201cwhether Brown\u2019s sentence was grossly disproportionate to the crime of petty theft for which he was convicted . . . .\u201d <em>(Brown v.

We choose not to follow <em>Brown </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1431\">*1431</page-number><em>Andrade, </em>because they ignore the salient teachings of the Supreme Court.  A long line of Supreme Court cases have held that recidivism is a proper sentencing factor. (See <em>Solem v. Helm, supra, </em>463 U.S. 277, 296 [103 S.Ct. 3001, 3012-3013]; <em>Rummel </em>v. <em>Estelle, supra, </em>445 U.S. 263, 284 [100 S.Ct. 1133, 1144-1145]; <em>Gryger v.

State of Missouri </em>(1895) 159 U.S. 673, 678 [16 S.Ct. 179, 181, 40 L.Ed. 301].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-5\"><em>Rummel </em>contradicts <em>Andrade's </em>and <em>Brown's </em>assertions that the punishment must be proportional to the \u201ctriggering\u201d felony. In <em>Rummel, </em>the Supreme Court states, \u201csegregation and its duration are based not merely on that person\u2019s most recent offense but also on the propensities he has demonstrated over a period of time during which he has been convicted of and sentenced for other crimes.\u201d <em>(Rummel v. Estelle, supra, </em>445 U.S. at p. 284 [100 S.Ct. at p. 1145].) Supreme Court precedent teaches that when reviewing a recidivist sentence for proportionality, the recidivist sentence must be grossly disproportional to the criminal, not just the \u201ctriggering\u201d felony. This is why <em>Andrade </em>and <em>Brown </em>are wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-6\">Defendant\u2019s case is most analogous to <em>Rummel. </em>Given defendant\u2019s criminal history, including failure to comply with terms of parole, and due deference to the Legislature, defendant\u2019s sentence does not raise an inference of gross disproportionality when defendant\u2019s criminal history is considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-7\">II. <em>Application of California Constitution, Article I, Section 17.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1241-8\">\u201cA sentence may violate the state constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment. . . if '\u201c. . . it is so disproportionate to the crime for which it is inflicted that it shocks the conscience and offends fundamental notions of human dignity.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.]</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-9\">\u201cIn order to determine whether a particular punishment is disproportionate to the offense for which it is imposed, we conduct a three-pronged analysis. [Citations.] First, we examine the nature of the offense and/or the offender, with particular regard to the degree of danger both present to society. A look at the nature of the offense includes a look at the totality of the circumstances, including motive, the way the crime was committed, the extent of the defendant\u2019s involvement, and the consequences of defendant\u2019s acts. A look at the nature of the offender includes an inquiry into whether \u2018the punishment is grossly disproportionate to the defendant\u2019s individual culpability as shown by such factors as his age, prior criminality, personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1432\">*1432</page-number>characteristics, and state of mind.\u2019 [Citation.] Next, we compare the challenged punishment with the punishment prescribed for more serious crimes in the same jurisdiction. And finally, the challenged punishment is compared with punishment for the same offense in other jurisdictions.\u201d <em>(People v. Thongvilay </em>(1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 71, 87-88 [72 Cal.Rptr.2d 738].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-4\">Defendant contends that his sentence of 25 years to life for stealing a magazine, with two nonviolent felony convictions, was cruel and unusual punishment. As discussed in our Eighth Amendment analysis, defendant has improperly characterized his prior felony convictions. Defendant\u2019s record is far from impeccable on the issue of violence. Defendant\u2019s 1990 conviction for lewd conduct with a child under the age of 14 and 1987 conviction for battery on a peace officer demonstrate his violent character.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-5\">\u201c[Defendant\u2019s punishment was imposed because of his recidivism.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cline </em>(1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 1327, 1338 [71 Cal.Rptr.2d 41].) \u201c[S]ociety is warranted in imposing increasingly severe penalties on those who repeatedly commit felonies. If increased penalties do not deter the repeat offender, then society is warranted in segregating that person for an extended period of time. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Martinez </em>(1999) 71 Cal.App.4th 1502, 1512 [84 Cal.Rptr.2d 638], citing <em>Rummel </em>v. <em>Estelle, supra, </em>445 U.S. at pp. 284-285 [100 S.Ct. at pp. 1144-1145].) An overview of defendant\u2019s criminal record illustrates that neither increased penalties nor age has deterred him from committing more crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-6\">At the age of 19, defendant was convicted of petty theft. He was given one day in jail and 24 months\u2019 probation. Less than two years later, at the age of 20, defendant was convicted of first degree burglary, and was given 180 days in jail and 36 months\u2019 probation. Defendant had his probation revoked and was sentenced to two years in state prison. He was paroled, violated parole, and had to finish his term.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-7\">At the age of 24, defendant was convicted of battery on a peace officer and was given 180 days in county jail. Less than three years later, at the age of 27, he was convicted of lewd conduct with a child under the age of 14. Defendant was given 270 days in jail and 60 months\u2019 probation. Defendant had his probation revoked and was sentenced to six years in state prison. He was paroled three times and each time violated parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-8\">The most recent offenses were for petty theft and possession of a smoking. device. These offenses were committed at the age of 38, and after having served eight years in prison and one and three-quarter years in county jail. Defendant\u2019s sentence of 25 years to life is not so disproportionate as to shock the conscience.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1433\">*1433</page-number>The second prong of the <em>Lynch </em>analysis involves a comparison of the \u201cchallenged punishment with the punishment prescribed for more serious crimes in the same jurisdiction.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Thongvilay, supra, </em>62 Cal.App.4th at p. 88.) Defendant compares his sentence with the statutory penalty for second degree murder. \u201cHowever, as the court pointed out in <em>People </em>v. <em>Ayon </em>(1996) 46 Cal.App.4th 385, 400 [53 Cal.Rptr.2d 853], this step is inapposite to three strikes sentencing because it is a defendant\u2019s \u2018recidivism in combination with current crimes that places him under the three strikes law. Because the Legislature may constitutionally enact statutes imposing more severe punishment for habitual criminals, it is illogical to compare [defendant\u2019s] punishment for his \u201coffense,\u201d which includes his recidivist behavior, to the punishment of others who have committed more serious crimes, but have not qualified as repeat felons.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Cline, supra, </em>60 Cal.App.4th 1327, 1338.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-5\">As for the third prong, defendant\u2019s interjurisdictional comparison demonstrates that California\u2019s Three Strikes law is among the most severe recidivist schemes in the nation. \u201cThat California\u2019s punishment scheme is among the most extreme does not compel the conclusion that it is unconstitutionally cruel or unusual. This state constitutional consideration does not require California to march in lockstep with other states in fashioning a penal code. It does not require \u2018conforming our Penal Code to the \u201cmajority rule\u201d or the least common denominator of penalties nationwide.\u2019 [Citation.] Otherwise, California could never take the toughest stance against repeat offenders or any other type of criminal conduct.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Martinez, supra, </em>71 Cal.App.4th at p. 1516.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-6\">Defendant\u2019s sentence of 25 years to life, under California\u2019s recidivist statute, for felony petty theft does not constitute cruel or unusual punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-7\">III. <em>Trial Court\u2019s Refusal to Strike One of Defendant\u2019s Prior Convictions.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1243-8\">Did the trial court abuse its discretion when it denied defendant\u2019s request to dismiss a prior strike in the interest of justice?</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-9\">\u201cTrial courts retain the power to dismiss prior strikes in the interest of justice under section 1385. [Citation.] In exercising their discretion under section 1385, trial courts must consider both the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights and society\u2019s interests, as represented by the People. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Cline, supra, </em>60 Cal.App.4th at p. 1337.) This requires the court to consider \u201cwhether, in light of the nature and circumstances of his present felonies and prior serious and/or violent felony convictions, and the particulars of his background, character, and prospects, the defendant may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1434\">*1434</page-number>deemed outside the scheme\u2019s spirit, in whole or in part, and hence should be treated as though he had not previously been convicted of one or more serious and/or violent felonies.\u201d <em>(People v. Williams </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 148, 161 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 917, 948 P.2d 429].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-4\">A trial court\u2019s decision to strike prior felony convictions is subject to review under the \u201cdeferential abuse of discretion standard. Under that standard an appellant who seeks reversal must demonstrate that the trial court\u2019s decision was irrational or arbitrary. It is not enough to show that reasonable people might disagree about whether to strike one or more of his prior convictions. Where the record demonstrates that the trial court balanced the relevant facts and reached an impartial decision in conformity with the spirit of the law, we shall affirm the trial court\u2019s ruling, even if we might have ruled differently in the first instance. [Citation.]\u201d <em>{People v. Myers </em>(1999) 69 Cal.App.4th 305, 309-310 [81 Cal.Rptr.2d 564].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-5\">Defendant places great emphasis on the fact that the \u201ctriggering\u201d offense was a nonviolent petty shoplifting offense. We cannot, however, ignore defendant\u2019s background, character, or seriousness of his crimes. Defendant has been convicted of a violent felony, a serious felony, and four misdemeanors. He violated parole four times and had probation revoked twice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-6\">Defendant compares his situation to that of <em>People v. Bishop </em>(1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 1245 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 347], where the trial court struck two prior felony convictions in the interest of justice and the Court of Appeal affirmed. A comparison of the cases is of little assistance to the defendant upon appeal. The <em>Bishop </em>holding does not establish that had the trial court denied Bishop\u2019s motion such a decision would have been arbitrary or irrational. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1249-1251.) Rather, the holding only establishes that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in striking the two prior felony convictions. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1244-7\">The Court of Appeal in <em>Bishop </em>indicated that it might have denied Bishop\u2019s motion had it been the trial court. <em>(People v. Bishop, supra, </em>56 Cal.App.4th at p. 1251.) The <em>Bishop </em>court stated, \u201cWhile the People and perhaps even this court may be of the opinion that Bishop appears undeserving of leniency, the paramount consideration is not what the prosecution, defense or appellate court might conclude. Rather, what counts is what the trial court in this case concluded, as expressed by the reasons it stated . . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid.) A </em>comparison only demonstrates that reasonable people might disagree. Defendant has failed to demonstrate that the trial court\u2019s decision was irrational or arbitrary.
