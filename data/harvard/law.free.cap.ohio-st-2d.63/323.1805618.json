See, <em>e.g., State, ex rel. Senn, </em>v. <em>Bd. of Elections </em>(1977), 51 Ohio St. 2d 173, 174; <em>State, ex rel. Abrams, </em>v. <em>Bachrach </em>(1963), 175 Ohio St. 257, 259. Relying on this construction, respondent refused relator\u2019s filings because the original statements of candidacies were not filed simultaneously with the nominating petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">Although strict compliance with the election laws is a necessity, this should not be construed to require more than the statutes themselves mandate. In <em>State, ex rel. Leslie, </em>v. <em>Duffy </em>(1955), 164 Ohio St. 178, 183-184, this court stated that \u201cit is essential, of course, to protect the purity of elections, the cornerstone of free institutions. However, *** courts should be careful not to read requirements into election laws which are not specifically there.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">\u201c * * * [W]here a proposed candidate strictly follows all the requirements stated in the statute governing the candidacy, he is not required to do things required by another statute concerned with a different class of candidates.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">R. C. 3513.257 requires that prospective independent joint candidates for Governor and Lieutenant Governor shall file a statement of candidacy and a nominating petition \u201cas one instrument.\u201d That statute does not require the filing \u201cas one instrument\u201d of petitions for an independent candidacy for President, Vice-President or Senator. Cf. R. C. 3513.05; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number><em>State, ex rel. Senn, </em>v. <em>Bd. of Elections, supra. </em>Respondent erred in requiring more of relator than the statute mandates.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Respondent\u2019s reliance on <em>State, ex rel. Hawkins, </em>v. <em>Board of Elections </em>(1971), 28 Ohio St. 2d 4, is factually misplaced. The relator in <em>Hawkins </em>never timely filed the original statement of candidacy. <em>Hawkins </em>held that the timely filing of the original statement of candidacy is required by R. C. 3513.261. Relator in the instant actions complied with that requirement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">For the foregoing reasons, respondent\u2019s motions to dismiss are overruled and the writs of mandamus are allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">\n<em>Writs Allowed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b378-8\">Celebrezze, C. J., W. Brown, P. Brown, Sweeney, Locher and Dowd, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b378-9\">Holmes, J., not participating.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b378-19\"> Respondent argues that \u201cR. C. 3501.38 (I) prohibits any changes in or additions to the petition after it has been filed.\u201d We find that section to be inapplicable under the facts of these cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
