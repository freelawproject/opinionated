Further, at common law a person can change his name at will if there is no intent to deceive or defraud. 57 American Jurisprudence 2d 282, Section 11; 65 Corpus Juris Secundum 26, Section 11 (2) and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-13\">Even if Fred Curly Morrison also employed the name Fred L. Morrison at certain times, this would not necessarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>invalidate his nomination under the reasoning of the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State relies upon R. C. 3513.06 which requires any candidate who changes his name to circulate petitions with both his former name and his current name and states that failure to so do invalidates such petitions. But, in <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Brushart </em>(1950), 153 Ohio St. 372, this court considered a situation analogous to that <em>sub judice </em>and determined that, where a person signed a declaration of candidacy using a name which he had adopted and by which he had been generally known in the community for years, the fact that during the same time he had used another name on certain occasions did not make such signing a change of name and invalidate his petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Thus, relator could have argued that his use of two names in good faith\u2014even though only one was listed on his petitions\u2014did not disqualify him, if his own statement did not contradict his present stance. It seems that a person\u2019s own statement concerning his true name should be considered as persuasive evidence concerning this factual issue. On March 4, 1980, the relator filed an application for change of voting status, pursuant to R. C. 3503.19, which reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">\u201cI, Fred L. Morrison, who am registered from 120 Price Avenue, City of Columbus, Ohio, have, on 3-4-80, changed my name to Fred \u2018Curly\u2019 Morrison, and desire to be registered for the purpose of voting under said new name.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">Signed <em>Fred Curly Morrison Is/ </em>Present Name</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">Signed <em>Fred L. Morrison Is/ </em>Former Name \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b390-11\">Reasonable minds might reach different conclusions as to what the relator considered his name to be, and, if it was changed, when such change took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-12\">If \u201cCurly\u201d is, in fact, a nickname, this court in a similar situation, in <em>State, ex rel Sterne, </em>v. <em>Bd. of Elections </em>(1969), 20 Ohio St. 2d 41, found no abuse of discretion on the part of the Secretary of State or a board of elections in denying a candidate\u2019s request that her nickname be place on the ballot.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-13\">Ordinarily a decision of a board of elections is final and will be reviewed by this court only to ascertain whether it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>tainted with fraud or corruption or resulted from an abuse of discretion or a clear disregard of the applicable law. <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>State </em>(1932), 125 Ohio St. 387; <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Brushart, supra. </em>None of these grounds for reversing the board is apparent, and its decision must stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">The writ is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">\n<em>Writ denied.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b391-7\">Celebrezze, C.

Brown, Holmes and Dowd, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b391-9\">Holmes, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ADF\">dissenting. I believe that the Franklin County Board of Elections abused its discretion in this matter. I therefore dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-10\">Because of the fundamental importance of the right of the citizens of this state to choose those who will govern, it is incumbent upon administrative boards, as well as the courts, to make decisions which further the informed exercise of that right. The decision of the board in the instant cause hinders, rather than promotes, the voters\u2019 right to make an informed choice between candidates, and, thus, is an abuse of that board\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-11\">It has been agreed to by the parties hereto that relator has used the name of Fred Curly Morrison continuously for the past 40 years, and that there is no misrepresentation, fraud or bad faith in the use of that name by relator. Indeed, the opposite appears to be true.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-12\">Relator has used the appellation \u201cCurly\u201d for many years as a well-known athlete and businessman. That name has, over the years, risen to the status of the publicly-accepted designation for his person. Denying relator the right to appear on the ballot as Fred Curly Morrison does not serve the voters of the 16th Ohio Senatorial District, and has no reasonable basis in logic or law.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-13\">The arbitrary nature of the board\u2019s decision is underscored by the fact that relator does not seek to use his \u201cnickname\u201d in lieu of his given name. He seeks to use both names. Because this would aid the voters in identifying the candidates, and would not mislead them, I believe the board\u2019s decision was without a rational basis, and violates the intent of the election laws of this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>The board has abused its discretion, and the writ should issue.</p>\n<judges id=\"b392-5\">Dowd, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
