While absence of any stated reasons for denial of bond does not support the assumption that the Court of Appeals had no grounds for such denial, <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>McGettrick </em>(1965), 2 Ohio St. 2d 177, we are constrained to look to what was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>available to the Court of Appeals to support a denial in view of the requirements of Crim. R. 46(E) and App. R. 8(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Respondent\u2019s brief filed in the Court of Appeals reviews the arguments made to the trial court opposing the appeal bond upon which the trial court concluded the petitioner was not likely to engage in further criminal conduct. The additional contentions presented in respondent\u2019s brief were statements of the prosecutor alleging generally a pattern of criminal conduct by petitioner and assistance to his brother when he was being sought by police. To support these statements the prosecutor appended a transcript of a conversation among friends of the petitioner, which contains four imprecise and vague references to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">All other risk factors, including petitioner\u2019s age (51), his long time residency and home ownership in Cuyahoga County, his activity in community affairs, his responsible employment, lack of any prior criminal record and a six-months\u2019 minimum sentence, would ordinarily support release on bond with such conditions as the trial or appellate court would deem appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">The prosecutor\u2019s statements plus the transcript are insufficient when considered together with all the positive factors to support a belief of \u201crisk of flight or danger\u201d as required by Crim. R. 46(E)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">This court set a bond of $100,000 for release of petitioner pending the final determination of this cause. That bond is now continued during the pendency of petitioner\u2019s appeal to the Court of Appeals. The writ of habeas corpus is allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">\n<em>Writ allowed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b228-10\">Celebrezze, C. J., Herbert, W. Brown and Sweeney, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b228-11\">Locher and Holmes, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b228-12\">P.

The writ of habeas corpus, in the instant cause, should be denied because it is not the appropriate remedy. Petitioner incorrectly forwarded this matter to this court by a writ of habeas corpus instead of a writ of mandamus directed to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>This court, in <em>Stahl </em>v. <em>Shoemaker </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St. 2d 351, determined that, when extraordinary writs are in question, parties must make their selection of the various writs very carefully and judiciously. In <em>Stahl, supra, </em>at page 354, this court succinctly, but aptly, stated that \u201c[hjabeas corpus is not a substitute for appeal or for a mandamus proceeding.\u201d R. C. 2731.01 defines mandamus as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">\u201cMandamus is a writ, issued in the name of the state to an inferior tribunal, a corporation, board, or person, commanding the performance of an act which the law specially enjoins as a duty resulting from an office, trust, or station.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Petitioner, by his own admission, conceded that the trial court refused <em>in toto </em>to follow the mandates of Crim. R. 46(E) and, rather, deferred a determination on that issue to the Court of Appeals. In his own memorandum opposing the respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss, petitioner stated that \u201c** *the Court may construe Petitioner\u2019s request for relief as a Petition for Writ of Mandamus.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">Upon the rationale propounded by <em>Stahl, supra, </em>the petition for a writ of habeas corpus should be denied due to the inappropriateness of the remedy sought.</p>\n<judges id=\"b229-8\">Holmes, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
