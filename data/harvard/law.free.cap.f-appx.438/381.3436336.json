Valente, proceeding pro se, sued Dayton for breach of contract, promissory estoppel, and various torts. After an extensive discovery period, the district court awarded summary judgment to the University on all claims. Valente now appeals. We affirm the lower court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">At the close of the Fall 2007 Semester, UDSL officials notified Valente that another student had accused him of Honor Code violations during final exams, and that they might summon him for a disciplinary hearing, should the Honor Council\u2019s ongoing investigation reveal probable cause for the alleged offenses. Over the following weeks, the Council researched the complaint, interviewed potential witnesses and gathered relevant documents. After completing this task, the Council members concluded that there was probable cause to believe that Valente violated the Honor Code. In particular, their findings suggested that (1) Valente received test questions for his upcoming criminal-law examination from a classmate who had already taken that exam, and (2) Valente relayed these questions to another student\u2014both in potential violation of the Honor Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">Toward the end of January, the Law School informed Valente of the specific allegations and scheduled a disciplinary hearing for early February. It also provided him a \u201cDiscovery Packet,\u201d which included a summary of the Honor Council\u2019s investigation, a list of potential witnesses (and their expected testimony), and copies of all documents that the prosecution intended to introduce. Upon receiving these materials, Valente sued the University in federal district court, moving to preliminarily enjoin the Honor Council hearing. When the district court denied Valente\u2019s motion, he voluntarily dismissed the case and the hearing continued, albeit a few days delayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">The disciplinary hearing proceeded much like a criminal trial. First, a student prosecutor read the charges against Valente: five separate violations of the Law School Honor Code. Next, the court heard opening statements. Then, during their respective cases-in-chief, both the prosecutor and Valente presented exhibits and interviewed witnesses, whom the other side then cross-examined. Finally, each side offered closing arguments. At the close of the proceedings, a seven-student panel retired for deliberation, then issued a written opinion in which it found Valente guilty of all five Honor Code violations. The Law School, adopting the panel\u2019s recommended sentence, suspended Valente for at least three semesters.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-11\">In July 2008, Valente reinstated his suit against the University, alleging various claims, including breach of contract and several torts. He also sought another preliminary injunction, this time demanding immediate reinstatement to UDSL. The district court held a two-day evidentiary hearing before denying Valente\u2019s motion. It subsequently granted summary judgment in favor of the University. In its opinion, the court held that (1) Dayton had substantially complied with the terms of any implied contract resulting from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>parties\u2019 student-university relationship, and (2) to the extent it could construe Valente\u2019s claims under tort and other theories, those claims were precluded by his contract claims or lacked sufficient evidence. Valente appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Ciminillo v. Stretcher, </em>434 F.3d 461, 464 (6th Cir.2006). Summary judgment is proper \u201cif the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). Once the moving party meets its initial burden, the nonmovant \u201cmust set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\u201d <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322 n. 3, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201cWhere the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party, there is no \u2018genuine issue for trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., </em>475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986) (citation omitted). But in making our determination, we may not \u201cweigh the evidence and determine the truth of [any disputed] matter,\u201d <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 249, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 <em>(1986); </em>we must instead view the facts in the record and all inferences that can be drawn from those facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, <em>Matsushita, </em>475 U.S. at 587-88, 106 S.Ct. 1348.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">Because this action involves an Honor Code dispute between a university and its student, contractual theories underlie our analysis. <em>See Behrend v. State, </em>55 Ohio App.2d 135, 379 N.E.2d 617, 620 (1977) (\u201cGenerally ... when a student enrolls in a college or university, pays his or her tuition and fees, and attends such school, the resulting relationship may reasonably be construed as being contractual in nature.\u201d) Yet, at the same time, \u201c[contracts for private education have unique qualities and must be construed to allow the institution\u2019s governing body to meet its educational and doctrinal responsibilities.\u201d <em>Ray v. Wilmington Coll., </em>106 Ohio App.3d 707, 667 N.E.2d 39, 42 (1995). Courts therefore will not interfere with a private university\u2019s right to make regulations, establish requirements, set scholastic standards, and enforce disciplinary rules absent <em>\u201ca clear abuse of discretion.\u201d Schoppelrei v. Franklin Univ., </em>11 Ohio App.2d 60, 228 N.E.2d 334, 336 (1967) (emphasis added); <em>accord Wilmington Coll., </em>667 N.E.2d at 42; <em>see also State v. Adams, </em>62 Ohio St.2d 151, 404 N.E.2d 144, 149 (1980) (\u201cThe term \u2018abuse of discretion\u2019 connotes more than an error of law or of judgment; it implies that the [adjudicating body\u2019s] attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary[,] or unconscionable.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">B. Breach of Contract</p>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">Valente alleges that, in conducting its disciplinary hearing, the Law School\u2019s Honor Council failed to abide by some of the Honor Code\u2019s terms, thus breaching the University\u2019s contract with him in two ways: first, the Honor Council denied him the opportunity to impeach the prosecution\u2019s student-witnesses; second, it misconstrued the Law School\u2019s \u201cQuiet Period\u201d rule, applying terms explained in a school-wide email from the Registrar, rather than an alternate, oral explanation that Dean Lori Shaw purportedly gave Valente. Valente argues that either of these \u201cerrors\u201d creates an issue of material fact as to whether Dayton breached the contract and thus precludes summary judgment. We disagree. Contrary to Valente\u2019s asser<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>tions, the issue here is <em>not </em>whether the Law School strictly adhered to each of the Honor Code\u2019s procedural rules, or whether it could have provided a better hearing, but rather whether it abused its discretion\u2014whether it acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, or unconscionably. <em>See Adams, </em>404 N.E.2d at 149; <em>Wilmington Coll., </em>667 N.E.2d at 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Addressing Valente\u2019s first point, we note that, although the Honor Code does provide each party the right \u201cto impeach any witness,\u201d the Honor Council President may nevertheless \u201climit the amount of relevant but marginally probative evidence.\u201d Valente states that he wished to introduce details about the prosecutorial witnesses\u2019 own Honor Council hearings\u2014evidence that, in addition to receiving confidentiality protection under the Honor Code, offers little obvious probative value. Valente\u2019s first argument thus gives us no reason to conclude that the Honor Council violated Honor Code procedures, let alone that it abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">We move to Valente\u2019s second contention, which involves the correct interpretation of UDSL\u2019s Quiet Period rule. Prior to the Fall 2007 exam period, the Law School\u2019s Registrar circulated an email to students, reminding them of UDSL\u2019s Quiet Period. As she explained, \u201cAFTER you take [an] exam, you may not discuss the exam OR any legal concepts relating to the course with any member of the UDSL community____If a discussion of [a] completed exam arises, you are to immediately remove yourself from the conversation.\u201d But according to Valente, Dean Shaw told him that students \u201cwere allowed to accept material from [other] students who had taken [an] exam,\u201d so long as \u201cthe student giving the material [did] not alter the material after taking the exam and a student [did] not accept any material he knew to have been altered\u201d by another student after that student had taken the exam. He thus maintains that because he allegedly did not know that the questions he received were actual test questions (rather than hypothetical practice questions), he did not violate the Quiet Period rule, at least as he understood it.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-10\">The terms governing a student-university contract generally reside in the school\u2019s guidelines supplied to students, though the parties may alter these terms through mutual agreement. <em>Bleicher v. Univ. of Cincinnati Coll. of Med., </em>78 Ohio App.3d 302, 604 N.E.2d 783, 787 (1992). But even if we assume that the purported exchange with Shaw occurred, we need not determine whether it displaced the Registrar\u2019s official explanation of the Quiet Period rule, as Valente never raised the issue when given the opportunity to defend his actions during the disciplinary hearing. Instead, this \u201calternate interpretation\u201d argument only surfaced months later, in Valente\u2019s district-court action. Valente essentially faults the Honor Council for overlooking exculpatory evidence\u2014his supposed conversation with Dean Shaw\u2014 <em>evidence that he failed to present. </em>Based upon these facts, we discern no abuse of discretion in the Honor Council\u2019s disciplinary procedures or judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-12\">We accordingly affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on Valente\u2019s breach-of-contract claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-13\">C. Breach of the Duty of Good Faith and Fair Dealing</p>\n<p id=\"b409-14\">Valente also alleges that the University\u2019s actions violated its duty of good faith and fair dealing. This contention has no merit because, excepting insurance contracts, <em>see, e.g., Suver v. Pers. Serv. Ins. Co., </em>11 Ohio St.3d 6, 462 N.E.2d 415, 417 (1984), \u201cOhio courts have been circumspect in allowing tort remedies for breaches of such duties,\u201d <em>In re Commercial Money </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number><em>Ctr., Inc., Equip. Lease Litig., </em>603 F.Supp.2d 1095, 1122 (N.D.Ohio 2009). In fact, when addressing a contractual dispute between a school and its former employees and students, the Ohio Court of Appeals held that \u201c[t]here is no separate tort cause of action for breach of good faith that is separate from a breach of contract claim.\u201d <em>Ne. Ohio Coll, of Massotherapy v. Burek, </em>144 Ohio App.3d 196, 759 N.E.2d 869, 875 (2001). Lacking sufficient grounds to form a separate cause of action, Valente\u2019s second claim thus fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">D. Promissory Estoppel</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Valente next asserts that promissory estoppel should apply to Dean Shaw\u2019s alleged representations about the Quiet Period rule. Though Valente\u2019s brief offers no explanation whatsoever for this argument, we construe his filings liberally because he proceeds pro se. <em>See, e.g., Boswell v. Mayer, </em>169 F.3d 384, 387 (6th Cir.1999). \u201cUnder Ohio\u2019s promissory estoppel doctrine, a promise that the promisor should reasonably expect to induce action or forbearance on the part of the promisee or a third person and ... [that] does induce such action or forbearance is binding if one can avoid injustice only by enforcing the promise.\u201d <em>Andersons, Inc. v. Consol, Inc., </em>348 F.3d 496, 503 (6th Cir.2003) (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">Because Valente does not develop his argument, we can only guess as to how he believes this equitable principle should bear upon the instant action. We presume that he wants the courts to enforce Dean Shaw\u2019s supposed interpretation of the Quiet Period rule, rather than that of the Registrar. Yet even if we assume that Dean Shaw\u2019s statement qualifies as a \u201cpromise,\u201d we do not believe that \u201cavoid[ing]injustice\u201d mandates estoppel; as we discussed earlier, Valente had the opportunity to present this evidence to the Honor Council, but failed to do so. And, as a broader matter, the presence of an enforceable contract between Dayton and Valente generally precludes promissory-estoppel claims relating to the contract. <em>See O\u2019Neill v. Kemper Ins. Cos., </em>497 F.3d 578, 583 (6th Cir.2007) (\u201cIn Ohio, [wjhere the parties have an enforceable contract and merely dispute its terms, scope, or effect, one party cannot recover for promissory estoppel .... \u201d (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)); accord <em>Telxon Corp. v. Smart Media of Del., Inc., </em>Nos. 22098, 22099, 2005 WL 2292800, at *21 (Ohio Ct.App. Sept. 21, 2005). We thus affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on Valente\u2019s promissory-estoppel claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">E. Tort Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">In his original complaint, Valente alleged eight separate tort claims; he preserves four on appeal: breach of fiduciary duty, negligence, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and fraud. As a preliminary matter, \u201cunder Ohio law the existence of a contract action generally excludes the opportunity to present the same case as a tort claim.\u201d <em>Wolfe v. Cont\u2019l Cas. Co., </em>647 F.2d 705, 710 (6th Cir.1981). Because, as we explained, the relationship between a university and its students is contractual, <em>see Behrend, </em>379 N.E.2d at 620, and all of Valente\u2019s claims arise from the same course of events (namely, his suspension from UDSL for Honor Code violations), we could dispose of his tort claims summarily. But, because these claims nonetheless fail on the merits, we address each one briefly.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-10\">1. Breach of Fiduciary Duty</p>\n<p id=\"b410-11\">Valente alleges that in conducting its Honor Council hearing and suspending him, Dayton violated a fiduciary duty that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>it owed to him as a student. The elements for a breach-of-fiduciary-duty claim include the following: \u201c(1) the existence of a duty arising from a fiduciary relationship; (2) a failure to observe the duty; and (3) an injury resulting proximately therefrom.\u201d <em>Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. Sessley, </em>188 Ohio App.3d 213, 935 N.E.2d 70, 83 (2010) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), <em>appeal denied, </em>126 Ohio St.3d 1618, 935 N.E.2d 856 (Ohio 2010). Parties form a \u201cfiduciary relationship\u201d when \u201cspecial confidence and trust is reposed in the integrity and fidelity of another and there is a resulting position of superiority or influence, acquired by virtue of this special trust.\u201d <em>In re Termination of Emp\u2019t of Pratt, </em>40 Ohio St.2d 107, 321 N.E.2d 603, 609 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Although the \u201cfiduciary relationship\u201d definition is somewhat vague, our search of Ohio case law yields no instances where courts have applied it to the university-student context. We find this observation telling, especially because Ohio \u201ccourts have been reluctant to characterize relationships between individuals as being fiduciary in nature, with the obvious exception of those relationships that involve statutorily-imposed duties.\u201d <em>Casey v. Reidy, </em>180 Ohio App.3d 615, 906 N.E.2d 1139, 1145 (2009) (collecting cases). Valente, in support of his argument, cites only one decision\u2014from New Hampshire\u2014which held that <em>\u201c[i]n the context of sexual harassment by faculty </em>to <em>embers, </em>the relationship between a post-secondary institution and its students is a fiduciary one,\u201d because the power differential between students and faculty makes it difficult for students to refuse professors\u2019 unwelcome advances. <em>Schneider v. Plymouth State Coll, </em>144 N.H. 458, 744 A.2d 101, 105 (1999) (emphasis added). Yet this case offers no insight into Valente\u2019s claim, given its limited holding and obvious factual differences. Recognizing the Ohio courts\u2019 hesitancy to impose fiduciary duties outside their traditional contexts, we accordingly see no reason to extend them now.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">2. Negligence</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">Next, Valente argues that Dayton failed to train or supervise its employees and agents, thereby giving rise to a negligence claim. \u201cTo establish actionable negligence, one must show in addition to the existence of a duty, a breach of that duty and injury resulting proximately therefrom.\u201d <em>Mussivand v. David, </em>45 Ohio St.3d 314, 544 N.E.2d 265, 270 (1989). But \u201can action of tort for negligence cannot be maintained unless the defendant\u2019s conduct constituted the breach of a duty imposed by law, <em>apart from it being a breach of an obligation created by agreement of the parties, </em>either express or implied.\u201d <em>Bowman v. Goldsmith Bros. Co., </em>109 N.E.2d 556, 557 (1952) (emphasis added); <em>accord Textron Fin. Corp. v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., </em>115 Ohio App.3d 137, 684 N.E.2d 1261, 1270 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-10\">In support of his negligence action, Valente recites a litany of duties that Dayton supposedly breached. Yet these obligations all arise from Dayton\u2019s Honor Code (one of the sources of terms governing the student-university contract, see <em>Bleicher, </em>604 N.E.2d at 787-88) and mirror the duties that Valente lists in his breaehof-contract claim. Because the duties Valente identifies all arise from his contractual relationship with Dayton, he proffers no grounds upon which to base a negligence action.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-11\">3. Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress</p>\n<p id=\"b411-12\">In his penultimate tort claim, Valente accuses the University of intentionally inflicting emotional distress. In Ohio, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>plaintiff claiming intentional infliction of emotional distress must show the following: (1) the defendant intended to cause plaintiffs emotional distress or should have known that such serious emotional distress would result, (2) the defendant\u2019s conduct was outrageous, extreme, beyond all possible bounds of decency, and utterly intolerable in a civilized community, (3) the defendant\u2019s conduct proximately caused the plaintiffs psychic injury, and (4) the plaintiffs emotional distress was so serious that no reasonable person could be expected to endure it. <em>Talley v. Family Dollar Stores of Ohio, Inc., </em>542 F.3d 1099, 1110 (6th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">The most obvious reason to reject Valente\u2019s emotional-distress claim is that he makes no showing that the University engaged in extreme and outrageous conduct. Quite the contrary, we view Dayton\u2019s stringent enforcement of its academic standards proper, if not commendable. We accordingly affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Dayton on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">4. Fraud</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">Finally, Valente argues that Dean Shaw, in offering her purported \u201calternate explanation\u201d of the Law School\u2019s Quiet Period rule, intentionally defrauded him. The elements of a fraud claim are (1) a misrepresentation of a material fact; (2) made with knowledge of its falsity, or with such utter disregard as to its truth that knowledge may be inferred; (3) with the intent to induce another\u2019s reliance on it; (4) justifiable reliance upon the representation or concealment; and (5) a resulting injury proximately caused by the reliance. <em>Burr v. Bd. of Cnty. Comm\u2019rs, </em>23 Ohio St.3d 69, 491 N.E.2d 1101, 1105 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">Although Valente\u2019s filings provide several cursory allegations, he offers no facts demonstrating that Dean Shaw knew her statements were false, or that she acted with the intent to deceive. <em>See Schwartz v. Bank One, Portsmouth, N.A., </em>84 Ohio App.3d 806, 619 N.E.2d 10, 12 (1992) (\u201c[A] cause of action cannot be classified a tort action simply because the appellant used the term \u2018fraudulently5 in [the] pleading.\u201d). Lacking a showing of scienter, Valente\u2019s fraud claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-10\">For these reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision granting summary judgment to the University on all claims.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b407-8\">.
