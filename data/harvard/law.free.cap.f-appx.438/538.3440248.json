We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence factual findings. <em>Wakkary v. </em>Holder, 558 F.3d 1049, 1056 (9th Cir.2009). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-26\">Sudarto does not challenge the agency\u2019s dispositive finding that his asylum application is time-barred or its denial of CAT relief. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259-60 (9th Cir.1996) (issues not specifically raised and argued in a party\u2019s opening brief are waived).</p>\n<p id=\"A29\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>Sudai\u2019to, born and raised a Muslim, contends he suffered mistreatment as a schoolchild, was threatened for refusing to engage in anti-Christian acts, and fears future harm because he intends to convert to Christianity. Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that, assuming the truth of Sudarto\u2019s testimony, he failed to establish past persecution or a clear probability of persecution. <em>See Nagoulko v. INS, </em>333 F.3d 1012, 1016-18 (9th Cir.2003) (discrimination and harassment due to petitioner\u2019s religious beliefs did not compel finding of past persecution; petitioner\u2019s fear was too speculative to be objectively reasonable); <em>Hoxha v. Ashcroft, </em>319 F.3d 1179, 1182 (9th Cir.2003) (unfulfilled threats constituted harassment rather than persecution). Accordingly, Sudarto\u2019s withholding of removal claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b562-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
