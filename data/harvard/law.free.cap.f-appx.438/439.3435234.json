Lilly was convicted by a jury and sentenced to thirty months\u2019 imprisonment, to be served consecutively to his thirty-month sentence for a violation of supervised release. He appeals a district court order denying his motion to suppress evidence seized from his vehicle. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-11\">On the morning of March 4, 2009, during the course of his routine patrol duty in Mt. Morris Township, Michigan, Officer Michael Veach of the Mt. Morris Township Police Department observed Donald Lilly driving southbound on Neff Road. Officer Veach, who was driving northbound, noticed that Lilly was not wearing a seatbelt and that the windshield of Lilly\u2019s 1995 Chevrolet Suburban was cracked. Having observed these two traffic violations, Officer Veach turned his patrol car around, followed Lilly\u2019s vehicle for several blocks, and signaled for Lilly to stop by activating his siren and overhead lights. The stop occurred in the lefthand lane on Detroit Street, a four-lane road without a shoulder lane. Upon running Lilly\u2019s license plate number through the Law Enforcement Information Network (\u201cLEIN\u201d), Officer Veach learned that the Chevrolet Suburban was registered to Johnnie Brown of Romulus, Michigan, a city approximately 70 to 80 miles away from Mt. Morris Township.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-13\">Officer Veach approached the driver\u2019s-side window. He explained that he had stopped Lilly for the cracked windshield and seatbelt violations and requested Lilly\u2019s license, registration, and proof of insurance. He learned that Lilly resided at the same address as Brown, Lilly\u2019s mother. A LEIN check of Lilly\u2019s name revealed two outstanding arrest warrants in Genesee County for unpaid child support. Officer Veach then called for assistance, and his partner, Officer Clay Hite, responded. The officers asked Lilly to step outside of the vehicle, informed Lilly that he was under arrest for the outstanding warrants, handcuffed him, and placed him in the backseat of Officer Veach\u2019s patrol car.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-14\">After Lilly, the sole occupant of the Chevrolet Suburban, had been placed under arrest, the officers determined that the vehicle should be towed and impounded in accordance with the police department\u2019s routine procedure. Officer Veach testified that, before impounding a vehicle, police department procedure requires officers to conduct a preliminary inventory check in order to protect the vehicle\u2019s property from theft and to protect officers and the impoundment company from allegations of theft. Upon entering Lilly\u2019s car, Officer Veach detected a strong odor of marijuana <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>and found two duffel bags behind the driver\u2019s seat. One duffel bag contained two zip-lock bags of marijuana, each weighing approximately one pound. The other duffel bag contained two rolls of cash totaling $10,067. Officer Veach also found a garbage bag containing 27 zip-lock bags of marijuana, weighing approximately 27 pounds, behind the second-row seats. Following the inventory search, the marijuana and cash were seized from Lilly\u2019s car, which was then impounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">On June 17, 2009, a federal grand jury returned an indictment charging Lilly with one count of possession with intent to distribute marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). The government filed an information on August 3, 2009, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(a), in which it notified the court that Lilly\u2019s prior felony drug convictions for the distribution of cocaine and cocaine base rendered him subject to a maximum sentence of ten years\u2019 imprisonment. On August 13, 2009, Lilly moved to suppress \u201cany and all evidence seized from [his] person or vehicle\u201d on the ground that the officers\u2019 warrantless search of his Chevrolet Suburban violated his rights under the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution. After the government filed its response, the district court held a two-day evidentiary hearing on September 28 and October 16, 2009, concerning Lilly\u2019s motion to suppress evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">At the suppression hearing, Officer Veach testified as to the police department\u2019s procedures for impounding vehicles. He stated that it was \u201croutine policy\u201d to impound a ear when the sole occupant had been arrested; that a \u201cvehicle [was] never left ... on the side of the road or in a parking lot ... due to liability issues\u201d; and that an inventory typically was conducted out of liability and theft concerns. He further stated that impoundment was required in Lilly\u2019s case because Lilly\u2019s car was parked illegally in the lefthand lane of a shoulderless, four-lane road and that parking in a traffic lane \u201cwould be a road hazard.\u201d Although defense counsel questioned the legality of parking on Detroit Street, stating that \u201cthere\u2019s no indication that [someone] cannot park there,\u201d Officer Veach maintained that parking was impermissible because the vehicle would \u201cbe directly in a lane of traffic,\u201d as there was \u201cno shoulder there or anywhere to park a vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">On cross-examination, Officer Veach testified that his patrol car had been equipped with a camera that recorded Lilly\u2019s arrest \u201cfrom the time [he] stopped [Lilly] to the time the vehicle was impounded.\u201d Officer Veach stated that he submitted the tape to Deputy Chief Denny Van Alstein in accordance with department policy and that he \u201cha[d] no idea\u201d whether the deputy chief still had the tape. On redirect examination, however, Officer Veach clarified that the March 4 tape was no longer available; the tapes typically are re-circulated after 30 days, and he \u201cbelieved\u201d the tape had been recorded over. On re-cross-examination, Officer Veach stated that he had spoken with Deputy Chief Van Alstein, who confirmed that the tape had not been preserved. Officer Veach offered no explanation as to why he initially stated that he was uncertain whether the tape was available.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-10\">Lilly also testified at the suppression hearing. He maintained that he had been wearing his seatbelt at all times on March 4, 2009, and that he \u201calways dr[o]ve with [his] seatbelt on.\u201d Lilly stated that, after being placed in a holding cell in the Mt. Morris Township Police Department, he heard a conversation between two unidentified persons. According to Lilly, one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>person asked to review the tape of Lilly\u2019s arrest and, after a period of silence, allegedly stated that Lilly \u201cdid have [] his seatbelt [on].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">After the hearing, on December 7, 2009, a magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation denying Lilly\u2019s motion to suppress on the ground that the officers conducted a lawful inventory search of the vehicle. The magistrate judge noted that the police department\u2019s policy permits impoundment where vehicles (1) are traffic hazards, (2) are abandoned, or (3) require protection from vandalism and theft, and that Lilly\u2019s vehicle satisfied all three requirements. On December 21, 2009, the district court denied Lilly\u2019s nine objections and adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">On March 16, 2010, a jury convicted Lilly of one count of possession with intent to distribute marijuana. On July 16, 2010, the district court sentenced Lilly to thirty months of imprisonment and four years of supervised release, to be served consecutively to his thirty-month sentence in a separate case for violating the terms of his supervised release. <em>See United States v. Lilly, </em>4:02-cr-50047. The district court entered its judgment on July 27, 2010, and Lilly timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">Lilly contends that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence seized during the inventory search of his vehicle. He argues that Officer Veach contravened the police department\u2019s policy governing inventory searches and that the search was conducted for investigatory purposes. In reviewing the denial of a motion to suppress evidence, we review findings of fact for clear error and legal conclusions <em>de novo. United States v. Dillard, </em>438 F.3d 675, 680 (6th Cir.2006). \u201cWhen the district court has denied the motion to suppress, we review all evidence in a light most favorable to the Government.\u201d <em>United States v. Galloway, </em>316 F.3d 624, 628 (6th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-10\">The Fourth Amendment prohibits warrantless searches and seizures. U.S. Const, amend. IV. However, \u201cbecause the ultimate touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is reasonableness, the warrant requirement is subject to certain exceptions.\u201d <em>Brigham City, Utah v. Stuart, </em>547 U.S. 398, 403, 126 S.Ct. 1943, 164 L.Ed.2d 650 (2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). The Supreme Court has long held that a valid inventory search of a vehicle conducted without a warrant does not violate the Fourth Amendment. <em>Colorado v. Bertine, </em>479 U.S. 367, 371-74, 107 S.Ct. 738, 93 L.Ed.2d 739 (1987); <em>South Dakota v. Opperman, </em>428 U.S. 364, 372, 96 S.Ct. 3092, 49 L.Ed.2d 1000 (1976). \u201cInventory searches serve to protect an owner\u2019s property while it is in the custody of the police, to insure against claims of lost, stolen, or vandalized property, and to guard the police from danger.\u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>510 F.3d 641, 650-51 (6th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). In order to be valid, an inventory search must be conducted \u201caccording to standard police procedures\u201d and may not be undertaken \u201cfor purposes of investigation.\u201d <em>United States v. Lumpkin, </em>159 F.3d 983, 987 (citing <em>Florida v. Wells, </em>495 U.S. 1, 5, 110 S.Ct. 1632, 109 L.Ed.2d 1 (1990)); <em>Smith, </em>510 F.3d at 651; <em>accord United States v. Tackett, </em>486 F.3d 230, 232 (6th Cir.2007) (noting that \u201cofficers must conduct a permissible inventory search in good faith, not as a pretext for criminal investigation\u201d). And, we have recognized that a warrant-less inventory search may be conducted only where police have \u201clawfully tak[en] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>custody of a vehicle.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>510 F.3d at 651 (quoting <em>Lumpkin, </em>159 F.3d at 987).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">In this case, the Mt. Morris Township Police Department has issued a policy governing vehicle impoundment and inventory searches. This policy provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-6\">G. INVENTORY SEARCHES</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-7\">1. Inventory searches are exceptions to the search warrant requirement, but are only permitted for the following reasons:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-8\">a. To protect the owner\u2019s property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-9\">b. To protect officers from false claims.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-10\">c. To protect officers from the danger of vehicle contents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-11\">2. Officers may not just routinely impound and inventory any vehicle. The reason for each impoundment should be clearly stated in each report.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-12\">3. Vehicle inventory searches must be conducted pursuant to department procedure regarding the impounding of vehicles. Vehicles may be impounded for one of the following reasons:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-13\">a. Traffic hazard</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-14\">b. Abandoned vehicle</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-15\">c. Protection of the vehicle from vandalism or theft</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-16\">Lilly challenges the validity of the inventory search of his Chevrolet Suburban, contending that Officer Veach violated the police department\u2019s standard procedure in two ways. First, Lilly argues that Officer Veach misstated the police department\u2019s impoundment policy by \u201ctestifying] that it was the routine policy of his department to impound cars any time the only occupant has been arrested.\u201d Second, he argues that Officer Veach failed to state the reasons for impounding Lilly\u2019s car in his report. Based upon these alleged errors, Lilly maintains that \u201cthe search here was conducted for investigation, not inventory^]\u201d and was therefore impermissible under the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-17\">To support his first argument that Officer Veach misstated the police department\u2019s impoundment and inventory policy, Lilly relies upon \u00b6 G.2, which provides that \u201c[o]fficers may not just routinely impound and inventory any vehicle.\u201d Lilly notes that, in contrast to the language of \u00b6 G.2, Officer Veach testified that the police department routinely impounds vehicles after the arrest of the vehicle\u2019s sole occupant. And, Lilly also claims that Officer Veach\u2019s \u201cafter-the-fact justifications ... do not hold up either\u201d because the vehicle was not a traffic hazard, was not abandoned, and did not require protection from vandalism or theft. The district court, however, adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation and rejected the argument that Officer Veach contravened the police department\u2019s impoundment procedure. The court held that Lilly\u2019s vehicle \u201cqualified [for impoundment] under all three prerequisites for towing as laid out by the Mt. Morris Police Department.\u201d Because we review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error, <em>Dillard, </em>438 F.3d at 680, in order to prevail, Lilly must establish that the district court clearly erred in concluding that Officer Veach\u2019s testimony supported at least one ground for impoundment, as stated in \u00b6 G.3 of the police department\u2019s policy. We conclude that Lilly has not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-18\">Lilly contends here, as before the district court, that his car was not a traffic hazard because the \u201cunrebutted defense evidence showed that there were not any \u2018no parking\u2019 restrictions in that immediate area.\u201d The district court rejected this argument, as do we. The magistrate judge, in his report and recommendation, accepted Officer Veach\u2019s testimony that Lilly\u2019s vehicle was a traffic hazard because it was parked in a traffic lane on Detroit Street, a shoulderless, four-lane road. Indeed, Officer Veach stated that, although he could not recall whether the area was marked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>with \u201cno parking\u201d restrictions, \u201c[t]here\u2019s no shoulder [on Detroit Street] or anywhere to park a vehicle. You\u2019d be parked directly in one lane of traffic.\u201d And, the district court, in rejecting Lilly\u2019s objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report, likewise stated that, even if parking was permissible on Detroit Street, \u201cthis fact does nothing to rebut Officer Veach\u2019s testimony ... that the vehicle was a traffic hazard.\u201d In his appellate brief, Lilly has provided no support for his contention that a vehicle cannot be a traffic hazard if parked in an area without \u201cno parking\u201d signs, and we are not aware of any case law that bolsters this argument. Thus, Lilly has not established that the district court clearly erred in finding that Officer Veach complied with standard procedure when Officer Veach determined that Lilly\u2019s vehicle, which was parked in a traffic lane, was a traffic hazard and impounded it. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Brown, </em>91 F.3d 144, - (6th Cir.1996) (unpublished table decision) (noting that an officer\u2019s inventory search complied with standard procedure when the officer impounded a vehicle that \u201cwas stopped in a traffic lane and thus not legally parked\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">Nor has Lilly established that Officer Veach contravened \u00b6 G.2, which prohibits officers from \u201cjust routinely impounding] and inventorying] any vehicle.\u201d When asked on direct examination whether it was \u201croutine policy for [his] department to impound cars when ... the only occupant ... [had] been arrested,\u201d Officer Veach replied, \u2018Yes.\u201d But, notwithstanding this apparent misstatement of the police department\u2019s impoundment policy, Officer Veach\u2019s testimony at the suppression hearing makes clear that he impounded Lilly\u2019s vehicle for reasons permitted under \u00b6 G.3. On cross-examination, Officer Veach testified that he could not leave Lilly\u2019s vehicle on Detroit Street because of liability concerns and because it was parked in a lane of traffic on a busy thoroughfare. And, when asked on re-cross-examination whether someone could park \u201con that area of [Detroit Street],\u201d Officer Veach replied, \u201cNo ... it would be a road hazard.\u201d Thus, contrary to Lilly\u2019s argument, Officer Veach\u2019s testimony supports the district court\u2019s conclusion that Lilly\u2019s vehicle was impounded as a traffic hazard, in accordance with \u00b6 G.3 of the police department\u2019s impoundment policy.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">Lilly\u2019s second argument also lacks merit. He claims that Officer Veach failed to state the reason for impounding Lilly\u2019s vehicle in his report, in violation of \u00b6 G.2, which mandates that \u201c[t]he reason for each impoundment should be clearly stated in each report.\u201d However, as the government notes in its response, Lilly did not object to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation on this basis. Rather, in his eighth objection, which addressed Officer Veach\u2019s alleged failure to abide by the police department\u2019s impoundment policy, Lilly argued that \u201c[t]he government has not established that standardized procedures were followed; rather, Officer Veach followed his own policy of impounding a vehicle anytime the only occupant is arrested.\u201d As the language of this objection makes clear, Lilly did not raise the issue of whether Officer Veach violated the police department\u2019s standard procedure by failing to articulate a reason for impounding Lilly\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>In this circuit, \u201ca party must file objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation with the district court within the time permitted, or else waive the right to appeal.\u201d <em>Vanwinkle v. United States, </em>645 F.3d 365, 371 (6th Cir.2011) (citing <em>United States v. Walters, </em>638 F.2d 947, 949-50 (6th Cir.1981)). \u201c[B]y precluding appellate review of any issue not contained in objections to a magistrate judge\u2019s report, this rule of preservation prevents a litigant from sandbagging the district judge by failing to object and then appealing.\u201d <em>Peoples v. Hoover, </em>377 Fed.Appx. 461, 463 (6th Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, because Lilly did not object to the magistrate\u2019s report and recommendation on the ground that Officer Veach failed to state his reason for impounding Lilly\u2019s car, Lilly is foreclosed from raising this argument on appeal. The district court properly denied Lilly\u2019s suppression motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b468-7\">. Having concluded that the district court did not clearly err in crediting Officer Veach\u2019s testimony that Lilly\u2019s vehicle was a traffic hazard, we need not address whether the district court erred in determining that Lilly\u2019s vehicle was abandoned and required protection from vandalism or theft. Indeed, the police department\u2019s policy on impoundment and inventory searches provides that \u201d[v]ehicles may be impounded for <em>one </em>of the following reasons,\u201d including traffic hazards. It is therefore unnecessary to decide whether Lilly's vehicle met all <em>three </em>reasons for impoundment under \u00b6 G.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
