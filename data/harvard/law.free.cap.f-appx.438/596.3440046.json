Heflin (\u201cHeflin\u201d). Heflin appeals the dismissal of his suit against the County of Los Angeles (the \u201cCounty\u201d) and Sheriff Leroy Baca for failure to state a claim for the state law torts of negligence and violation of mandatory statutory duties. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Reviewing de novo, <em>Harrell v. 20th Century Ins. Co., </em>984 F.2d 203, 206 (9th Cir.1991), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">The facts are known to the parties; we do not repeat them.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">The County is not liable for McClain\u2019s tortious actions pursuant to Cal. Gov\u2019t Code \u00a7 815.2(a) because McClain was not acting within the scope of his employment. According to Heflin\u2019s First Amended Complaint, the assault occurred after McClain drove to another jurisdiction to confront Heflin about a personal dispute. Because McClain <em>\u201csubstantially </em>deviate[d] from [his] employment duties for personal purposes,\u201d the County is not liable. <em>Farmers Ins. Grp. v. Cnty. of Santa Clara, </em>11 Cal.4th 992, 47 Cal.Rptr.2d 478, 906 P.2d 440, 449 (1995); <em>see Van Ort v. Estate of Stanewich, </em>92 F.3d 831, 840 (9th Cir.1996) (holding a county was not liable for \u201c[t]he free-lance criminal exploits of a law enforcement officer\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">The County is also not liable for its negligent hiring and supervision of McClain. California common law holds <em>private </em>employers liable under such theories. <em>Doe v. Capital Cities, </em>50 Cal.App.4th 1038, 1054, 58 Cal.Rptr.2d 122 (1996). But \u201c[i]n California, a governmental entity can only be sued in tort pursuant to an authorizing statute or enactment.\u201d <em>Van Ort, </em>92 F.3d at 840. Heflin points to no statutory language supporting a negligent hiring or supervision claim against a public entity. <em>Id. </em>at 840-41; <em>see also de Villers v. Cnty. of San Diego, </em>156 Cal.App.4th 238, 251-52, 260, 67 Cal.Rptr.3d 253 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">Finally, the defendants are not liable for failure to fulfill a mandatory duty under Cal Gov\u2019t Code \u00a7 815.6. \u201cA plaintiff asserting liability under Government Code section 815.6 must specifically allege the applicable statute or regulation.\u201d <em>Brenneman v. California, </em>208 Cal.App.3d 812, 817, 256 Cal.Rptr. 363 (Cal.Ct.App.1989) (internal quotation marks omitted). None of the provisions that Heflin lists meets the exacting requirements of \u00a7 815.6 liability. <em>See In re Groundwater Cases, </em>154 Cal.App.4th 659, 689, 64 Cal.Rptr.3d 827 (Cal.Ct.App.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">Los Angeles County Code \u00a7 2.34.060 and Cal Gov\u2019t Code \u00a7 1031 are \u201cgeneral declaration^] of policy goals,\u201d and \u201cd[o] not impose a mandatory duty\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 815.6. <em>In re Groundwater Cases, </em>154 Cal.App.4th at 692, 64 Cal.Rptr.3d 827 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-10\">Because CalPenal Code \u00a7\u00a7 13510 and 13523 and Cal.Code Regs tit. 11, \u00a7 9030(b)(1) impose duties only on the Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training, they cannot render the County liable. <em>In re Groundwater Cases, </em>154 Cal.App.4th at 689, 64 Cal.Rptr.3d 827. Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 13522 does require the County to include certain materials in its application to participate in the POST program, but Heflin does not allege that the County failed to fulfill that duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-11\">Cal.Code Regs. tit. 11, \u00a7 9050 requires the County to \u201censure that every \u2018peace officer candidate\u2019 ... satisfies all minimum selection requirements.\u201d But the County has discretion to decide how to satisfy those standards. Cal.Code Regs. tit. 11, \u00a7 9053(b) (\u201cThe use of the [POST Background Investigation] manual is discretionary ....\u201d); <em>see also </em>Cal.Code Regs. tit. 11, \u00a7 9054 (describing no specific procedure for the psychological evaluation). As a result, these regulations do not create the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>sort of ministerial duties that subject a public entity to \u00a7 815.6 liability. <em>Haggis v. City of L.A., </em>22 Cal.4th 490, 93 Cal.Rptr.2d 327, 993 P.2d 983, 987 (2000) (\u201cIt is not enough ... that a public entity or officer have been under an obligation to perform the function if the function itself involves the exercise of discretion.\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b620-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b622-19\">. Because the provisions to which Heflin points do not creates mandatory duties, we do not reach the other elements of liability under \u00a7 815.6.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
