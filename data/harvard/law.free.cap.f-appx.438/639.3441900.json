Petitioner later entered the United States without admission or parole in February or March of 1998. She has not departed from the United States since that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-23\">Because Petitioner is illegally present in the United States after having been previously removed, she is inadmissible under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(C)(i)(II). She argues, however, that she is entitled to a waiver of inadmissibility under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(C)(ii). That section provides an exception to inadmissibility if 10 years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>have passed since the alien\u2019s last departure and if the alien obtains the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s consent to reapply for admission before reentering the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">In light of our decision in <em>Carrillo de Palacios v. Holder, </em>651 F.3d 969 (9th Cir.2011), filed this date, Petitioner is not entitled to a waiver of <em>inadmissibility\u2014nunc pro tunc </em>or otherwise\u2014because, although 10 years have elapsed since she last departed the United States, she did not remain outside the United States for at least 10 years before reentry. We therefore deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">Petition DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b663-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
