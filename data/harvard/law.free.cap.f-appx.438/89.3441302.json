For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-19\">I. <em>PROCEDURAL HISTORY</em></p>\n<p id=\"b115-20\">On December 13, 2005, Sternberg filed an application for disability insurance benefits; she alleged that knee and spinal problems had rendered her disabled since March 18, 2004. A.R. 30. The Social Security Administration denied Sternberg benefits on April 12, 2006, and, after reconsideration, on October 13, 2006. A.R. 32, 38. A hearing was held on March 17, 2008, before ALJ Daniel Shellhamer. A.R. 827. On August 11, 2008, the ALJ issued a decision which held that Sternberg had not been disabled under the relevant sections of the Social Security Act between March 18, 2004, and December 31, 2005. A.R. 13. Sternberg\u2019s request for review was denied by the Social Security Appeals Council. A.R. 5. Sternberg sought review by the District Court. App. 25-27. On September 30, 2010, 2010 WL 3907039, the District Court, in an opinion, affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision. App. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>II. <em>FACTUAL BACKGROUND</em></p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">Sternberg alleges that various knee and spinal problems have rendered her disabled since March 18, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">Sternberg first sought medical help for her knees during or prior to 1998. A.R. 891. On September 28, 1999, Dr. Robert Grossman performed arthroscopic surgery on Sternberg\u2019s left knee. On December 3, 1999, Dr. Grossman performed a similar surgery on Sternberg\u2019s right knee. A.R. 546-49. Dr. Vincent DiStefano treated Sternberg post-operatively. During a visit on September 18, 2001, Sternberg told Dr. DiStefano that an unloader brace had \u201csignificantly helped\u201d her left knee. A.R. 550-58.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">Records from another treating physician, Dr. Mark Seckler, indicate that Sternberg did not show significant improvement from November 13, 2001, to April 2, 2002. Dr. Seckler indicated that Sternberg had degenerative changes, patellofemoral syndrome bilaterally, and medial hemi-joint changes. Sternberg received five Hyalgan injections in each knee between January and April 2002. A.R. 559-69.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">On April 22, 2004, Dr. Seckler noted that Sternberg\u2019s knee problems were \u201cminimal, almost resolved.\u201d A.R. 194. On April 26, 2004, an MRI of Sternberg\u2019s left knee was suggestive of a recurrent tear of the medial meniscus. A.R. 386-87. At another visit on May 4, 2004, Dr. Seckler noted that Sternberg was \u201cvery histrionical\u201d and that \u201c[h]er complaints [were] grossly disproportionate to objective findings.\u201d A.R. 192-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">On July 27, 2004, Sternberg visited Dr. Manuel Banzon complaining of left knee pain. Dr. Banzon diagnosed Sternberg with left medial compartment arthritis. Sternberg received three injections of Synvisc between August and September 2004. On October 12, 2004, Dr. Banzon performed arthroscopic surgery on Stern-berg\u2019s left knee. When Sternberg was discharged from physical therapy in December 2004, records indicate she had \u201cminimal complaints of pain and difficulty\u201d and \u201cexhibited] a good prognosis.\u201d Dr. Banzon noted on January 7, 2005, that Sternberg was \u201cdoing very well.\u201d A.R. 219-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-10\">Sternberg saw Dr. Craig Israelite from August 17 to September 27, 2005. Dr. Israelite\u2019s impression was that of underlying degenerative joint disease of the left knee. A.R. 397-99. On March 9, 2006, Dr. Ronald Bagner examined Sternberg at the request of the Social Security Administration. Dr. Bagner\u2019s impression was of degenerative arthritis of the left knee. A.R. 532-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-11\">Sternberg also alleges spinal pain. In July 2004, Dr. Michael O\u2019Hara diagnosed Sternberg with cervical herniated nucleus pulposus, thoracic myofascitis and lumbar herniated nucleus pulposus. A.R. 19. In July 2004, Sternberg was treated with spinal manipulation under anesthesia. Dr. O\u2019Hara noted that Sternberg\u2019s prognosis was \u201cgood\u201d because of her \u201coverall improvement in function and diminishing pain.\u201d A.R. 195-218.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-12\">Dr. Banzon\u2019s records from September 2, 2004, indicate Sternberg exhibited diminished range of motion in her lower back with spasm in the paralumbar area. Dr. Banzon noted on January 7, 2005, that Sternberg was \u201cdoing very well. She has responded to conservative treatment.\u201d A.R. 755-58.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-14\">In December 2004 and January 2005, Sternberg received lumbar epidural steroid injections. A.R. 510-12. On April 15, 2005, Sternberg underwent lumbar discography followed by a CT scan; the scan showed small disc herniation at L5-S1, disc herniation at L4-5, and annular tears <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>on the right side at L3-4, L4-5 and L5-S1. A.R. 349, 351.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">Sternberg saw Dr. Bruce Rosenblum on June 14, 2005. Dr. Rosenblum\u2019s impression was that Sternberg had clinical lumbar-sacral radiculopathy. After viewing an MRI of Sternberg\u2019s spine, Dr. Rosenblum reported that he was \u201cnot clear where her pain [was] coming from.\u201d A.R. 376-77. On July 13, 2005, Dr. Paul Marcotte reported that Sternberg had a negative leg raising test. A.R. 400-01.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">During an examination on March 9, 2006, Dr. Bagner reported that: \u201c[Stern-berg] ambulates without difficulty. Gets on and off the examining table without difficulty____ Does not use a cane or crutches. Can heel and toe walk.\u201d Dr. Bagner\u2019s impression was of cervical sprain/ strain and lumbosacral strain. A.R. 532-33. On April 10, 2006, Dr. Eden Atienza, a state agency medical consultant, assessed Sternberg\u2019s functional capabilities. Dr. Atienza concluded that Sternberg was capable of light work, including lifting 10 pounds frequently, and sitting and standing for up to 6 hours in an 8-hour work day. A.R. 183-90.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">III. <em>THE ALJ\u2019s DECISION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b117-10\">On August 11, 2008, the ALJ denied Sternberg\u2019s claim for disability benefits. A.R. 28. In so doing, the ALJ followed the five-step sequential analysis required under 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520. Step one of the analysis calls on the ALJ to consider whether the claimant is engaged in substantial gainful activity. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(b). If the claimant is so engaged, then the claimant is not disabled, and the inquiry ends. Here, the ALJ found that Sternberg passed step one because she had not engaged in substantial gainful activity since 2000. A.R. 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-11\">At step two, the ALJ considers whether the claimant suffers from a severe medical impairment. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(c). If not, then the claimant is not disabled, and the inquiry ends. Here, the ALJ concluded that Sternberg had several severe impairments through the date last insured: bilateral knee osteoarthritis, lumbar and cervical degenerative disc disease with radiculopathy, pelvic pain/dislocation, right arm weakness/pain, and rheumatoid arthritis. A.R. 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-12\">Step three of the analysis requires the ALJ to consider whether the impairment is equivalent to or exceeds those impairments listed in 20 C.F.R. Part 404, Sub-part P, Appendix 1. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(d). If so, then the claimant is automatically considered disabled, and the inquiry ends. If not, the inquiry moves on to step four. Here, after comparing Sternberg\u2019s ailments to those listed, the ALJ concluded that Sternberg\u2019s impairments did not meet or medically exceed any of the listed impairments. A.R. 16. Thus, the ALJ moved to step four of the analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-14\">Step four focuses on whether the claimant\u2019s residual functional capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d) sufficiently permits her to perform her past relevant work. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(e)-(f). This first requires the ALJ to determine the claimant\u2019s RFC, which is defined as that which an individual is still able to do despite the limitations caused by his or her impairment(s). <em>Fargnoli v. Massanari, </em>247 F.3d 34, 40 (3d Cir.2001). If, after determining the claimant\u2019s RFC, the claimant is found capable of returning to her previous line of work, then she is not \u201cdisabled\u201d and not entitled to disability benefits. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(e)-(f). Here, the ALJ concluded that Sternberg had the RFC to perform a full range of sedentary work as defined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.157(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Specifically, the ALJ found that Sternberg had relatively minor postural limitations that restricted her to only occasional balancing, stooping, kneeling, crouching, and climbing of stairs and ramps, and precluded her from crawling and climbing on ladders and scaffolds. A.R. 17. However, the ALJ found that Sternberg was unable to perform her past relevant work because it was determined that she had performed it at the medium exertional level. A.R. 26. The analysis thus moved on to the fifth and final step.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">At step five, the ALJ considers whether there is sufficient work available in the national economy based on the claimant\u2019s residual functional capacity, age, and education. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(g). If there is sufficient work available, the claimant is not disabled. Here, the ALJ found that jobs did exist in significant numbers in the national economy that Sternberg could have performed. A.R. 27. Sternberg was therefore not disabled, as defined by the Social Security Act,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> on or prior to her last date insured, December 31, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">IV. DISCUSSION<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">Our review of the District Court\u2019s order affirming the ALJ\u2019s denial of benefits is plenary. <em>Allen v. Barnhart, </em>417 F.3d 396, 398 (3d Cir.2005). However, \u201cour review of the ALJ\u2019s decision is more deferential as we determine whether there is substantial evidence to support the decision of the Commissioner.\u201d <em>Knepp v. Apfel, </em>204 F.3d 78, 83 (3d Cir.2000). Substantial evidence is defined as \u201c \u2018more than a mere scintilla. It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ventura v. Shalala, </em>55 F.3d 900, 901 (3d Cir.1995) (quoting <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971)). Where the ALJ\u2019s findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence, we are bound by those findings, even if we would have decided the factual inquiry differently. <em>Hartranft v. Apfel, </em>181 F.3d 358, 360 (3d Cir.1999). The court looks at the whole record in making such a determination. <em>Smith v. Califano, </em>637 F.2d 968, 970 (3d Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-12\">To show that the ALJ\u2019s finding was not supported by substantial evidence, Stern-berg makes two main arguments on appeal: (1) that the ALJ improperly evaluated the medical evidence; and (2) that the ALJ erred in finding that Sternberg retained the RFC to perform the full range of sedentary work.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>A. The ALJ Properly Evaluated the Medical Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">Sternberg argues that the ALJ committed several errors in evaluating the medical evidence, including that he: (1) discounted, ignored, or misinterpreted compelling medical evidence and instead relied on his own medical opinion; (2) failed to give proper credence to Stern-berg\u2019s subjective complaints of pain; (3) failed to give sufficient weight to Stern-berg\u2019s treating physician; and (4) reached contradictory findings in his decision. We reject each of these arguments because the ALJ\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">1. <em>The ALJ Did Not Improperly Ignore Medical Reports but Reached a Decision Supported by Substantial Objective Medical Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">Sternberg argues that the ALJ ignored or discounted compelling objective medical evidence and instead relied on his own interpretation of the evidence and isolated statements from doctors\u2019 notes. In determining whether a claimant is entitled to disability insurance benefits, we have held that \u201c[ujnless the [ALJ] has analyzed all evidence and has sufficiently explained the weight he has given to obviously probative exhibits, to say that his decision is supported by substantial evidence approaches an abdication of the court\u2019s duty.... \u201d <em>Benton v. Bowen, </em>820 F.2d 85, 89 (3d Cir.1987) (quoting <em>Gober v. Matthews, </em>574 F.2d 772, 776 (3d Cir.1978)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, \u201c[w]here the [ALJ] is faced with conflicting evidence, he must adequately explain in the record his reasons for rejecting or discrediting competent evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 88.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-11\">In arguing that the ALJ disregarded important findings, Sternberg cites the results of several medical examinations from 2004 and 2005.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, the ALJ\u2019s decision thoroughly recounts Sternberg\u2019s medical treatment, including the findings that Sternberg claims the ALJ disregarded.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The ALJ did not ignore this evidence\u2014he explicitly addressed it in his decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-12\">Sternberg further alleges that the ALJ \u201crelied heavily on his own interpretation of the medical evidence and isolated statements in the various doctors\u2019 notes.\u201d Sternberg cites treatment records of Dr. Israelite from July to September 2005, which state the possibility that Sternberg could need a knee replacement sometime in the future. Sternberg claims that the ALJ misinterpreted this evidence in his decision and should not have used it to support his conclusion denying benefits because, \u201cDr. Israelite was not saying that [her] knee was not bad enough for replacement, [but] was merely wanting to put off the inevitable.... \u201d However, Dr. Israelite\u2019s report states that a knee replacement may be needed \u201cdown the road\u201d if Stern-berg\u2019s symptoms \u201cbecome disabling at a much later date.\u201d A.R. 397. Dr. Israelite then strongly recommended conservative treatment. This piece of evidence\u2014a finding in September 2005 that Sternberg\u2019s knee condition was not considered \u201cdisabling\u201d\u2014can fairly be read to weigh against Sternberg\u2019s claim of disability. While Sternberg may disagree with the ALJ\u2019s ultimate conclusion, the ALJ did not ignore or wrongly interpret evidence, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>comprehensively considered the record and balanced all the evidence before him.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">The result of this balancing\u2014the ALJ\u2019s conclusion denying disability benefits\u2014is also well supported by the record, despite Sternberg\u2019s contention that \u201cno objective medical findings\u201d support it.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">In regard to evidence concerning Stern-berg\u2019s knees, in April 2004, near the alleged onset date, Dr. Seckler reported that Sternberg\u2019s knee problems were \u201cminimal, [and] almost resolved\u201d after a course of conservative treatment. A.R. 194. In June 2004, Dr. Seckler explained to Stern-berg that \u201corthopedically she is fine.\u201d A.R. 192. A July 2004 EMG of the left leg was normal. A.R. 357-58. After left knee arthroscopic surgery in October 2004, the record demonstrates that Sternberg had \u201cminimal complaints of pain and difficulty\u201d as of December 2004 and was \u201cdoing very well\u201d as of January 2005 after a course of conservative treatment. A.R. 223, 219. Numerous doctors\u2019 reports throughout 2005 continued to show that Sternberg was responding well to conservative treatment and physical therapy. In March 2006, shortly after the expiration of Sternberg\u2019s insured status, Sternberg underwent a physical examination by Dr. Bagner in which she got on and off the examination table, dressed without difficulty, and was able to walk and stand without a cane or crutches. A.R. 533.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">In regard to Sternberg\u2019s back and neck pain, Sternberg references an April 2004 MRI of her lumbar spine finding a disc herniation. However, this herniation was described by her physician as \u201cvery subtle,\u201d and another MRI in June 2005 showed it was no longer evident. A.R. 382-83. In May 2005, an EMG of the lumbar spine was essentially normal. A.R, 352-56. In July 2005, Dr. Marcotte, a neurosurgeon, observed that Sternberg had a normal gait and saw no indication for lumbar surgery. A.R. 400-01.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-11\">Such evidence constitutes \u201cmore than a mere scintilla\u201d in support of the ALJ\u2019s determination and enough for a reasonable mind to conclude as the ALJ did here. <em>Ventura, </em>55 F.3d at 901. Consequently, there is substantial objective medical evidence in the record to support the ALJ\u2019s conclusion denying disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-12\">2. <em>The ALJ Gave Proper Credence to Sternberg\u2019s Subjective Complaints of Pain</em></p>\n<p id=\"b120-13\">The ALJ determined that Stern-berg\u2019s statements regarding \u201cthe intensity, persistence and limiting effects of her symptoms [were] not entirely credible\u201d because they were not consistent with the objective medical evidence. A.R. 26. Sternberg argues that the ALJ erred in this determination and did not give her claims of subjective pain enough weight. Furthermore, Sternberg argues that the ALJ made \u201cno valid findings\u201d in rejecting her subjective testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-14\">In evaluating a claimant\u2019s subjective complaints, this Court has held that \u201c[i]n order for an ALJ to reject a claim of disabling pain, he must consider the subjective pain and specify his reasons for rejecting these claims and support his conclusion with medical evidence in the record.\u201d <em>Matullo v. Bowen, </em>926 F.2d 240, 245 (3d Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-15\">In his review of the record, the ALJ comprehensively recounted Sternberg\u2019s subjective complaints of pain and properly pointed to evidence in the record to support his conclusion that they were not entirely credible. The ALJ cited evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>that in June 2004, Dr. Seckler described Sternberg as \u201cvery histrionical,\u201d noted that her concerns and complaints were \u201cgrossly disproportionate to objective findings,\u201d and stated that her pain specialist agreed with this assessment. The ALJ also referred to several examinations regarding Sternberg\u2019s back pain in May and June 2005 that revealed essentially normal results, leading Dr. Rosenblum to state he was \u201cnot clear where her pain is coming from.\u201d The ALJ further recounted that Sternberg responded well to conservative treatment and physical therapy throughout 2004 and 2005. Finally, the ALJ cited that in March 2006, shortly after Sternberg\u2019s last insured date, Dr. Bagner indicated that Sternberg was able to walk at a reasonable pace, and in April 2006, a state agency doctor found that the alleged severity of Sternberg\u2019s impairments were not fully consistent with the objective evidence. A.R. 18-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">Thus, the ALJ considered Sternberg\u2019s testimony, weighed it against various conflicting evidence in the record, and specified his reasons for finding her subjective complaints of pain not entirely credible. Consequently, there is substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s conclusion regarding Sternberg\u2019s subjective complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Relatedly, Sternberg claims that the ALJ failed to consider her medication as support for her allegations of pain. However, the ALJ specifically discussed the medications Sternberg received. A.R. 19-22, 24-26. Furthermore, the decision does not rely on a finding that Sternberg received only \u201cconservative treatment,\u201d as Sternberg also claims. The decision considers Sternberg\u2019s surgeries, injections, knee braces, chiropractic treatment, physical therapy, and psychological consultations, in addition to her medications. The ALJ did not disregard the fact that Stern-berg took various medications, or ignore her broader course of treatment, in determining that her subjective complaints of pain were not entirely credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">3. <em>The ALJ Gave Sufficient Weight to the Opinion of Sternberg\u2019s Treating Phgsician</em></p>\n<p id=\"b121-9\">Sternberg argues that the ALJ failed to give sufficient weight to the opinion of one of her treating physicians, Dr. O\u2019Hara. Sternberg specifically points to the fact that Dr. O\u2019Hara, who has treated Sternberg for her back, leg, neck and arm pain since April 2004, wrote in April 2008 that Sternberg \u201cshould be considered unemployable/disabled\u201d due to her condition. A.R. 861. In his decision, however, the ALJ assigned \u201clittle or no weight to the opinion of this treating physician\u201d because it was \u201csimply not supported by the preponderance of the evidence.\u201d A.R. 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-10\">As Sternberg correctly notes, this Court has held that \u201c[tjreating physicians\u2019 reports should be accorded great weight, especially when their opinions reflect expert judgment based on a continuing observation of the patient\u2019s condition over a prolonged period of time.\u201d <em>Plummer v. Apfel, </em>186 F.3d 422, 429 (3d Cir.1999) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). However, an ALJ may reject a treating physician\u2019s opinion on the basis of contradictory medical evidence and \u201cmay afford a treating physician\u2019s opinion more or less weight depending upon the extent to which supporting explanations are provided.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Also, in the case of a treating physician\u2019s opinion regarding a claimant\u2019s ability to work, as Dr. O\u2019Hara gave here, Social Security regulations state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-11\">We are responsible for making the determination or decision about whether you meet the statutory definition of disability. In so doing, we review all of the medical findings and other evidence that support a medical source\u2019s statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>that you are disabled. A statement by a medical source that you are \u201cdisabled\u201d or \u201cunable to work\u201d does not mean that we will determine that you are disabled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(e)(1). Thus, an ALJ does not give any \u201cspecial significance\u201d to a source who gives his opinion regarding a claimant\u2019s ability to work. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(e)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">Here, the ALJ did not act improperly in affording Dr. O\u2019Hara\u2019s opinion \u201clittle or no weight.\u201d There was medical evidence in the record\u2014the objective medical evidence cited above\u2014that contradicted Dr. O\u2019Hara\u2019s opinion. Furthermore, his opinion that Sternberg was \u201cunemployable/disabled\u201d was not entitled to any special significance, as it is a determination explicitly left to the ALJ. The ALJ\u2019s treatment of Dr. O\u2019Hara\u2019s opinion was consistent with the regulations and our prior decisions, and it was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">4. <em>The ALJ\u2019s Findings Are Not Contradictory</em></p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">Sternberg also argues that the ALJ\u2019s findings were contradictory because his decision states that Sternberg\u2019s impairments caused \u201csignificant\u201d limitations on her ability to perform basic work activities, but later refers to her limitations as \u201cslight\u201d or \u201cminor.\u201d There is no contradiction in the ALJ\u2019s statements. In describing Sternberg\u2019s limitations as significant, the ALJ was referring to his finding of Sternberg\u2019s severe impairments. By definition, severe impairments cause significant limitations in carrying out the physical activities that \u201cmost jobs\u201d require, aetivities such as lifting, pushing, and pulling as described by 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1521.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In later describing Sternberg\u2019s limitations as \u201cslight\u201d or \u201cminor,\u201d the ALJ was referring to Sternberg\u2019s limitations for purposes of performing sedentary work, or in other words, her postural, non-exertional limitations. It is not contradictory to state that an individual\u2019s physical limitations are \u201csignificant\u201d in relation to the physical demands of most jobs, but are only \u201cminor\u201d in relation to sedentary jobs. We therefore reject Sternberg\u2019s argument and uphold the ALJ\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-10\">B. The ALJ\u2019s Determination of Sternberg\u2019s RFC Is Supported by Substantial Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b122-11\">Sternberg also challenges the ALJ\u2019s finding that Sternberg retained the RFC to perform the full range of sedentary work. For the following reasons, we conclude that the ALJ\u2019s finding was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-12\">Sternberg argues that the ALJ\u2019s RFC determination was conclusory and unsupported by medical evidence. Specifically, she argues that the ALJ did not consider all the relevant evidence when making the RFC determination. To support this argument, Sternberg cites Social Security Ruling 96-8p, which states that an ALJ must consider \u201call of the relevant evidence\u201d when determining a claimant\u2019s RFC. Moreover, the RFC determination should be accompanied by \u201ca clear and satisfactory explication of the basis on which it rests.\u201d <em>Fargnoli, </em>247 F.3d at 41 (quoting <em>Cotter v. Harris, </em>642 F.2d 700, 704 (3d Cir.1981)).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>As discussed above, the ALJ\u2019s determination was supported by medical evidence, which was cited throughout his opinion. The ALJ gave a thorough recitation of Sternberg\u2019s medical history, including the doctors she saw, the diagnoses they gave, and the treatments they prescribed. The ALJ\u2019s opinion also makes clear how much weight he assigned to each doctor\u2019s assessment. Far from being conelusory, the ALJ cited the opinions and observations of numerous medical professionals to reach his determination, including Dr. Seckler, Dr. Bagner, and Dr. Atienza. A.R. 18-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Accordingly, the ALJ\u2019s determination of Sternberg\u2019s RFC is supported by substantial evidence. In addition, we have reviewed Sternberg\u2019s other arguments and find them unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">For the preceding reasons, we affirm the decision of the District Court in its determination that the ALJ\u2019s finding was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b118-7\">. \"Sedentary work involves lifting no more than 10 pounds at a time and occasionally lifting or carrying articles like docket files, ledgers, and small tools. Although a sedentary job is defined as one which involves sitting, a certain amount of walking and standing is often necessary in carrying out job duties.\" 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1567(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b118-8\">. The Social Security Act requires the claimant to demonstrate an \"inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months\u201d in order to be eligible for disability benefits. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(1)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b118-14\">. The District Court had jurisdiction to review the ALJ\u2019s decision pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b118-15\">. Sternberg\u2019s brief states that the District Court improperly evaluated the medical evidence and erred in finding that Sternberg could perform the full range of sedentary work. This mischaracterizes the nature of our review. As stated above, like the District Court, we independently review the ALJ's decision. Despite this imprecision, Sternberg's brief, in its substantive arguments, makes specific attacks <em>on the </em>ALJ's decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b119-8\">. The cited objective evidence includes: positive straight leg testing in 2004 and 2005, Appellant's Br. 28; findings of neck and lower back problems in 2004 and 2005, <em>id. </em>at 28; and MRIs and X-rays of Sternberg's spine taken in 2004, <em>id. </em>at 29.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b119-13\">. These findings recited by the ALJ include positive straight leg testing, A.R. 20, 22; findings of neck and back pain, A.R. 18-26; and the MRI and X-ray reports on Sternberg's spine, A.R. 18, 21.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b120-8\">. When making a disability determination, the Commissioner will weigh \"all of the evidence\u201d if any of the evidence is inconsistent. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(c)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b122-8\">. In relevant part, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1521 states: \u201cAn impairment or combination of impairments is not severe if it does not significantly limit your physical or mental ability to do basic work activities.... When we talk about basic work activities, we mean the abilities and aptitudes necessary to do most jobs. Examples of these include ... [p]hysical functions such as walking, standing, sitting, lifting, pushing, pulling, reaching, carrying, or handling....\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
