Incorporated (together, the \u201cCompany\u201d), and Vargas\u2019s su<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>pervisor, John Robinson. Vargas commenced this action against defendants on November 5, 2008, alleging disparate treatment and unlawful termination on account of his race, color, and national origin under Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e <em>et seq. </em>(\u201cTitle VII\u201d); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 (\u201c \u00a7 1981\u201d); the New York State Human Rights Law (\u201cNYSHRL\u201d), N.Y. Exec. Law \u00a7\u00a7 290 <em>et seq. </em>(McKinney 2009); and the New York City Human Rights Law (\u201cNYCHRL\u201d), N.Y.C. Admin. Code \u00a7\u00a7 8-101 <em>et seq. </em>Familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal is assumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">We review a grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Weinstock v. Columbia Univ., </em>224 F.3d 33, 40 (2d Cir.2000). Summary judgment is appropriate if there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). In making this determination, \u201cthe court must \u2018assess the record in the light most favorable to the non-movant and ... draw all reasonable inferences in [the nonmovant\u2019s] favor.\u2019 \u201d <em>Weinstock, </em>224 F.3d at 41 (quoting <em>Del. &amp; Hudson Ry. Co. v. Consol. Rail Corp., </em>902 F.2d 174, 177 (2d Cir.1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">Vargas, a Hispanic male of Puerto Rican descent, joined the Company as a research associate in its Fixed Income Division in August 2004. He was transferred to its Investment Grade Sales Group (the \u201cIGSG\u201d) as a credit sales associate in July 2005. Vargas alleges that after the Company appointed Robinson head of IGSG in May 2006, he was subjected to disparate treatment in his employment until his termination on October 17, 2007 as part of a Reduction in Force (\u201cRIF\u201d). At all relevant times, Vargas was the only Hispanic credit sales associate in the IGSG.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-12\">At summary judgment, the district court determined that: (1) Vargas failed to make out a prima facie case of discrimination with respect to his termination claim; (2) the relevant statute of limitations barred all of his pre-termination claims, or alternatively, he failed to establish a prima facie case; and (3) his claims under \u00a7 1981, the NYSHRL, and the NYCHRL were not viable because they were analyzed under the same standards as Title VII.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b33-13\">On appeal, Vargas challenges the district court\u2019s rulings that he has failed to establish a prima facie case of disparate treatment and that all of his pre-termination claims are time-barred. <em>See Patterson v. Cnty. of Oneida, </em>375 F.3d 206, 225 (2d Cir.2004) (defining three-year limitations period in New York for \u00a7 1981 claims); N.Y. C.P.L.R. \u00a7 214(2) (McKinney 2009) (same, for NYSHRL claims). We hold that, timely or not, his Title VII, \u00a7 1981, and NYSHRL claims are not actionable. Although Vargas raises fair issues regarding whether he has shown that defendants\u2019 pre-termination conduct could be considered \u201cadverse employment actions,\u201d and as to the timeliness of his claims under \u00a7 1981 and NYSHRL, for the reasons that follow, we conclude that Vargas\u2019s pre-termination and termination claims fail as a matter of law under Title VII, \u00a7 1981, and the NYSHRL.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-14\">The \u201cultimate issue\u201d in an employment discrimination case is whether the alleged adverse action was motivated at least in part by an impermissible discriminatory reason. <em>Fields v. N.Y. State Office of Mental Retardation &amp; Dev\u2019l Disabilities, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>115 F.3d 116, 119 (2d Cir.1997). Where an employer has proffered a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for an action, a plaintiff will survive a motion for summary judgment only by adducing evidence that would allow a reasonable jury to infer that \u201cit is more likely than not that [plaintiff] was subjected to [that action] based on an illegal discriminatory motive.\u201d <em>Greenway v. Buffalo Hilton Hotel, </em>143 F.3d 47, 53 (2d Cir.1998) (citing St. <em>Mary\u2019s Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, </em>509 U.S. 502, 509, 511, 113 S.Ct. 2742, 125 L.Ed.2d 407 (1993)). In other words, even if the employer\u2019s reasons are rejected, \u201cabsent <em>some evidence </em>that it was motivated by discriminatory intent ..., bad treatment does not establish a violation of Title VII.\u201d <em>Pollis v. New Sch. for Soc. Research, </em>132 F.3d 115, 124 (2d Cir.1997) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">Upon reviewing the record, we conclude that Vargas did not produce evidence sufficient to support an inference that defendants\u2019 stated reasons for them employment decisions were pretextual or that Vargas\u2019s race, color, or national origin was a motivating factor in defendants\u2019 decisions. Vargas contends that he was treated less favorably than other employees, but he does so in conclusory fashion, without offering any concrete evidence to show that any of the purported mistreatment was the result of discriminatory animus. At best, the uniformly race-neutral incidents Vargas points to in the record reflect that Robinson singled him out because he \u201cdisliked\u201d Vargas or his facial hair, or \u201ctreated him badly\u201d due to a \u201cpersonal agenda,\u201d none of which is sufficient to suggest animus motivated by Vargas\u2019s protected status. <em>Idrees v. City of New York, </em>No. 04 Civ. 2197(GWG), 2009 WL 142107, at *10 (S.D.N.Y. Jan.21, 2009); see <em>also Alfano v. Costello, </em>294 F.3d 365, 378 (2d Cir.2002) (holding that \u201csome circumstantial or other basis\u201d is necessary for inference that incidents \u201cneutral on their face were in fact discriminatory\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">With respect to Vargas\u2019s claims under the NYCHRL, however, we find that the district court erred in dismissing them under the same analysis it applied to his federal and state claims. Pursuant to the New York City Civil Rights Restoration Act, N.Y.C. Local Law No. 85 (2005), \u201ccourts [must] be sensitive to the distinctive language, purposes, and method of analysis required by the [NYCHRL], requiring an analysis more stringent than that called for under either Title VII or the [NYSHRL].\u201d <em>Williams v. N.Y.C. Housing Auth., </em>61 A.D.3d 62, 872 N.Y.S.2d 27, 30-31 (1st Dep\u2019t 2009); <em>see Loeffler v. Staten Island Univ. Hosp., </em>582 F.3d 268, 278 (2d Cir.2009) (confirming that \u201cclaims under the [NYCHRL] must be reviewed independently from and \u2018more liberally\u2019 than their federal and state counterparts\u201d) (quoting <em>Williams, </em>872 N.Y.S.2d at 31).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">The district court failed to analyze Vargas\u2019s City claims independently from his federal and state law claims, and we will not resolve these claims in the first instance. Accordingly, we remand the NYCHRL claims to the district court, to consider whether to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over them pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c), and if it decides to do so, to consider the NYCHRL claims under the appropriate standard, separate and apart from the federal and state claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">We therefore VACATE the district court\u2019s judgment with respect to Vargas\u2019s NYCHRL claims and REMAND those claims to the district court to determine whether to exercise supplemental jurisdiction or to dismiss without prejudice to refiling in state court. We AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment in all other respects.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b33-7\">. The standard of proof for claims brought under \u00a7 1981 and the NYSHRL is identical to that of Title VII claims. <em>See Ruiz </em>v. <em>Cnty. of Rockland, </em>609 F.3d 486, 491-92 (2d Cir.2010) (addressing \u00a7 1981 claims); <em>Torres v. Pisano, </em>116 F.3d 625, 629 n. 1 (2d Cir.1997) (addressing NYSHRL claims).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
