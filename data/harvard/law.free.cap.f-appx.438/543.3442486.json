D\u2019Enbeau, Esquire, Deputy Corporation Counsel, Corporation Counsel, Wailuku, HI, Jane E. Lovell, Deputy Corporation Counsel, Deputies Corporation Counsel, Wailuku, Maui, HI, for Defendants-Appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b568-13\">Before: HAWKINS, McKEOWN, and RAWLINSON, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b568-14\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-15\">Appellant Lothar Kuster (Kuster) appeals the district court\u2019s order granting Appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment on Kuster\u2019s claims for relief pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-16\">\u201cTo prevail in a civil action against state actors for the deprivation of rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, a plaintiff must show that (1) acts by the defendants (2) under color of state law (3) deprived him of federal rights, privileges or immunities and (4) caused him damage.\u201d <em>Thornton v. City of St. Helens, </em>425 F.3d 1158, 1163-64 (9th Cir.2005) (citations, alterations and internal quotation marks omitted). Kuster advances four constitutional bases for his \u00a7 1983 action against the individual defendants: (a) violation of his procedural due process rights; (b) violation of his right to substantive due process; (c) violation of his rights to equal protection of the law; and (d) retaliation in violation of his First Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-17\">\n<em>A. Procedural Due Process</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b568-18\">Kuster contends that although he satisfied all the requirements, Appellees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>failed to issue him a building permit, in violation of the Special Management Area (SMA) Rules governing the permit issuance process. <em>See </em>Maui, Haw., Planning Commission, SMA Rules \u00a7 12-202-12. As the reviewing body has discretion to issue a permit, Kuster does not have a protectable property interest in one, and therefore cannot demonstrate deprivation of a federal due process right. <em>See Shanks v. Dressel, </em>540 F.3d 1082, 1091 (9th Cir.2008) (\u201cOnly if the governing statute compels a result upon compliance with certain criteria, none of which involve the exercise of discretion by the reviewing body, does it create a constitutionally protected property interest ... \u201d) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">\n<em>B. Substantive Due Process</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">To assert a substantive due process claim, a party must \u201cestablish that the [government\u2019s] actions were arbitrary and irrational and had no relationship to a legitimate government objective.\u201d <em>City of Los Angeles v. McLaughlin, </em>865 F.2d 1084, 1088 (9th Cir.1989) (citation omitted). \u201cA substantive due process claim does not require proof that all use of the property has been denied, but rather that the interference with property rights was irrational or arbitrary.\u201d <em>Bateson v. Geisse, </em>857 F.2d 1300, 1303 (9th Cir.1988) (citations omitted). \u201cThe irreducible minimum of a substantive due process claim challenging land use regulation is failure to advance any governmental purpose.\u201d <em>N. Pacifica LLC v. City of Pacifica, </em>526 F.3d 478, 484 (9th Cir.2008) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">Kuster failed to demonstrate that the delay in the permit application process was due to arbitrary and capricious conduct. Kuster presented no evidence that the Planning Director responsible for issuance of the permit was aware of Kuster\u2019s contentious relationship with his neighbors or that he would be sympathetic to them while antagonistic toward Kuster. Kuster similarly presented no evidence that the Planning Director even read his letters complaining of delays. Appellees presented evidence that the delay in processing, although regrettable, was due to under-staffing and a backlog. Having failed to provide any evidence to the contrary, Kuster did not raise an issue of a material fact with respect to his substantive due process claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">\n<em>C. Equal Protection</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b569-10\">Kuster contends that he was treated differently than similarly situated building permit applicants. However, Kuster failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact \u201cthat the discriminatory treatment was intentionally directed just at him, as opposed to being an accident or a random act,\u201d <em>N. Pacifica LLC, </em>526 F.3d at 486 (citation, alteration, and internal quotation marks omitted) (discussing the requirements for an equal protection claim premised on a \u201cclass of one\u201d theory), or that he is similarly situated to other applicants who were treated more favorably, <em>see SeaRiver Mar. Fin. Holdings, Inc. v. Mineta, </em>309 F.3d 662, 679 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-11\">The summary of public records proffered by Kuster is not admissible evidence because the underlying documents were not accessible on the referenced website. <em>See City of Phoenix v. Com/Sys., Inc. </em>706 F.2d 1033, 1038 (9th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-12\">\n<em>D. Retaliation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b569-13\">Kuster asserts that the individual Appellees harassed him because he filed a quiet title action and multiple police reports against his neighbors, and sent complaint letters to the County about its permit issuance process. However, Kuster failed to raise a genuine issue of a material fact regarding whether his conduct \u201cwas a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>substantial or motivating factor in the [Appellees\u2019] decision.\u201d <em>Soranno\u2019s Gasco, Inc. v. Morgan, </em>874 F.2d 1310, 1314 (9th Cir.1989) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Indeed, there is no evidence in the record that any government official took affirmative steps to prevent or delay action on Kuster\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">Because Kuster failed to provide sufficient evidence to raise a material issue of fact regarding violation of any constitutional right, summary judgment in favor of the individual defendants was appropriate. <em>See Ove v. Gwinn, </em>264 F.3d 817, 824, (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">Finally, Kuster\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim against the County of Maui fails because absent a constitutional violation, Kuster cannot maintain his claim against the government entity. <em>See Simmons v. Navajo Cnty., </em>609 F.3d 1011, 1021 (9th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b568-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
