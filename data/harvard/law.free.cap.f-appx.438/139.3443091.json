He contends that the District Court erred by failing to find a due process violation in the eleven-year delay between the time of the commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>of the relevant crime and his arrest and prosecution. We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Because we write solely for the benefit of the parties who are familiar with the factual context and procedural history of this case, we recite only the facts relevant to our analysis. After Snyder\u2019s wife and infant son perished in a fire on July 2, 1982, the local coroner determined the manner of death to be criminal homicide, but a grand jury declined to issue any indictments and several consecutive district attorneys decided against further investigating or prosecuting Snyder for the deaths. In 1992, a new district attorney restarted the investigation, conducting interviews with eighty previously unquestioned individuals and gathering new physical evidence and expert testimony. As a result of the renewed investigation, on September 8, 1998, the Commonwealth issued a criminal complaint charging Snyder with arson and two counts of murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">After a jury trial, Snyder was convicted on the charges in the Luzerne County Court of Common Pleas, but on appeal, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court concluded that the lengthy delay actually prejudiced Snyder\u2019s ability to present a defense; the Court instructed the trial court to conduct a hearing into whether the Commonwealth possessed a valid justification for the extensive passage of time. On remand, the trial court heard testimony from each of the district attorneys who served during the relevant time and from police investigators, who represented that the investigatory lapse prior to 1993 was unrelated to the purpose of gaining a tactical advantage and was motivated by prosecutorial balancing of competing interests and limited resources. The testimony further demon-stated that after reappraisal of the case by a new district attorney, however, a restarted investigation yielded previously-undiscovered and compelling evidence, which served as the basis for Snyder\u2019s ultimate arrest. At the conclusion of the evidentiary hearing, the trial court found the Commonwealth\u2019s justification for the delayed arrest of Snyder to be valid and proper, and the Superior Court of Pennsylvania, sitting <em>en banc, </em>affirmed this judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-10\">Snyder then filed a Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus before the District Court raising due process and ineffective assistance of counsel claims; the Court held oral argument on April 20, 2010. The District Court subsequently denied Snyder\u2019s Petition, but granted a certificate of appealability on Snyder\u2019s claim that the pre-trial delay violated his due process rights.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b164-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-12\">\u201cIn reviewing on appeal a federal habeas judgment, we exercise plenary review over the district court\u2019s legal conclusions and apply a clearly erroneous standard to its findings of fact.\u201d <em>Kumarasamy v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>453 F.3d 169, 172 (3d Cir.2006) (citation, quotations &amp; alteration omitted). We will affirm the denial of Snyder\u2019s Petition for substantially the same reasons as set forth by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-13\">Our consideration of Snyder\u2019s petition is governed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 <em>et seq., </em>which provides that where a petitioner\u2019s claim has been adjudicated on the merits in state court, \u201chabeas relief is precluded unless the state court\u2019s decision was (1) \u2018contrary to, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States\u2019; or (2) Vas based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u2019 \u201d <em>Williams v. Beard, </em>637 F.3d 195, 204 (3d Cir.2011) (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)). The terms \u201ccontrary to\u201d and \u201cunreasonable application of [law]\u201d are afforded independent meaning: the former prong applies when \u201c\u2018the state court reaches a conclusion opposite to the Supreme Court\u2019s own conclusion on a question of law or decides the case differently [on] a set of materially indistinguishable facts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Adamson v. Cathel, </em>633 F.3d 248, 255 (3d Cir.2011) (quoting <em>McMullen v. Tennis, </em>562 F.3d 231, 236 (3d Cir.2009)). The \u201cunreasonable application\u201d prong governs when a \u201c\u2018state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from [the Supreme] Court\u2019s decisions 'but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Wiggins v. Smith, </em>539 U.S. 510, 520, 123 S.Ct. 2527, 156 L.Ed.2d 471 (2003)). Importantly, \u201c\u2018an <em>unreasonable application of federal law is different from an incorrect </em>application of federal law,\u2019 \u201d <em>Renico v. Lett, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 1855, 1862, 176 L.Ed.2d 678 (2010) (quoting <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 410, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000)) (emphasis in original), and \u201cwe are not authorized to grant <em>habeas corpus </em>relief simply because we disagree with the state court\u2019s decision or because we would have reached a different result if left to our own devices.\u201d <em>Outten v. Kearney, </em>464 F.3d 401, 414 (3d Cir.2006) (citation <em>&amp; </em>quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">The relevant \u201cclearly established Federal law\u201d governing Snyder\u2019s claim that a lengthy pre-indictment delay violated his due process right to a fair trial was explicated by the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>United States v. Lovasco, </em>431 U.S. 783, 789, 97 S.Ct. 2044, 52 L.Ed.2d 752 (1977), and <em>United States v. Marion, </em>404 U.S. 307, 325, 92 S.Ct. 455, 30 L.Ed.2d 468 (1971). Under <em>Lovasco </em>and <em>Marion, </em>a petitioner \u201ccan make out a claim under the Due Process Clause only if he can show both (1) that the delay between the crime and the federal indictment actually prejudiced his defense; and (2) that the government deliberately delayed bringing the indictment in order to obtain an improper tactical advantage or to harass him.\u201d <em>United States v. Beckett, </em>208 F.3d 140, 150-51 (3d Cir.2000) (citing <em>Marion, </em>404 U.S. at 325, 92 S.Ct. 455, and <em>Lovasco, </em>431 U.S. at 789-90, 97 S.Ct. 2044). Not \u201cevery delay-caused detriment to a defendant\u2019s case should abort a criminal prosecution,\u201d Mar<em>ion, </em>404 U.S. at 324-25, 92 S.Ct. 455, and \u201cthe Due Process Clause does not permit courts to abort criminal prosecutions simply because they disagree with a prosecutor\u2019s judgment as to when to seek an indictment,\u201d <em>Lovasco, </em>431 U.S. at 790, 97 S.Ct. 2044. Rather, \u201cthe due process inquiry must consider the reasons for the delay as well as the prejudice to the accused,\u201d such that no deviation from \u201cfundamental conceptions of justice\u201d is evidenced when a prosecutor \u201crefuses to seek indictments until he is completely satisfied that he should prosecute and will be able promptly to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 790, 795, 97 S.Ct. 2044. \u201cInvestigative delay is fundamentally unlike delay undertaken by the Government solely \u2018to gain tactical advantage over the accused,\u2019 \u201d and does not deprive a defendant of due process even if he is \u201csomewhat prejudiced by the lapse of time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 795-96, 97 S.Ct. 2044 (quoting <em>Marion, </em>404 U.S. at 324, 92 S.Ct. 455).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">Here, Snyder concedes that he \u201cwas unable to prove a delay which was <em>deliberately caused </em>so as to gain a tactical advantage over him,\u201d but argues that this absence is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>\u201cnot fatal to his claim.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Br. 9 (emphasis added).) He urges instead that where actual prejudice is confirmed, any subsequent exploitation of the delay\u2014regardless of the root cause of the delay in the first instance\u2014violates due process. <em>(Id.) </em>We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">As the District Court discussed, the state trial and appellate courts properly identified the applicable two-prong analysis called for by <em>Lovasco </em>and <em>Marion </em>in answering the question of whether Snyder had been deprived of due process by a prosecutorial delay. (App\u2019x 18-19.) The courts acknowledged that the \u201cdelay in prosecution did result in actual prejudice to [Snyder],\u201d satisfying the first prong of the analysis. (App\u2019x 19.) At the same time, the state courts correctly observed that apart from a demonstration of actual prejudice, the applicable caselaw likewise requires that the delay be motivated by an intent to gain an unfair tactical advantage over the defendant. In this regard, the Superior Court concluded that the Commonwealth\u2019s justifications for the delay were devoid of any deliberate intent to tactically undermine Snyder\u2019s defense, and, therefore, did not rise to the prohibited level of \u201cpurposeful shelving of a case to gain advantage\u201d or \u201coffend constitutional standards.\u201d <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">The Superior Court\u2019s reasoning aligns with the Supreme Court\u2019s governing precedent that due process is violated only where the government deliberately delays an indictment with the purpose of tactically disadvantaging or harassing a petitioner. Snyder failed to show that the government\u2019s investigatory delay violated this prong of the analysis by \u201cdelaying] the indictment deliberately to harass him or to gain some improper advantage.\u201d <em>Beckett, </em>208 F.3d at 151. The state court did not \u201c[r]each a conclusion opposite to the Supreme Court\u2019s own conclusion on a question of law,\u201d nor did it \u201cidentify[] the correct governing legal principle ... but unreasonably appl[y] that principle to the facts.\u201d <em>Adamson, </em>633 F.3d at 255. Hence, under our \u201chighly deferential standard for evaluating state-court rulings,\u201d <em>Renico, </em>130 S.Ct. at 1862, we cannot say that this ruling was either \u201ccontrary to\u201d nor an \u201cunreasonable application of federal law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of Snyder\u2019s Petition for a Writ of Habeas Corpus.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b164-7\">. The District Court exercised jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2241 and 2254.
