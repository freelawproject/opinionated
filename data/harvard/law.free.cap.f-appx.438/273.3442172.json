We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the AP<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>PEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir.
