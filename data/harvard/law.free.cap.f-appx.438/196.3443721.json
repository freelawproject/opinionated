Cabey pleaded guilty but reserved his right to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress evidence seized from his vehicle after an investigatory stop. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-17\">This court reviews factual findings underlying the district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress for clear error and legal conclusions de novo. <em>United States v. Blake, </em>571 F.3d 331, 338 (4th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 1104, 175 L.Ed.2d 919 (2010). A factual finding is clearly erroneous if this court \u201con the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Harvey, </em>532 F.3d 326, 337 (4th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). However, \u201cif the district court\u2019s account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety,\u201d the court will not reverse the district court\u2019s finding even if it would have \u201cdecided the fact differently.\u201d <em>United States v. Stevenson, </em>396 F.3d 538, 542 (4th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted). In other words, when two views of the evidence are permissible, \u201cthe district court\u2019s choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-20\">We have reviewed the transcript of the hearing on the motion to suppress, the district court\u2019s memorandum opinion and order denying the motion, and the parties\u2019 briefs and joint appendix. Having reviewed these materials, we conclude that the district court did not err in denying the motion to suppress. We therefore affirm the judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-21\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
