Williams contends that the government breached his plea agreement by failing to recommend a sentence at the low end of the applicable guidelines range. Williams requests that we vacate his sentence, remand his case for re-sentencing before a different judge, and that we order the government to fulfill its obligations under the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-11\">We ordinarily review <em>de novo </em>whether the government has breached a plea agreement. <em>United States v. Al-Arian, </em>514 F.3d 1184, 1191 (11th Cir.2008). However, because Williams failed to object at sentencing to the government\u2019s violation of his plea agreement, we review his claim only for plain error. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1428-29, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). For this Court to correct an error under plain error review, \u201c(1) there must be error; (2) the error must be plain; (3) the error must affect the appellant\u2019s substantial rights; and (4) the error must seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Pantle, </em>637 F.3d 1172, 1174 (11th Cir.2011) (quotation marks omitted). With respect to the third prong of plain error review, we recently reiterated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-13\">\u201c[i]t is the defendant rather than the [government who bears the burden of persuasion with respect to prejudice.\u201d <em>[United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1299 (11th Cir.2005).] And in order to meet that burden, a defendant must show that the claimed error affected his substantial rights, which \u201calmost always requires that the error must have affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). A defendant\u2019s burden under the plain error standard to show prejudice is \u201canything but easy\u201d\u2014\u201cthe burden truly is on the defendant to show that the error actually did make a difference.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1299-1300.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b853-14\"><em>Pantle, </em>637 F.3d at 1177.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-15\">Williams argues that the government breached his plea agreement by failing to recommend a sentence at the low end of the applicable guidelines range. However, even though the government concedes that it breached the plea agreement by arguing for a sentence \u201cwithin\u201d the applicable guidelines range, Williams has conceded that it \u201cit may be argued that the comments of [the government] were equivocal and did not affect the sentencing court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>judgment\u201d in imposing his sentence. Furthermore, the district court explicitly stated that the primary motivating factor behind the sentence was Williams\u2019 criminal history and the fact that he remained undeterred by his experiences in the criminal justice system. The district court also repeatedly reminded Williams during sentencing that it was not bound by the government\u2019s sentencing recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">For those reasons, it is at best unclear whether the district court would have sentenced Williams any differently had the government recommended a sentence at the low end of the guidelines range. Therefore, Williams has not carried his burden of demonstrating that the government\u2019s breach of the plea agreement affected his substantial rights. <em>Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1301 (\u201c[Wjhere the effect of an error on the result in the district court is uncertain or indeterminate ... [the defendant] has not met his burden of showing prejudice.... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
