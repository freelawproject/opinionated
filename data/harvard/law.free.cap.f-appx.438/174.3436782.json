Gilyard was convicted by a jury of one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1344, 1349 (2006) (Count One); seven counts of bank fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344 (2006) (Counts Two through Eight); six counts of possessing and uttering counterfeit securities, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 513(a), 2 (2006) (Counts Nine through Fourteen);<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and one count of aggravated identity theft, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A (2006) (Count Fifteen). Gilyard was sentenced to a total of 192 months\u2019 imprisonment. Gilyard\u2019s counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that he found no meritorious issues for appeal, but questioning whether the district court erred in denying Gilyard\u2019s post-verdict motions and in adopting the factual findings contained in the presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) over Gilyard\u2019s objections. Gilyard filed a pro se supplemental brief also challenging the denial of her post-verdict motions, which are based on Gilyard\u2019s belief that a witness perjured himself at trial. Although we affirm Gilyard\u2019s convictions and sentence, we remand for the purpose of correcting a clerical error in the judgment. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">Gilyard first challenges the district court\u2019s denial of her post-verdict motions for substitution of counsel and for a continuance. Both motions center on Gilyard\u2019s allegation that a Government witness committed perjury. We review the district court\u2019s denial of a continuance for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>445 F.3d 724, 739 (4th Cir.2006). The trial court abuses its, discretion when its denial of a motion for continuance is \u201can unreasoning and arbitrary insistence upon expeditiousness in the face of a justifiable request for delay.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Whether to grant a motion for substitution of counsel is also within the district court\u2019s discretion. <em>United States v. Reevey, </em>364 F.3d 151, 156 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-15\">In evaluating whether the trial court abused its discretion in denying a defendant\u2019s motion for substitution of counsel, we consider: (1) the timeliness of the motion; (2) the adequacy of the court\u2019s inquiry into the defendant\u2019s complaint about her attorney; and (3) whether the attorney/client conflict was so great that it resulted in total lack of communication preventing an adequate defense. <em>Id. </em>We weigh these factors against the district court\u2019s \u201cinterest in the orderly administration of justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 157. In addition, a district court has wide latitude in limiting a defendant\u2019s right to counsel of choice, based upon fairness and the demands of the court\u2019s calendar. <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez, </em>548 U.S. 140, 152, 126 S.Ct. 2557, 165 L.Ed.2d 409 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-16\">We have reviewed the record and find that all three factors weighed against granting Gilyard\u2019s motion for substitute counsel. Therefore, we conclude without difficulty that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion. Moreover, because the district court\u2019s ruling was not arbitrary, the court did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>abuse its discretion in denying Gilyard\u2019s motion for a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">Next, counsel generally questions whether the district court erred in adopting the PSR\u2019s factual findings over Gil-yard\u2019s objections. However, Gilyard has not made an affirmative showing that the PSR\u2019s findings are unreliable or inaccurate. <em>United States v. Terry, </em>916 F.2d 157, 162 (4th Cir.1990). Therefore, the district court did not err in adopting the PSR\u2019s factual findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm Gilyard\u2019s convictions and sentence. We note, however, that the judgment contains a clerical error. The judgment states that Gilyard was convicted of Counts Nine through Fourteen under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 512(a). Gilyard, however, was charged with and convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 513(a) with respect to these counts of the indictment. We accordingly remand for the purpose of correcting this clerical error. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Crim.P. 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">This court requires that counsel inform Gilyard, in writing, of her right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Gilyard requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Gilyard. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal conclusions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b199-10\"> The judgment erroneously cites 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 512(a) (2006) for these counts of conviction. However, Gilyard was convicted of violating \u00a7 513(a), as charged in the indictment. Because the judgment does not accurately recite the disposition of this case, we remand this case to the district court for correction of the written judgment. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 36.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
