(\u201cBrogdin\u201d) retained the services of Plaintiff-Appellant Charles D. Cook to deliver casing<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and oversee its installation in Brogdin\u2019s oil well. During the execution of his work on the project, Cook delivered casing to the drill site, but thereafter made a counting error that caused him to take away more of that casing, as excess, than he should have. This error in turn resulted in the completion of the well at an incorrect depth, shallower than the zone targeted for completion. Consequently, Brogdin incurred increased costs to have the well reworked and casing reinstalled to the correct depth. Cook sued his commercial general liability (\u201cCGL\u201d) insurance carrier, Defendant-Appellee Admiral Insurance Company (\u201cAdmiral\u201d), seeking a declaratory judgment that Admiral must (1) defend Cook in any lawsuit brought against him by Brogdin and (2) indemnify Cook for all damages awarded to Brogdin in such a suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>Seeking a determination that it did not owe Cook a defense or indemnity, Admiral filed a motion for summary judgment, which the district court granted. The court reasoned that, because there was no \u201closs of use\u201d of the Brogdin well, Cook\u2019s acts did not result in \u201cproperty damage\u201d under the terms of Admiral\u2019s policy, so Admiral had no duty to defend or indemnify Cook. We affirm the summary judgment, but for different reasons</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">I. FACTS &amp; PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">A. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">Cook purchased a CGL insurance policy from Admiral. During the term of that policy, Brogdin retained Cook to deliver casing to the well and to oversee its installation in the well bore. In preparation for casing and completing the oil well, Cook was required to haul any excess casing away from the drill site. Cook made a counting error, however, and hauled away too much casing from the drill site. This resulted in an insufficient string of casing being installed in the well bore, causing the well to be completed ineffectively at a depth that was shallower than that of the zone intended for completion and production. This required Brogdin to have the well reworked before it could be completed at the correct depth, costing Brogdin $336,745.63. Brogdin sued Cook in state court, claiming only that cost of reworking the well.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">B. Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">Before he was sued by Brogdin, Cook notified Admiral of Brogdin\u2019s pre-suit claim. Admiral responded that, although the CGL policy provided $1 million in coverage, Cook could not recover more than $100,000 in damages because of an endorsement relating to underground work. This prompted Cook to sue Admiral in state court, seeking a declaratory judgment that the policy\u2019s full $1 million coverage was applicable to Brogdin\u2019s anticipated claim because Cook\u2019s work did not involve an underground equipment hazard. When, thereafter, Brogdin sued Cook, Admiral accepted Cook\u2019s defense under a reservation of the right to claim that it had no duty to defend or indemnify Cook against Brogdin\u2019s suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-13\">Admiral removed Cook\u2019s action to federal court and Brogdin intervened. Admiral then countersued Cook and Brogdin, seeking a declaratory judgment that its duty to indemnify Cook was limited to $100,000. Cook filed a motion for partial summary judgment on Admiral\u2019s counterclaim. Admiral then filed a motion for summary judgment, asserting that it had no duty to defend Cook in Brogdin\u2019s state court suit because Brogdin\u2019s claims against Cook were not within the scope of coverage of the CGL policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-14\">The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Admiral. It held that Admiral did not have a duty to defend Cook against Brogdin\u2019s lawsuit because Cook\u2019s actions did not result in a \u201closs of use of tangible property that is not physically injured,\u201d and that there thus was no \u201cproperty damage\u201d under the CGL policy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court also ruled that, for the same reasons, Admiral did not have a duty to indemnify Cook, who then timely filed a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-15\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"AY5\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b339-16\">We review a district court\u2019s summary judgment de novo, applying the same legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>standards as the district court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Summary judgment is proper only \u201cif the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In our review, we may only consider the summary judgment record that was before the district court, viewing that evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">B. Admiral Does Not Have a Duty to Defend Cook</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Under Texas law, an insurer\u2019s duty to defend \u201cis governed by the \u2018eight-corners\u2019 rule, whereby a court considers only the allegations in the underlying complaint and the terms of the insurance policy. If the petition filed against the insured, liberally construed, alleges facts within the scope of coverage, the insurer must defend.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In addition, the duty to defend \u201cis determined by the underlying plaintiffs pleadings ... without regard to the truth or falsity of those allegations,\u201d making \u201conly two documents [ ] ordinarily relevant to the determination of the duty to defend: the policy and the pleadings of the underlying claimant. Facts outside the pleadings, even those easily ascertained, are ordinarily not material to the determination and allegations against the insured are liberally construed in favor of coverage.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AdB\">Here, Brogdin asserts in its complaint that it had contracted with Cook to \u201cdeliver and oversee the running of casing on a well\u201d but that Cook had \u201cremoved more casing from the well site than it [sic] should, thereby resulting in a failure to complete the well to the desired depth, necessitating an expensive rework of the well, proximately causing damage to plaintiff.\u201d Based on these alleged facts, Brogdin makes two distinct legal claims\u2014one based on a theory of breach of contract and the other based on a theory of negligence\u2014contending that under each theory Cook \u201cmust reimburse [Brogdin] for the funds paid by [Brogdin] to mitigate damages caused by [Cook], to the damage of [Brogdin].\u201d We now must determine in our de novo review whether Brogdin has made allegations against Cook that fall within the scope of coverage of Admiral\u2019s CGL policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-13\">1. \u201cLoss of Use of Tangible Property That Is Not Physically Injured\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b340-14\">The CGL policy requires Admiral to defend Cook against any suit seeking \u201cdamages because of \u2018bodily injury\u2019 or \u2018property damage\u2019 to which this insurance applies.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The policy further provides that \u201c[t]he insurance applies to [] \u2018property damage\u2019 only if: The [ ] \u2018property damage\u2019 is caused by an \u2018occurrence\u2019 that takes place in the \u2018coverage territory\u2019 ....\u201d And an \u201coccurrence\u201d is defined as \u201can accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same harmful conditions.\u201d The Texas Supreme Court has agreed with our earlier assessment that \u201c\u2018claims for damage caused by an in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>sured\u2019s defective performance or faulty workmanship\u2019 may constitute an \u2018occurrence\u2019 when \u2018property damage\u2019 results from the \u2018unexpected, unforeseen or undesigned happening or consequence\u2019 of the insured\u2019s negligent behavior\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>\u2014regardless of whether the occurrence injures a third party\u2019s property or the insured\u2019s work.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Texas Supreme Court has also explained that \u201c[a]n accident is generally understood to be a fortuitous, unexpected, and unintended event\u201d and has cited, as an example, \u201c[t]he wrong number of boxes was shipped because someone made a mistake in counting.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Here, Cook\u2019s \u201cremov[al][of] more casing from the well site than [he] should\u201d (because someone made a mistake in counting) was an \u201coccurrence\u201d under the terms of the CGL policy, as construed by the Texas Supreme Court.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The question then is whether the resulting damage alleged by Brogdin\u2014the \u201cfailure to complete the well to the desired depth\u201d\u2014constituted \u201cproperty damage\u201d under Admiral\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">That CGL policy defines \u201cproperty damage\u201d disjunctively as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-7\">(a) Physical injury to tangible property, including all resulting loss of use of that property. All such loss of use shall be deemed to occur at the time of the physical injury that caused it; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-8\">(b) Loss of use of tangible property that is not physically injured. All such loss of use shall be deemed to occur at the time of the \u201coccurrence\u201d that caused it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-12\">In the district court, Cook assumed that Brogdin\u2019s alleged facts fit into the CGL policy under subsection (b) alone, i.e., the \u201closs of use\u201d definition of \u201cproperty damage.\u201d The district court determined, however, that for there to be <em>\u201closs of use </em>of tangible property,\u201d the tangible property\u2014here, the well\u2014must have been <em>in use </em>prior to the damage.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The court observed: \u201cThe well completed at the specified depth had not only not been used but could not have been used. It was not poised ready to put in action or service. It simply did not exist at the time of the breach or when the reworking was done.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Based on that analysis, the district court concluded that Cook\u2019s actions did not result in \u201closs of use\u201d of an <em>existing </em>well.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The court went on to note that \u201ceven if the policy did cover damages for the loss of use of something that had not yet been created, the Brogdin lawsuit <em>does not allege </em>damages for loss of use.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We need not pursue this further, however, because we affirm on different grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-13\">2. \u201cProperty Damage\u201d Exclusions</p>\n<p id=\"b341-14\">Although the CGL policy does generally require Admiral to defend against any suit seeking damages from Cook for \u201cproperty damage,\u201d section j of the policy expressly excludes coverage of:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-15\">\u201cProperty damage\u201d to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>(5) That particular part of real property on which you ... are performing operations if the \u201cproperty damage\u201d arises out of those operations; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-4\">(6) That particular part of any property that must be restored, repaired or replaced because \u2018your work\u2019 was incorrectly performed on it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Here, the \u201cproperty damage,\u201d i.e., the completion of the well at an incorrect depth, undeniably <em>arose out of </em>Cook\u2019s operations; and it was precisely that well which had to be reworked because Cook\u2019s negligence in retrieving too much casing from the site left an insufficient quantity of casing to reach the proper depth for completion. Moreover, Cook then oversaw the running of that insufficient casing. Relying on <em>Mid-Continent Casualty Co. v. JHP Development, Inc.,</em><footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Cook insists that exclusion j(5) is inapplicable because, temporally speaking, \u201cthere was a gap between the occurrence and loss of use.\u201d In that opinion, we addressed this same CGL policy exclusion, recognizing that \u201cexclusion j(5) makes clear that the exclusion only applies to property damage that occurred during the performance of construction operations\u201d and concluding that the exclusion did not apply in that case because the property damage \u201coccur[red] during a prolonged, open-ended, and complete suspension of construction activities.\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Cook attempts to liken <em>Mid-Continent </em>to the instant case by identifying the \u201coccurrence\u201d as the removal of the casing and then arguing that the property damage \u201coccurred after the occurrence was performed, when the casing was run.\u201d This analysis, however, misses the point of our holding in <em>Mid-Continent </em>and misses the factual distinction between that case and this one. The plain language of exclusion j(5) makes it applicable to property damage that \u201carises out of\u2019 operations that take place while the insured is \u201cperforming operations.\u201d That is why exclusion j(5) did not apply in <em>Mid-Continent </em>to damage caused during a suspension of construction activities. Here, in contrast, there was no suspension of construction activities: The well was completed to the incorrect depth, i.e., damaged, <em>while </em>Cook was \u201cdelivering] and overseeing] the running of casing on [the] well,\u201d as his \u201cwork\u201d was characterized in Brogdin\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-11\">Cook likewise asserts that exclusion j(6) is inapplicable because \u201cthe defective work was the removal of casing, [and] the loss of use was to the well, a separate property.\u201d But, this analysis too strays from the plain text of the exclusion. In <em>Mid-Continent, </em>we explained that \u201c[t]he plain meaning of the exclusion ... is that property damage only to parts of the property that were themselves the subjects of the defective work is excluded.\u201d <footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In the instant case, Cook was hired to (1) provide casing for the well as an integral part of the drilling and completion of the well as a whole <em>and </em>(2) oversee the running of the casing that he provided. As Admiral notes, casing \u201cis not a component of a well that functions independently, and without which the rest of the well would continue to function.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Therefore, because Cook <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>negligently recovered and hauled off too much of the casing from the well site where he had delivered it\u2014thus furnishing a net amount of casing insufficient to reach the target depth for the completion of the well\u2014he caused defects in the \u201cconstruction\u201d of the well as a whole when he oversaw the installation of that deficient quantity of casing. These circumstances are distinguishable from those of defective repair work (performed after a well is constructed) that causes damage only to the casing, as a pre-installed component of the finished well.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> By contrast, there was here no domino effect of damage to the entire well triggered by Cook\u2019s defective work on one independent working part of the well; rather, Cook\u2019s work was performed during the overall drilling and completion operation of the well and thus caused damage to the entire well when his work was incorrectly performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Although the district court did not grant summary judgment in favor of Admiral on the basis of exclusions j(5) and j(6), we have recognized that we may affirm a district court\u2019s judgment for reasons\u2014supported by the record\u2014other than those relied on by the district court.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> We may, therefore, properly consider whether any of the Admiral policy\u2019s exclusions apply to coverage in this case because the entire CGL policy, including exclusions j(5) and j(6), is part of the record. Cook contends that Admiral has waived any argument based on these policy exclusions because, under Texas law, a policy exclusion is an affirmative defense,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> and failure to raise an affirmative defense generally constitutes waiver.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> But, we have also made clear that \u201cthere is some play in the joints\u201d of that general rule, and \u201c \u2018a defendant does not waive an affirmative defense if it is raised at a pragmatically sufficient time, and [the plaintiff] was not prejudiced in its ability to respond.\u2019 \u201c<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> We have, for example, upheld a summary judgment in favor of an insurer based on an affirmative defense that the insurer did not plead.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-14\">Here, the parties\u2019 dispute turned primarily on whether Cook\u2019s negligence, as alleged by Brogdin, caused \u201cproperty damage\u201d under the policy\u2019s \u201closs of use\u201d definition. The district court determined that it did not, thereby denying that Admiral had a duty to defend, and the court stopped its analysis at that point. Because the court thus determined that there was no policy coverage in the first place, it had no reason to question whether any of the policy\u2019s exclusions might apply. As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>we found that ruling to raise a difficult question, however, and believed the policy-exclusion question to be rather straightforward, we requested that both parties submit supplemental letter briefs addressing the applicability of the policy\u2019s two exclusions, which to us seemed relevant to the facts of this case. Cook thus had an adequate opportunity to respond and to refute the applicability of the exclusions; and, indeed, he took only two days, of the seven we allowed, to do so. Now that we have reviewed both Cook\u2019s and Admiral\u2019s responding analyses on this issue, we are satisfied that Cook was not prejudiced by our sua sponte raising of this issue,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> and we are now convinced that these exclusions provide the correct legal basis on which to affirm the district court\u2019s summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">In sum, the property damage alleged by Brogdin in its complaint falls squarely within these two \u201cproperty damage\u201d exclusions\u2014j(5) and j(6)\u2014of the CGL policy. This, in turn, relieves Admiral of any duty to defend Cook in the action brought against him by Brogdin.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">C. Admiral Does Not Have a Duty to Indemnify Cook</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">Under Texas law, an insurer\u2019s duty to <em>indemnify </em>\u201cis justiciable before the insured\u2019s liability is determined in the liability lawsuit when the insurer has no duty to defend <em>and the same reasons that negate the duty to defend likewise negate any possibility the insurer will ever have a duty to </em>indemnify.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Admiral\u2019s CGL policy provides that it \u201cwill pay those sums that [Cook] becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of [] \u2018property damage\u2019 to which this insurance applies.\u201d As we have determined that the CGL policy does not apply to the type of \u201cproperty damage\u201d alleged by Brogdin, Admiral does not have a duty to indemnify Cook for the same reasons that it does not have a duty to defend him.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-12\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b344-13\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s summary judgment relieving Admiral of any duty to defend or indemnify Cook is, in all respects, AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b338-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm.

The panel majority\u2019s decision is based on arguments that neither Admiral Insurance Company nor Cook advanced in the district court, nor were these arguments raised in this court until supplemental briefing was requested by our court. Respectfully, our jurisprudence does not allow us to affirm a summary judgment on <em>any </em>grounds, but rather only on the basis of any arguments advanced below. Admiral is entitled to summary judgment, however, since the events giving rise to the underlying suit against Cook fall outside the scope of Cook\u2019s insurance policy. Admiral did advance this basis for summary judgment, both in the district court and in our court.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-16\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b344-17\">Cook acquired a general commercial liability insurance policy from Admiral. Cook contracted with M.J. Brogdin to deliver and oversee the running of casing for an oil well. In the course of that job, Cook made an error, and Brogdin sued. Brog<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>din\u2019s two-page petition filed in state court alleged that Cook \u201cremoved more casing from the well site than [he] should, thereby resulting in a failure to complete the well to the desired depth.\u201d Brogdin\u2019s suit sought damages as a result. Cook filed the instant suit against Admiral, seeking a declaratory judgment that Admiral was required to defend and indemnify him from Brogdin\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Admiral. Among Admiral\u2019s arguments for summary judgment, though not the basis of the district court\u2019s decision, was the limited scope of the coverage set forth in the \u201cclassifications\u201d section of the insurance policy. Admiral did not advance an argument on the basis of the \u201cproperty damage\u201d exclusions relied upon by the panel majority.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">The panel majority resolves this case on the basis of two \u201cproperty damage\u201d exclusions in the policy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The panel majority concludes that the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment may be affirmed on the basis of these exclusions\u2014which were not addressed by the parties until our request for supplemental briefing on appeal\u2014because \u201cwe have recognized that we may affirm a district court\u2019s judgment for reasons\u2014supported by the record\u2014 other than those relied on by the district court.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b345-13\">Our court, however, has recognized limits on the reach of that general proposition. For instance, in <em>Johnson v. Sawyer, </em>we stated, \u201cAlthough we can affirm a summary judgment on grounds not relied on by the district court, those grounds must at least have been proposed or asserted in that court by the movant.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Yet here, the panel majority relies upon exclusions that were never asserted in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-14\">In <em>LeMaire v. Louisiana Department of Transportation &amp; Development, </em>we recognized that the limits placed upon our summary judgment affirmance rule are intertwined with the general limits we place upon the scope of our consideration on appeal: \u201cwe may only affirm an order granting summary judgment on a basis that was presented to the district court. This is in keeping with our precedent that arguments not raised before the district court are waived and cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, the general proposition relied upon by the panel majority comes into tension with another of our court\u2019s general propositions, stated\u2014perhaps most succinctly\u2014in another context by our en banc court: \u201cIt goes without saying that we are a court of review, not of original error. Restated, we review only those issues presented to us; we do not craft new issues or otherwise search for them in the record.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We have recognized that \u201c[i]t is for the parties, those who have a stake in the litigation, to decide which issues they want to pursue, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>at trial and on appeal.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As our en banc court recognized, \u201cit is not for us to decide which issues should be presented, or to otherwise try the case for the parties.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Here, because the parties chose\u2014on the basis of their own assessments\u2014to address other provisions contained in the policy, we should not relitigate the case for them.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">There is, however, an alternative ground on which summary judgment may be affirmed that the parties did raise, both below and in their briefing to this court. Admiral contends that the claims asserted by Brogdin\u2019s suit against Cook fall outside the scope of Cook\u2019s policy. To determine the scope of Admiral\u2019s duty to defend under Texas\u2019s \u201ceight corners\u201d rule, we compare the facts alleged in Brogdin\u2019s petition to the language of the policy.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">The underlying state-court petition states that Cook \u201cremoved more casing from the well site than [he] should, necessitating an expensive rework of the well.\u201d On appeal, Cook explains that this was an \u201coversight\u201d and cites to a description of this oversight as arising \u201cwhen Cook\u2019s employees miss counted [sic] casing joints.\u201d However, the insurance policy contains an endorsement that \u201c[t]his insurance applies to ... \u2018property damage\u2019 ... arising only out of those operations which are described by the classification shown on the Commercial General Liability Coverage Declarations, its endorsements!,] and supplements.\u201d The \u201cCommercial General Liability Coverage Part\u201d includes the following \u201cClassification[s]\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-13\">OIL OR GAS LEASE WORK BY CONTRACTORS\u2014OILFIELD LEASE ROAD AND DITCH MAINTENANCE, EXCAVATION AND BEAUTIFICATION OF OILFIELD LEASE SITE\u2014 NOT LEASE OPERATIONS\u2014OILFIELD WATER STEAM CLEANING OF TANKS AND SMALL TANKS WITH PRESSURE WASHER WITH PSI OF 2500 OR LESS\u2014NOT LEASE OPERATIONS OCCASIONAL SHOP WELDING\u2014EXCLUDING ANY WORK ON EXISTING LINES[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-14\">OIL OR GAS CONTRACTOR\u2019S EQUIPMENT RENTED TO OTHER^] (EXCLUDING ANY SELF-PROPELLED VEHICLES OR AUTOS) WITHOUT OPERATORS\u2014NO IN-HOLE EQUIPMENT (PRODUCTS/COMPLETED OPERATIONS ARE INCLUDED IN THE GENERAL AGGREGATE LIMIT)[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-15\">SUB-CONTRACTED WORK ONLY TO OTHER INSURED INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS, OIL OR GAS WORK IN THE FIELD[.]<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-16\">The events for which Cook seeks coverage fall outside of the scope of the text. We must be mindful of the directive under Texas law that \u201ccourts must strive to give effect to the written expression of the parties\u2019 intent\u201d in interpreting an insurance policy.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Moreover, to determine the scope of coverage \u201cthe court must focus on the factual allegations that show the origin of the damages rather than on the legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>theories alleged.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Reading the classifications as a whole, nothing listed in the policy\u2019s coverage extends to the facts pled: the erroneous removal of casing from the site that hindered the completion of the well at the desired depth.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Nevertheless, Cook argues that the erroneous removal of the casing falls under the phrase \u201coil or gas lease work by contractors\u201d in the classification. But that phrase is followed by a dash and references to lease road and ditch maintenance and the excavation and beautification of the oilfield lease site. Cook\u2019s \u201cremovfal of] more casing from the well site than [he] should\u201d bears no resemblance to the policy\u2019s statements of coverage. Cook\u2019s allegedly erroneous acts are wholly unconnected to maintaining lease roads or ditches. Similarly, one cannot say that Cook\u2019s erroneous removal of the pipe was done to beautify or excavate the site: as Cook concedes, the casing was improperly removed owing to an \u201coversight,\u201d a function of a counting error. Moreover, if \u201clease work by contractors\u201d were to extend coverage to <em>all </em>activities undertaken by Cook in the course of his business\u2014as Cook appears to contend\u2014there would be no need for the examples following the dash. Indeed, the Supreme Court of Texas has held that \u201ccourts must be particularly wary of isolating from its surroundings or considering apart from other provisions a single phrase, sentence, or section\u201d of an insurance policy.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Reading the classifications as a whole, the removal of the casing falls outside of the policy\u2019s scope and, thus, coverage does not attach.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">Alternatively, Cook argues that this section of the insurance contract is unclear and should be construed against Admiral. He relies upon <em>National Union Fire Insurance Co. of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania v. Hudson Energy </em>Co.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> There, the Supreme Court of Texas held that \u201cif a contract of insurance is susceptible of more than one reasonable interpretation, we must resolve the uncertainty by adopting the construction that most favors the insured.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Cook\u2019s reliance is misplaced, however, because that case made clear that \u201c[i]f the written instrument is worded so that it can be given only one reasonable construction, it will be enforced as written.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> That is the situation in the instant case. The classifications list types of work that will be covered\u2014for instance, the renting of Cook\u2019s non-self-propelled equipment to others\u2014and types of work that will explicitly not be covered\u2014 for instance, certain lease operations. As discussed above, the policy may only be reasonably interpreted by reading the examples following the dashes as cabining the preceding language. This explains the dual listings of non-coverage for \u201clease operations.\u201d If the first listing of \u201clease operations\u201d was not limited by reference to the cleaning of tanks, there would be no need to list it again with reference to shop welding.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-11\">Because the only reasonable interpretation of the classifications of Cook\u2019s policy would not extend coverage to the events at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>issue, \u201cit will be enforced as written.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> For the same reasons Admiral has no duty to defend, it has no duty to indemnify.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">IY</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Cook contends that Admiral waived its argument relying upon the classifications limiting the scope of the policy by waiting to raise this issue until Admiral\u2019s motion for summary judgment below. Cook theorizes that this delay constitutes waiver, since he construes this language as constituting an affirmative defense. Even assuming this were an affirmative defense, there is no waiver. We have previously held that \u201ca defendant does not waive an affirmative defense if it is raised at a pragmatically sufficient time, and the plaintiff was not prejudiced in its ability to respond.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Cook does not argue to this court that he was prejudiced by the delay, nor is prejudice apparent. Moreover, we have previously held that a purely legal issue raised following relevant testimony at trial was asserted at a \u201cpragmatically sufficient time.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Under Texas law, the interpretation of an insurance contract is also a question of law.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> On the facts presented here, there is similarly no waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">I respectfully concur in the judgment only.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b345-8\">. <em>Ante, </em>at 11.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b345-9\">. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b345-10\">. <em>Id. </em>at 9-10 (citing <em>Palmer ex rel.
