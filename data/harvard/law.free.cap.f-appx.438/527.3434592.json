In 2006 he pleaded guilty in Woodbury County, Iowa, to conspiracy to deliver methamphetamine. At removal proceedings in October 2009, Hernandez conceded he was removable (based on the Iowa conviction) as an alien convicted of a controlled-substance offense, <em>see 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(C), and as an alien convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude, <em>see 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I). In December 2009 an immigration judge denied Hernandez\u2019s request for a further continuance of the removal proceedings and ordered him removed. The Board of Immigration Appeals dismissed Hernandez\u2019s appeal and he petitions for review. We lack jurisdiction to review Hernandez\u2019s petition. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) (no court shall have jurisdiction to review final order of removal against alien who is removable by reason of committing criminal offense covered under, inter alia, \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(C)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">Accordingly, we dismiss the petition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b552-10\">. Hernandez did not raise below, or here, a legal argument that an Iowa conviction for conspiracy to deliver methamphetamine is not a controlled-substance conviction for purposes of section 1182(a)(2)(C), <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D) (jurisdiction to review questions of law is retained), nor did he raise any substantial constitutional challenge, <em>see Alvarez Acosta v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>524 F.3d 1191, 1197 (11th Cir.2008) (courts retain jurisdiction under \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D) to entertain substantial constitutional challenges); <em>see also Ming Ming Wijono v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 868, 871-72 (8th Cir.2006) (administrative exhaustion requirements).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
