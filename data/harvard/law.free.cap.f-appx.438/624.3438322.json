We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen, and review de novo questions of law, including claims of due process violations. <em>Hamazaspyan v. Holder, </em>590 F.3d 744, 747 (9th Cir.2009). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-9\">The agency did not abuse its discretion in denying Zhang\u2019s motion to reopen where Zhang failed to establish exceptional circumstances beyond his control that would excuse his failure to appear at his hearing. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(e)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-10\">The agency did not violate due process by considering due diligence as a factor in denying Zhang\u2019s motion to reopen where the BIA\u2019s precedent decision in <em>Matter of J-P-, </em>22 I. &amp; N. Dec. 33 (BIA 1998) (en banc) put Zhang on notice that this factor applied. <em>Cf. Singh v.
