GORSUCH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b753-11\">Larry Wright filed a federal petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 seeking relief from his Oklahoma convictions and sentences for armed robbery and unlawful possession of a firearm. In response, the district court issued a detailed opinion explaining its reasons for declining to award relief. Mr. Wright now asks for a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) to allow him to contest the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-12\">We may grant a COA only if Mr. Wright makes a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). Under this standard, an applicant must show \u201cthat reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (internal quotation omitted). Because Mr. Wright proceeds in this court pro <em>se, </em>we review his pleadings with special solicitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-17\">Even so, we conclude that we cannot issue a COA. In this court, as in the district court, Mr. Wright has sought to pursue three claims. None, however, involves a situation where reasonable jurists could debate the decision to deny relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-18\">First, Mr. Wright claims that the prosecutors\u2019 misconduct at his trial denied him his federal constitutional right to a fair trial. Noting that state courts had already provided him with some but not all the relief he had requested on this claim, the district court concluded, after extensive discussion, that the state court decision not to provide further relief was neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of federal law. Mr. Wright\u2019s COA application affords us no basis on which we might disagree with that considered conclusion. <em>See Wright v. Franklin, </em>No. 08-CV-028-TCK-FHM, 2011 WL 1990035, at *3-*6 (N.D.Okla. May 23, 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-19\">Second, Mr. Wright argues that his federal equal protection rights were offended by the state court\u2019s jury instructions. We agree with the district court, however, that this claim was not preserved for federal review. To be sure, Mr. Wright pursued a related claim of error in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>his direct appeal, taking the question whether the trial court\u2019s jury instructions comported with <em>state law </em>to the state\u2019s highest court, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals (OCCA). <em>See </em>ROA 162 <em>et seq. </em>(raising state law claim on direct appeal); <em>id. </em>at 65 (OCCA ruling). But he raised his federal equal protection claim involving the jury instructions used at his trial only for the first time in his state collateral challenge. And he failed to pursue that collateral challenge on appeal to the OCCA. His failure to do so, to avail himself of all avenues available to him for relief under state law, procedurally defaults the claim. <em>See Johnson v. Champion, </em>288 F.3d 1215, 1226-27 (10th Cir.2002). Neither has he shown that there was adequate cause for his delay, or that a \u201cfundamental miscarriage of justice\u201d would result from the default, such that we might potentially excuse his default. <em>Coleman v. Thompson, </em>501 U.S. 722, 750, 111 S.Ct. 2546, 115 L.Ed.2d 640 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">Third, Mr. Wright contends that his trial counsel\u2019s ineffective assistance violated his Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. The district court found this claim procedurally defaulted because it was included in his state collateral challenge, a challenge that he (again) failed to pursue through appeal to the OCCA. <em>Wright, </em>2011 WL 1990035, at *7-*8. Mr. Wright, however, also pursued his ineffective assistance claim in his direct appeal\u2014 and the issue was entertained and adjudicated by the OCCA. <em>See </em>ROA at 159 <em>et seq. </em>The OCCA concluded that trial counsel had performed deficiently, but that there was insufficient proof that counsel\u2019s errors had prejudiced Mr. Wright. <em>See id. </em>at 62-64. On collateral review the state trial court declined to consider Mr. Wright\u2019s renewed ineffective assistance claim precisely because, in its view, the claim had already been addressed and resolved on direct appeal. <em>See id. </em>at 73.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">But whether or not the claim is procedurally defaulted, there is no way we might issue a COA. To make out a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a petitioner must show that he was prejudiced by his lawyer\u2019s deficient performance. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). What\u2019s more, because this case arises on collateral review and the OCCA ruled on the merits of the claim, a federal court may intercede to afford Mr. Wright relief only if the OCCA\u2019s <em>Strickland </em>analysis\u2014 concluding that Mr. Wright suffered no prejudice from his lawyer\u2019s performance\u2014 was \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). And it is plain that Mr. Wright cannot clear this doubly deferential hurdle. As the OCCA noted, the state presented significant evidence of Mr. Wright\u2019s guilt, and the jury was instructed in a manner designed to cure any defect arising out of the mistakes made by Mr. Wright\u2019s defense counsel. <em>See </em>ROA at 61, 64. We see no basis on which a reasonable jurist could think the OCCA\u2019s <em>Strickland </em>prejudice assessment was contrary to or an unreasonable application of federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">The application for a COA is denied and this appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b753-13\"> This order is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
