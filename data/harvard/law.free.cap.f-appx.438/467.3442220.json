A Presentence Report prepared by the United States Probation Office concluded that, under the United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d), Bailey\u2019s offense level was twenty-one and his criminal history category was VI. The Presentence Report therefore recommended a sentence between seventy-seven and ninety-six months of imprisonment. The district court ordered a sentence of 120 months to be served consecutively to Bailey\u2019s pri- or fourteen-year state sentence for an unrelated offense. Bailey timely appeals and argues that the sentence is unreasonable because the district court gave improper weight to his mental-health issues and inadequate consideration to the state sentence that he was already serving. Because we conclude that the sentence imposed by the district court was not unreasonable, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-12\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b492-13\">On April 10, 2008, Bailey went to the state probation office. R. 15 (Factual Basis for Plea). Bailey had been convicted of robbery and was serving probation at the time of his visit. Id The state probation office contacted detectives from the Hamilton County Sheriff\u2019s Office, who came and arrested Bailey pursuant to outstanding state warrants for Attempted First Degree Murder and Especially Aggravated Assault.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id </em>During a search of Bailey\u2019s person incident to the arrest, detectives found a Charter Arms .38 caliber revolver.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id </em>Bailey was thereafter indicted by a federal grand jury for violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), which prohibits individuals previously imprisoned for more than one year from possessing a firearm. R. 1 (Indictment). Bailey entered a guilty plea without a plea agreement. R. 20 (Dist.Ct.Order).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-14\">The United States Probation Office prepared a Presentence Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) dated July 29, 2009, and distributed that report to the district court and counsel. PSR; R. 32 (Sent. Tr. 9/10/09 at 2-3). The PSR <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>stated that Bailey\u2019s total offense level was twenty-one and that his criminal history category was VI. PSR at 5, \u00b6 20 &amp; 18, \u00b642. It also stated that \u201cthe guideline range for imprisonment [was] 77 to 96 months\u201d and, because the violation occurred while Bailey was on probation, the PSR recommended that the sentence be \u201cimposed consecutively\u201d pursuant to Application Note 3(C) to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3. <em>Id. </em>at 23, \u00b6\u00b6 63-64. The PSR concluded that there were \u201cno known mitigating or aggravating circumstances concerning the offense or the defendant that would warrant a departure from the advisory guideline range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 24, \u00b673. Neither party objected to the contents of the PSR. R. 32 (Sent. Tr. 9/10/09 at 3).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">At the hearing on September 10, 2009, the district court remarked that \u201cthis is a case where the Court might contemplate a nonguidelines sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2. The court also stated that \u201cit strikes the Court that [Bailey] may be a sociopath\u201d and that \u201c[t]here is no treatment for that at all.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11. The district court and counsel agreed that it would be best to continue the hearing pending an evaluation of Bailey\u2019s mental health. <em>Id. </em>at 10-12. An order to that effect was entered on September 17, 2009. R. 23 (Dist.Ct.Order).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">In a report dated December 11, 2009, a mental-health evaluator concluded that \u201cBailey does not suffer from a severe mental disease or defect\u201d and \u201cdoes not require inpatient hospitalization.\u201d R. 28 (Sealed Forensic Report at 1). The evaluator described Bailey as \u201can unreliable and evasive historian\u201d who provided contradictory information, <em>id. </em>at 4, and appeared to malinger on the psychological evaluations performed, <em>id. </em>at 10-11. The evaluator noted that other records indicated that Bailey was a victim of sexual abuse at age twelve, <em>id. </em>at 4, diagnosed with ADHD at age eight, <em>id. </em>at 6, and suffers from sickle cell anemia, <em>id. </em>at 10. The evaluator indicated that even though Bailey and his family members reported that he suffered from bipolar disorder, there were \u201cno records actually reflecting] such a diagnosis\u201d and Bailey did not \u201cendorse\u201d or \u201cdisplay such symptoms\u201d of the disorder. <em>Id. </em>at 12. The evaluator concluded that Bailey was properly diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder. <em>Id. </em>at 11. The evaluator also stated that \u201cmost clinicians do not consider [personality disorders to be] a form of major mental illness\u201d and that \u201cpsychotropic medications ... are less helpful in treating persons with personality disorders.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">On January 21, 2010, the district court held the second sentencing hearing. R. 33 (Sent. Tr. 1/21/10). The court sentenced Bailey to the statutory maximum of 120 months of imprisonment to run consecutively to the fourteen-year state sentence that he was already serving. <em>Id. </em>at 26. In support, the district court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-9\">The nature of this offense demonstrates a complete lack of respect for the law and refusal to abide by prior sentencing. You\u2019re bringing a loaded gun into a probation office, an arm of the judicial system, where you were directed to report pursuant to an arrest that occurred less than three months before. This extreme disregard for the judicial system and the laws of society demonstrated by your conduct weighs in favor of a sentence outside of the guidelines.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-10\">The Court believes that the long history of violations of the law along with the more recent escalation and dangerousness of these violations is of such concern that the Court believes that a sentence within the guideline range is not sufficient. The pattern of your committing crimes involves returning to criminal acts almost immediately after a prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>charge. This demonstrates that you either have the inability to conform your conduct to the requirements of the law or an unwillingness to conform your conduct to the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-4\">The escalating nature of these offenses combined with your continued access to firearms demonstrates that you pose a serious risk of committing future violent crimes and that the public would be in danger from you and your acts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 23-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">Bailey timely appealed, challenging the reasonableness of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">We review sentences for reasonableness \u201cunder a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). \u201cIn reviewing the reasonableness of a sentence outside the Guidelines range, appellate courts may [ ] take the degree of variance into account and consider the extent of a deviation from the Guidelines,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 47, 128 S.Ct. 586, but must afford \u201cdue deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors ... justify the extent of the variance,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-10\">Bailey does not challenge the reasonableness of the district court\u2019s sentence on procedural grounds.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, we review his sentence for substantive reasonableness only.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-12\">B. Substantive Reasonableness of Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b494-13\">Even though the Guidelines are no longer mandatory, \u201ca district judge must give serious consideration to the extent of any departure from the Guidelines and must explain his conclusion that an unusually lenient or an unusually harsh sentence is appropriate in a particular case with sufficient justifications.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 46, 128 S.Ct. 586. \u201cA sentence may be substantively unreasonable where the district court selects] the sentence arbitrarily, bas[es] the sentence on impermissible factors, fail[s] to consider pertinent \u00a7 3553(a) factors or givfes] an unreasonable amount of weight to any pertinent factor.\u201d <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>588 F.3d 301, 328 (6th Cir.2009) (alternation in original; internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-14\">Bailey argues that his sentence is unreasonable because the district court: (1) gave unreasonable weight to his mental-health diagnosis; and (2) failed properly to consider the fourteen-year state sentence Bailey was already serving. We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing the 120-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-15\">In deciding on the appropriate sentence, the district court discussed Bailey\u2019s antisocial personality disorder diagnosis. R. 33 (Sent. Tr. 1/21/10 at 23-24). Despite acknowledging counsel\u2019s assertion that individuals with antisocial personality disorder \u201cget better\u201d with age, the district court expressed concern about the uncertainty as to when manifestations of the disorder might subside. <em>Id,, </em>at 23-24 (\u201cI\u2019ll take her word for it and assume that as you get <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>older that some of the characteristics of being a sociopath will diminish, if not disappear altogether. But you are a young man, and we have no idea when that might take place. One of the frustrating aspects of being a sociopath is that there is really no treatment that is available that helps.\u201d). The district court ultimately deemed the 120-month sentence appropriate in light of the fact that Bailey\u2019s \u201creckless and unpredictable conduct poses a continuing threat to society.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">This conclusion is not unreasonable. The district court considered Bailey\u2019s mental health in light of one of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors: public safety. We have previously upheld sentences when a district court found an individual\u2019s mental-health condition, and in particular antisocial personality disorder, increased the risk of recidivism and thereby the danger to the public. <em>See United States v. Young, </em>310 Fed.Appx. 784, 796 (6th Cir.2009) (unpublished opinion) (upholding sentence where district court found link between defendant\u2019s mental-health issues and risk of recidivism); <em>see also United States v. Glowers, </em>280 Fed.Appx. 496, 502 (6th Cir.2008) (unpublished opinion) (rejecting argument that 360-month sentence was unreasonable because \u201cthe district court failed to adequately consider the benefits of treatment\u201d). Moreover, the district court based its conclusion not just on Bailey\u2019s mental-health diagnosis but also his extensive criminal history, which had grown increasingly violent over time. R. 33 (Sent. Tr. 1/21/10 at 25). We have recognized that it may be \u201creasonable for [a] district court to place substantial weight on [a defendant\u2019s] criminal history in reaching its sentencing determination.\u201d <em>United States v. Webb, </em>403 F.3d 373, 384 (6th Cir.2005). In addition, the district court attempted to tailor the sentence to Bailey\u2019s mental-health needs by \u201crecommending] that the defendant be evaluated for mental health treatment while incarcerated\u201d and \u201cparticipate in a program of mental health treatment.\u201d R. 33 (Sent. Tr. 1/21/10 at 26-27). The district court did not give unreasonable weight to Bailey\u2019s mental-health diagnosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">Bailey also argues that the district court failed to consider the reasonableness of the sentence in light of the fourteen-year state sentence Bailey was already serving.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At the sentencing hearing, defense counsel brought to the district court\u2019s attention the fact that Bailey was already serving a fourteen-year state sentence and therefore would be \u201clooking at being out of his twenties when he\u2019s released, no matter the sentence\u201d for the present offense. <em>Id. </em>at 18. The government noted that Bailey was eligible for parole once he served thirty percent of the state sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 21. The district court nevertheless concluded that in light of Bailey\u2019s escalating offenses, which had become \u201cmore and more dangerous and frequent ... a sentence of 96 months [was] inadequate to provide the public with sufficient protection [and] ... to demonstrate to [Bailey] the seriousness of [his] conduct and to promote respect for the law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 25-26. Thus, the district court considered and rejected Bailey\u2019s argument in light of Bailey\u2019s extensive violent criminal activities. By grounding its reasoning in the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district court adequately justified the imposition of the 120-month sentence despite the fourteen-year state sentence. \u201c[W]e are satisfied that the sentence imposed by the district court, although certainly harsh, is not unreasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Herrera-Zuniga, </em>571 F.3d 568, 591 (6th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">Because the district court\u2019s sentence of 120 months of imprisonment was not unreasonable, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b492-10\">. Bailey subsequently pleaded guilty to lesser charges in state court on March 18, 2009. PSR at 16; R. 33 (Sent.
