For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-21\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-22\">Because we write primarily for the parties, we need not engage in a lengthy recitation of the facts. Brown argues that the district court violated Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32 because it did not determine if he and his attorney had read and discussed his presentence report.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>Rule 32(i)(l)(A) requires a sentencing court to \u201cverify that the defendant and the defendant\u2019s attorney have read and discussed the presentence report and any addendum to the report.\u201d In addition, \u201cfor any disputed portion of the presentence report or other controverted matter,\u201d the court must \u201crule on the dispute or determine that a ruling is unnecessary either because the matter will not affect sentencing, or because the court with not consider the matter in sentencing.\u201d Fed. R.Crim.P. 32(i)(3)(B).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">We have held that a district court need not directly inquire whether defense counsel has reviewed the pre-sentencing report with his client; instead, \u201cthe court need only <em>somehow </em>determine that the defendant has had this opportunity.\u201d <em>United States v. Mays, </em>798 F.2d 78, 80 (3d Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">The record establishes that Rule 32\u2019s requirements were met: Defense counsel\u2019s letter regarding the objections to the pre-sentence report provided sufficient evidence for the district court to conclude that defense counsel read the investigation report. In fact, counsel read the investigation report in enough detail to object to a specific paragraph in the pre-sentence report. Moreover, the letter states that \u201cMr. Brown objects\u201d to certain portion of the report, and it is therefore logical to conclude that Brown\u2019s counsel discussed the report with him. <em>See </em>JA22a (letter from counsel). Although counsel later abandoned the claims he initially raised in this letter for reasons that are unclear from the record, that does not mean that the attorney did not read or review the presentence report with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">Therefore, we hold that there the district court complied with Rule 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-11\">In addition to his Rule 32 objection, Brown now attempts to pursue the claim that his counsel abandoned at his sentencing hearing, namely, that the amount of drugs used to calculate his sentence is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-12\">Brown\u2019s co-defendants were found in possession of $25,000 that they confessed they intended to use to purchase one kilogram of crack cocaine in Atlanta. In the sentencing report, that kilogram was attributed to Brown. Brown now argues that the government failed to meet its burden under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 regarding the calculation of the amount of crack cocaine that he and his co-defendants intended to and were capable of buying with the $25,000 they possessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-13\">Note 12 to \u00a7 2D1.1 provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-14\">In an offense involving negotiation to traffic in a controlled substance, the weight under negotiation in an uncompleted distribution is used to calculate that amount. However, where the court finds that the defendant did not intend to produce and was not reasonably capable of producing the negotiated amount, the court shall exclude from the guideline calculation the amount that it finds the defendant did not intend to produce and was not reasonably capable of producing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-15\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 n. 12. \u201c[T]he government generally bears the burden of proving the weight of drugs under negotiation....\u201d <em>United States v. Raven, </em>39 F.3d 428, 432 (3d Cir.1994) (citing <em>United States v. McCutchen, </em>992 F.2d 22, 25 (3d Cir.1993)). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>\u201cThe government can meet this burden by referring <em>to </em>the presentence investigation report, which, if unchallenged by the defendant is, of course, a proper basis for sentence determination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 434 (quoting <em>United States v. McDowell, </em>888 F.2d 285, 290 n. 1 (3d Cir.1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">Here, the amount set forth in the presentence investigation report went unchallenged. Although Brown\u2019s counsel initially sent a letter protesting the amount, he abandoned that claim when he failed to file any brief supporting his argument to the district court, and, at the sentencing hearing, he acknowledged that there were no \u201cpresent\u201d objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Even if Brown were permitted to challenge this amount now, he could not satisfy his burden of producing some evidence that the amount submitted by the government is incorrect. As we explained in <em>Raven,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-6\">[T]he defendant who wishes to be found responsible for a lesser amount of drugs must come forward with evidence supporting the proposition that he or she lacked both the intent and the reasonable capability to produce the drugs in question.... In order to meet this burden of production, the defendant may cast a different light on the government\u2019s evidence, elicit evidence of his or her own during cross examination of any witnesses offered by the government, or present other evidence suggesting lack of intent and lack of reasonable capability-</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 434-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">Here, Brown merely attacks the credibility of his co-defendants statements that they intended to buy a kilogram of crack cocaine. The district court\u2019s calculation of the drugs chargeable to Brown was based on those statements. He also argues that there was \u201cnothing in the record to support a finding that Mr. Brown, through co-defendant [Latacha Renee] Thompson [who intended to drive to Atlanta to buy the crack cocaine], was capable of producing any illegal narcotics with the $25,000 seized.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-10\">These arguments are unpersuasive. The PSR drug-quantity estimate was based on his co-defendants\u2019 confessions that Thompson was en route to purchase a kilogram of cocaine on Brown\u2019s behalf. That estimate was accepted by the district courts that sentenced two of his codefendants, both of which courts found, for the purposes of determining the appropriate guidelines range, that the amount attributable to each defendant was between 500 and 1,500 grams. According to the guidelines in force at the time of sentencing, offenses involving a cocaine-base quantity within that range corresponded to an offense level of 34. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(3) (2009). Furthermore, Brown did not prove that he lacked both the intent and reasonable capacity to obtain or distribute that quantity, which he was required to do to rebut the government\u2019s proffered estimate. <em>See Raven, </em>39 F.3d at 434. Therefore, in light of that reliable evidence <em>of </em>drug quantity, to which Brown did not object at sentencing, there was ample basis for the District Court to accept the drug quantity reported in the PSR. As such, we reject his challenge to his guidelines calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-12\">For the reasons stated above, we affirm the District Court\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b100-12\">. The District Court had jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. We have appellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b101-7\">. Instead of referring to Rule 32(i)(3)(B), Brown cites U.S.S.G. \u00a7 6A1.3(b), which imposes the same requirement: \"The court shall resolve disputed sentencing factors at a sentencing hearing in accordance with Rule 32(i), Fed.R.Crim.P.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
