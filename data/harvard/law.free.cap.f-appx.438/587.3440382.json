Piersol, Senior District Judge for the U.S. District Court for South Dakota, Sioux Falls, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b612-6\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>***</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">Mark Gable (\u201cGable\u201d or \u201cappellant\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of National Broadcasting Company (\u201cNBC\u201d), Gregory Garcia (\u201cGarcia\u201d), Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation, and Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment LLC (collectively, \u201cdefendants\u201d or \u201cappellees\u201d) in this copyright infringement action. We review a district court order granting summary judgment de novo. <em>See Buono v. Norton, </em>371 F.3d 543, 545 (9th Cir.2004). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">Gable claims that defendants infringed his copyright in the screenplay <em>Karma! </em>when they created the television program called <em>My Name is Earl (\u201cEarl\u201d). </em>To establish copyright infringement, Gable must show that (1) defendants had access to his work and (2) <em>Karma! </em>and <em>Earl </em>are substantially similar in protected expression. <em>See Rice v. Fox Broad. Co., </em>330 F.3d 1170, 1174 (9th Cir.2003). Because Gable failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact regarding substantial similarity, we need not address the issue of access.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-11\">To determine whether two works are substantially similar for the purposes of summary judgment, courts in the Ninth Circuit use the \u201cextrinsic test,\u201d which measures the \u201carticulable similarities between the plot, themes, dialogue, mood, setting, pace, characters, and sequence of events.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). A party claiming infringement may place \u201cno reliance upon any similarity in expression resulting from unprotectable elements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u201cSimilarities derived from the use of common ideas,\u201d for example, cannot be protected. <em>Id. </em>at 1175 (quotation omitted). Relatedly, the doctrine of <em>scenes a faire </em>holds that \u201cexpressions indispensable and naturally associated with the treatment of a given idea are treated like ideas and are therefore not protected by copyright.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-12\">Because \u201cno reasonable juror could find substantial similarity of ideas and expression\u201d between <em>Karma! </em>and <em>Earl, </em>the district court did not err in granting summary' judgment for the defendants. <em>Funky Films, Inc. v. Time Warner Entm\u2019t Co., </em>462 F.3d 1072, 1076 (9th Cir.2006) (citation and internal quotations marks omitted). The mere fact that <em>Karma! </em>and <em>Earl </em>both deal with the ideas of karma and redemption does not constitute infringement. <em>Rice, </em>330 F.3d at 1175; <em>see also Kouf v. Walt Disney Pictures &amp; Television, </em>16 F.3d 1042, 1045 (9th Cir.1994) (attaching \u201cno significance\u201d to the fact that two works involved kids fighting insurmountable dangers). Likewise, there is no infringement stemming from the copying of a \u201cselection and arrangement\u201d of otherwise unprotectable elements, as in <em>Metcalf v. Bochco, </em>294 F.3d 1069, 1074 (9th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>2002), because <em>Karma! </em>and <em>Earl </em>do not involve the \u201csame totality of similarities and the same degree of access.\u201d <em>Rice, </em>330 F.3d at 1179; <em>see also Funky Films, </em>462 F.3d at 1081 n. 4. The superficial points of comparison between <em>Karma! </em>and <em>Earl, </em>gleaned haphazardly from three seasons of the television series, do not rise to the level of substantial similarity.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">The district court also did not err in excluding expert testimony from David Nimmer and Eric Sherman.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Some of Nimmer\u2019s testimony contained inadmissible legal conclusions. See <em>United States v. Scholl, </em>166 F.3d 964, 973 (9th Cir.1999). According to the district court, although each were recognized to have a separate area of expertise, both Nimmer and Sherman also failed to establish that they had \u201cknowledge, skill, experience, training, or education\u201d relevant to the evidence at issue. Fed.R.Evid. 702. Determinations of whether a particular witness has such expertise is \u201cpeculiarly within the sound discretion of the trial judge\u201d and reviewing courts afford \u201ca high degree of deference to the district court\u2019s findings.\u201d <em>United States v. Chang, </em>207 F.3d 1169, 1172 (9th Cir.2000) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). The district judge in this case did not abuse his discretion in excluding Nimmer\u2019s and Sherman\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Finally, the district court did not err in awarding attorneys\u2019 fees to the defendants. Section 505 of the Copyright Act provides that the district court may \u201caward a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee to the prevailing party as part of the costs.\u201d 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 505. A district court\u2019s order awarding attorneys\u2019 fees under the Copyright Act is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Columbia Pictures Television, Inc. v. Krypton Broad. of Birmingham, Inc., </em>259 F.3d 1186, 1197 (9th Cir.2001). Here, the district court considered, among other things, that its award of attorneys\u2019 fees \u201cencourages valid copyright owners, such as Garcia, to fight for the protection of their works where it would otherwise be uneconomical to do so.\u201d The award also \u201chelps to prevent the filing of similarly meritless copyright actions\u201d in the future. Under these circumstances, the district court did not abuse its discretion. <em>See Fogerty v. Fantasy, Inc., </em>510 U.S. 517, 534 &amp; n. 19 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b612-13\"> xhiS disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
