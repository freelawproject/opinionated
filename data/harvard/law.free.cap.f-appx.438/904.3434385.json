Cir. R. 28(d), there \u201cis a strong presumption in favor of a common law right of public access to court proceedings.\u201d <em>In re Violation of Rule 28(D), </em>635 F.3d 1352, 1356 (Fed.Cir.2011). Petitioners have included a document at A509-26 that has been marked confidential in its entirety. In addition, both petitioners and respondents identify large portions of their briefs as confidential, including Respondent\u2019s response at page 11-16 and Petitioner\u2019s reply at pages 2-7. In the interest of public access, the court requests that the parties submit a modified nonconfidential version of these appendix pages and briefs. The submission should delete only the specific information that can legitimately be kept confidential.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">It Is Ordered That:</p>\n<p id=\"b929-6\">Absence a receipt of a modified nonconfidential version of the above-identified appendix pages and briefs within 7 days of the date of filing of this order, this court will make publicly available a document reflecting that confidential material and may use such material in its public disposition.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
