Abrams, pretermitting her asylum application as untimely and denying her application for withholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Yinghua Han, </em>No. A088 372 173 (B.I.A. Mar. 17, 2010), <em>aff'g </em>No. A088 372 173 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Aug. 14, 2008). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-24\">Under the circumstances of this case, we review both the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s opinions. <em>See Zaman v. Mukasey, </em>514 F.3d 233, 237 (2d Cir.2008). The applicable standards of review are well-established. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Yanqin Weng v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 510, 513 (2d Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b30-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>I. Pretermission of Asylum</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">Contrary to Han\u2019s arguments, the agency did not commit legal error in its pretermission of her asylum application as untimely. There is no merit to Han\u2019s argument that the agency failed to apply a legal standard, as Han was required to demonstrate \u201cto the satisfaction of the Attorney General\u201d that extraordinary circumstances excused her untimely filing. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D). Furthermore, the agency considered Haris argument that she feared \u201crevenge\u201d if she applied for asylum, and it was not required to explicitly address the evidence of her son\u2019s illness. <em>See Jian Hui Shao v. Mukasey, </em>546 F.3d 138, 169 (2d Cir.2008) (rejecting the notion that the agency must \u201cexpressly parse or refute on the record each individual argument or piece of evidence offered by the petitioner\u201d) (quoting <em>Zhi Yun Gao v. Mukasey, </em>508 F.3d 86, 87 (2d Cir.2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">Furthermore, Han\u2019s arguments that the record demonstrates that she established exceptional circumstances sufficient to excuse her untimely filing, raise neither a constitutional claim nor a question of law. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 329-31 (2d Cir.2006). Accordingly, we lack jurisdiction to review these arguments. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">II. Withholding of Removal and CAT Relief</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">The agency reasonably concluded that Han failed to meet her burden of demonstrating past persecution based on her claim that she was physically forced to have an abortion. Han testified that family planning officials came to her home and \u201cdragged\u201d her to the hospital, but in response to the IJ\u2019s request for clarification of why she omitted that detail from her asylum application, Han testified that she decided to have an abortion to avoid a fine and to prevent her husband from losing his job. Han also testified that her husband was angry with her for having an abortion. Moreover, as the BIA found, although Han submitted an abortion certificate in support of her claim, a State Department report indicated that abortion certificates are issued to recipients of voluntary abortions. Accordingly, the agency reasonably determined that there was insufficient evidence that the abortion resulted from physical force.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-9\">Furthermore, the agency reasonably found that Han failed to establish that the threat of economic harm for refusing the abortion amounted to force. The BIA found that Han presented no evidence indicating \u201cthe amount she would be fined, the income they would lose if her husband was fired, or their assets in China for the [IJ] to assess in determining whether the threatened harm would be persecutory....\u201d Because Han did not present evidence regarding her personal financial circumstances in relation to the threatened economic harm, it was reasonable for the BIA to conclude that she did not demonstrate economic persecution. See <em>Jian Hui Shao, </em>546 F.3d at 161-61; <em>Guan Shan Liao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>293 F.3d 61, 70 (2d Cir.2002). Accordingly, a reasonable fact-finder would not be compelled to find that Han met her burden of establishing that she was forced to have an abortion, as required to establish past persecution based on an abortion. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42). We thus affirm the BIA\u2019s finding. <em>See Diallo v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 279, 287 (2d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b30-10\">Additionally, the agency did not err in finding that Han failed to meet her burden of demonstrating a well-founded fear of future persecution. To the extent Han claims that she has a well-founded fear of persecution because she might have more children, she failed to point to any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>particular evidence in the record to support her claim that her fear of future persecution was objectively reasonable. <em>See Jian Xing Huang v. INS, </em>421 F.3d 125, 129 (2d Cir.2005) (holding that, absent solid support in the record for the petitioner\u2019s assertion that he would be subjected to persecution, his fear was \u201cspeculative at best\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">Accordingly, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s determination that Han failed to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. The agency thus did not err in denying withholding of removal. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Corovic v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 90, 95 (2d Cir.2008). Because Han was unable to show the objective likelihood of persecution needed to make out a claim for withholding of removal based on her alleged forced abortion, she was necessarily unable to succeed on her claim for CAT relief, which rested on the same factual predicate. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED in part and DISMISSED in part. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DENIED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
