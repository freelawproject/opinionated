(\u201cDiversified\u201d). The Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) concluded that Diversified violated \u00a7 8(a)(1) and (3) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1), (3) (2006). The Board, by a two-member delegee group, adopted the ALJ\u2019s recommended order with minor modifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-20\">In its prior appeal to this court, the Board filed an unopposed motion to remand the case based on the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>New Process Steel, L.P. v. NLRB, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2635, 177 L.Ed.2d 162 (2010), that the Act does not authorize fewer than three members to form a valid delegee group. We granted the motion and remanded to the Board for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-23\">On remand, the Board, by a three-member panel, affirmed the ALJ\u2019s findings of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>fact and conclusions. We conclude that substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s decision. Accordingly, we grant the petition for enforcement. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal conclusions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">\n<em>PETITION GRANTED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
