Section 7491\u2019s burden-shifting framework did not apply to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>1994 deficiency, because the parties stipulated that the IRS\u2019s investigation of those deficiencies commenced prior to July 22, 1998. Nor did the Tax Court err in determining \u00a7 7491\u2019s burden shifting framework did not apply to the 1993 and 1995 deficiencies due to the Swansons\u2019 failure to introduce credible evidence and failure to cooperate with the Commissioner. The Tax Court\u2019s determination that the Swan-sons were not credible was not clearly erroneous, given (among other things), the Swansons\u2019 claim that clearly personal expenses were deductible \u201cmanagement expenses,\u201d that they relinquished their ownership interest in FSH \u201cfor nothing more than a stranger\u2019s promise of a loan,\u201d and they claimed never to have discussed tax avoidance with Evans and O\u2019Brien, despite the fact that Evans and O\u2019Brien were both convicted of promoting tax evasion schemes. <em>See Wood v. Comm\u2019r, </em>338 F.2d 602, 605 (9th Cir.1964). The Tax Court\u2019s determination that certain personal expenses were not business expenses was not contrary to the parties\u2019 stipulation. The Swansons did not identify any specific inconsistencies, and the stipulation stated that the Commissioner did not agree with the Swansons\u2019 characterization of all of their personal expenses or stipulate to the accuracy of all their exhibits. Nor did the Tax Court clearly err in determining that the Swansons were not cooperative with the Commissioner, given evidence that they brought a law suit against one IRS agent and refused to answer questions posed by his successor.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">The Tax Court did not err in holding that FSH Services lacked economic substance. <em>See Sparkman v. Comm\u2019r, </em>509 F.3d 1149, 1155 (9th Cir.2007); <em>see also Markosian v. Comm\u2019r, </em>73 T.C. 1235, 1243-45 (1980). The Tax Court\u2019s conclusions that the Swansons\u2019 relationship with FSH\u2019s property did not materially differ before and after the creation of the trust, that neither Evans nor O\u2019Brien functioned as an independent trustee, that economic benefits did not inure to other beneficiaries of the trust, and that the Swansons failed to respect the rules and restrictions of the trust were not clearly erroneous. <em>Sparkman, </em>509 F.3d at 1155. Though the Swansons offered evidence that Evans made loans in his capacity as a trustee, such loan activity was de minimis. Moreover, when Evans was caught misappropriating funds, the Swansons selected his replacement. Having determined that FSH lacked economic substance, the Tax Court did not err in attributing the income of the trust to the Swansons, rather than to Evans, because Mr. Swanson was the primary source of FSH\u2019s income. <em>Id. </em>at 1158.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">The Tax Court did not err in declining to categorize various continuing education expenses as Schedule C deductions because the Swansons did not carry their burden of demonstrating why those deductions were business expenses. <em>See New Colonial Ice Co. v. Helvering, </em>292 U.S. 435, 440, 54 S.Ct. 788, 78 L.Ed. 1348 (1934); <em>Rockwell v. Comm\u2019r, </em>512 F.2d 882, 886 (9th Cir.1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">The Tax Court did not err in holding that the 1993, 1994, and 1995 deficiency actions were timely given that the Swan-sons omitted from their gross income an amount in excess of 25 percent of the amount of gross income stated in their tax returns. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6501(e)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">The Tax Court did not err in upholding the penalties imposed under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6662 on the ground that the Swansons substantially understated their tax liability and failed to prove that they acted with reasonable cause and in good faith. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6664(c)(1). The Swansons did not carry their burden of proving they acted with due care in setting up the trust and calculating their tax liabil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>ity, and the Tax Court\u2019s determination that they were negligent and that their testimony was not credible was not clearly erroneous. <em>Sparkman, </em>509 F.3d at 1161.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Nor did the Tax Court abuse its discretion in imposing a penalty of $12,500 under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6673. <em>Larsen v. Comm\u2019r, </em>765 F.2d 939, 941 (9th Cir.1985) (per curiam). The Tax Court did not err in determining that the Swansons were maintaining frivolous or groundless positions, given that the Swansons continued to pursue litigation despite their knowledge that Evans and O\u2019Brien (co-trustees of FSH) were facing (and were eventually convicted of) criminal charges of tax fraud. Moreover, reasonable inquiry would have revealed that Evans, Cache Properties, and Martha Doerr were involved in other trust transactions that were deemed shams. <em>Cf. Wolf v. Comm\u2019r, </em>4 F.3d 709, 716 (9th Cir.1993). The Tax Court did not clearly err in finding that the Swansons\u2019s evidence and arguments did not lead to the agreed-upon reduction of their tax liabilities; rather, the reductions resulted from concessions by the Commissioner that would have occurred during the course of normal negotiations between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b607-21\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
