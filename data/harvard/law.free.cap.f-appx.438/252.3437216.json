This court must examine the basis of its jurisdiction, sua sponte, if necessary. <em>Mosley v. Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987). \u201c[T]he timely filing of a notice of appeal in a civil case is a jurisdictional requirement [and courts have] no authority to create equitable exceptions to jurisdictional requirements.\u201d <em>Bowles v. Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, 214, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007). Under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(1)(A), a notice of appeal in a civil case must be filed within 30 days after the judgment or order being appealed is entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-11\">Here, the district court\u2019s order and final judgment dismissing the case was signed February 5, 2010, 2010 WL 431962. White subsequently filed two motions attacking this order, each expressing the same grounds for disagreeing. Even liberally construing these motions as Rule 59 or 60 motions, the appeal is still untimely. The district court entered an order denying the \u201cmotion for reconsideration\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on April 8, 2010, but White\u2019s appeal was dated more than thirty days later on June 24, 2010, and filed on June 29, 2010. Accordingly, we lack jurisdiction over his appeal and it must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-15\">APPEAL DISMISSED; REQUEST FOR APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b277-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b277-13\">. Although the district court\u2019s order referred only to one motion, and White filed two, because both attacked the original order on the same grounds, the district court did not err in essentially treating the two as one. <em>See United States v. Oliver, </em>630 F.3d 397, 404 &amp; n. 3 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
