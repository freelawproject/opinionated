Because our review of the record shows that Joseph\u2019s motion to extend should have been construed as a timely notice of appeal, we vacate the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-23\">On August 18, 2010, Joseph filed a motion to revisit his conviction. The district court returned the motion as it was unsigned. Joseph then filed a motion to clarify. In an order entered September 8, 2010, the district court granted the motion to clarify but denied the motion to reopen, construing it as a successive 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 (West Supp.2011) motion. The court also denied a certificate of appealability.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-24\">On October 7, Joseph filed a motion for extension of time to file an appeal and a request for a certificate of appealability. Joseph noted that the time limit in criminal cases applied, and as such, his motion was filed within the excusable neglect period. <em>See </em>Fed. RApp. P. 4(b) (providing notice of appeal must be filed within fourteen days of judgment but may be extended for another thirty days upon a finding of excusable neglect). He asserted that his institution had been on lockdown from September 12 to September 22, preventing his timely filing. He also contended that the district court erred in recharacterizing his motion without notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-25\">On October 29, the district court denied the motion for extension of time. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>court noted that, after the lockdown was ended, Joseph still had ample time under the fourteen day appeal period in Rule 4(b)(1)(A) to file his notice of appeal. On November 12, Joseph filed a notice of appeal from the court\u2019s October 29 order. In his informal brief, Joseph asserts that the district court erred by ruling that he had not shown sufficient excusable neglect.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">The determination of whether an extension of time was even required depends on whether Joseph\u2019s motion to reopen was criminal or civil in nature, as the former provides a defendant with a fourteen-day period to file a notice of appeal, while the latter has a sixty-day appeal period. <em>See </em>Fed. RApp. P. 4(a)(1)(B), 4(b)(1)(A). Joseph\u2019s motion to extend time was filed twenty-nine days after the district court\u2019s order denying his motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">While both Joseph and the district court appear to believe that the criminal appeal period applies, we conclude that, in fact, the civil appeal period is applicable. The district court construed Joseph\u2019s motion as a successive \u00a7 2255 motion and counseled Joseph that a certificate of appealability was required. Moreover, the district court\u2019s construction was correct, as there is no criminal rule of procedure that permits a motion to reopen a sentence nearly a decade after conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">Thus, we conclude that Joseph\u2019s motion for extension of time should have been construed as a notice of appeal, as no extension was necessary and Joseph had clearly evinced a desire to appeal. If so construed, Joseph\u2019s appeal was clearly timely filed within the sixty day appeal period. As such, we vacate the order of the district court denying Joseph\u2019s motion to extend and remand with instructions to construe Joseph\u2019s motion to extend as a timely appeal of the denial of his motion to reopen. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
