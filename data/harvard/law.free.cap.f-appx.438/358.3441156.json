At that time, the Local Union also had jurisdiction over a facility in Batavia, Ohio (\u201cBatavia Plant\u201d), which was owned by ZF Batavia LLC (\u201cZF\u201d), and operated as a joint enterprise with Ford. The Batavia Plant workers were employed either by Ford and subject to the Ford CBA, or by ZF and subject to a collective bargaining agreement between ZF and the Local Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">In 2001, Plaintiffs were laid off by Ford, and subsequently became aware of other jobs with Ford outside of the jurisdiction of the Local Union. According to Plaintiffs, Local Union officials encouraged them to take the work, stating that doing so was the best way to maintain their seniority. The officials advised Plaintiffs that they could eventually return to the Sharonville Plant simply by signing a \u201cReturn-to-Basic Unit\u201d form, and waiting to be recalled in order of seniority from a \u201creturn home list.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">In December of 2001, Evans and Lewis began work at a Michigan truck facility, which was under the jurisdiction of UAW Local 900. Similarly, in September of 2002, Ogle began work at a Kentucky truck facility, which was under the jurisdiction of UAW Local 862. It does not appear that Plaintiffs paid dues directly to the Local Union during this time, but rather the new local unions withdrew union dues from their paychecks. The record does not reflect whether the new local unions remitted any of the dues to the Local Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">According to Plaintiffs, they never paid an initiation fee to the new local unions, nor did they ever deposit an honorable withdrawal transfer card (\u201cWithdrawal Card\u201d), an item not well defined in the record, with the new local unions. In fact, according to Plaintiffs, the Local Union never issued a Withdrawal Card to Plaintiffs. This fact is corroborated by the president of the Local Union, Phyllis Blust, who explained in an affidavit that it is not the practice of the Local Union to issue such a card to a member who is laid off. Blust also explained that the Local Union does not require individuals from other local unions to deposit a Withdrawal Card or pay an initiation fee to transfer into the Local Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">In June 2004, Plaintiffs Lewis and Evans returned to attend a Local Union membership meeting. They were introduced as the \u201cboys from Michigan truck,\u201d and allege that they participated during the meeting by, among other things, voting on issues presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-10\">In late 2004, ZF transferred ownership of the Batavia Plant to Ford. Under a Transition Agreement between ZF and Ford, ZF Employees would maintain their seniority, but be employed by Ford. This would give ZF Employees \u201cretroactive seniority\u201d with Ford, and place some of them ahead of existing Ford employees, including Plaintiffs, in terms of seniority. In meetings held during September 2004, ZF Employees voted to approve the Transition Agreement. According to Plaintiffs, Ford Employees, including Plaintiffs, were excluded from attending the meetings or voting on the Transition Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-11\">At some point after the disputed vote, Plaintiffs were each recalled to the Sharonville Plant, and subsequently transferred to the Batavia Plant. But sometime in 2006, Plaintiffs were again laid off by Ford, at which point \u201cPlaintiffs learned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>that ZF [E]mployees had not been laid off even though they had been Ford employees for a shorter period of time.\u201d (Pis.\u2019 Br. at 47.)</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">On November 9, 2006, Plaintiffs filed a complaint against Defendants in the district court, alleging violations of the Labor Management Report and Disclosure Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 401 <em>et seq. </em>(\u201cLMRDA\u201d), in connection with the vote on the Transition Agreement. The litigation was stayed for nearly two years pending an internal union appeal\u2014details of which are not contained in the record\u2014but once the stay was lifted, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on April 10, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">On June 5, 2009, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss, asserting that Plaintiffs were not members of the Local Union at the time of the disputed vote. Three days later, Plaintiffs served Defendants with discovery requests. Defendants did not respond, but instead sought a protective order that would stay discovery. On June 30, 2009, Plaintiffs responded to the motion to dismiss. Both parties asked the district court to consider matters outside of the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">On July 28, 2009, Plaintiffs filed a motion for discovery pursuant to Rule 56(d), seeking discovery into the issue of membership, among other topics. On January 5, 2010, the district court simultaneously converted Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss into one for summary judgment; denied Plaintiffs\u2019 Rule 56(d) motion as futile; granted summary judgment for Defendants on the basis that Plaintiffs were not members of the Local Union at the time of the disputed vote and thus lacked standing under the LMRDA; and denied as moot Defendants\u2019 motion for a protective order.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">On appeal, Plaintiffs argue that the district court abused its discretion by granting Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment prior to any discovery. Plaintiffs contend that without a reasonable opportunity for discovery, they were unable to present evidence that would be material to their opposition to Defendants\u2019 motion. Defendants respond that the district court did not abuse its discretion; according to Defendants, Plaintiffs\u2019 request for discovery was vague, and no genuine issues of material fact remained outstanding that would have required discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-10\">Because we find that it was an abuse of discretion, under the circumstances of this case, to enter summary judgment prior to any discovery, we VACATE the grant of summary judgment, and REMAND with instructions to permit reasonable discovery consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-11\">Prior to the entry of summary judgment, Plaintiffs requested leave to take discovery pursuant to Rule 56(d), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-12\">If a nonmovant shows by affidavit or declaration that, for specified reasons, it cannot present facts essential to justify its opposition, the court may:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-13\">(1) defer considering the motion or deny it;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-14\">(2) allow time to obtain affidavits or declarations or to take discovery; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-15\">(3) issue any other appropriate order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-16\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(d). The district court denied Plaintiffs\u2019 request for discovery, and we review for an abuse of discretion. <em>See CenTra, Inc. v. Estrin, </em>538 F.3d 402, 419 (6th Cir.2008). \u201cAn abuse of discretion occurs when the reviewing court is left with the definite and firm conviction that the trial court committed a clear error of judgment.\u201d <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>521 F.3d 636, 648 (6th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>In reviewing the denial of a motion for discovery, we consider a number of factors, including: \u201c(1) when the appellant learned of the issue that is the subject of the desired discovery; (2) whether the desired discovery would have changed the ruling below; (3) how long the discovery period had lasted; (4) whether the appellant was dilatory in its discovery efforts; and (5) whether the appellee was responsive to discovery requests.\u201d <em>CenTra, </em>538 F.3d at 420 (quoting <em>Plott v. Gen. Motors Corp, </em>71 F.3d 1190, 1196-97 (6th Cir.1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Having reviewed the record, we are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court abused its discretion. A straight-forward application of the factors set forth above compels our conclusion. Because the district court permitted no discovery whatsoever, the first and third factors weigh in Plaintiffs\u2019 favor. The fourth factor is inapplicable, and the fifth factor weighs in Plaintiffs\u2019 favor because Defendants failed to respond to Plaintiffs\u2019 discovery requests and instead sought a protective order to stay discovery. Additionally, the second factor, as explained below, weighs in Plaintiffs\u2019 favor because Plaintiffs sought evidence that would be germane to the summary judgment motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">This case presents no compelling reason to depart from the oft-repeated rule in this Circuit that \u201cwhen the parties have no opportunity for discovery, denying the Rule 56[ (d) ] motion and ruling on a summary judgment motion is likely to be an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(collecting cases). Although a district court ordinarily does not abuse its discretion in denying a Rule 56(d) request that is \u201ctoo vague,\u201d the district court in this case did not deny the motion on that basis. Instead, the district court reasoned only that \u201cthere were no questions of fact which needed to be resolved in discovery for a decision on Defendants\u2019 Motion.\u201d This was legal error insofar as an inadequate record prevented appropriate consideration of the motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">We recognize that case law governing standing under the LMRDA is somewhat sparse. We nonetheless believe that some measure of discovery was necessary in this case to properly define and present the issues to be considered on summary judgment. Given the dearth of case law in this area, we briefly explain why the evidentiary record before the district court was insufficient to permit a grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">Section 411 of Title 29 of the U.S.Code establishes a \u201cunion bill of rights.\u201d <em>Hooks v. Truck Drivers, Chauffeurs &amp; Helpers, Local 100, </em>39 Fed.Appx. 309, 312 (6th Cir.2002). The Section provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-10\">Every member of a labor organization shall have equal rights and privileges within such organization to nominate candidates, to vote in elections or referendums of the labor organization, to attend membership meetings, and to participate in the deliberations and voting upon the business of such meetings, subject to reasonable rules and regulations in such organization\u2019s constitution and bylaws.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-11\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 411(a)(1). It is well settled that only a \u201cmember of a labor organization\u201d has standing to enforce the rights guaranteed by \u00a7 411. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 411, 412; <em>United Bhd. of Carpenters &amp; Joiners of Am., Dresden Local No. 267 v. Ohio Carpenters Health &amp; Welfare Fund, </em>926 F.2d 550, 556 (6th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-12\">Under the statute, a \u201cmember\u201d is defined as \u201c[(1)] any person who has fulfilled the requirements for membership in [a labor] organization, and [ (2) ] who neither has voluntarily withdrawn from mem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>bership nor has been [appropriately] expelled or suspended from membership.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(o). In considering an individual\u2019s membership status, courts defer to the internal rules of the union, so long as those rules are reasonable. <em>See, e.g., Hooks, </em>39 Fed.Appx. at 312; <em>Taylor v. Great Lakes Seamen\u2019s Union, Local 5000, United Steelworkers of Am., </em>701 F.2d 590 (6th Cir.1983) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">The first question is whether Plaintiffs have fulfilled the requirements of membership in the Local Union. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(o). This question is answered by looking to the internal rules and regulations of the UAW pertaining to membership. Under Article 6, \u00a7 2 of the UAW Constitution:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-5\">Any person eligible to become a member of the International Union ... may apply for membership to the Local Union having jurisdiction over the workplace in which s/he is employed. The applicant must, at the time of the application, be an actual worker in and around the workplace. All applicants for membership in any Local Union of the International Union shall fill out an official application ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-6\"><em>{See </em>UAW Const, art. 6, \u00a7 2.) This section seems to make membership in a local union contingent upon the applicant maintaining a job within the local union\u2019s jurisdiction \u201cat the time of the application.\u201d Whether another provision of the UAW Constitution would operate differently, or whether there is a \u201clong established, consistently applied policy that continued employment ... is a condition of retention of union membership,\u201d <em>Dale v. Major League Umpire\u2019s Ass\u2019n, </em>No. 85-2669, 1986 WL 2883, at *4 (E.D.Pa. Mar.5, 1986), are questions of fact to be discovered, if at all, on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">It is true, as the district court noted, that Article 6, \u00a7 10 of the UAW Constitution provides that \u201c[n]o member shall be allowed to hold membership in more than one (1) Local Union [ ] at the same time[.]\u201d But \u00a7 10 on its face does not purport to resolve the choice between competing local unions; nor does it suggest that the remedy for a violation is expulsion from one of the competing local unions. More fundamentally, in this case, it is unclear whether \u00a7 10 even applies, as discovery is needed to determine whether Plaintiffs ever attained membership in the new local unions, or whether the new local unions regarded Plaintiffs as having attained membership.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">The district court recognized that the UAW Constitution provides that a member \u201cshall establish her/his membership in another UAW Local Union by either\u201d paying an initiation fee and dues, or \u201cobtaining an honorable withdrawal transfer card and depositing same immediately in such other UAW Local Union.\u201d (UAW Const, art. 17, \u00a7 3.) But Plaintiffs did neither, and therefore the question remains of whether the Plaintiffs continued to be members of the Local Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-10\">On this question, the district court concluded that Plaintiffs became members of the new local unions \u201cwhen Plaintiffs left the jurisdiction\u201d of Local 863. The district court did not address the initiation fee, and summarily dismissed the Withdrawal Card procedures as a \u201cmere formality,\u201d reasoning that \u201cit is not the actual issuance of the card which determines membership.\u201d Such a conclusion, however, cannot be upheld on the basis of a plain reading of either UAW Constitution or the official interpretation thereof, as neither addresses whether an individual\u2019s membership in a local union automatically terminates upon taking work within the jurisdiction of another local union without actual receipt and delivery of the Withdrawal Card.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-11\">In support of its conclusion, the district court relied heavily on the purported inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>pretation of the UAW Constitution offered by Blust. This was likely error; as Defendants\u2019 counsel conceded at oral argument, it is doubtful that Blust, as an official with the Local Union, has the authority to interpret the International Union\u2019s Constitution. Discovery is needed on that point. Discovery may also be needed to illuminate the significance of Withdrawal Cards, the Local Union\u2019s failure to issue such cards, and Plaintiffs\u2019 resulting inability to accept and deposit such cards in the new local unions, as apparently contemplated by the UAW Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">If Plaintiffs have fulfilled the requirements of membership in the Local Union, the second question is whether Plaintiffs have \u201cvoluntarily withdrawn from membership [or] been expelled or suspended from membership after appropriate proceedings.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(o). Defendants limit their argument to voluntarily withdrawal. According to Defendants, Plaintiffs voluntarily withdrew by accepting work outside of the jurisdiction; by not paying dues to the Local Union; and by affirmatively paying dues to the new local unions.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">It is unclear whether the district court reached this question. Voluntary withdrawal from membership in a local union is expressly governed by Article 6, \u00a7 17 of the UAW Constitution. Section 17 states that a member in a local union \u201cmay resign or terminate membership only by written communication, signed by the member, to the Financial Secretary of the Local Union.\u201d (UAW Const, art. 6, \u00a7 17.) Discovery may be necessary to determine whether and to what extent \u00a7 17 would operate in this case, and whether any other rules or policies govern voluntarily withdrawal.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">If Plaintiffs could voluntarily withdraw from membership by taking actions inconsistent with membership, as Defendants appear to argue, further factual development is necessary prior to the consideration of summary judgment on this basis. For example, relevant inquiry may be necessary into union dues and initiation fees; membership records maintained by the Local Union, new local unions, and/or International Union; Plaintiffs\u2019 participation, if any, as members of the new local unions or as members of the Local Union while outside of the jurisdiction; communication between any of various parties and relevant non-parties; and the nature and substance of Plaintiffs\u2019 underlying union grievance(s).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">With regard to union dues specifically, there is the question of whether Plaintiffs paid dues to any local union during their period of layoff. If they did, there is the question of which local unions were paid dues and whether the local unions receiving the dues subsequently transferred any portion of the dues to another local union. If Plaintiffs did not pay dues to the Local Union while working outside of the jurisdiction, then one must consider whether this had any consequence under the UAW Constitution, particularly where the Constitution distinguishes between <em>members </em>and <em>members in good standing. (See, e.g., </em>UAW Const, art. 16, \u00a7 8 (stating that failure to pay dues will result in loss of \u201cgood standing membership\u201d).) There is also the question of whether Plaintiffs paid dues to the Local Union upon their recall to the Sharonville Plant. These questions should be explored on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b387-11\">Because the district court, under the circumstances of this case, abused its discretion by entering summary judgment prior to any discovery whatsoever, we VACATE the grant of summary judgment, and REMAND with instructions to permit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>reasonable discovery consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b382-19\">. A fourth individual, Richard Thomason, was listed as a Plaintiff in the Complaint, but the district court dismissed him from the case, and he is not a party to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b388-7\">. Contrary to the concurrence, the majority expresses no view on the merits of Plaintiffs\u2019 claims. We simply note that Plaintiffs\u2019 claims raise numerous questions of law and fact that the district court, or the jury, may be asked to resolve. <em>See Chisom v. Roemer, </em>501 U.S. 380, 403, 111 S.Ct. 2354, 115 L.Ed.2d 348 (1991) (stating that the existence of complicated questions of fact \"cannot justify a judicially created limitation\" on a broadly worded remedial statute). Whether Plaintiffs must show, as the concurrence contends, that the result of the disputed election would have been different is a question that is not before us and on which we do not opine.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b388-4\">McKEAGUE, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AUk\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Plaintiffs claim that they were deprived of the right to vote on whether to approve the Ford-ZF Transition Agreement. But they were not the only ones denied this chance to vote\u2014only ZF employees participated, and thus all Ford employees were excluded. While I concur fully in the majority\u2019s conclusion that there are factual disputes that should be explored in discovery, I question whether these entire proceedings are ultimately futile.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">I find it hard to imagine how Plaintiffs could ever recover if they don\u2019t now seek a new vote or to otherwise \u201cundo\u201d the merger. They would presumably have to identify all who would have been eligible if Ford employees had been included; contact this wide-ranging group of people individually; and seek to prove, three years later, how they would have voted. I am not aware of any legal authority, and plaintiff has not cited any, that sanctions such an \u201cafter the fact\u201d inquiry as to how a person would have voted, as opposed to conducting a new vote, which plaintiffs expressly decline to seek. Is an affidavit from each putative voter sufficient? Or would cross-examination be required? Are Local 863 and Ford entitled to communicate with each Ford employee who did not vote, to give their perspective and explain the consequences (whatever they may be) of such a now-advisory vote? If, and only if, they overcome these legal and practical hurdles-and presumably many more\u2014and then can prove that the negative votes would have changed the outcome of the Agreement\u2019s approval, can they obtain back-wages as they now seek to do. Practically speaking, they cannot meet this burden.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
