Stat. Saettele asserts her counsel did not have clear and unequivocal authority to settle the case for $60,000. Saettele also contends there was no meeting of the minds as to an essential term of the agreement, as the parties failed to agree regarding the terms of the release.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After review, we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">We review the district court\u2019s decision to enforce a settlement agreement for an abuse of discretion. <em>Hayes v. Nat\u2019l Serv. Indus., </em>196 F.3d 1252, 1254 (11th Cir.1999). We refer to state law principles when reviewing the scope of an attorney\u2019s authority to enter into a settlement agreement. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b774-9\">Under Florida law, the \u201cparty seeking to enforce a settlement agreement bears the burden of showing that the attorney proposing the settlement had the clear and unequivocal authority from his client to do so.\u201d <em>Hamilton v. Fla. Power &amp; Light Co., </em>48 So.3d 170, 171-72 (Fla. 4th DCA 2010); <em>see also Murchison v. Grand Cypress Hotel Corp., </em>13 F.3d 1483, 1485-87 (11th Cir.1994) (applying Florida\u2019s \u201cclear and unequivocal authority\u201d standard). \u201cThe trial court\u2019s factual findings that there was a clear and unequivocal grant of authority must be supported by competent, substantial evidence in order to be upheld on appeal.\u201d <em>Hamilton, </em>48 So.3d at 172. The mere representation by an attorney does not give the attorney the implied or apparent authority to settle her client\u2019s claim. <em>Johnson v. Skarvan, </em>992 So.2d 873, 875 (Fla. 5th DCA 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-10\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in enforcing the settlement agreement, as Saettele admitted she gave her attorney permission to settle the case for $60,000. Further, Maronda Homes agreed to waive the disputed written release terms, such that Saettele will not be bound to any term to which she did not agree at the time of settling her case for $60,000. Thus, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b774-8\">. As an initial matter, Maronda Homes contends this appeal is moot because Saettele accepted the benefits of the settlement agreement by depositing the settlement check. We have held, however, ''[m]erely accepting the [settlement] payment, without evidence of some intent to end the litigation,\u201d does not waive the right to appeal. <em>Ass\u2019n for Disabled. Americans, Inc. v. Integra Resort Mgmt., Inc., </em>387 F.3d 1241, 1243 (11th Cir.2004). Here, the record demonstrates Saettele expressed her intent to receive the payment as ordered by the district court, and believed she could appeal the judgment despite that fact. In the district court, Saettele argued Maronda Homes was required to provide the check to her, as she did not want to risk Maronda Homes becoming insolvent or bankrupt during the pendency of the appeal. Under these facts, Maronda Homes had notice of the fact that Saettele did not intend for the acceptance of the settlement check to waive her right to an appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
