(\u201cFalcon\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s: (1) decision after a bench trial that Publishers Service, Inc. (\u201cPublishers\u201d) was not liable for copyright infringement and (2) denial of Falcon\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-16\">First, Falcon contends that the district court erred by rejecting its copyright infringement claim after finding that Falcon impliedly granted Publishers a nonexclusive license to publish its images.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Following a bench trial, we review the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error. <em>See Zivkovic v. S. Cal. Edison Co., </em>302 F.3d 1080, 1088 (9th Cir.2002). We also apply the clear error standard to factual inquiries that apply the law to the facts. <em>Saltarelli v. Bob Baker Grp. Med. Trust, </em>35 F.3d 382, 384 (9th Cir.1994) We review de novo the district court\u2019s conclusions of law. <em>Id. </em>at 385.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-17\">A copyright owner has the sole rights to copy, distribute, or display its copyrighted work. 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 106 (2006). Transfers of copyright ownership, including when a copyright owner exclusively licenses the copyrighted work to another, must be in writing. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 101, 204(a). However, a nonexclusive license is not considered a transfer of ownership under \u00a7 101 and may be agreed to orally or implied through conduct. <em>See Effects Assocs., Inc. v. Cohen, </em>908 F.2d 555, 558 (9th Cir.1990); <em>Oddo v. Ries, </em>743 F.2d 630, 634 (9th Cir.1984). \u201cGenerally, a \u2018copyright owner who grants a nonexclusive license to use his copyrighted material waives his right to sue the licensee for copyright infringement\u2019 and can sue only for breach of contract.\u201d <em>Sun Microsystems, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp., </em>188 F.3d 1115, 1121 (9th Cir.1999) (quoting <em>Graham v. James, </em>144 F.3d 229, 236 (2d Cir.1998)); 3 <em>Nimmer on Copyrights </em>\u00a7 10.15[A][1].</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>This Court held in <em>Effects </em>that an implied grant of a nonexclusive license to use a copyrighted work precludes a copyright infringement claim. 908 F.2d at 559. Both <em>Effects </em>and this case involved copyrighted material delivered to a recipient with the intent that the recipient copy and distribute it. <em>See id. </em>at 555-56. In both cases, the recipient allegedly used the material without full payment. <em>See id. </em>Although Falcon did not produce its content at Publishers\u2019 specific request, as was the case with the parties in <em>Effects, </em>for years Falcon sent images to satisfy Publishers\u2019 ongoing demand for content and Publishers regularly published the content that Falcon supplied. <em>Id. </em>at 558-59.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">The parties\u2019 conduct demonstrates that Falcon granted Publishers an ongoing nonexclusive implied license to use its content for a fee. <em>See id. </em>at 558-59. Falcon\u2019s claim that Publishers needed an express license for each image that Publishers published is contradicted by the frequent and informal interactions between the parties. Most images that Falcon submitted to Publishers, including the sets that Falcon based its copyright infringement lawsuit on, were previously published \u201csecond rights\u201d images worth little and offered to Publishers without any restrictions or promises of exclusivity. Falcon never declined to give Publishers a nonexclusive license to publish its images, which supports Publishers\u2019 contention that over time Falcon had granted it an implied license. As Publishers owed Falcon payment only after it published Falcon\u2019s copyrighted images, its obligation to pay constituted a covenant, rather than a condition precedent that would give rise to a copyright infringement lawsuit. <em>See Effects, </em>908 F.2d at 558-59. <em>Effects </em>controls here and the district court correctly found that Publishers was not liable for copyright infringement because Falcon granted Publishers an implied nonexclusive license to publish its images. <em>See id. </em>at 559. The district court correctly characterized Publishers\u2019 failure to pay Falcon after publication as a contract breach and awarded Publishers all damages to which it was entitled.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">Second, Falcon contends that the district court erred by dismissing Falcon\u2019s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment despite Publishers\u2019 untimely responses to Falcon\u2019s First Set of Requests for Admissions. We review a denial of partial summary judgment de novo. <em>See Aguilera v. Alaska Juris F/V, O.N. 569276, </em>535 F.3d 1007, 1009 (9th Cir.2008). Evidentiary rulings made in the summary judgment context are reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Fonseca v. Sysco Food Serv. of Ariz., Inc., </em>374 F.3d 840, 845 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">A district court must grant summary judgment if the pleadings and supporting documents, viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, demonstrate that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56; <em>see Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322-23, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). The moving party must identify \u201cthe portions of the materials on file that it believes demonstrate the absence of any genuine issue of material <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>fact.\u201d <em>T.W. Elec. Serv., Inc. v. Pac. Elec. Contractors Ass\u2019n, </em>809 F.2d 626, 630 (9th Cir.1987). The Central District of California requires all summary judgment motions to include a statement of undisputed facts. C.D. Cal. R. 56-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">The district court appropriately denied Falcon\u2019s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment without prejudice based on its findings that Falcon failed to properly serve the motion and to offer sufficient evidentiary support by neglecting to submit a statement of undisputed facts or the First Set of Requests for Admissions. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56; C.D. Cal. R. 56-1. The district court\u2019s reasons for denying Falcon\u2019s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment were unrelated to whether or not Falcon\u2019s First Set of Requests for Admissions were deemed admitted. <em>See id. </em>Falcon\u2019s argument that the district court erred by denying its Motion for Partial Summary Judgment without prejudice is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b604-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b604-18\">. The parties are familiar with the factual and procedural history of this case and we do not recount it in detail here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b605-6\">. Falcon also contends that Publishers would have been liable for copyright infringement had Publishers\u2019 responses to Falcon's First Set of Requests for Admissions been deemed admitted. Falcon\u2019s requests sought an admission that Publishers \"did not issue a purchase order to Plaintiff Falcon to obtain a license from Plaintiff Falcon that would permit the publication of the depiction[s].\u201d This inquiry was only relevant to whether Publishers had obtained an <em>express license </em>to publish the images. By contrast, the district court correctly held that Publishers had an <em>implied license </em>to publish Falcon\u2019s images.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
