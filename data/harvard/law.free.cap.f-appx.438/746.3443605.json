On appeal, he argues that the district court failed to apply the actual innocence exception to the procedural default rule and that he is \u201cactually innocent\u201d of being a career offender. Additionally, Bido argues that his motion asserted a constitutional violation because the district court violated his due process rights in two ways. First, he argues that his due process rights were violated because he was sentenced in excess of the ten-year statutory maximum due to the district court\u2019s incorrect application of the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d). Second, he argues that the sentence the court imposed violated his due process rights because he was not a career offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-16\">In a proceeding on a motion to vacate, set aside, or correct sentence, the district court\u2019s factual findings are reviewed for clear error while legal issues are reviewed <em>de novo. Lynn v. United States, </em>365 F.3d 1225, 1232 (11th Cir.2004). We liberally construe <em>pro se </em>pleadings. <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998). Appellate review of an unsuccessful \u00a7 2255 motion generally is limited to the issues specified in the certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d). <em>Murray v. United States, </em>145 F.3d 1249, 1250-51 (11th Cir.1998). However, threshold procedural issues that must be resolved before we can reach the underlying claim are presumed to be encompassed within the COA. <em>See McCoy v. United States, </em>266 F.3d 1245, 1248 n. 2 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-17\">A prisoner in federal custody may file a motion to vacate, set aside, or correct sentence \u201cclaiming the right to be released upon the ground that the sentence was imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States, or that the court was without jurisdiction to impose such sentence, or that the sentence was in excess of the maximum authorized by law, or is otherwise subject to collateral attack.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(a). Unless the claimed error involves a lack of jurisdiction or a constitutional violation, however, \u00a7 2255 relief is limited. <em>United States v. Addoni</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number><em>zio, </em>442 U.S. 178, 185, 99 S.Ct. 2235, 2240, 60 L.Ed.2d 805 (1979). Generally, a non-constitutional error of law will only form the basis for \u00a7 2255 relief if it constitutes a \u201cfundamental defect which inherently results in a complete miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 185, 99 S.Ct. at 2240 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">Under the career offender guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, a defendant is sentenced as a career offender if, among other requirements, he has at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense. Similarly, the ACCA enhances federal felon-in-possession sentences when the defendant has at least three prior convictions for either a violent felony or a serious drug offense. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). We have held that the definition of a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the Sentencing Guidelines and a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA are \u201cvirtually identical.\u201d <em>United States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347, 1352 (11th Cir.2008). Following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008), which narrowed the definition of a violent felony under the ACCA, we held that the crime of carrying a concealed firearm could no longer be considered a crime of violence under the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>Archer, </em>531 F.3d at 1352.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">In general, a criminal defendant who fails to object at trial, or to raise an issue on direct appeal, is procedurally barred from raising the claim in a \u00a7 2255 motion, absent a showing of cause and prejudice or a fundamental miscarriage of justice. <em>United States v. Frady, </em>456 U.S. 152, 167-68, 102 S.Ct. 1584, 1594, 71 L.Ed.2d 816 (1982). However, he can show a fundamental miscarriage of justice and overcome the procedural bar by showing that he is \u201cactually innocent.\u201d <em>See Bousley v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 614, 623, 118 S.Ct. 1604, 1611, 140 L.Ed.2d 828 (1998). Although the COA did not identify Bido\u2019s procedural default as an issue for review, a movant generally is not entitled to review of procedurally-defaulted claims. <em>See Frady, </em>456 U.S. at 167-68, 102 S.Ct. at 1594. Therefore, we must consider whether the actual innocence exception applies to excuse Bido\u2019s procedural default. <em>See McCoy, </em>266 F.3d at 1248 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-9\">Bido argues that the district court failed to apply the actual innocence exception and, relying on the panel opinion in <em>Gilbert v. United States, </em>609 F.3d 1159 (11th Cir.2010) <em>(\u201cGilbert I </em>\u201d), <em>rev\u2019d en banc, </em>640 F.3d 1293 (11th Cir.2011) <em>(\u201cGilbert II\u201d), </em>claims that he is \u201cactually innocent\u201d of being a career offender. However, our recent <em>en banc </em>decision in <em>Gilbert II </em>forecloses this argument for two reasons. First, Gilbert also had argued that he was actually innocent of being a career offender, but we categorically rejected that claim, explaining that Gilbert was neither charged with, nor convicted of, being a career offender. <em>Gilbert II, </em>640 F.3d at 1304-05. Second, in order <em>to </em>invoke the actual innocence exception to the procedural default rule, a petitioner must show that his conviction resulted from a constitutional violation. <em>Id. </em>at 1305; <em>Johnson v. Fla. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>513 F.3d 1328, 1334 (11th Cir.2008). However, a petitioner\u2019s claim that a Sentencing Guideline provision was misapplied to him at sentencing is not a constitutional claim. <em>Gilbert II, </em>640 F.3d at 1306. Accordingly, the actual innocence exception does not apply to Bido. Because Bido has not demonstrated a fundamental miscarriage of justice to excuse his procedural default, we decline to reach the merits of his procedurally-defaulted claim, and we affirm the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>trict court\u2019s order denying his \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
