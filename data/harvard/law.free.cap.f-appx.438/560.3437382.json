We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, and grant the petition for review and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-21\">We review the agency\u2019s factual findings for substantial evidence and its legal conclusions <em>de novo. Viridiana v. Holder, </em>630 F.3d 942, 945 (9th Cir.2011). Where, as here, the agency did not make an express adverse credibility finding, the petitioner\u2019s testimony is accepted as true. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b584-22\">Soni demonstrated that she suffered persecution when three Punjab police officers detained, raped, and beat her following her arrest at a student political rally, and afterwards continued to seek her at her family\u2019s home. She is therefore entitled to a presumption that she would suffer persecution if she returned to India. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(1). The government bears the burden of rebutting that presumption by a preponderance of the evidence to show that Soni could safely and reasonably relocate in India. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(l)(ii); <em>Afriyie v. Holder, </em>613 F.3d 924, 934 (9th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-23\">The IJ\u2019s conclusion that the government rebutted the presumption by showing that internal relocation would be both safe and reasonable for Soni is not supported by substantial evidence. Although the IJ pointed to some evidence that Soni could safely relocate, the country reports on which he relied are inconclusive, and do not, by themselves, constitute substantial evidence. In addition, the IJ erroneously found that Soni\u2019s continued presence in India indicated she could safely relocate, when in fact the Punjab police continued to seek Soni at her family\u2019s home until she left India. Because Soni did not remain in India without incident, her continued presence there does not rebut the presumption <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>of a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1245 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Moreover, in addressing the reasonableness of relocation, the IJ sidestepped the difficulties a single Indian woman such as Soni would face in relocating in India by-suggesting that Soni\u2019s husband could move to India with her. The record is devoid of evidence that Soni\u2019s husband could relocate with her in India, and the IJ\u2019s decision completely ignores evidence that Soni and her husband have two U.S. citizen children. The IJ\u2019s failure to properly address the cultural restraints and familial ties factors requires remand. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(3); <em>Afriyie, </em>613 F.3d at 935.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Accordingly, we grant the petition for review and remand for further proceedings in which Soni\u2019s continued presence in India after her detention and rape shall not be deemed evidence that she could safely relocate. On remand, the agency shall also address the cultural restraints and familial ties factors, placing the burden on the government to show Soni\u2019s husband could relocate with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b584-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
