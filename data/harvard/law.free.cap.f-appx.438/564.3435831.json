The trial court denied his <em>pro se </em>motion for an independent medical expert to help him evaluate the medical tests on which the victim\u2019s attending physicians relied to testify that the injuries sustained were serious and consistent with battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">The Idaho Court of Appeals assumed for purposes of its decision that an indigent criminal defendant\u2019s right to expert assistance as set forth in <em>Ake v. Oklahoma, </em>470 U.S. 68, 105 S.Ct. 1087, 84 L.Ed.2d 53 (1985), applies to medical experts, but found the <em>Ake </em>claim meritless. The state court explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-10\">the State presented uncontroverted testimony that Menniek exerted great force on the victim\u2019s body; indeed Menniek conceded that he punched and kicked the man. The State introduced photographs showing the victim\u2019s bloodied and lacerated head. Then an objective doctor\u2014the treating physician, not an expert retained by the State\u2014described three different kinds of bleeding in the victim\u2019s brain. The jury learned that treating emergency room physicians had believed the victim\u2019s injuries were severe enough to warrant transfer to a facility better equipped to cope with serious brain trauma, and doctors opined that the injuries could have been life threatening, both individually and in the aggregate. It is extremely unlikely that an independent medical expert could have helped Menniek rebut the objective evidence that the victim suffered brain trauma or the straightforward medical diagnoses of the victim\u2019s treating physician.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-13\">We agree that the probable value of expert assistance in this case was minimal and that the risk of error in the trial outcome by declining to appoint an expert was negligible. Because the state court\u2019s decision was neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as determined by the Supreme Court, we affirm the conviction. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b589-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
