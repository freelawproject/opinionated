Sperling, </em>506 F.2d 1323, 1344 (2d Cir.1974) (\u201cThe record shows that Sperling was the operational kingpin of a highly organized, structured and on-going narcotics network.\u201d). Sperling, now age seventy-two, is currently serving the sentence at FCI-Allenwood in Pennsylvania. In January 2010, he filed a pro se petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, claiming that the Bureau of Prisons (\u201cBOP\u201d) has improperly deemed him ineligible for the Elderly Offender Home Detention Pilot Program (\u201cEOHDPP\u201d) because he is serving a sentence of life imprisonment. The District Court denied the habeas petition, concluding that Sperling is prohibited by statute, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 17541(g), from eligibility for the EOHDPP, and that the BOP has reasonably construed the governing statute to exclude life-sentenced inmates. Sperling timely filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">We have appellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s legal conclusions. <em>Woodall v. Fed. Bur. of Prisons, </em>432 F.3d 235, 239 n. 3 (3d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">The Second Chance Act of 2007 established the EOHDPP by directing the Attorney General to conduct a two-year pilot program \u201cto determine the effectiveness of removing <em>eligible elderly offenders </em>from a [BOP] facility and placing such offenders on home detention until expiration of the prison term to which the offender was sentenced.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 17541(g)(1)(A) (emphasis added). The sole question here is whether Sperling is an \u201celigible elderly offender\u201d despite serving a term of life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">The statute defines \u201celigible elderly offender\u201d to require that an inmate meet several criteria in order to participate in the pilot program, including the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-8\">The term \u201celigible elderly offender\u201d means an offender in the custody of the Bureau of Prisons\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-9\">(i) who is not less than 65 years of age; [and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-10\">(ii) who is serving a term of imprisonment <em>that is not life imprisonment </em>based on conviction for an offense or offenses that do not include any crime of violence ..., sex offense ..., offense described in section 2332b(g)(5)(B) of title 18, United States Code, or offense under chapter 37 of title 18, United States Code ..., and has served the greater of 10 years or 75 percent of the term of imprisonment to which the offender was sentenced[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-11\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 17541(g)(5)(A)(ii) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-12\">On February 5, 2009, the BOP issued Operations Memorandum No. 003-2009 (5392) to provide guidance to its staff in administering the EOHDPP. The Memorandum explains that inmates must meet all statutory eligibility criteria to participate in the EOHDPP. With regard to life sentences, the Memorandum explains that \u201c[i]nmates serving life sentences are not eligible to participate in the pilot program because it is not possible to calculate 75% of a life sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b93-13\">Sperling argues that the BOP has erred in determining eligibility for the EOHDPP because, as he reads \u00a7 17541(g)(5)(A)(ii), Congress did not exclude life-sentenced inmates per se, but rather identified only certain crimes for which a life sentence bars eligibility, such as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d or \u201csex offense.\u201d Sperling thus argues that his life sentence does not render him ineligible under \u00a7 17541(g)(5)(A)(ii). Sperling\u2019s argument, however, turns on an insupportable construction of the statutory language.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>Section 17541(g)(5)(A)(ii) provides in relevant part that an eligible offender is one \u201cserving a term of imprisonment that is not life imprisonment based on conviction for an offense or offenses that do not include any crime of violence, [sex offense, and other specified offense.]\u201d The phrase \u201cthat is not life imprisonment\u201d clearly modifies \u201cterm of imprisonment\u201d so as to provide that only those offenders serving a term of imprisonment that is not for life (and those serving a term of imprisonment for offenses that do not include any crime of violence or other listed offenses) are eligible for the EOHDPP. The statute is not phrased, as Sperling would have it, to grant eligibility to inmates serving life terms so long as the life term was not imposed upon conviction for any crime of violence or other offense listed in the statute. That is not a natural or even plausible reading of the statutory language.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">\u201cIf the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter; for the court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.\u201d <em>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 887, 842-43, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984); <em>see Madison v. Resources for Human Dev., Inc., </em>233 F.3d 175, 185 (3d Cir.2000) (\u201cIt is well-settled that if a statute unambiguously expresses Congress\u2019s intent, courts must give effect to that intent.\u201d). The District Court properly concluded that Sperling is entitled to no relief in light of the expressed intent in \u00a7 17541(g)(5)(A)(ii) to exclude life-sentenced inmates from the definition of \u201celigible elderly offender.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">Alternatively, even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the language of \u00a7 17541(g)(5)(A)(ii) alone does not conclusively resolve this matter, we find the BOP\u2019s interpretation of the statute reasonable and persuasive. As the BOP observes in its Operations Memorandum, it is not possible to render an eligibility determination for a life-sentenced inmate while doing service to the express statutory requirement that an offender \u201chas served the greater of 10 years or 75 percent of the term of imprisonment to which the offender was sentenced.\u201d \u00a7 17541(g)(5)(A)(ii). This criterion of at least 75 percent service before eligibility would be rendered meaningless, or at best unworkable, if it were applied to inmates serving terms that run for the duration of their natural lives. The BOP has thus properly interpreted \u00a7 17541(g)(5)(A)(ii) to exclude life-sentenced inmates \u201cso that effect is given to all [the statute\u2019s] provisions, so that no part will be inoperative or superfluous, void, or insignificant.\u201d <em>Erienet, Inc. v. Velocity Net, </em>156 F.3d 513, 516 (3d Cir.1998) (quotation marks omitted). Finally, while \u201cinformal agency interpretations of statutes, such as the BOP Operations Memorandum here, are not subject to deference,\u201d <em>Izzo v. Wiley, </em>620 F.3d 1257, 1259 (10th Cir.2010), Sperling offers no viable argument that the BOP\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 17541(g)(5)(A)(ii) is anything but the correct one.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">In sum, the District Court properly denied Sperling\u2019s habeas corpus petition because the BOP acted consistently with the controlling statutory authority in deeming him ineligible for the EOHDPP. Because this appeal from the denial of Sperling\u2019s habeas petition presents \u201cno substantial question,\u201d 3d Cir. LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
