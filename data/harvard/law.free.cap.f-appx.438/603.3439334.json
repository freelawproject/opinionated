We have jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-12\">After the district court sentenced Turcios Calderon to 48 months in prison, the United States Sentencing Commission added Application Note 8 to \u00a7 2L1.2 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines. This Application Note states that cultural assimilation may be, in certain \u00a7 1326 cases, an appropriate basis for a downward departure. <em>See </em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. n. 8 (2010). Turcios Calderon argues that the Application Note is retroactive and that his sentence should be vacated and remanded so the district court can consider the new Application Note at resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-17\">We do not reach the question of whether Application Note 8 is retroactive because\u2014even assuming it <em>is </em>retroactive\u2014 the district court already considered cultural assimilation in imposing Turcios Calderon\u2019s below-Guidelines sentence. Our law has recognized since 1998 the authority of a sentencing court to depart downward based on a defendant\u2019s cultural assimilation if the cultural ties to the United States so warrant. <em>United States v. Lipman, </em>133 F.3d 726, 730-32 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-18\">At sentencing, Turcios Calderon argued under <em>Lipman </em>that his cultural and family ties\u2014including the age at which he came to the United States, his long residency in this country, his attendance of school here, and the citizen status of his family members\u2014justified a sentence below the Guidelines range. The district court\u2019s remarks at the sentencing hearing reveal that the district court considered and accepted that argument, imposing a sentence a full 22 months below the low end of the Guidelines range of 70 to 87 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-19\">Turcios Calderon\u2019s other argument, that his 48-month sentence is substantively unreasonable, fails because the district court appropriately exercised its discretion in determining the length of the sentence. <em>See United States v. Carty, </em>520 F.3d 984, 993 (9th Cir.2008) (en banc). Because we are dealing with a non-Guidelines sentence, \u201cwe are to \u2018give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)). Turcios Calderon\u2019s extensive criminal history certainly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>justifies the district court\u2019s decision not to grant a greater downward departure. Turcios Calderon asked the district court for a sentence \u201csignificantly lower than the guideline sentence\u201d\u2014which is exactly what he got.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b628-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
