Salgado\u2019s attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting, in counsel\u2019s opinion, there are no meritorious grounds for appeal, but raising the issue of whether the district court erred in failing to adequately depart for Salgado\u2019s substantial assistance. Salgado was notified of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief but has not done so. We dismiss the appeal in part, and we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-10\">We review a sentence under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The first step in this review requires us to ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as improperly calculating the Guidelines range, failing to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2006) factors, or failing to adequately explain the sentence. <em>United States v. Carter, </em>564 F.3d 325, 328 (4th Cir.2009). If the sentence is procedurally reasonable, we then consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed, taking into account the totality of the circumstances. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-12\">In sentencing, the district court should first calculate the Guidelines range and give the parties an opportunity to argue for whatever sentence they deem appropriate. <em>United States v. Pauley, </em>511 F.3d 468, 473 (4th Cir.2007). The district court should then consider the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors to determine whether they support the sentence requested by either party. <em>Id. </em>When rendering a sentence, the district court must make and place on the record an individualized assessment based on the particular facts of the case. <em>Carter, </em>564 F.3d at 328, 330.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-13\">In explaining the chosen sentence, the \u201csentencing judge should set forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, 551 </em>U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). While a district court must consider the statutory factors and explain its sentence, it need not explicitly reference \u00a7 3553(a) or discuss every factor on the record. <em>United States v. Johnson, 445 F.3d 339, 345 </em>(4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-14\">After determining Salgado\u2019s Guidelines range was 135 to 168 months based on a total offense level of thirty-three and criminal history category I, the district court granted the Government\u2019s motion under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) (2006); USSG \u00a7 5K1.1 to reduce Salgado\u2019s sentence based on his substantial assistance. The district court sentenced him to 118 months in prison. On appeal, Salgado challenges the extent of the district court\u2019s downward departure. However, this decision is not reviewable and we dismiss this portion of the appeal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number><em>See United States v. Allen, </em>491 F.3d 178, 193 (4th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore dismiss the appeal in part, and we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires that counsel inform his or her client, in writing, of his or her right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART; AFFIRMED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
