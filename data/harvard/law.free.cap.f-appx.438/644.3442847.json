Daly (Daly) appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Defendants on Daly\u2019s various state law claims and a claim based on the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). Daly asserts that the district court erred in determining that his claims were time-barred.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-9\">1. <em>State-Law Based Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b669-10\">Daly asserted state law claims of conversion and concealment. The statute of limitations for these claims is three years. <em>See </em>Cal. Civ. Proc. \u00a7 338(c) and (d). The statute of limitations for conversion begins to run from the date of the conversion, however, where there has been fraudulent concealment of the conversion, the limitations period begins to rim when the \u201cthe aggrieved party discovers or ought to have discovered the existence of the cause of action for conversion.\u201d <em>Strasberg v. Odyssey Group, Inc., </em>51 Cal.App.4th 906, 916, 59 Cal.Rptr.2d 474 (1996) (citations omitted). The discovery rule applies to the running of the statute of limitations for a claim of concealment as well. <em>See Unruh-Haxton v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., </em>162 Cal.App.4th 343, 367, 76 Cal.Rptr.3d 146 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-14\">Daly\u2019s state-law claims accrued no later than May, 2004, when he demonstrated awareness of any purported conversion and concealment in an email, and opined that a suit should be filed against Appellees and \u201canyone else complicit in this scam.\u201d Daly\u2019s state law-claims were time-barred when he filed suit in June, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-15\">2. <em>Civil RICO Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b669-16\">\u201cThe statute of limitations for civil RICO actions is four years.\u201d <em>Pincay v. Andrews, </em>238 F.3d 1106, 1108 (9th Cir.2001) (citation and footnote reference omitted). \u201cThe limitations period for civil RICO actions begins to run when a plaintiff knows or should know of the injury which is the basis for the action.\u201d <em>Living Designs, Inc. v. E.I. Dupont de Nemours and Co., </em>431 F.3d 353, 365 (9th Cir.2005) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-17\">In May, 2004, Daly learned that the company had sold licensing rights to a third-party, who had the option to purchase the company\u2019s sole asset at the conclusion of the agreement. Daly\u2019s civil RICO claim is time-barred because Daly had \u201cenough information to warrant an investigation\u201d by May, 2004. <em>Living Designs, </em>431 F.3d at 365. Indeed, by May, 2004, Daly\u2019s attorney had already drafted a complaint against Appellees. Daly\u2019s ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>gument that the third-party\u2019s exercise of the option to purchase in 2006 triggered the statute of limitations is foreclosed by <em>Volk v. D.A. Davidson &amp; Co., </em>816 F.2d 1406, 1415 (9th Cir.1987) (holding that the operative date on which the RICO statute of limitations began to run is when a plaintiff learns of the wrong, not the date which it sustained the loss).</p>\n<p id=\"AIe\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b669-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
