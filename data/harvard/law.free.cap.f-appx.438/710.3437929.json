LUCERO, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b734-25\">Daniel Chalan Jr. seeks a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 habeas petition. We deny a COA and dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">On January 28, 1985, an Allsup\u2019s convenience store located within the Cochiti Pueblo was robbed. Inside the store, police discovered the body of the assistant store manager, who had been shot multiple times and repeatedly bludgeoned. Several bullet fragments and spent casings were recovered from the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">The day after the murder, police and FBI agents learned that Chalan, his brother, and two cousins had been seen near the crime scene wielding rifles. Authorities subsequently interviewed Chalan, who initially denied that he was involved in the crime. The following day, however, he confessed to committing the murder. His detailed confession largely matched the physical evidence discovered at the crime scene. Chalan also directed police to pieces of a rifle hidden nearby which contained hair consistent with the victim\u2019s, and to a key that fit the Allsup\u2019s cash register.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">Chalan was charged in federal court with first-degree murder, robbery, and two counts of using a firearm during a felony. The prosecution called more than twenty witnesses during a four-day trial. One of these witnesses, FBI Special Agent Earnest Peele, testified about the composition of the bullet fragments found at the crime scene. Using a technique known as comparative bullet lead analysis (\u201cCBLA\u201d), Peele concluded that the fragments found at the crime scene fell into three groups. He testified that fragments within each group were similar enough in composition that they likely came from the same box of bullets or from boxes of bullets manufactured around the same time. Peele could not opine as to whether bullet fragments across groups came from the same box.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">A jury convicted Chalan on all counts. On direct appeal, we vacated one of Chalan\u2019s firearm convictions and remanded for an evidentiary hearing on the government\u2019s use of peremptory strikes. <em>United States v. Chalan, </em>812 F.2d 1302, 1317 (10th Cir.1987). The district court ultimately upheld Chalan\u2019s remaining three convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-10\">More than twenty years later, Chalan received a letter from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office stating that the FBI had ceased using the CBLA technique and noting that Agent Peele\u2019s trial testimony may have been misleading. Based on this new information, Chalan filed a \u00a7 2255 petition claiming that the admission of Peele\u2019s testimony violated his right to due process. The district court held that Chalan had procedurally defaulted his claim by failing to raise it on direct appeal. Although it concluded that Chalan established cause because the factual predicate of his claim was unavailable at the time of his direct appeal, the court held that Chalan failed to demonstrate prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b735-12\">A petitioner may not appeal the denial of habeas relief under \u00a7 2255 without a COA. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B). We will issue a COA only if Chalan can show \u201cthat jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-13\">As a general rule, \u201cclaims not raised on direct appeal may not be raised on collateral review unless the petitioner shows cause and prejudice.\u201d <em>Massaro v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 504, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003) (citation omitted). To show cause for a procedural default, a petitioner must demonstrate that \u201csome <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>objective factor external to the defense impeded counsel\u2019s efforts to comply with the ... procedural rule.\u201d <em>Murray v. Carrier, </em>477 U.S. 478, 488, 106 S.Ct. 2639, 91 L.Ed.2d 397 (1986). Establishing prejudice requires a petitioner to demonstrate that the claimed constitutional violation \u201cworked to his <em>actual </em>and substantial disadvantage, infecting his entire trial with error of constitutional dimensions.\u201d <em>United States v. Frady, </em>456 U.S. 152, 170, 102 S.Ct. 1584, 71 L.Ed.2d 816 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">The Supreme Court has indicated that a petitioner can establish cause by showing that \u201cthe factual or legal basis for a claim was not reasonably available\u201d at the time of direct appeal. <em>Murray, </em>477 U.S. at 488, 106 S.Ct. 2639 (citation omitted). In the \u00a7 2254 context, we have applied the cause and prejudice test to a claim asserted under <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), in which the facts underlying the claim could not have been discovered until after a conviction became final. See <em>Scott v. Mullin, </em>303 F.3d 1222, 1227-30 (10th Cir.2002); see <em>also United States v. Angelos, </em>417 Fed.Appx. 786, 801 (10th Cir.2011) (unpublished) (\u201cThe appropriate remedy available to a defendant who discovers evidence of prosecutorial misconduct or vindictiveness after completion of his direct appeal is to use that evidence as cause to excuse his procedural default.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">Nevertheless, Chalan argues that he did not procedurally default because he could not have discovered the deficiencies of the CBLA evidence at the time of his direct appeal. He cites to <em>Bousley v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 614, 118 S.Ct. 1604, 140 L.Ed.2d 828 (1998), in which the Court recognized \u201can exception to the procedural default rule for claims that could not be presented [on direct appeal] without further factual development.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 621, 118 S.Ct. 1604. Chalan maintains that his claim required further factual development because the letter he received from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office was not\u2014and could not have been\u2014part of the record on direct appeal. On this basis, he asserts that the exception to the procedural default rule applies and he should not be obligated to show cause or prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-8\">Our circuit has not explicitly considered the interaction between <em>Murray </em>and <em>Bousley. </em>The former holds that a petitioner can show cause when the \u201cthe factual ... basis for a claim was not reasonably available\u201d at the time of direct appeal. <em>Murray, </em>477 U.S. at 488, 106 S.Ct. 2639 (citation omitted). This statement suggests the cause and prejudice inquiry applies to such claims. But if the factual predicate for a claim is not available, it would appear to qualify under <em>Bousley </em>as a \u201cclaim[ ] that could not be presented without further factual development.\u201d 523 U.S. at 621, 118 S.Ct. 1604.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b736-9\">We need not decide whether Chalan\u2019s claim fits within the exception identified in <em>Bousley. </em>To obtain a COA, Chalan must establish not only that the district court\u2019s procedural ruling was debatable, but also that the merit of his claim is subject to reasonable debate. <em>See Slack, </em>529 U.S. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>484, 120 S.Ct. 1595. And to prevail on a \u00a7 2255 claim that the admission of objectionable evidence violated a petitioner\u2019s due process rights, the petitioner must show that \u201cthe error had substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 U.S. 619, 638, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993); <em>see also United States v. Dago, </em>441 F.3d 1238, 1245-46 (10th Cir.2006) <em>(Brecht </em>standard applies to trial type constitutional errors in \u00a7 2255 proceedings). Accordingly, Chalan must show some form of prejudice regardless of the application of the procedural bar. This he cannot do.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">Assuming that the admission of CBLA testimony was error,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we agree with the district court that the error did not influence the jury\u2019s verdict. The CBLA evidence presented at trial merely implied that some bullet fragments found at the crime scene likely came from the same box of bullets. But Peele did not claim that all of the bullet fragments came from the same source. Accordingly, Peele\u2019s testimony did not undermine Chalan\u2019s argument that other individuals must have been involved in the crime.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Nor did Peele tie the fragments to Chalan in any way. Even if jurors accepted Peele\u2019s testimony, it was at worst a cursory supplement to the other evidence offered at trial. Chalan confessed to the murder and relayed knowledge about details of the crime scene. He also directed police to a weapon that contained hairs consistent with the victim\u2019s and to a key which was taken from the store. In light of this unequivocal evidence, the CBLA testimony had no apparent impact on Chalan\u2019s convictions, and thus he suffered no actual prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-3\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b737-10\">Because Chalan has not shown that his claim is debatable on the merits, we DENY a COA and DISMISS the appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b734-15\"> This order is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b736-6\">. One could read <em>Bousley </em>as limited to situations in which a petitioner was aware of his claim at the time of direct appeal but lacked a sufficient record to present it. <em>See </em>523 U.S. at 621, 118 S.Ct. 1604 (exception can be applied when facts underlying claim were \"dehors the record and their effect on the judgment was not open to consideration and review on appeal\u201d (quoting <em>Waley v. Johnston, </em>316 U.S. 101, 104, 62 S.Ct. 964, 86 L.Ed. 1302 (1942) (per curiam))). However, it would be a curious result to treat as procedurally defaulted claims that could not have been raised because the factual predicate for the claim was unavailable, but exempt from procedural default claims that could not have been raised simply because the trial record was insufficient.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b737-7\">.

Another witness testified that although some bullet casings found at the scene matched others, the variety of casings found throughout the store suggest that more than one gun was involved.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
