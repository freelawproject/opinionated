On December 10, 2010, Thomas filed an \u201capplication/petition to dismiss ...,\u201d which the District Court granted \u201cvoluntarily and without prejudice\u201d on December 13, 2010. On January 10, 2011, Thomas filed a motion for relief from judgment or to reopen the complaint. The docket indicates that the defendants filed responses in opposition to reopening and The County of Bergen Special Transportation (\u201cBergen County\u201d) filed a motion to dismiss the complaint in January 2011. Thomas filed an opposition to the motion to dismiss to which Bergen County replied in February 2011. Thomas filed a memorandum in opposition to Bergen County\u2019s motion to dismiss on February 15, 2011. About three months later, on May 6, 2011, Thomas filed an affidavit and an \u201camended application to transfer venue.\u201d He then filed the current petition for a writ of mandamus on May 9, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-12\">Mandamus is a drastic remedy that is granted only in extraordinary cases. <em>In re Diet Drugs Prods. Liab. Litig., </em>418 F.3d 372, 378 (3d Cir.2005). It may be \u201cused to confine an inferior court to a lawful exercise of its prescribed jurisdiction or to compel it to exercise its authority when it is its duty to do so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citation and quotation omitted). To demonstrate that mandamus is appropriate, a petitioner must establish that he or she has \u201cno other adequate means\u201d to obtain the relief requested, and that he or she has a \u201cclear and indisputable\u201d right to issuance of the writ. <em>Madden v. Myers, </em>102 F.3d 74, 79 (3d Cir.1996). Although district courts are generally given discretion to control their dockets, <em>see In re Fine Paper Antitrust Litig., </em>685 F.2d 810, 817 (3d Cir.1982), an appellate court may issue a writ of mandamus when an undue delay in adjudication is \u201ctantamount to a failure to exercise jurisdiction,\u201d <em>Madden, </em>102 F.3d at 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-13\">Here, there is no basis for granting the petition for a writ of mandamus, as there has been no undue delay in adjudication of Thomas\u2019s motion for relief from judgment or to reopen the complaint. The district court docket reflects that Thomas\u2019s motion for relief from judgment or reopen the complaint and Bergen County\u2019s motion to dismiss were ready for disposition no earlier than February 15, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-14\">While we may issue a writ of mandamus in response to undue delay, only a few months have passed since Thomas\u2019s motion for relief from judgment or to reopen his complaint has been ready for disposition. This short time (of about four months) does not warrant mandamus relief. <em>Cf. Madden, 102 </em>F.3d at 79 (eight months of inaction on motions is not sufficient to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>compel mandamus). We are fully confident that the District Court will rule on Thomas\u2019s motion without undue delay. Thomas\u2019s petition for a writ of mandamus will be denied. In light of our disposition, Thomas\u2019s motion seeking to expedite this matter and to appoint counsel is denied as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
