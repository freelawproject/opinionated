We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-25\">Kohler commenced the action in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania while incarcerated at the York County Prison, although he has since been released.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>alleged that \u201cover the past 13 years [he had] been set-up to lose credibility. People have used their professional power and abused it by doing whatever they want with me.... All because of my [mental health] diagnosis.\u201d Compl. 3, ECF No. 6. Kohler disclaimed any physical injury, but emphasized the psychic and emotional toll caused by this alleged abuse. Compl. 3. He requested relief in the form of \u201crelease from prison ... money compensation, plus investigations done.\u201d Compl. 5. Elsewhere, Kohler complained of discrimination by a counselor at the York County Prison, charged an unspecified \u201cthey\u201d with \u201cstalling his] legal fight,\u201d and accused the judge who oversaw his case of trying to \u201cmake [him] lose credibility, which is defamation of character.\u201d <em>See </em>\u201cNotice of Intent,\u201d ECF No. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">The District Court warned Kohler that his complaint, in its current form, failed to state a claim for relief, and granted him leave to amend. <em>See </em>12/17/2010 Order 7, ECF No. 5. In response, Kohler filed a handwritten \u201cAmendment,\u201d in which he claimed to have \u201calready written a 100-page-plus\u201d complaint that he had submitted as part of his York County criminal case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He expounded further upon the discrimination he felt he had suffered, alleging that \u201cDr. Super and Wendy Parg\u201d lied in a hearing, that the judge in his criminal case called him a \u201ccrack head,\u201d and that guards at the prison yelled at him and said he had \u201cno credibility.\u201d More significantly, he claimed to have been kept in a segregation cell in less-than-ideal conditions and was forcibly injected with medicine that left his \u201cbody ... shaking the rest of the day and they left me in my cell to suffer.\u201d <em>See generally </em>Amendment, ECF No. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">Finding that Kohler\u2019s amendment did not state a claim, the District Court sua sponte dismissed the complaint. It observed that most of the actors he referenced by name in the bodies of his original complaint and its amendment were not, in fact, parties to the suit, and that his filings failed to provide notice as required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a). The District Court also discussed the vague and unspecific nature of his claims, and identified several defendants who could not, as per this Circuit\u2019s precedent, be proper parties to the suit. Finally, it concluded that, having granted leave to amend once, further amendment would be futile. <em>See generally </em>1/28/2011 Order, ECF No. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. While the District Court did not specify in its order whether it was dismissing under Rule 8(a) or under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) for failure to state a claim, the totality of the memorandum suggests an intent to rule pursuant to the latter<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>; accordingly, we conduct plenary review of the District Court\u2019s decision, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>accepting as true the allegations of fact established in the complaint along with reasonable inferences drawn therefrom. <em>Allah v. Seiverling, 229 </em>F.3d 220, 223 (3d Cir.2000). If no substantial question is presented by the instant appeal, we may summarily affirm on any ground supported by the record. See Third Circuit LAR 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6; <em>United States v. Rhines, </em>640 F.3d 69, 71 (3d Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Title 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, under which this complaint arises, creates a federal cause of action for \u201cthe deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws\u201d by persons acting under color of state law. <em>See also Revell v. Port Auth. of N.Y. and, N.J., </em>598 F.3d 128, 134 (3d Cir.2010). As it is well established that \u00a7 1983 complaints \u201cneed only satisfy the notice pleading standard of Rule 8(a),\u201d <em>Thomas v. Independence Twp., </em>463 F.3d 285, 295 (3d Cir.2006), it follows that such a complaint must, at the very least, put the defendants on notice of the character of the constitutional wrong alleged. However, a plaintiff must plead more than mere labels and conclusions, and a complaint \u201cmust contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal </em>556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1939, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quoting <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)). \u201cIn other words, a complaint must do more than allege the plaintiffs entitlement to relief. A complaint has to \u2018show\u2019 such an entitlement with its facts.\u201d <em>Fowler v. UPMC Shadyside, </em>578 F.3d 203, 211 (3d Cir.2009); <em>see also W. Penn Allegheny Health Sys. v. UPMC, </em>627 F.3d 85, 98 (3d Cir.2010) (\u201cIn determining whether a complaint is sufficient, courts should disregard the complaint\u2019s legal conclusions and determine whether the remaining factual allegations suggest that the plaintiff has a plausible\u2014as opposed to merely conceivable-claim for relief.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">We agree with the District Court that the complaint failed to state a claim for relief. First, several of the wrongs alleged by Kohler are not constitutional in nature; for example, \u201cdefamation of character\u201d is \u201cactionable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 only if it occurs in the course of or is accompanied by a change or extinguishment of a right or status guaranteed by state law or the Constitution.\u201d <em>Clark v. Falls, </em>890 F.2d 611, 619 (3d Cir.1989) (citing <em>Paul v. Davis, </em>424 U.S. 693, 701-12, 96 S.Ct. 1155, 47 L.Ed.2d 405 (1976)); <em>see also Sturm v. Clark, </em>835 F.2d 1009, 1012 (3d Cir.1987) (\u201cAbsent the alteration or extinguishment of a more tangible interest, injury to reputation is actionable only under state defamation law.\u201d). The comments to which Kohler referred do not implicate an alteration of a more tangible interest. Furthermore, without an underlying constitutional violation, Kohler cannot make out an emotional distress case under \u00a7 1983. <em>See Spence v. Bd. of Educ. of the Christina Sch. Dist., </em>806 F.2d 1198, 1203 (3d Cir.1986). When Kohler <em>does </em>describe a possible facial violation of his constitutional rights, such as questionable prison conditions or the alleged forcible administration of psychiatric drugs, he fails to connect the named defendants<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to those violations\u2014or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>even to situate the violations concretely in time. <em>See Rode v. Dellarciprete, </em>845 F.2d 1195, 1207 (3d Cir.1988) (\u201cA defendant in a civil rights action must have personal involvement in the alleged wrongs; liability cannot be predicated solely on the operation of <em>respondeat superior.\u201d). </em>Other claims, such as intimations that he was singled out for this discriminatory treatment, are too undeveloped to be considered as more than the conclusory allegations disfavored by <em>Iqbal.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">Finally, to the extent that Kohler requested release from prison or attempted to otherwise contest the validity of his conviction or sentence, his claim would have been properly brought only as a petition for writ of habeas corpus. <em>See Preiser v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 500, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973); <em>Williams v. Consovoy, </em>453 F.3d 173, 177 (3d Cir.2006). Attempts to proceed under \u00a7 1983 would be otherwise barred by the \u201cfavorable termination rule\u201d of <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), which requires \u201ca \u00a7 1983 plaintiff [to] prove that [his] conviction or sentence has been reversed <em>on </em>direct appeal, expunged by executive order, declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make such determination, or called into question by a federal court\u2019s issuance of a writ of habeas corpus\u201d in order to recover damages for allegedly unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364. The favorable termination rule applies even to those prisoners who, like Kohler, may no longer be in custody. <em>Williams, </em>453 F.3d at 177-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">As a pro se plaintiff, Kohler is and was entitled to liberal construction of his complaint. <em>Erickson v. Pardus, </em>551 U.S. 89, 94, 127 S.Ct. 2197, 167 L.Ed.2d 1081 (2007) (per curiam). Moreover, we are sensitive to the likelihood that Kohler\u2019s mental illness\u2014which he declines to specifically disclose, but which is undoubtedly an issue in many of the events in his complaint\u2014may impede his ability to craft a coherent pleading. But in a desire to effect justice by affording an uncounseled plaintiff leeway in pleading his case, a court must be mindful to work with what the complaint reasonably provides; it cannot stretch the obligation of lenience to its breaking point. <em>Cf. Capogrosso v. Sup.Ct. of N.J., </em>588 F.3d 180, 184 (3d Cir.2009) (per curiam) (inferences drawn in plaintiffs favor must be reasonable); <em>Smith-Bey v. Hosp. Adm\u2019r, </em>841 F.2d 751, 758 (7th Cir.1988) (\u201cAlthough a district court must give such pleadings a liberal construction, this does not mean that the district court must invent factual scenarios that cannot be reasonably inferred from the pleadings.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">Having reviewed Kohler\u2019s complaint and its amendment, we agree with the District Court that it does not state a valid constitutional claim in its present form. Hence, as no substantial issue is presented by this appeal, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment. Kohler\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is denied; his motion to dismiss individual parties is denied as unnecessary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b145-15\">. We are uncertain whether venue was proper in the Eastern District, given the York-County-centric nature of both the defendants and claims. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391(b). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>Whether venue was proper below does not affect the exercise of federal subject-matter jurisdiction. <em>See Wachovia Bank, N.A. v. Schmidt </em>546 U.S. 303, 316, 126 S.Ct. 941, 163 L.Ed.2d 797 (2006); <em>Polizzi v. Cowles Magazines, Inc., </em>345 U.S. 663, 665, 73 S.Ct. 900, 97 L.Ed. 1331 (1953); <em>see also Khouzam v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>549 F.3d 235, 249 (3d Cir.2008) (in immigration context, section 1252(b)(2) is a non-jurisdictional venue provision); <em>United States v. Gallagher, </em>183 F.2d 342, 346 (3d Cir.1950) (criminal venue provision, like other venue statutes, is waivable).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b146-9\">. The docket for the case number Kohler provides, CP-67-CR-0003429-2009, does not reveal any submission matching the one described. Our attempts to track down this document were for naught. As it is not before us\u2014and as it was not before the District Court\u2014it does not factor in our decision today.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b146-10\">. See, <em>e.g., </em>1/28/2011 Order \u00b6\u00b6 a (citing \u00a7 1915), o &amp; n.4 (closing case and declining to grant leave to amend).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b147-6\">. On appeal, Kohler asks this Court to \"drop\u201d several of the defendants from the action. We appreciate his desire for parsimony, but the request serves to emphasize the overbroad nature of the original complaint. For instance, he requests the dismissal of defendant Judy Shultz, as his dispute with Ms. Shultz \"was more landlord-tenant [related] than civil[-rights] related.\u201d He also apparently sued several of his family members whom he now wishes to dismiss \"even though they violated [his] rights\u201d\u2014although he still \"want[s] to question\u201d several of them. We cannot see how his grievances against these varied and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>disparate defendants were part of the same transaction or occurrence, or series thereof. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 20(a)(2); <em>see also DirecTV, Inc. v.
