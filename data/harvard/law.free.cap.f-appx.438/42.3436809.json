We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-11\">As the BIA adopted the decision of the IJ and supplemented that decision, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, and questions of law <em>de novo. See Aliyev v. Mukasey, </em>549 F.3d 111, 115 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-13\">The BIA and IJ ruled that Petitioner was precluded from satisfying the \u201cgood moral character\u201d requirement for cancellation of removal because he knowingly assisted his wife\u2019s two illegal entries into the United States in 2003. Because Petitioner is not a lawful permanent resident, to establish eligibility for cancellation of removal he must demonstrate, <em>inter alia, </em>that during the \u201c10 years immediately preceding the date of [his] application ... [he] has been a person of good moral character.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b (b)(1). The Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) provides that \u201c[n]o person shall be regarded as, or found to be, a person of good moral character who, during the period for which good moral character is required to be established, is, or was ... a member of one or more of the classes of persons, whether inadmissible or not, described in [8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(E) ] ... if the offense described therein, for which such person was convicted or of which he admits the commission, was committed during such period.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1101(f)(3). Section 1182(a)(6)(E), in turn, designates as inadmissible for smuggling \u201c[a]ny alien who at any time knowingly has encouraged, induced, assisted, abetted, or aided any other alien to enter or to try to enter the United States in violation of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1182 (a) (6) (E) (i).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-14\">We have \u201cyet to set forth anything approaching a bright-line test as to the nature of the actions that will or will not suffice to support a finding that an alien has encouraged, induced, assisted, abetted, or aided another in illegally entering the United States.\u201d <em>Chambers v. Office of Chief Counsel, </em>494 F.3d 274, 279 (2d Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). However, under any plausible reading of the statute, Petitioner\u2019s actions constitute smuggling. At his hearing, Petitioner admitted that he had made arrangements with smugglers for his wife\u2019s two illegal entries into the United States in 2003. With regard to his wife\u2019s first entry, Petitioner paid a smuggler approximately $6,000 to lead his wife across the border, to lead Petitioner across three hours later, and to reunite them at a location in the United States. As to his wife\u2019s second entry, Petitioner again hired a smuggler to take both him and his wife across the border. Based on these facts as admitted by Petitioner, there is substantial evidence in the record to support the agency\u2019s conclusion that Petitioner admitted assisting his wife\u2019s illegal entries into the United States for purposes of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(E)(i). <em>See Chambers, </em>494 F.3d at 279-80.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">Petitioner argues that the agency <em>erred </em>in designating him as both a smuggler and a smugglee. As the BIA observed, nothing in Section 1182(a)(6)(E) suggests that the categories of smugglees and smugglers are mutually exclusive. Petitioner argues that Congress did not intend to include smugglees as possible smugglers under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(E) because smugglees are inadmissible under a separate subsection, \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(A)(i). However, an alien may be found inadmissible under multiple provisions of the INA. <em>Cf. 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(d)(ll) (providing a waiver of inadmissibility under Section 1182(a)(6)(E)(i) only if the alien is \u201cotherwise admissible\u201d). Furthermore, although Congress expressly excluded from the purview of Section 1182(a)(6)(E) certain aliens who would otherwise be considered smugglers, no such exception is made for smugglees. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(E)(ii); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>499 U.S. 160, 167, 111 S.Ct. 1180, 113 L.Ed.2d 134 (1991) (\u2018Where Congress explicitly enumerates certain exceptions to a general prohibition, additional exceptions are not to be implied, in the absence of evidence of a contrary legislative intent.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">Finally, Petitioner argues that the family unity waiver of inadmissibility (provided for in Section 1182(a)(6)(E)(iii) as set forth in Section 1182(d)(ll)) applies in the context of determining whether an alien is precluded from establishing good moral character for cancellation of removal purposes. We need not consider that question because, in any event, Petitioner does not qualify for such a waiver. Section 1182(d)(ll) provides in pertinent part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-7\">The Attorney General may, in his discretion for humanitarian purposes, to assure family unity, or when it is otherwise in the public interest, waive application of clause (i) of subsection (a)(6)(E) in the case of any alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence who temporarily proceeded abroad voluntarily and not under an order of removal, and who is otherwise admissible to the United States as a returning resident ... and in the case of an alien seeking admission or adjustment of status as an immediate relative or [family-sponsored] immigrant ... if the alien has encouraged, induced, assisted, abetted, or aided only an individual who at the time of such action was the alien\u2019s spouse, parent, son, or daughter (and no other individual) to enter the United States in violation of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(d)(ll). Petitioner is not eligible for a waiver under the plain terms of this provision because he is neither a lawful permanent resident nor an alien seeking admission or adjustment of status as an immediate relative or family-sponsored immigrant. <em>See, e.g., Lamie v. U.S. Trustee, </em>540 U.S. 526, 534, 124 S.Ct. 1023, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>157 L.Ed.2d 1024 (2004) (noting the well-established rule that courts must enforce a statute according to its terms if its language is plain).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Petitioner asserts\u2014and the government does not dispute\u2014that he is a steady worker and family man with no criminal record or history of drug abuse, and that he has been found to lack \u201cgood moral character\u201d <em>only </em>because he handled the arrangements for his wife, as well as himself, to be smuggled back into the United States after a visit to her dying parents in Mexico. If these assertions are true (something about which we can have no opinion, and that in any event is irrelevant to the legal issues before us), the government might well want to consider whether the continued prosecution of this case is consistent with recently announced guidelines for the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in deportation cases. See Memorandum from John Morton, Director, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, to All Field Office Directors et al. (June 17, 2011), <em>available at </em>http://www.ice.gov/ doclib/secure-communities/pdf/ prosecutorial-discretion-memo.pdf.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">We have considered Petitioner\u2019s remaining arguments and we find them to be without merit. For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
