The district court dismissed her December and July 2007 claims because they were time barred and her April 2008 claim because it was barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">We review dismissal for failure to state a claim pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) de novo, applying the standard used to review a dismissal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). <em>Hart v. Hairston, </em>343 F.3d 762, 763-64 (5th Cir.2003). \u201cTo survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">As an initial matter, Henderson has not briefed any challenge to the district court\u2019s reasons for dismissing her suit; she has therefore abandoned her claims based on the December 2007 and April 2008 false arrests and the July 2007 probation revocation. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-11\">Henderson raised for the first time in her objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendations a claim that a Jasper County investigator and her attorney threatened her into pleading guilty by informing her that if she did not plead guilty and agree to probation, she would face two years in prison. We could decline to address these claims, <em>see Finley v. Johnson, </em>243 F.3d 215, 219 n. 3 (5th Cir.2001) (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 case); however, even if we were to address the claims, they are meritless. Because Henderson has alleged only that the Jasper investigator warned her of the sentence that she could receive if she did not accept the plea bargain providing for probation, she has not established that her guilty plea was the result of mental coercion overbearing her will. <em>See Bordenkircher v. Hayes, </em>434 U.S. 357, 358, 363-65, 98 S.Ct. 663, 54 L.Ed.2d 604 (1978). Henderson\u2019s similar claim against her court-appointed attorney is without merit because she has not shown that he was an official state actor. <em>See Mills v. Criminal Dist. Court No. 3, </em>837 F.2d 677, 679 (5th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">Finally, because Henderson did not raise in the district court a claim that the Jasper County Sheriff also threatened her to plead guilty, we will not address the issue here. <em>See Hannah v. United States, </em>523 F.3d 597, 600 n. 1 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b380-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
