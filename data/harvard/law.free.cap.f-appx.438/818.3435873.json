The district court granted Murphy a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on the following issue only:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-9\">whether the [district] court committed procedural error in denying his request to reopen and amend his \u00a7 2255 motion, which would then require him to seek leave from the Eleventh Circuit to file a second or successive motion before the court addresses the merits of his motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b843-10\">On appeal, Murphy argues that, pursuant to changes in the law, he no longer qualifies as an armed career criminal pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). His claims his motion to reopen or amend and his original motion to vacate \u201carise[ ] from the same conduct[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b843-11\">The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996) (\u201cAEDPA\u201d) provides that, to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion, a movant must first receive an order from the U.S. Court of Appeals authorizing the district court to consider it. <em>Farris v. United States, </em>333 F.3d 1211, 1216 (11th Cir.2003); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h). \u201cWithout authorization, the district court lacks jurisdiction to consider a second or successive petition.\u201d <em>Farris, </em>333 F.3d at 1216.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-13\">The Supreme Court has held that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AMW\">a Rule 60(b)(6) motion in a \u00a7 2254 case is not to be treated as a successive habeas petition if it does not assert, or reassert, claims of error in the movant\u2019s state conviction. A motion that, like petitioner\u2019s, challenges only the District Court\u2019s failure to reach the merits does not warrant such treatment, and can therefore be ruled upon by the District Court without precertification by the Court of Appeals pursuant to \u00a7 2244(b)(3).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b843-14\"><em>Gonzalez v. Crosby, </em>545 U.S. 524, 538, 125 S.Ct. 2641, 2651, 162 L.Ed.2d 480 (2005). In turn, if a Rule 60(b) motion attacks the district court\u2019s previous resolution of a claim on the merits, as in this case, it is construed as a successive habeas petition subject to the restrictions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2254, 2244(b)(3)(A). <em>See id., </em>545 U.S. 524, 531-32, 125 S.Ct. 2641, 2647-48, 162 L.Ed.2d 480. Although the Supreme Court expressly noted that it was limiting its consideration to \u00a7 2254 cases, <em>id. </em>at 529 n. 3, 125 S.Ct. at 2646 n. 3, we recently held that \u201cthe standard announced in <em>Gonzalez </em>applies to federal prisoner cases as well,\u201d <em>Gilbert v. United States, </em>640 F.3d 1293, 1323 (11th Cir.2011) <em>(en </em>banc). In <em>Gilbert, </em>we rejected Gilbert\u2019s argument that a motion he filed asserting an error of law in the calculation of his sentence should have been treated as one filed under Rule 60(b), holding that \u201c[b]ecause Gilbert\u2019s motion sought to assert or reassert a claim for relief, instead of pointing out a defect in the integrity of the earlier \u00a7 2255 motion proceeding in his case, under <em>Gonzalez </em>his motion is the equivalent of a second or successive motion and is barred by \u00a7 2255(h).\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b843-15\">Here, the district court did not err by dismissing Murphy\u2019s motion to reopen, be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>cause Murphy had filed a previous \u00a7 2255 motion that had been dismissed on the merits and had not obtained authorization from us to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion.
