Hamner was convicted of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>sexual battery, served his thirty-month sentence and is now on probation. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">A. State Court Conviction</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">In 2003, Hamner was in West Palm Beach, Florida for a company sales event. That evening, Hamner and coworkers, including the victim, went out for dinner. During the car ride back to the hotel, the victim, who had been drinking, said she felt dizzy and slumped over. Hamner and the victim\u2019s boss, Mr. Mosby, helped the victim to her hotel room and left her in her bed, fully clothed. Shortly thereafter, Hamner returned alone to the victim\u2019s room. Hamner\u2019s and the victim\u2019s accounts of what happened next differ.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-7\">According to Hamner, he merely wanted to return the victim\u2019s hotel key and check on her. When Hamner entered the room, the victim seemed fine and made repeated sexual advances. She asked Hamner to have sex with her and begged him not to leave. Hamner eventually had sex with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-8\">The victim, on the other hand, said that she awoke to find she was naked and Hamner was on top of her. She told Hamner \u201cno\u201d and \u201cstop\u201d and tried to get away, before hitting her head and blacking out.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-9\">After Hamner left, the victim called her mother and said she was raped. The victim\u2019s mother called the hotel\u2019s front desk and asked the hotel manager to check on her daughter. Using an emergency key, the hotel manager entered the victim\u2019s room and found her naked and crying hysterically. The hotel manager called 911 and stayed with the victim until the police arrived. Both the hotel manager and the first responding police officer reported that the victim was intoxicated, slurring her words and going in and out of consciousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-12\">B. Direct State Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b901-13\">Following a 2005 trial in a Florida state court, Hamner was convicted of sexual battery without physical violence, in violation of Florida Statute \u00a7 794.011(5). Hamner was sentenced to thirty months\u2019 imprisonment followed by three years of sex offender probation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b901-14\">Hamner appealed his conviction and sentence. Among other things, Hamner challenged the state court\u2019s denial of his request to recross-examine the victim. The Florida Court of Appeals affirmed. <em>See State v. Hamner, </em>942 So.2d 433 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2006). The state appellate court concluded (1) that the trial court did not err in denying Hamner an opportunity to conduct recross-examination and, (2) that, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>error occurred, any error was harmless given multiple witnesses testified the victim was slurring her speech that night. <em>Id. </em>at 436-37. The Florida Supreme Court denied Hamner\u2019s petition for discretionary review.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-15\">C. Motion for Post-Conviction Relief</p>\n<p id=\"b901-16\">Hamner filed a motion for post-conviction relief pursuant to Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.850, alleging that his trial counsel was ineffective and he was denied a fair trial due to cumulative error. The state habeas court denied most of Hamner\u2019s claims without a hearing. However, the state habeas court held an evidentiary hearing on whether Hamner\u2019s trial counsel was ineffective in failing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>present medical evidence about the victim\u2019s mental and physical condition and reserved ruling on the cumulative error claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">At the hearing, Hamner submitted the victim\u2019s hospital records and called the nurse at the hospital when the victim was admitted. The records and the nurse\u2019s testimony indicated that at the hospital the victim was agitated and screaming that she did not want anyone to touch her, that she was 16 and just about to turn 17 (although she was actually 27) and that she kept \u201cseeing his face.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At the hearing, Hamner\u2019s trial counsel and the state prosecutor testified, among other things, that presenting evidence of the victim\u2019s mental state could have undermined Hamner\u2019s defense that the victim was lucid and able to consent during the sexual encounter. Hamner\u2019s trial counsel was concerned that if he relied too heavily on this evidence, the State might amend the information from a second degree felony to a first degree felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">The state prosecutor stated that, although the evidence of the victim\u2019s mental state would have helped the state\u2019s case, she did not introduce it because she did not think she needed it. The state prosecutor stressed that Hamner\u2019s testimony as to what happened did not match the four different versions of events he offered during the investigation or the other evidence. Specifically, time-stamped data from the hotel\u2019s electronic door locks established that 26 minutes after Hamner and Mosby left the victim in her room, the hotel manager and the first responding officer found the victim incoherent, slurring her words and going in and out of consciousness. Yet, Hamner testified that the victim was lucid and actively soliciting sex from him when he reentered her room thirteen minutes earlier. The state prosecutor recalled jurors laughing at Hamner during her cross-examination, and described Hamner\u2019s testimony as \u201ctotally unbelievable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b902-8\">The state habeas court concluded that: (1) Hamner did not meet \u201cthe <em>Strickland, </em>standard for ineffective assistance of counsel\u201d; and (2) since \u201cthe individual errors [were] without merit, the contention of cumulative error [was] similarly without merit.\u201d On appeal, the Florida District Court of Appeals affirmed. <em>See Hamner v. State, </em>13 So.3d 529 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2009). Addressing Hamner\u2019s claim as to the omitted evidence of the victim\u2019s medical condition, the state appellate court concluded that, even if trial counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, \u201cno reasonable probability exists that such performance ultimately prejudiced the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 533. The state court explained that Hamner\u2019s own incredible testimony as to what happened \u201cwas his downfall\u201d and the omitted evidence would not have changed the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>Id. </em>The Florida Supreme Court denied discretionary review.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-9\">D. Section 2254 Petition</p>\n<p id=\"b902-10\">Hamner filed this counseled \u00a7 2254 petition alleging ineffective assistance of trial counsel, denial of his Sixth Amendment right to fully cross-examine the victim and a denial of due process based on cumulative error. As to the ineffective assistance claims, Hamner alleged that his trial counsel: (1) failed to present evidence relating to the victim\u2019s medical condition at the hospital; (2) failed to object to hearsay testimony from the victim\u2019s mother, the hotel manager and the responding police officer as to statements the victim made shortly after the incident; (3) failed to depose some state witnesses and to attend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>the deposition of one of Hamner\u2019s own witnesses and, thus, to prepare an effective examination or cross examination of these witnesses; and (4) failed to object to the district court\u2019s jury instructions as to involuntary intoxication.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">The district court denied Hamner\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition. Hamner filed a motion for a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on his ineffective assistance claims, his Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause claim, the cumulative error-due process claim and on whether the district court should have held an evidentiary hearing. The district court granted Hamner\u2019s motion for a COA.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b903-7\">In considering a district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 2254 habeas petition, we review findings of fact for clear error and legal determinations <em>de novo. Rhode v. Hall, </em>582 F.3d 1273, 1279 (11th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 3399, 177 L.Ed.2d 313 (2010). Like the district court, we are also reviewing the state habeas court\u2019s decision. <em>See Putman, </em>268 F.3d at 1240. Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d), as amended by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), a federal court may not grant habeas relief on a state prisoner\u2019s claim that was denied on the merits in state court unless the state court decision was (1) \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d or (2) \u201cbased on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b903-12\">A. Ineffective Assistance of Trial Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b903-13\">To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance, the petitioner must show that (1) counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, and (2) the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). A court need not address both prongs of the inquiry if the petitioner makes an insufficient showing on one. <em>Id. </em>at 697, 104 S.Ct. at 2069.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-14\">To show deficient performance, the petitioner must demonstrate that counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. <em>Id. </em>at 687-88, 104 S.Ct. at 2064. <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>performance prong requires deferential review, and the court, in assessing the reasonableness of counsel\u2019s performance, \u201cmust indulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d <em>Reed v. Sec\u2019y, Fla. Dep\u2019t of Corrs., </em>593 F.3d 1217, 1240 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 177, 178 L.Ed.2d 106 (2010) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>With respect to the prejudice prong, the court asks whether \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068. To establish prejudice, the petitioner has the burden to show more than that the error had \u201csome conceivable effect on the outcome of the proceeding,\u201d <em>Marquard v. Sec\u2019y Dep't of Corrs., </em>429 F.3d 1278, 1305 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation marks omitted), and may not rest on \u201cbare allegations of deficient performance.\u201d <em>Yeck v. Goodwin, </em>985 F.2d 538, 542 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">Our standard of review is \u201cdoubly deferential\u201d when \u201ca <em>Strickland </em>claim [is] evaluated under the \u00a7 2254(d)(1) standard.\u201d <em>Knowles v. Mirzayance, </em>556 U.S. 111, -, 129 S.Ct. 1411, 1420, 173 L.Ed.2d 251 (2009). \u201cThe question is not whether a federal court believes the state court\u2019s determination under the <em>Strickland </em>standard was incorrect but whether that determination was unreasonable\u2014a substantially higher threshold.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-7\">Here, Hamner has not shown that the state court\u2019s denial of his ineffective assistance claims was contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, <em>Strickland </em>or an unreasonable determination of the facts. First, as to the failure to object to hearsay testimony, the state court found that these statements would have been admitted as excited utterances. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 90.803(2) (providing that excited utterances are not inadmissible hearsay evidence). As such, the state court reasonably concluded that trial counsel could not be deemed ineffective for failing to raise a futile hearsay objection. <em>See Card v. Dugger, </em>911 F.2d 1494, 1520 (11th Cir.1990) (\u201cCounsel cannot be labeled ineffective for failing to raise issues which have no merit.\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b904-11\">Second, as to the failure to depose witnesses, the state court denied this claim because Hamner either failed to allege the substance of the witnesses\u2019s potential testimony or, if he did, failed to show how the omission of that testimony prejudiced Hamner at trial.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The state court\u2019s conclusion that Hamner failed to show prejudice was not contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, <em>Strickland. Strickland </em>places upon the petitioner the burden to establish prejudice except in the few cases, not applicable here, in which prejudice is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>presumed. <em>See </em>466 U.S. at 693, 104 S.Ct. at 2067.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">Similarly, as to the involuntary intoxication jury instruction claim, the state court concluded that Hamner failed to explain how the instruction prejudiced his defense. Hamner argues that there was no evidence of involuntary intoxication and that, by giving this instruction, the state trial court nullified his consent defense. Hamner\u2019s bare allegation does not satisfy his burden to show that trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to the instruction caused him prejudice.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">The instruction, which told the jury it could consider \u201c[ejvidence of the victim\u2019s mental incapacity ..., <em>if any,\u201d </em>did not misstate the law and did not suggest that such evidence existed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (emphasis added.) The victim\u2019s own testimony, which the jury obviously credited, indicated she voluntarily drank alcohol at dinner and became intoxicated. Moreover, during closing, Hamner\u2019s counsel argued that the involuntary intoxication instruction the trial court was about to give did not apply because there was no evidence of involuntary consumption of alcohol or drugs and stressed that the victim voluntarily consumed alcohol. Hamner points to nothing in the record to suggest that the jury disregarded the \u201cif any\u201d language of the instruction and presumed the victim was involuntarily intoxicated at the time of the offense. Therefore, the state court\u2019s ruling on this claim was not contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, <em>Strickland.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b905-10\">As for Hamner\u2019s claim regarding the omitted evidence of the victim\u2019s mental condition at the hospital, the state habeas court concluded that Hamner failed to show prejudice. Specifically, in light of \u201cthe unbelievability of the defendant\u2019s version of events,\u201d the state habeas court concluded that the omitted evidence would not have changed the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>Hamner, </em>13 So.3d at 533.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-11\">Notably, Hamner\u2019s trial counsel was able to elicit information from witnesses about the victim\u2019s mental health issues and her prior rape. The defense\u2019s theory of the case, however, did not rely heavily upon these facts. Instead, the defense argued that the victim intentionally fabricated the rape story because she feared she would lose her job. Evidence that, at the hospital, the victim appeared delusional and possibly was having a flashback to the earlier rape would have undermined that theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-12\">Moreover, the record bears out the state habeas court\u2019s assessment of Hamner\u2019s credibility. Although Hamner admitted it was inappropriate for him to have sex with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>the victim under the circumstances, less than fifteen minutes after leaving her room, Hamner reentered her room alone and admitted he had sex with her. Furthermore, Hamner\u2019s story kept changing right up until trial. When questioned by the police, Hamner initially denied reentering the victim\u2019s room, later admitted entering her room, but denied having sex with the victim, and finally admitted having sex. His final version of events at trial did not match any of his prior statements given to police. At the state habeas court\u2019s evidentiary hearing, the state prosecutor testified that Hamner\u2019s testimony was so unbelievable that some jurors laughed during her cross-examination of Hamner.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">Hamner\u2019s story at trial was also inconsistent with the other evidence. Hamner testified that when he entered the victim\u2019s room, she was coherent. Hamner described a sustained conversation with the victim in which she repeatedly asked him to have sex with her, told him she was on birth control pills, discussed her sexual history with him, told him she had a headache and promised him the best sex he had ever had. Hamner said that, during this conversation, the victim repeatedly made sexual advances, undressed and attempted to perform oral sex on him.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">Yet, Hamner\u2019s description of the victim did not match the woman the hotel manager and the police officer found on the floor of the hotel room less than fifteen minutes later. At that time, the victim was intoxicated, barely able to stand up or communicate, and was slurring her words and slipping in and out of consciousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">On this record, we cannot say the state habeas court\u2019s conclusion that Hamner failed to show prejudice was contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, <em>Strickland </em>or was an unreasonable determination of the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-7\">B. Sixth Amendment Right of Confrontation</p>\n<p id=\"b906-8\">Under the Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause, defendants have the right to cross-examine the government\u2019s witnesses. <em>Delaware v. Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. 673, 678, 106 S.Ct. 1431, 1435, 89 L.Ed.2d 674 (1986). However, this right is not without limitation, as the defendant is entitled to only \u201can <em>opportunity </em>for effective cross-examination, not cross-examination that is effective in whatever way, and to whatever extent, the defense might wish.\u201d <em>Delaware v. Fensterer, </em>474 U.S. 15, 20, 106 S.Ct. 292, 294, 88 L.Ed.2d 15 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-9\">Accordingly, the state trial court has \u201cwide latitude insofar as the Confrontation Clause is concerned to impose reasonable limits on such cross-examination based on concerns about, among other things, harassment, prejudice, confusion of the issues, the witness\u2019 safety, or interrogation that is repetitive or only marginally relevant.\u201d <em>Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. at 679, 106 S.Ct. at 1435. To establish a Confrontation Clause violation, the defendant must show that he was \u201cprohibited from engaging in otherwise appropriate cross-examination\u201d and \u201c[a] reasonable jury might have received a significantly different impression of [the witness\u2019s] credibility had [the defendant\u2019s] counsel been permitted to pursue his proposed line of cross-examination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 680, 106 S.Ct. at 1436.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-10\">Here, the state appellate court\u2019s decision on the Confrontation Clause issue was not contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, <em>Van Arsdall. </em>On cross-examination, Hamner was able to question the victim about her claim that she had said no, specifically focusing on how loud the victim claimed she had spoken. This information was important to the defense because the victim\u2019s supervisor, Mosby, was in the room next door and testified that he heard no noise from her room. On redirect, the state prosecutor explored fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>ther the manner in which the victim said no, and asked if she spoke clearly. The victim admitted that she did not know how loudly she had spoken and that her words \u201cmight have been slurred.\u201d The state trial court refused Hamner\u2019s request for recross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">The alleged Sixth Amendment violation relates only to Hamner\u2019s desire to question the victim further about the clarity of her diction when she said no. Given that the victim herself acknowledged she had been drinking and might have slurred her words, we do not see how further exploration of this admission would have given a reasonable jury a significantly different impression of her credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">Hamner\u2019s testimony was that the victim never said no at all and in fact repeatedly and coherently asked him to have sex with her. Thus, further questioning on this point arguably would been detrimental to Hamner\u2019s defense given that it could have undermined his own credibility and supported the prosecution\u2019s theory that the victim was in no condition to knowingly consent and that Hamner took advantage of her. Under the facts and circumstances of this case, the state court reasonably concluded that the trial court\u2019s refusal to let Hamner recross-examine the victim on this particular point did not rise to the level of a Sixth Amendment violation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b907-7\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b907-8\">For all these reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Hamner\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b901-10\">. Because Hamner remains subject to the terms and conditions of his sex offender probation, he is \"in custody\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a). <em>See Jones v. Cunningham, </em>371 U.S. 236, 242-43, 83 S.Ct. 373, 376-77, 9 L.Ed.2d 285 (1963).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b902-6\">. The victim was raped when she was a teenager. Hamner suggests the victim may have been experiencing a \"flashback\u201d to that earlier incident at the hospital.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b903-9\">. The district court's order failed to specify which issues satisfied the requirements of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). We conclude <em>sua sponte </em>that the issues for which Hamner sought certification merit a COA. <em>See Putman v. Head, </em>268 F.3d 1223, 1228 (11th Cir.2001) (explaining that this Court is not deprived of jurisdiction if the district court fails to identify issues for appellate review and that we may determine <em>sua sponte </em>which issues warrant a COA).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-10\">However, we do not address Hamner's claim on appeal that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction because this claim was not alleged in Hamner\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition. Further, Hamner did not seek certification of this issue in his counseled motion for a COA or request in his counseled appeal brief that this Court expand the COA to include this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b903-18\">. Hamner's appeal brief does not acknowledge AEDPA\u2019s deference requirements. Instead, Hamner's brief argues the merits of his claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b904-8\">. Hamner\u2019s trial counsel raised a hearsay objection to the testimony of the victim's mother as to statements the victim made shortly after the incident. The state trial court overruled the objection and admitted the out-of-court statements as excited utterances. The state habeas court found that the testimony of the other two witnesses, which recounted statements made by the victim \"a few brief moments after the victim spoke to her mother,\u201d would also have fallen under the excited utterance exception.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b904-9\">. Hamner alleged that Officer Jay Donde testified at his deposition that the victim knew which room Hamner was staying in and, after the sexual encounter, contacted the front desk multiple times in an effort to call him. The state court found that Hamner did not show how Officer Donde\u2019s testimony would have created reasonable doubt in the minds of the jury. The district court noted that Officer Donde\u2019s potential testimony was cumulative of the testimony of two other hotel employees that the victim had done this.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-13\">Hamner alleged that another witness, Lloyd Walker, who attended dinner with Hamner and the victim, would have testified that the victim behaved oddly, drank Jack Daniels with no ice, talked about her boyfriend and told people that everyone there was her boyfriend. The state court found that Lloyd Walker\u2019s testimony merely corroborated the victim's own testimony that at dinner she drank Jack Daniels and talked about her boyfriend.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b905-8\">. The state habeas court denied this claim because Hamner failed to describe with any particularity how the instruction prejudiced his defense. Although under Florida law it is generally error to give a jury instruction that is not supported by the record, it is not <em>per se </em>reversible error. Instead, it is reversible error only if it is \"capable of misleading the jury-in such a way as to prejudice the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial.\u201d <em>Lewis v. State, </em>693 So.2d 1055, 1057 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1997). Thus, the mere fact that Hamner\u2019s trial counsel failed to object to the instruction does not demonstrate prejudice. Moreover, the victim admitted she voluntarily consumed alcohol, and we see no prejudice from this instruction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b905-13\">. The jury instruction stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-14\">Evidence of the victim\u2019s mental incapacity or defect, if any, may be considered in determining whether there was an intelligent, knowing, and voluntary consent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ArDb\">Mentally incapacitated means that a person is rendered temporarily incapable of appraising or controlling his or her conduct due to the influence of a narcotic, an[a] esthetic or intoxicating substance administered to that person without his or her consent, or due to any other act committed upon that person without his or her consent.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b907-11\">. Given that Hamner did not request a hearing, or allege any facts that, if proven, would have indicated that the state court acted contrary to, or unreasonably applied, federal law, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Hamner's petition without holding a hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
