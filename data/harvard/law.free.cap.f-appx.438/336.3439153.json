Brown, who is now Louisiana prisoner #432458, appeals from the district court\u2019s dismissal with prejudice of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint regarding his arrest and prosecution, and he moves this court for leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP). By moving for leave to proceed IFP, Brown is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith because it is frivolous. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3); <em>Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-11\">Brown\u2019s claims against Matt Hill, Shannon Harkins, James Hindmon, Larry Knight, and Larry Ludlow, the Ouachita Parish Sheriffs Office investigating and arresting deputies; Royce Toney, the Ouachita Parish Sheriff; and George Britton, his state court-appointed defense counsel, are based on the alleged illegality of his arrest. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of these defendants, concluding that Brown\u2019s claims were barred under <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), and, alternatively, that the claims failed on the merits. The district court\u2019s reliance on <em>Heck </em>was misplaced, as there is insufficient information in the record to determine whether Brown\u2019s probation revocation was based on the allegedly illegal arrest or whether any evidence obtained as a result of Brown\u2019s arrest was used to secure the revocation of his probation. <em>See Mackey v. Dickson, </em>47 F.3d 744, 746 (5th Cir.1995) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-16\">The district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on the merits was proper, however. <em>See Polzin v. Gage, </em>636 F.3d 834, 838 (7th Cir.2011) (per curiam) (\u201c[District courts may bypass the impediment of the <em>Heck </em>doctrine and address the merits of the case.\u201d). Brown\u2019s claims are based on the alleged illegality of his arrest, specifically, that the police officers who arrested him lacked probable cause to do so. Brown does point to summary judgment evidence challenging the police officers\u2019 sworn statements that he confessed to involvement in a burglary prior to his arrest. He does not point to any evidence, though, contradicting the officers\u2019 sworn statements that Brown\u2019s three accomplices informed police of his participation in the crime, leading to his arrest. Thus, probable cause existed for Brown\u2019s arrest because a reasonable person could have concluded, based on the information known to the officers at the time of Brown\u2019s arrest, that Brown had committed an offense. <em>See United States v. Castro, </em>166 F.3d 728, 733 (5th Cir.1999) (en banc) (per curiam). Because all of Brown\u2019s claims hinge on the illegality of his arrest, the district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of the defendant police officers, sheriff, and defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-17\">The district court also dismissed Brown\u2019s claim against Ellen Eade, the prosecuting assistant district attorney, on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>the basis of absolute prosecutorial immunity. Brown has failed to identify an error in the district coui't\u2019s analysis regarding Eade\u2019s entitlement to absolute prosecutorial immunity and has, therefore, abandoned the issue. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas Cnty. Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). To the extent that Brown asserts that the District Attorney\u2019s office or Sheriffs office withheld favorable evidence, that claim is raised for the first time on appeal and is therefore waived. <em>See Jennings v. Owens, </em>602 F.3d 652, 657 n. 7 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">Brown\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is therefore frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983) (per curiam). The IFP motion is denied, and the appeal is dismissed. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b361-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
