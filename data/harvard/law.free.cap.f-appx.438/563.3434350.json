We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291, 2253, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Ceja\u2019s motion for a stay pursuant to <em>Rhines v. Weber, </em>544 U.S. 269, 277-78, 125 S.Ct. 1528, 161 L.Ed.2d 440 (2005), and <em>Pace v. DiGuglielmo, </em>544 U.S. 408, 416, 125 S.Ct. 1807, 161 L.Ed.2d 669 (2005). Ceja\u2019s protective petition served no purpose because his federal petition would have been untimely in the absence of statutory tolling. As such, the petition could not \u201cprotect\u201d Ceja against the possibility that he would not receive statutory tolling.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-9\">Ceja also claims that the district court prematurely dismissed his federal petition before knowing whether he was entitled to statutory tolling. This issue has been made moot by the California Supreme Court\u2019s denial of the state petition as untimely on April 20, 2011, citing <em>In re Robbins, </em>18 Cal.4th 770, 77 Cal.Rptr.2d 153, 959 P.2d 311 (1998). Furthermore, Ceja has not shown that the California Supreme Court exercised its discretion in a manner that \u201cimpose[d] novel and unforeseeable requirements without fair or substantial support in prior state law.\u201d <em>See Walker v. Martin, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1120, 1130, 179 L.Ed.2d 62 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-15\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b588-16\">Ceja argues that he is entitled to equitable tolling because of uncertainty in the law and that he is entitled to statutory tolling for the duration of the DNA testing litigation. These arguments were not raised in district court, and we decline to address them.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b588-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
