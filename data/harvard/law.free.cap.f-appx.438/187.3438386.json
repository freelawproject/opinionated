Lecco\u2019s convictions arose from his cocaine distribution and hiring of Patricia Burton and Valeri Friend to murder Carla Collins in retaliation for her telling police that Lecco continued to deal cocaine and carry firearms after agreeing to assist police in their drug investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-13\">On appeal, Lecco argues that (1) the district court erred in admitting statements Burton or Friend made to Collins during the murder implicating Lecco; (2) the district court erred in excluding evidence that Lecco was a \u201cfixer\u201d in the community; (3) the district court erred in excluding statements made to police to show police misconduct during the investigation; and (4) the Government violated Leceo\u2019s Fifth Amendment rights by presenting perjured testimony at trial. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-14\">We review for abuse of discretion a trial court\u2019s rulings on the admissibility of evidence. <em>United States v. Cole, </em>631 F.3d 146, 153 (4th Cir.2011). A statement is not hearsay if it is offered against the defendant and is a statement of a co-conspirator of the defendant made \u201cduring the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E). For a statement to be admissible under Rule 801(d)(2)(E), the government must show by a preponderance of the evidence that (1) a conspiracy existed of which the defendant was a member; and (2) the co-conspirator\u2019s statement was made in furtherance of the conspiracy. <em>United States v. Neal, </em>78 F.3d 901, 905 (4th Cir.1996). A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>co-conspirator\u2019s statement is made \u201cin furtherance of\u2019 a conspiracy \u201cif it was intended to promote the conspiracy\u2019s objectives, whether or not it actually has that effect.\u201d <em>United States v. Shores, </em>33 F.3d <em>438, 443 </em>(4th Cir.1994). We broadly construe the \u201cin furtherance\u201d requirement, such that \u201ceven casual relationships to the conspiracy suffice to satisfy the exception.\u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>441 F.3d 254, 262 (4th Cir.2006) (upholding the admission of a co-conspirator\u2019s explanation, in a drug conspiracy, that he had obtained drugs through a robbery); <em>see also United States v. Robinson, </em>367 F.3d 278, 292 (5th Cir.2004) (upholding the admission of a co-conspirator\u2019s threat to kill a government informant because he had \u201csnitched\u201d on the leader of the conspiracy).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">Lecco contends that the district court abused its discretion in admitting Burton and Friend\u2019s explanation to Collins that they were killing her at Lecco\u2019s request. We disagree. The district court correctly held that the explanation was in furtherance of the conspiracy because it effectively furthered the retaliatory goal of the conspiracy. Further, the explanation was intended to remind the coconspirators of the penalty for failing to carry out the conspiracy\u2019s goals, and it was not unduly prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Lecco next argues that the district court abused its discretion when it excluded evidence of his helpfulness. Rule 404(a), Fed.R.Evid., deems inadmissible evidence of a person\u2019s character \u201cfor the purpose of proving action in conformity therewith,\u201d excepting \u201cevidence of a pertinent trait of character offered by an accused.\u201d Proof of such a trait may be made by reputation or opinion testimony in all cases, and if the trait is an essential element of the charge, claim, or defense, specific instances of conduct also may be admitted. Fed.R.Evid. 405; <em>see also United States v. Gravely, </em>840 F.2d 1156, 1164 (4th Cir.1988) (\u201cUnless evidence of character is an essential element of a charge, claim or defense, proof of character is limited to general good character (reputation as a good person and law abiding citizen).\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">Here, Lecco sought to introduce evidence that he had helped people in his community on several occasions in an attempt to show that he only helped his friends bury Collins after the murder. Evidence of character, however, is not an essential element of any of the charges that were brought against Lecco, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1), 924(c)(1), (j) 1512(a)(1)(C), (k), 1513(a)(1)(B); 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 846, nor did he raise a defense with a character element. Moreover, as the district court held, Lecco\u2019s status as a \u201cfixer\u201d is not a pertinent character trait, as the fact that he helped members of the community in noncriminal matters did not make it more likely that he would bury a body after a murder for which he was not otherwise culpable.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">Lecco\u2019s third claim is also without merit. Lecco challenges the district court\u2019s exclusion of a witness\u2019s false statements to police. At trial, Lecco argued that those statements were similar enough to another witness\u2019s concededly false statements to suggest police misconduct during the investigation. The district court excluded them, finding that they were hearsay, \u201cat best,\u201d and that they were otherwise irrelevant and immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-10\">Although we agree with Lecco that the proffered evidence was not hearsay, as it was not offered for the truth of the matter asserted, Fed.R.Evid. 801(c), we hold that it was within the district court\u2019s discretion to exclude the evidence as irrelevant. Evidence is relevant if it has \u201cany tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 401. \u201c[R]elevance typically presents a low barrier to admissibility.\u201d <em>United States v. Leftenant, </em>341 F.3d 338, 346 (4th Cir.2003). Thus, to be relevant, \u201cevidence need only be \u2018worth consideration by the jury,\u2019 or have a \u2018plus value.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Queen, </em>132 F.3d 991, 998 (4th Cir.1997)). However, relevancy must be determined \u201cin relation to the charges and claims being tried, rather than in the context of defenses which might have been raised but were not.\u201d <em>United States v. Hedgepeth, </em>418 F.3d 411, 419 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">Prior to his attempted introduction of the false statements, Lecco did not argue police misconduct as a defense; rather, his theory was that the murder was the result of an out-of-control cocaine binge with which he was not involved. Because police manipulation did not tend to prove Lecco\u2019s claim that the witnesses lied to police to protect themselves, we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the statements as irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">Finally, Lecco claims that the Government denied him due process when it called Friend, but not Burton, to testify. Essentially, Lecco argues that Friend\u2019s testimony was so \u201cdiametrically opposed\u201d to Burton\u2019s that the Government knowingly presented perjured testimony by calling only Friend. The government \u201cmay not knowingly use false evidence, including false testimony, to obtain a tainted conviction.\u201d <em>Napue v. Illinois, </em>360 U.S. 264, 269, 79 S.Ct. 1173, 3 L.Ed.2d 1217 (1959). In order to establish a due process violation, a claimant must show \u201cthe falsity and materiality of the testimony and the prosecutor\u2019s knowledge of its falsity.\u201d <em>Basden v. Lee, </em>290 F.3d 602, 614 (4th Cir.2002). Perjured testimony is material \u201cif there is any reasonable likelihood that the false testimony could have affected the judgment of the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">Lecco has not shown that the Government deprived him of due process by calling Friend to testify rather than Burton because he has not shown that the Government knew of any falsity in Friend\u2019s testimony or that the testimony was material. Lecco falsely characterizes the Government\u2019s assertion at Burton\u2019s sentencing hearing that Burton \u201cwas the first to come forward with at least the closest true story of what happened to Collins,\u201d and he has not established that Friend and Burton\u2019s slightly differing accounts of the murder could have affected the judgment of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
