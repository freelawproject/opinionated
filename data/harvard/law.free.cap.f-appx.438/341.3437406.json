The district court granted Mead a certificate of appealability on the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel. Mead argues that counsel failed to adequately advise him regarding whether to accept the plea offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-21\">Whether Mead received ineffective assistance of counsel is reviewed de novo. <em>Cf. Medellin v. Dretke, </em>544 U.S. 660, 680, 125 S.Ct. 2088, 161 L.Ed.2d 982 (2005). We review the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo. <em>Charles v. Thaler, </em>629 F.3d 494, 498 (2011). To establish ineffective assistance, Mead must show (1) that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and (2) that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). \u201cPrejudice in the state sentencing context turns on whether, absent counsel\u2019s errors, there is a reasonable probability that the defendant\u2019s sentence would have been significantly less <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>harsh.\u201d <em>Charles, </em>629 F.3d at 499 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">Mead argues that he was deprived of constitutionally adequate representation when, after the State agreed to impose the sentence the defense sought, counsel allowed him to reject the plea offer without adequately advising him of its advantages and disadvantages. Significantly, Mead does not allege that he was unaware that he was facing a life sentence as an habitual offender. <em>See United States v. Herrera, </em>412 F.3d 577, 580 (5th Cir.2005). The state record and allegations made for the first time in Mead\u2019s appellate brief indicate that the terms of the plea offer were communicated to Mead; however, Mead, who has consistently maintained his innocence, exercised his right to a trial by jury. Mead\u2019s assertions that he was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s failure to give him unspecified advice and that it is reasonable likely that he would have accepted the plea offer had he received such advice are purely conclusional. As such, his allegations of prejudice are insufficient to support a basis for habeas relief. <em>See Green v. Johnson, </em>160 F.3d 1029, 1040 (5th Cir.1998). Consequently, Mead was not entitled to an evidentiary hearing. <em>Fc. United States v. Edwards, </em>442 F.3d 258, 264 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b365-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
