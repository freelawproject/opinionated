Wright\u2019s \u00a7 1983 complaint alleged that he was arrested without a warrant and without first being informed of his Miranda<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> rights. Wright sought monetary damages and dismissal of the state criminal charges pending against him. The district court sua <em>sponte </em>dismissed the complaint, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(l), for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b830-16\">A complaint fails to state a claim when, taking the complaint\u2019s allegations as true, it does not appear that a claim for relief \u201cis plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009). Although we liberally construe <em>pro se </em>pleadings, holding them to a less stringent standard than those drafted by an attorney, <em>Miller v. Donald, </em>541 F.3d 1091, 1100 (11th Cir.2008), we will not rewrite an otherwise deficient pleading to sustain an action. <em>GJR Invs., Inc. v. Cnty. of Escambia, </em>132 F.3d 1359, 1369 (11th Cir.1998), <em>overruled on other grounds by Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. 1937 (2009). To state a claim under \u00a7 1983, a plaintiff must allege that (1) the defendant deprived him of a right secured under the United States Constitution or federal law and (2) such deprivation occurred under color of state law. <em>Richardson v. Johnson, </em>598 F.3d 734, 737 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-17\">Because the allegations in Wright\u2019s \u00a7 1983 complaint, even construed liberally, fail to allege a claim that is \u201cplausible on its face,\u201d the district court properly dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. <em>See Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. at-, 129 S.Ct. at 1949 (quotation marks omitted). Specifically, as to Wright\u2019s false arrest claim, the complaint alleges in conclusory fashion that the police arrested Wright without a warrant, but does not allege any facts showing that the police lacked probable cause to arrest him. <em>See Rankin v. Evans, </em>133 F.3d 1425, 1435 (11th Cir.1998) (explaining that the existence of probable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>cause is an absolute bar to a \u00a7 1983 claim for false arrest).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">Wright\u2019s allegation that his <em>Miranda </em>rights were violated does not give rise to a cognizable claim under \u00a7 1983. <em>See Jones v. Cannon, </em>174 F.3d 1271, 1291 (11th Cir.1999). Likewise Wright\u2019s request for the dismissal of the pending state criminal charges, which challenges the very fact of his confinement, cannot be granted in the \u00a7 1983 context. <em>See Preiser v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 500, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 1841, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973). Furthermore, because Wright\u2019s complaint alleges that his criminal proceedings are pending, the district court properly refused to construe it as a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(1)(A) (providing that a writ of habeas corpus may not be granted unless the petitioner has exhausted the remedies available in the state courts).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b830-13\">. <em>Miranda v.
