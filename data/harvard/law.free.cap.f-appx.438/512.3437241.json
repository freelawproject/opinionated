He was sentenced to 204 months\u2019 imprisonment, 16 months above the high end of his guidelines range (151 to 188 months). North filed a notice of appeal, but his newly appointed counsel has concluded that the appeal is frivolous and seeks permission to withdraw. <em>See Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). North has not accepted our invitation to comment on counsel\u2019s facially adequate submission, <em>see </em>CIR. R. 51(b). We limit our review to the only potential issue that counsel discusses. <em>See United States v. Schuh, </em>289 F.3d 968, 973-74 (7th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-25\">North has given no indication that he wants his guilty plea vacated, so counsel properly omits discussion of the adequacy of the plea colloquy or the voluntariness of the plea. <em>See United States v. Knox, </em>287 F.3d 667, 670-72 (7th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-26\">Counsel does consider challenging the substantive reasonableness of North\u2019s above-guidelines sentence but rightly concludes that this challenge would be frivolous. We would uphold an above-range sentence so long as the district court reasonably applied the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and adequately explained the penalty. <em>See United States v. Hill, </em>645 F.3d 900, 911 (7th Cir.2011); <em>United States v. Courtland, </em>642 F.3d 545, 550-51 (7th Cir.2011). In this case the court concluded that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors weighed in favor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>of an above-range sentence. The court emphasized North\u2019s extensive criminal history, which spanned more than 40 years and included 8 felony drug convictions, in concluding that a 204-month sentence was necessary both to promote respect for the law and to protect the public from further crimes. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A), (C). Despite North\u2019s advancing age\u2014he turned 61 shortly before sentencing\u2014the court reasonably determined that his decades of illegal behavior demonstrated a likelihood of continued crime even as he reaches an age when others would stop offending. <em>See United States v. Vallar, </em>635 F.3d 271, 279-80 (7th Cir.2011); <em>United States v. Kincannon, </em>567 F.3d 893, 901 (7th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Bullion, </em>466 F.3d 574, 577 (7th Cir.2006). Based on North\u2019s lifetime of crime, the court acted well within its discretion in imposing an above-guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Perez-Molina, </em>627 F.3d 1049, 1050-51 (7th Cir.2010); <em>United States v. Padilla, </em>618 F.3d 643, 646 (7th Cir.2010); <em>United States v. McKinney, </em>543 F.3d 911, 914 (7th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. King, </em>506 F.3d 532, 537 (7th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
