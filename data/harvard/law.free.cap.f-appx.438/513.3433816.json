He pleaded guilty to knowingly and fraudulently making a false oath in a bankruptcy case. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(2). The district court sentenced him to six months\u2019 imprisonment, the bottom of his guidelines range. He appealed, but his appointed lawyer believes that the appeal is frivolous and seeks to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Fedosky did not accept our invitation to address counsel\u2019s submission. <em>See </em>7th Cir. R. 51(b). We conf\u00edne our review to the potential issue that counsel identified in her facially adequate brief. <em>See United States v. Schuh, </em>289 F.3d 968, 973-74 (7th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">Counsel explains that she discussed with Fedosky whether he wants to challenge his guilty plea and that he gave \u201cno affirmative indication\u201d he wants to do so. Counsel thus properly omits discussion about the adequacy of the plea colloquy or the voluntariness of the guilty plea. <em>See United States v. Knox, </em>287 F.3d 667, 671-72 (7th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">Counsel considers whether Fedosky might argue that his six-month sentence is unreasonable, but aptly rejects any such argument as frivolous. Fedosky\u2019s sentence is at the bottom of his guidelines range and thus presumptively reasonable, <em>see Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 350-51, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>United States v. Moreno-Padilla, </em>602 F.3d 802, 810 (7th Cir.2010), and counsel identifies no reason to disturb that presumption. When imposing this within-guidelines sentence, the district court properly applied the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The court discussed Fedosky\u2019s personal characteristics, noting his financial irresponsibility and \u201cquestionable honesty,\u201d <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1); <em>United States v. Omole, </em>523 F.3d 691, 698 (7th Cir.2008), and the need to protect the community from someone who runs up debts that cannot be paid off, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(c). These considerations, according to the court, outweighed Fedosky\u2019s argument that probation would be more appropriate given the absence of any loss resulting from the crime and his role as the sole provider for his family. The court discussed the relevant sentencing factors and addressed Fedosky\u2019s mitigating arguments, and was required to do nothing more. <em>See United States v. Kilgore, </em>591 F.3d 890, 893 (7th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">We GRANT counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and DISMISS the appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
