Ford argues on appeal that the district court erred in enhancing his offense level by five levels, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(3)(B), because there was insuf<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>ficient proof that he distributed files in anticipation of receipt of something of value. Ford also argues that his sentence is unreasonable because it is based on a flawed guideline that was determined without the benefit of empirical evidence, and because the district court failed to give proper consideration to the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">We review the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo </em>and its factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Knight, </em>562 F.3d 1314, 1322 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 192, 175 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">Section 2G2.2(b)(3)(B) provides for a five-level increase in a defendant\u2019s sentence for transporting material involving the sexual exploitation of a minor if his offense involved \u201c[distribution for the receipt, or expectation of receipt, of a thing of value, but not for pecuniary gain.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(3)(B). The Guideline defines the phrase as meaning \u201cany transaction, including bartering or other in-kind transaction, that is conducted for a thing of value but not for profit.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2, comment. (n.l). \u201cThing of value\u201d is further defined as \u201canything of valuable consideration. For example, in a case involving the bartering of child pornographic material, the \u2018thing of value\u2019 is the child pornographic material received in exchange for other child pornographic material bartered in consideration for the material received.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We have also held that \u201cwhen a defendant trades child pornography in exchange for other child pornography, the defendant has engaged in distribution for the receipt, or expectation of receipt of a thing of value.\u201d <em>United States v. Bender, </em>290 F.3d 1279, 1286 (11th Cir.2002) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-8\">The district court found that Ford had participated in publicly available peer-to-peer file sharing networks and had both distributed child pornography to others and had viewed and downloaded child pornography files from others, a finding that is supported by Ford\u2019s own admissions to the same. Although Ford argued that the child pornography files that he received were not a thing of value under \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(3)(B), he never disputed that he had actually downloaded those files from the file sharing networks. Thus, the district court did not err in determining that, pursuant to \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(3)(B), the five-level upward adjustment was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b848-10\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence, \u201c[rjegardless of whether the sentence imposed is inside or outside the Guidelines range,\u201d under a deferential abuse of discretion standard of review. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We reverse only if \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1190 (11th Cir.2010) <em>(en banc), cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 1813, 179 L.Ed.2d 772 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-13\">Procedural reasonableness includes whether the district court properly calculated the guideline range. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. Once we determine that a sentence is procedurally sound, we examine whether the sentence was substantively reasonable in light of the totality of the circumstances and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>\u201c[T]he weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312, 1322 (11th Cir.2008) (quotations and alterations omitted). A sentence may be substantively unreasonable where a district court \u201cunjustifiably relied on any one \u00a7 3553(a) factor, failed to consider pertinent \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selected the sentence arbitrarily, or based the sentence on impermissible factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Sarras, </em>575 F.3d 1191, 1219 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">The district court is not required \u201cto state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). Rather, it is sufficient for the sentencing judge to set forth \u201cenough to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). The burden of establishing that a sentence is unreasonable lies with the party challenging the sentence. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1189 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">In <em>Kimbrough, </em>the Supreme Court held that a district court may deviate from the Guidelines in a particular crack cocaine case because the Guidelines range for these offenses did not take into account \u201cempirical data and national experience.\u201d <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 109-10, 128 S.Ct. 558, 575, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007) (quotation omitted). The Supreme Court did not hold, however, that all enhancements must be supported by empirical data or that all crack cocaine sentences must be lower than the Guidelines range because of the lack of supporting empirical data. <em>See id. </em>Instead, the Court held that \u201cit would not be an abuse of discretion for a district court to conclude when sentencing a particular defendant that the crack/powder disparity yields a sentence \u2018greater than necessary\u2019 to achieve \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s purposes, even in a mine-run case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 110, 128 S.Ct. at 575.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-8\">In <em>Pugh, </em>we acknowledged that <em>Kimbrough </em>gave district courts the authority to deviate from the Guidelines in crack cocaine cases because the sentencing ranges did not take into account empirical data and national experience. <em>See Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1201 n. 15. However, we held that the child pornography guidelines \u201cdo not exhibit the deficiencies the Supreme Court identified in <em>Kimbrough.\u201d Id. </em>Furthermore, we recognized that we have \u201ctypically treated child sex offenses as serious crimes, upholding severe sentences in these cases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1202.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-9\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to disregard the guideline range produced by \u00a7 2G2.2. As we explained in <em>Pugh, </em>the child pornography guidelines do \u201cnot exhibit the deficiencies the Supreme Court identified in <em>Kimbrough.\u201d </em>515 F.3d at 1201 n. 15. But even if those deficiencies did exist, <em>Kimbrough </em>merely permits district courts to deviate from a guideline but does not require them to do so. <em>See Kimbrough, </em>552 U.S. at 109-10, 128 S.Ct. at 575. Furthermore, in this case, the district court actually varied downward from Ford\u2019s guideline range of 210 to 240 months\u2019 imprisonment by imposing a sentence of 198 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-10\">Ford\u2019s sentence is also substantively reasonable, because the district court stated that it had considered Ford\u2019s arguments and reviewed the entire revised PSI in determining Ford\u2019s sentence. Furthermore, the district court stated that it had considered all the statutory factors and specifically noted that \u201cthe sentence to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>imposed reflects just punishment, promotes respect for the law, deters future criminal conduct on the part of the defendant, and protects the public from future criminal conduct by the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b850-27\">.
