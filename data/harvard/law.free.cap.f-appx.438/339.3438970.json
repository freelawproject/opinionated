Satyam cross-petitions under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324b(j), asking that we enforce OCA-HO\u2019s final order dismissing Raghunandhan\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-24\">OCAHO issued a twenty-three page opinion with its order, addressing every aspect of the case. After reviewing the record, briefs, and applicable law, we deny Raghunandhan\u2019s petition and grant Satyam\u2019s cross-petition on the basis of OCA-HO\u2019s comprehensive opinion. Raghunandhan has not raised a genuine issue of material fact that his employment was terminated on the basis of his status as a U.S. citizen. To the contrary, the record shows that he was terminated because he refused to return to India when Satyam, because of economic concerns, canceled his temporary assignment as an Onsite Program Manager in the United States. Raghunandhan contends that Satyam\u2019s action violated his employment agreement, but any issue of breach of contract is not before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-25\">Raghunandhan also contests the denial of his motion to compel discovery, but OCAHO appropriately denied that motion for failure to comply with the procedural requirements of 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 68.23(b)(4). Consequently, we DENY Raghunandhan\u2019s petition for review of the OCAHO\u2019s order and GRANT Satyam\u2019s cross-petition seeking enforcement of that order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b363-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
