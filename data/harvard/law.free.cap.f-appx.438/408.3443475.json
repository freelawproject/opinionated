Blazy served as the Director of the Jefferson County Regional Planning Commission for a two-year term. When his contract was not renewed, he filed suit against the Commission and its president, John S. Fabian, alleging claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 for a violation of procedural due process and under state law for breach of contract and declaratory relief. The district court denied Blazy\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment and granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the grounds that Blazy\u2019s contract did not create a property interest in continued employment entitling him to due process protection and, in the alternative, that Ohio law provided an adequate remedy for his breach of contract claim. The district court also declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over his remaining state law claims. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">Blazy is a resident of Jefferson County, Ohio, and was hired on April 28, 2006, to serve as the Director of the Jefferson County Regional Planning Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d). The Commission is organized under Ohio Rev.Code Ann. \u00a7 713.21 and operates in accordance with the Articles of Cooperation and Bylaws adopted by the Commission. Blazy\u2019s two-year, written employment contract was effective retroactively from March 27, 2006, until March 28, 2008, and stated that, \u201c[u]pon the approval of the Commission, this agreement may be extended for a specific period as determined by the Commission.\u201d The contract further provided that the \u201cCommission may exercise the option of non-renewal ... by providing a thirty (30) day advance written notice to the Director.\u201d As Director, Blazy served \u201cat the pleasure of the Commission\u201d in an unclassified employment status.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-10\">During his two-year term, Blazy\u2019s working relationships with other County Commissioners and state offices allegedly deteriorated. On January 17, 2008, in light of these problems, the Executive Committee of the Commission convened, voted not to renew Blazy\u2019s contract, and placed him on paid administrative leave from January 22, 2008, until the expiration of his contract. The Executive Committee informed Blazy of its decisions by hand-delivered correspondence dated January 18, 2008, which stated that his contract would expire by its terms on March 28, 2008. On January 23, 2008, when the Commission convened for its scheduled monthly meeting, John Fabian, the President of the Commission, allegedly stated that the Executive Committee\u2019s determinations as to Blazy\u2019s non-renewal were final and not subject to review, modification, or approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-11\">Several provisions of the Ohio Revised Code and the Articles of Cooperation empower the Commission to establish and delegate authority to an Executive Committee. Ohio Rev.Code Ann. \u00a7 713.21(C) provides that the Commission</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-12\">may establish committees with the powers it finds necessary to carry on its work, including an executive committee to make final determinations, decisions, findings, recommendations, and orders as provided in the commission\u2019s rules. All actions of these committees shall be reported in writing to the members of the regional planning commission no later than its next meeting or within thirty days from the date of the action, whichever is earlier.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>Article of Cooperation 6.01 provides that \u201c[a]ll of the powers and duties of the ... Commission ... shall be possessed and may be exercised by the Executive Committee, but always subject to review by the Commission at any regular monthly meeting.\u201d In addition, Article 9.01 authorizes the Executive Committee to select a Director of the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">On December 2, 2008, Blazy filed suit in federal district court, alleging claims against the Commission and Fabian for (1) a violation of procedural due process, (2) breach of contract, and (3) declaratory relief. He argued that notice from the Executive Committee alone was inadequate to satisfy the non-renewal clause of his employment contract; that he was not afforded an opportunity to be heard by members of the Commission; that the Commission, as a whole, never ratified the Executive Committee\u2019s non-renewal decision; that Fabian acted with malice and ill-will against him; and that the Commission failed to act in conformity with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \u00a7 713.21(C) or with the Articles of Cooperation and Bylaws.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">On March 3, 2009, the defendants moved for judgment on the pleadings on the grounds that Blazy did not have a property interest in his continued employment and thus was not deprived of procedural due process; that Fabian was entitled to qualified immunity; and that Blazy was not entitled to reinstatement because \u201cBlazy was an at-will employee who received proper notice of non-renewal.\u201d The defendants also noted that Blazy was designated as an unclassified employee and thus had neither a property interest in his employment nor any entitlement to procedural due process protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">Blazy opposed this motion on May 4, 2009, and moved for partial summary judgment against the defendants, arguing that he had a protected property interest in his continued employment and that, pursuant to the Articles of Cooperation, the Executive Committee lacked the capacity to authorize the non-renewal of his contract. He maintained that, although Article of Cooperation \u00a7 9.01 delegated general authority to the Executive Committee to select the Director of the Commission, this article was \u201csilent as to the authority of the Executive Committee to dismiss the Director or to decline to renew his ... contract.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, absent timely notice from the full Commission of its decision to exercise the non-renewal option, \u201cthe contract would automatically renew for an additional term beyond the \u2018initial term.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-10\">On July 31, 2009, the defendants renewed their motion for judgment on the pleadings and, in the alternative, sought summary judgment on the same grounds. They disputed Blazy\u2019s alleged property interest in continued employment beyond the two-year term and noted that, even if the contract created a property interest, Blazy was timely notified by the Executive Committee, which was empowered to make hiring and firing decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-11\">On March 12, 2010, the district court denied Blazy\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment and granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, finding that there \u201c[was] no independent basis from which [Blazy] [could] claim a protected property interest.\u201d Although acknowledging that a written contract, such as an employment agreement, could create a property interest entitling an employee to due process protection, the court found that Blazy\u2019s contract created a two-year term that expired on March 28, 2008, and that did not automatically renew in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>absence of written notice by the Commission. Thus, Blazy\u2019s unilateral expectation of renewal was \u201cinsufficient to establish a reasonable expectation in continued employment.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Bd. of Regents v. Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 577, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972). The court also concluded that, even if the contract provided a property interest in continued employment, Blazy had an adequate remedy for breach of contract under Ohio law and therefore could not assert a \u00a7 1983 claim on this basis. Finally, having disposed of Blazy\u2019s federal claim, the district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over his remaining state law claims. The court entered its final judgment on March 16, 2010, and Blazy timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Allen v. Mich. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>165 F.3d 405, 409 (6th Cir.1999). Summary judgment is proper \u201cif the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). We must construe the evidence, facts, and all reasonable inferences drawn from them in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Allen, </em>165 F.3d at 409 (citing <em>Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., </em>475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986)). In answering a properly supported motion for summary judgment, the nonmoving party must demonstrate that there is a genuine issue for trial, which exists \u201c \u2018if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving pai\u2019ty.\u2019 \u201d <em>Holloway v. Brush, </em>220 F.3d 767, 772 (6th Cir.2000) (quoting <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">Blazy argues here, as before the district court, that the defendants infringed his right to procedural due process by violating his employment contract\u2019s non-renewal provision. He contends that, because the termination clause of the contract stated that \u201c[tjhe Commission may exercise the option of non-renewal ... by providing a thirty (30) day advance written notice,\u201d the contract \u201ctherefore conferred upon Blazy a reasonable expectation that his employment would renew automatically from term to term unless <em>official </em>action taken by the Commission in a timely and proper fashion foreclosed any such renewal.\u201d Although Blazy acknowledges receipt of the Executive Committee\u2019s non-renewal decision on January 18, 2008, he argues that this notice was insufficient because the Executive Committee was not empowered to make this decision on behalf of the full Commission and because the committee\u2019s written decision was not presented for review at the Commission\u2019s January 23 monthly meeting. He seeks \u201creinstatement with back pay and the restoration of all perquisites of employment and rights of tenure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">The Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s due process clause includes a guarantee of procedural fairness, assuring that a deprivation of life, liberty, or property must \u201cbe preceded by notice and opportunity for a hearing appropriate to the nature of the case.\u201d <em>Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudernull, </em>470 U.S. 532, 542, 105 S.Ct. 1487, 84 L.Ed.2d 494 (1985) (internal quotation marks omitted). When evaluating a claim for the violation of due process rights, \u201c[t]his court undertakes a two-step analysis.\u201d <em>Mitchell v. Fankhauser, </em>375 F.3d 477, 480 (6th Cir.2004). At the first step, the plaintiff must, as a threshold matter, establish that he had a protected property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>interest in his continued employment entitling him to due process protection. <em>See id.; Leary v. Daeschner, </em>228 F.3d 729, 741 (6th Cir.2000). As the Supreme Court has explained, a plaintiff cannot establish a property interest in a benefit, such as continued employment, by demonstrating merely \u201ca unilateral expectation\u201d or an \u201cabstract need or desire for it\u201d; he must demonstrate \u201ca legitimate claim of entitlement to it.\u201d <em>Roth, </em>408 U.S. at 577, 92 S.Ct. 2701; <em>see also Town of Castle Rock v. Gonzales, </em>545 U.S. 748, 756, 125 S.Ct. 2796, 162 L.Ed.2d 658 (2005). At the second step, \u201cif the plaintiff has such a protected property interest, this court must then determine what process is due.\u201d <em>Mitchell, </em>375 F.3d at 480 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">Property interests are not created by the Constitution but rather \u201care created and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law.\u201d <em>Roth, </em>408 U.S. at 577, 92 S.Ct. 2701; <em>see also Women\u2019s Med. Prof'l Corp. v. Baird, 438 F.3d </em>595, 611 (6th Cir.2006). \u201cA property interest can be created by a state statute, a formal contract, or a contract implied from the circumstances.\u201d <em>Singfield v. Akron Metro. Hous. Auth., </em>389 F.3d 555, 565 (6th Cir.2004) (citing <em>Perry v. Sindermann, </em>408 U.S. 593, 602, 92 S.Ct. 2694, 33 L.Ed.2d 570 (1972)); <em>accord Dorian v. Euclid Bd. of Educ., </em>62 Ohio St.2d 182, 404 N.E.2d 155, 158 (1980). In this case, we must look to Ohio law and to the terms of the employment contract to determine whether Blazy had a \u201clegitimate expectation of continued employment.\u201d <em>Johnston-Taylor v. Gannon, </em>907 F.2d 1577, 1581 (6th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">Blazy claims that the Commission infringed his Fourteenth Amendment right to procedural due process by \u201cfailing] to give timely and proper notice of non-renewal.\u201d He states that the Commission\u2019s \u201cfailure to follow regulations governing the process by which it takes official action\u201d provided the \u201cindependent basis\u201d supporting \u00a7 1983 liability. The defendants argue, in turn, that there is no independent basis on which Blazy can claim a protected property interest in employment beyond the two-year term. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">The defendants note that Blazy, as Director of the Commission, is designated as an unclassified employee who \u201cserves at the pleasure of the Commission\u201d and thus is not entitled to the statutorily-based due process protections afforded to classified civil servants under Ohio law. Indeed, we have recognized that \u201c[tjhere are critical differences between classified and unclassified civil servants\u201d in Ohio: whereas classified employees have tenure during \u201cgood behavior,\u201d can be discharged only for cause, and may not be deprived of their property interest in continued employment without due process of law, <em>see </em>Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \u00a7 124.34, unclassified employees \u201chave no property right to continued employment.\u201d <em>Christophel v. Kukulinsky, </em>61 F.3d 479, 482 (6th Cir.1995) (citing <em>Vodila v. Clelland, </em>836 F.2d 231, 232 (6th Cir.1987)). Blazy does not contest his unclassified status. However, an employee may claim a property interest in continued employment based upon contract, and Blazy contends that his contract\u2019s non-renewal provision created such an interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">The defendants also contend that, although Blazy\u2019s employment contract contemplated the <em>possibility </em>of subsequent terms, the contract does not create a legitimate <em>expectation </em>of continued employment beyond the two-year term. Blazy challenges this interpretation, arguing that the contract created a property interest in continued employment by providing for au<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>tomatic renewal in the absence of notification to the contrary by the Commission. Looking to the plain language of the contract, we conclude that the defendants have the better of the arguments. The contract\u2019s \u201cTerms of Agreement\u201d set forth a fixed two-year term of employment, starting on March 27, 2006, and ending on March 28, 2008. The contract also makes clear that any extension \u201cfor a specific period as determined by the Commission\u201d is \u201c[u]pon the approval of the Commission.\u201d Thus, contrary to Blazy\u2019s argument, the contract does not provide for automatic renewal in the absence of written notice. Nor did the Commission approve a subsequent term of employment. Blazy\u2019s expectation of automatic renewal is unsupported by the terms of the contract and insufficient to establish a property interest in continued employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">Blazy also challenges the district court\u2019s reliance upon <em>Roth, </em>in which Roth, an untenured teacher, sought relief for an alleged deprivation of procedural due process after the university notified him of its decision not to renew his contract for the next academic year without providing a statement of reasons or opportunity for a hearing. 408 U.S. at 568, 92 S.Ct. 2701. The Court rejected Roth\u2019s claim on the grounds that his \u201c\u2018property5 interest in employment ... was created and defined by the terms of his appointment\u201d; that these terms provided a defined ending date, with \u201cno provision for renewal whatsoever\u201d; and that, despite his \u201cabstract concern in being rehired,\u201d neither the contract terms nor university policy secured any legitimate entitlement to re-employment the next year. <em>Id. </em>at 578, 92 S.Ct. 2701.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">Blazy argues that his case is distinguishable from Roth: while Roth was afforded proper notice and was employed subject to a contract that included \u201cno provision for renewal whatsoever,\u201d Blazy\u2019s contract allegedly contemplated renewal absent written notice by the Commission. He further argues that the Executive Committee\u2019s timely written notice of its non-renewal decision was defective because the committee failed to present its written decision to the full Commission at the January 23 meeting, as required by Ohio law. <em>See </em>Ohio Rev.Code Ann. \u00a7 713.21(C) (\u201cAll actions of ... committees shall be reported in writing to the members of the regional planning commission no later than its next meeting....\u201d). Blazy therefore maintains that he was entitled to automatic renewal to a second term as Director.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">However, even if his argument that the Executive Committee failed to abide by the requirements of \u00a7 713.21(C) is meritorious,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Blazy\u2019s analysis of his alleged property interest in continued employment is misguided. He states that, if the full Commission had issued proper notice, \u201c[he] either would have had a chance to convince the Commission to allow his contract to renew or ... would have been given an opportunity to confront his accusers ... or meet any evidence of performance deficiencies ... through further discussions ... with the Commission as a whole.\u201d This argument is incorrect. In <em>Roth, </em>although university policy required written notification of non-retention decisions, the Supreme Court made clear that Roth was not entitled to a hearing or a statement of reasons following notification because he lacked a protected property interest in his employment following the expiration of his contract. Here, for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>same reasons, Blazy was not entitled to a hearing or other process regardless of whether he was notified by the Executive Committee or the full Commission: he was an unclassified employee; his contract provided for a fixed ending date on March 28, 2008; and the Commission did not elect to extend his contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">Although he contends that the contract\u2019s notice of non-renewal provision established an implied property interest in continued employment, Blazy has not identified any case law in this circuit or in Ohio supporting his argument. Moreover, our case law supports the defendants\u2019 argument that an unclassified employee does not acquire a property interest in continued employment merely by virtue of procedural protections afforded to him. <em>See McClain v. North-West Comm. </em>Corr. <em>Ctr. Judicial Corr. Bd., 440 F.3d </em>320, 330 (6th Cir.2006) (stating that an unclassified employee had no property interest under the Fourteenth Amendment in continued employment, notwithstanding a state regulation that provided some due process protection); <em>Lake Mich. Coll. Fed\u2019n of Teachers v. Lake Mich. Comm. Coll., </em>518 F.2d 1091, 1095 (6th Cir.1975) (noting that teachers who were terminated under Michigan\u2019s Public Employment Relations Act (\u201cPERA\u201d) for participating in an illegal strike did not acquire a protected property interest in continued employment \u201cmerely because the PERA requires the employer to follow certain procedures when discharging the employee\u201d); <em>see also Nigro v. Va. Commonwealth Univ. Med. Coll., </em>No. 5:09-CV00064, 2010 WL 2262539, at *6 (W.D.Va. June 4, 2010) (stating that notice procedures relevant to the non-renewal of a one-year contract did not \u201cimply a three-year property interest\u201d given \u201cthe express language regarding the contract\u2019s term\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">Blaz/s claim, at its essence, is a breach of contract action as to whether, pursuant to Article of Cooperation \u00a7 6.01, the Executive Committee was empowered to make the non-renewal decision; whether, pursuant to Ohio\u2019s Open Meeting Law, Ohio Rev.Code Ann. \u00a7 121.22, each member of the Executive Committee was properly notified of the January 17 meeting, in which Blazy\u2019s non-renewal decision was made; and whether, pursuant to \u00a7 713.21(C), the committee failed to properly present its decision in writing to the full Commission at its January 23 meeting. And, Blazy cannot seek federal relief pursuant to \u00a7 1983 for this alleged breach of contract. In <em>Ramsey v. Board of Education of Whitley County, </em>844 F.2d 1268, 1273 (6th Cir.1988), we stated that \u201c[w]hen a person is hired for a fixed period of time or pursuant to a contract providing for employment \u2018at will\u2019 ... and that person is dismissed prematurely, no federal cause of action lies under section 1983 to redress what is best characterized as an ordinary breach of contract.\u201d We explained that \u201ca nontenured employee\u2019s property interest in continued employment is created and defined by the employee\u2019s contract\u201d and that \u201cthe deprivation of that finite interest can be compensated adequately by an ordinary breach of contract action.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 1274.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">Blazy was not dismissed prematurely from his two-year term as Director, and he was compensated through the expiration of his contract. We affirm the district court\u2019s determinations that Blazy lacked a property interest in employment beyond the contract\u2019s March 28, 2008, termination date <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>and therefore is not entitled to relief under \u00a7 1983 for a deprivation of procedural due process.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Blazy also contends that the district court erred in declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over his state law claims for breach of contract and declaratory judgment and in dismissing these claims without prejudice under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c)(3). \u201cThis court reviews a district court\u2019s decision to decline supplemental jurisdiction over a state law claim for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Unger v. City of Mentor, </em>387 Fed.Appx. 589, 591-92 (6th Cir.2010) (citing <em>Carlsbad Tech., Inc. v. HIF Bio, Inc., </em>556 U.S. 635, 129 S.Ct. 1862, 1867, 173 L.Ed.2d 843 (2009)).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">As Blazy acknowledges, \u201c[rjesolution of ... [his] substantive claims turns on questions of law involving the interpretation and application of the written employment agreement and relevant statutory and corporate governance provisions that condition and define the limits\u201d of the Executive Committee\u2019s authority. Given that the alleged breach of the contract\u2019s notice provision hinges upon various provisions of Ohio and local law, including Ohio Rev.Code Ann. \u00a7 \u00a7 121.22 and 713.21(C) and Article of Cooperation \u00a7 6.01, the district court acted well within its discretion in declining to review this claim. Indeed, we have stated that \u201cif the federal claims are dismissed before trial, ... the state claims [generally] should be dismissed as well.\u201d <em>Saglioccolo v. Eagle Ins. Co., </em>112 F.3d 226, 233 (6th Cir.1997) (internal quotation marks omitted) (alterations in original). The district court did not abuse its discretion in declining supplemental jurisdiction over Blazy\u2019s claims for breach of contract and declaratory judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-11\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b434-7\">. Blazy also contests whether the Commission delegated authority to the Executive Committee to make hiring decisions and contends that the full Commission hired him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b437-6\">. Because it is an issue that we need not decide, we express no opinion as to whether the Executive Committee\u2019s notification of its nonrenewal decision violated the requirements of Ohio Rev.Code. Ann. \u00a7 713.21(C).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b438-5\">. Blazy disputes the applicability of <em>Ramsey. </em>However, in doing so, he quotes portions of <em>Ramsey </em>pertaining to tenured employees and therefore misunderstands his status as an unclassified, untenured employee who served \u201cat the pleasure of the Commission.\u201d He also contends that his contract provided for \"just cause\u201d termination. The record does not support this interpretation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b439-8\">. Having determined that Blazy lacked a property interest in continued employment beyond his two-year term and thus cannot seek relief under \u00a7 1983 against the Commission for a deprivation of procedural due process, we also conclude that Blazy's procedural due process claim against Fabian, in his personal capacity, is without merit. Furthermore, because Blazy had no property interest in continued employment, and therefore no basis for seeking relief under \u00a7 1983, we need not address Blazy's argument concerning the adequacy of a remedy under Ohio law.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
