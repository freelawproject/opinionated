For the reasons that follow, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-12\">In 1992, Rivera was convicted after a jury trial in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania of various drug charges, including distribution of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), and distribution of cocaine within 1000 feet of a school, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 860. He received a sentence of 292 months in prison. Rivera filed a direct appeal, which was dismissed pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 42(b). In May 1993, Rivera filed a motion to vacate sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The District Court denied relief on the merits and we affirmed. Rivera has since brought many challenges to his conviction and sentence, including motions pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582, habeas petitions pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, and a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244 for leave to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion, all of which have been unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-16\">In 2010, Rivera filed the present habeas petition in District Court pursuant to \u00a7 2241 claiming that the trial court erred in treating the drug involved in his offense as a sentencing factor rather than as an element of the offense to be found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Rivera also claimed that distribution of cocaine is a lesser-included offense of distribution of cocaine within 1000 feet of a school and that he was convicted of both crimes in violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The District Court adopted the Magistrate Judge\u2019s recommendation to dismiss the habeas petition for lack of jurisdiction, explaining that Rivera\u2019s claims are properly brought pursuant to \u00a7 2255, not \u00a7 2241. The District Court denied Rivera\u2019s subsequent motion for reconsideration and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-17\">\u201cMotions pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 are the presumptive means by which federal prisoners can challenge their convictions or sentences!)]\u201d <em>Okereke v. United States, </em>307 F.3d 117, 120 (3d Cir.2002). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>Although a petitioner may challenge a conviction pursuant to \u00a7 2241 where a \u00a7 2255 motion would be \u201cinadequate or ineffective,\u201d a \u00a7 2255 motion is not inadequate or ineffective because the petitioner is unable to meet \u00a7 2255\u2019s gatekeeping requirements. <em>Cradle v. United States, </em>290 F.3d 536, 538-39 (3d Cir.2002) (per curiam). Rather, a \u00a7 2255 motion is inadequate or ineffective \u201conly where the petitioner demonstrates that some limitation of scope or procedure would prevent a \u00a7 2255 proceeding from affording him a full hearing and adjudication of his wrongful detention claim.\u201d Id. at 538.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">Rivera has not made such a showing. As noted above, the fact that Rivera is unable to meet \u00a7 2255\u2019s gatekeeping requirements for filing a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion does not render a \u00a7 2255 motion \u201cinadequate or ineffective.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Rivera\u2019s case is also distinguishable from In re <em>Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d 245 (3d Cir.1997), in which we allowed the petitioner to raise in a habeas petition pursuant to \u00a7 2241 a claim under <em>Bailey v. United States, </em>516 U.S. 137, 116 S.Ct. 501, 133 L.Ed.2d 472 (1995).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The petitioner in <em>Dorsainvil </em>had no earlier opportunity to challenge his conviction for a crime that <em>Bailey </em>may have negated. <em>Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d at 251.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Rivera argues that he could not raise his double jeopardy claim when he filed his first \u00a7 2255 motion because we had yet to decide <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>443 F.3d 293 (3d Cir.2006), where we held that \u00a7 841(a)(1) is a lesser-included offense of \u00a7 860 and convictions for both crimes based on the same set of facts violate the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Double Jeopardy Clause. <em>Id. </em>at 300-02. Although <em>Jackson </em>was the first time we \u201cauthoritatively stated that 841(a) is a lesser-included offense of 860(a),\u201d <em>id. </em>at 301, at least one court of appeals had so held before Rivera filed his first \u00a7 2255 motion and another so held while his \u00a7 2255 motion was pending. <em>See United States v. Freyre-Lazaro, </em>3 F.3d 1496, 1507 (11th Cir.1993); <em>United States v. Scott, </em>987 F.2d 261, 266-67 (5th Cir.1993). Unlike in <em>Dorsainvil, </em>Rivera\u2019s claim does not involve an intervening change in substantive law that would negate the criminal nature of Rivera\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-10\">Rivera\u2019s argument that he should be able to raise in a \u00a7 2241 petition his claim that the trial court erred in treating the identity of the controlled substance involved in his offense as a sentencing factor fails for the same reason. <em>See Okereke, </em>307 F.3d at 120-21 (holding claim under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), that finding of drug quantity was improperly made by the trial judge at sentencing must be brought pursuant to \u00a7 2255, not \u00a7 2241). Finally, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Rivera\u2019s motion for reconsideration.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b180-11\">Accordingly, because this appeal does not raise a substantial question, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b179-13\">. Rivera raised this claim in his motion for leave to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion, which was denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b180-8\">. In <em>Bailey, </em>the Supreme Court held that a defendant could not be convicted of using a firearm during and in relation to a drug-trafficking crime under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1) unless the government proved that the defendant \"actively employed the firearm during and in relation to the predicate crime.\u201d <em>Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d at 247 (citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b180-13\">. In his motion for reconsideration, Rivera argued that the District Court erred in treating a motion for reconsideration of the Magistrate Judge\u2019s report as his objections to the report and in failing to conduct a <em>de novo </em>review. These arguments are without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
