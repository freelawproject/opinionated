The district court denied the application as time barred but nevertheless granted Mead a certificate of appealability on his claim of actual innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>If necessary, we must examine the basis of our jurisdiction sua sponte. <em>Mosley v. Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987). Mead\u2019s second \u00a7 2254 application raised a claim of actual innocence that could have been raised in his earlier application; therefore, the second application was successive. <em>See Crone v. Cockrell, </em>324 F.3d 833, 836 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">As a prisoner seeking to file a second or successive \u00a7 2254 application, Mead was required to apply for leave from this court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A). His failure to do so rendered his second application unauthorized, thus depriving the district court of jurisdiction. <em>See United States v. Key, </em>205 F.3d 773, 774 (5th Cir.2000). As such, we lack jurisdiction over this habeas appeal. <em>See id. </em>at 775. The judgment of the district court is thus VACATED, and the appeal is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b364-36\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
