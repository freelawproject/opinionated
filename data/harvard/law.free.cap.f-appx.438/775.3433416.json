Martinez argues that the district court could not enhance by two points his base offense level for possessing device-making equipment, <em>see </em>United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(10)(A)(i) (2009), because that misconduct was accounted for in his sentence for aggravated identity theft. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-10\">The district court did not err by adding two points to Martinez\u2019s base offense level. A defendant convicted of aggravated identity theft cannot be sentenced for that offense and a \u201cspecific offense characteristic for the transfer, possession, or use of a means of identification,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2B1.6 cmt. n. 2, which includes any \u201ctelecommunication identifying information or access device (as defined in section 1029(e)[ (1) and (11)]),\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(d)(7). Martinez possessed a piece of \u201cdevice-making equipment\u201d called a \u201cscanning receiver,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(10)(A)(i) <em>&amp; </em>cmt. n. 9 (A). The aggravated identity theft statute punishes the \u201ctransfer\u00ed ], possession], or use[], without lawful authority, [of] a means of identification of another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A(a)(l). Because neither a piece of \u201cdevice-making equipment\u201d nor a \u201cscanning receiver\u201d constitute a means of identification, the district court could enhance Martinez\u2019s sentence for possessing a credit card skimming device.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-11\">We AFFIRM Martinez\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
