For the reasons that follow, we dismiss the appeal and remand with instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-24\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-25\">From 1999 through July 2005, Joseph DiBruno, Sr. (\u201cDiBruno\u201d), and his sons Joseph, Jr., and Nicholas organized and incorporated various corporations and entities, soliciting investors with promises of high rates of return. Some of these entities were operational businesses, but others were merely \u201cshell\u201d entities designed to allow DiBruno and his sons to solicit monies from unsuspecting investors. Di-Bruno and his sons did not invest investors\u2019 funds into the operational businesses; rather, they used the funds they solicited for personal expenditures, defrauding investors of over three million dollars. In August 2007, a federal grand jury returned a second superseding indictment charging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>DiBruno and his sons with, among other offenses, conspiracy to defraud the United States, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 (2006). DiBruno pled guilty, pursuant to a written plea agreement, to the conspiracy charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Prior to sentencing, DiBruno moved to withdraw his guilty plea, but the district court denied the motion after a hearing at which DiBruno testified. Based on his testimony at the hearing, the district court found DiBruno guilty of criminal contempt, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 401 (2006); Fed.R.Crim.P. 42(b). The court sentenced DiBruno to sixty months\u2019 imprisonment on the conspiracy count, ordered that he pay a $100 special assessment, and ordered that he pay restitution, jointly and severally with his co-defendant sons, in the amount of $3,808,487. The court also sentenced Di-Bruno to six months\u2019 imprisonment on the contempt count, to be served consecutively to the sixty-month prison term on the conspiracy count. DiBruno timely appealed the judgment of conviction and the district court\u2019s order of contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">In February 2009, while DiBruno\u2019s appeal was pending in this court, but before filing an opening appellate brief, DiBruno\u2019s counsel filed a suggestion of death, informing us that DiBruno had died. The Government then moved to dismiss the appeal as moot. In response, DiBruno\u2019s counsel concurred with the Government\u2019s conclusion that the appeal should be dismissed as moot as a result of DiBruno\u2019s death. Counsel further asserted that the case should be remanded to the district court with instructions to vacate DiBruno\u2019s convictions and dismiss the indictment against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">The parties disagreed, however, over the appropriate resolution of the order of restitution, and we directed them to file briefs addressing this issue. Having reviewed those briefs and the submissions relative to the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss, we conclude that, although DiBruno\u2019s convictions and sixty-six month prison sentence abate as a result of his death pending appeal, the restitution order survives.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">In <em>United States v. Dudley, </em>739 F.2d 175, 176 (4th Cir.1984), this court held that the death of an appellant pending an appeal of his criminal conviction results in the abatement of \u201cnot only the appeal but all proceedings in the prosecution from its inception.\u201d In such a case, the appeal is to be dismissed and the case remanded to the district court with instructions to vacate the judgment of conviction and dismiss the indictment. <em>Id, </em>An exception to this general directive exists, however, as to any order of restitution included within the criminal judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 178.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-11\">In this case, DiBruno timely appealed both the judgment of conviction and the district court\u2019s order of criminal contempt, and the appeal was pending in this court at the time of DiBruno\u2019s death. Although DiBruno died before his counsel filed an opening appellate brief raising any issues for review, there existed at the time of DiBruno\u2019s death at least the possibility that his convictions might be overturned. <em>See United States v. DeMichael, </em>461 F.3d 414, 417 (3d Cir.2006) (\u201cWhen a defendant appeals the judgment of conviction itself ... or files a general notice of appeal but dies before submitting an opening brief, the possibility remains that the conviction itself might be overturned.\u201d); <em>United States v. Pogue, </em>19 F.3d 663, 665 (D.C.Cir.1994) (per curiam) (\u201c[Ajppellant had filed a timely appeal before his death; the appeal was not withdrawn; and, had he lived, appellant could have challenged the plea agreement and underlying conviction.\u201d). In view of this possibility, we conclude that DiBruno died pending the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>appeal of his conspiracy and contempt convictions. Accordingly, the general rule of abatement applies, and we therefore grant the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal as moot. We also remand to the district court with instructions to vacate DiBruno\u2019s convictions and sixty-six month prison sentence and to dismiss the second superseding indictment as to Di-Bruno. <em>See Dudley, </em>739 F.2d at 176. However, fee assessments already paid need not be refunded because they are the equivalent of prison time already served; therefore, the rule of abatement does not apply to any payments already made on the $100 special assessment, and we further instruct that the Government not be ordered to refund any such payments to DiBruno\u2019s estate. <em>See United States v. Zizzo, </em>120 F.3d 1338, 1346-47 (7th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">With respect to the order of restitution, DiBruno\u2019s counsel suggests that it, too, should abate because failure to abate the order would contravene the principle that death pending appeal abates all proceedings in the prosecution from its inception. Counsel also suggests that allowing the restitution order to survive DiBruno\u2019s death would create statutory inconsistency because the acts governing restitution, the Victim and Witness Protection Act of 1982, as amended (\u201cVWPA\u201d), <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663 (2006), and the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act of 1996 (\u201cMVRA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 104-132, \u00a7\u00a7 201-11, 110 Stat. 1214, 1227-41 (codified in relevant part at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3663A, 3664 (2006)), authorize restitution only for those who are \u201cconvicted\u201d of criminal offenses. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">We have previously concluded that orders of restitution do not abate by reason of the death of a convicted criminal defendant who dies while his appeal his pending. <em>Dudley, </em>739 F.2d at 177-78. As Judge Murnaghan explained for the court in <em>Dudley, </em>\u201c[t]he argument that impositions of penalties in criminal cases have heretofore always been abated on death of the accused ... grows out of the consideration that punishment, incarceration, or rehabilitation have heretofore largely been the exclusive purposes of sentences and so ordinarily should be abated upon death\u201d because \u201cshuffling off the mortal coil completely forecloses punishment, incarceration, or rehabilitation, this side of the grave at any rate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 177. Recognizing that \u201c[i]t is an old and respected doctrine of the common law that a rule ceases to apply when the reason for it[] dissipates,\u201d the court held that the rule of abatement should not apply to orders of restitution because such orders, although contained in judgments of convictions and thus \u201cin some respects penal,\u201d have the \u201cpredominantly compensatory purpose of reducing the adverse impact [of the defendant\u2019s crimes] on the victim.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">Although the Courts of Appeals are divided on whether an order of restitution abates when a convicted criminal defendant dies pending direct appeal, <em>compare United States v. Christopher, </em>273 F.3d 294, 298-99 (3d Cir.2001) (holding restitution order does not abate); <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>Nos. 91-3287, 91-3382, 1991 WL 131892, at *1 (6th Cir. July 18, 1991) (same); <em>Dudley, </em>739 F.2d at 178 (same), <em>with United States v. Rich, </em>603 F.3d 722, 728-31 (9th Cir.2010) (holding restitution order does abate); <em>United States v. Estate of Parsons, </em>367 F.3d 409, 415 (5th Cir.2004) (en banc) (same); <em>United States v. Logal, </em>106 F.3d 1547, 1552 (11th Cir.1997) (same), <em>Dudley </em>is controlling Circuit precedent and thus dictates the result here. <em>See United States v. Rivers, </em>595 F.3d 558, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>564 n. 3 (4th Cir.2010) (\u201c[A] panel of this court cannot overrule, explicitly or implicitly, the precedent set by a prior panel of this court. Only the Supreme Court or this court sitting en banc can do that.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). The <em>Dudley </em>decision explicitly excepted orders of restitution from the general rule that \u201c[d]eath pending appeal of a criminal conviction abates not only the appeal but all proceedings in the prosecution from its inception.\u201d <em>Dudley, </em>739 F.2d at 176-78. Counsel\u2019s first claim is thus foreclosed by <em>Dudley </em>and therefore fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Counsel also suggests that, the <em>Dudley </em>decision notwithstanding, allowing the order of restitution to survive DiBruno\u2019s death would create statutory inconsistency because the VWPA and the MVRA authorize restitution only for those defendants who have been \u201cconvicted\u201d of criminal offenses. Counsel thus posits that where a defendant\u2019s conviction never becomes final as a result of his death pending appeal, the statutes provide no authority for the defendant to be required to pay restitution. In the absence of such authority, counsel urges, the restitution component of a defendant\u2019s sentence also must abate.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">Restitution is a statutory remedy based in the VWPA and the MVRA. Enacted in 1982, the VWPA authorized, but did not require, district courts to order restitution to victims when sentencing defendants convicted of criminal offenses. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663(a)(1)(A) (\u201cThe court, <em>when sentencing a defendant convicted of an offense </em>under this title ... may order, in addition to ... any other penalty authorized by law, that the defendant make restitution to any victim of such offense.\u201d (emphasis added)). In 1996, the MVRA, which supersedes the VWPA in part, was enacted. The MVRA requires a district court to order restitution to victims when sentencing defendants convicted of certain criminal offenses. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A(a)(l), (c)(l)(A)(ii), (B) <em>(\u201c[W]hen sentencing a defendant convicted of an offense </em>[committed by fraud or deceit[ ] or ... in which an identifiable victim or victims has suffered a ... pecuniary loss], the court shall order, in addition to ... any other penalty authorized by law, that the defendant make restitution to the victim of the offense.\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">Counsel\u2019s argument that these statutes provide no authority for a decedent defendant\u2019s estate to be required to pay restitution proceeds from the premise that the term \u201cconvicted\u201d has a specific temporal thrust. <em>Dudley, </em>however, countenanced the view that the import of the term \u201cconvicted\u201d is provided by the context in which term is used, and that the pertinent context was \u201cwhen [the district court was] sentencing\u201d Dudley. At sentencing in October 1983, Dudley stood \u201cconvicted\u201d of one drug distribution and several food stamp offenses and was ordered, pursuant to the VWPA, to pay restitution. <em>Dudley, </em>739 F.2d at 175-76. And although this court abated Dudley\u2019s convictions as the result of his death pending appeal, the court did not abate the order of restitution, even though Dudley\u2019s convictions were voided as a result of the abatement. <em>Id. </em>at 177-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">While <em>Dudley </em>issued before the enactment of the MVRA, the court\u2019s adoption of this view of the temporal thrust of the term \u201cconvicted\u201d applies to orders of restitution issued, as here, under the MVRA. It is a bedrock principle of statutory interpretation that statutes that are <em>in pan materia </em>or relating to the same subject matter are to be interpreted in light of, and consistently with, one another. <em>United States v. Stewart, </em>311 U.S. 60, 64, 61 S.Ct. 102, 85 L.Ed. 40 (1940). This inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>pretive principle is especially applicable when two statutes adopt the same vocabulary in reference to the same subject matter. <em>See, e.g., Oscar Mayer &amp; Co. v. Evans, </em>441 U.S. 750, 756, 99 S.Ct. 2066, 60 L.Ed.2d 609 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">Here, the MVRA adopts the same vocabulary\u2014\u201cwhen sentencing a defendant convicted of an offense\u201d\u2014as used in the VWPA to refer to the same subject matter, namely, the temporal condition precedent for a court to order the defendant to pay restitution. As <em>Dudley </em>interprets the term \u201cconvicted\u201d as used in the VWPA with reference to this temporal context, the <em>in pari, materia </em>canon directs adoption of the same construction of the term as used in the MVRA. Applying this approach here, because DiBruno stood \u201cconvicted\u201d of the conspiracy offense during sentencing and was ordered during sentencing to pay restitution to the victims of that offense, the restitution order is valid and thus survives the abatement of DiBruno\u2019s convictions following his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">Adopting the position of DiBruno\u2019s counsel would, we believe, contravene Congress\u2019 intent to require Federal criminal defendants to compensate the identifiable victims of their crimes. In <em>Dudley, </em>this court held a restitution order under the VWPA has the \u201cpredominantly compensatory purpose of reducing the adverse impact [of the defendant\u2019s crimes] on the victim.\u201d <em>Dudley, </em>739 F.2d at 177. A review of the MVRA and VWPA, as amended, confirms that restitution orders continue to be compensatory in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">The MVRA amended the VWPA to provide that restitution orders under the VWPA are to be issued and enforced in accordance with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664, the enforcement provision of the MVRA. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663(d). In each restitution order under the MVRA and the VWPA, as amended, the district court must order restitution to \u201ceach victim in the full amount of each victim\u2019s losses as determined by the court and without consideration of the economic circumstances of the defendant.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(f)(1)(A). Additionally, under the MVRA and VWPA, as amended, the district court\u2019s order of restitution creates a property right for the victim that has the effect of a civil judgment against the convicted criminal defendant or his estate. An order of restitution is a heritable, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663(a)(1)(A), assignable, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(g)(2), civil judgment \u201cin favor of such victim,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3664(m)(l)(B), and, when properly registered or recorded, shall operate as \u201ca lien on the property of the defendant ... in the same manner and to the same extent and under the same conditions as a judgment of a court of general jurisdiction,\u201d <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">Further, an order of restitution carries the civil effects of joint and several liability, collateral estoppel, and subrogation. Where, as here, multiple defendants contribute to a victim\u2019s loss, the district court may make each defendant liable for payment of the full restitution amount. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3664(h). A defendant ordered to make restitution is estopped from denying the essential allegations of the offense in any subsequent civil proceeding. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3664(Z). Additionally, an insurer or other person who compensates the victim for any loss covered by a restitution order may, to the extent of the payment, be subrogated to the victim\u2019s right against the restitution debtor. <em>Id,. </em>\u00a7 3664(j)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">Other provisions of the MVRA and VWPA, as amended, protect the defendant from possible punitive effects of a restitution order. For instance, in the case of property loss to the victim, the restitution order may require only a return of the property or payment equal to the value of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>the property loss. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3663(b)(1), 3663A(b)(l). In the case of bodily injury to the victim, the restitution order may compensate the victim only for certain, enumerated expenses incurred as a result of the offense. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 3663(b)(2)-(3), 3663A(b)(2)-(3). Further, any restitution amount paid to a victim under a restitution order must be reduced by the victim\u2019s recovery for the same loss in civil proceedings. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(j)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">These provisions make clear that an order of restitution under the MVRA or the VWPA, as amended, is expressly non-punitive and the equivalent of a civil judgment against a criminal defendant requiring that he compensate his victims for the specific harms he has done to them by his offenses. <em>See United States v. Bach, </em>172 F.3d 520, 523 (7th Cir.1999) (stating that the MVRA requires that \u201cdefinite persons are to be compensated for definite losses just as if the persons were successful tort plaintiffs\u201d). Because orders of restitution under the MVRA, like their VWPA predecessors, are meant to compensate victims of crime, they do not abate with the death of a convicted criminal defendant pending appeal. <em>See Dudley, </em>739 F.2d at 177-78. We thus reject counsel\u2019s second claim and instruct the district court on remand to leave unaffected the order of restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">Accordingly, the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal is granted and the appeal is dismissed as moot. The case is remanded to the district court with instructions to vacate DiBruno\u2019s convictions and sixty-six month prison sentence, dismiss the second superseding indictment as to him, and leave unaffected the order of restitution and any paid portion of the special assessment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">\n<em>DISMISSED AND REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
