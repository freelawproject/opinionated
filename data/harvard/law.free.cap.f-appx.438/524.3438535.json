The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced him to consecutive prison terms of 120 months on the drug charge and 60 months on the firearm charge, the statutory minimum sentences. On appeal, Hedges\u2019s counsel moved to withdraw and filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Counsel also moved to unseal certain district court documents for use in this appeal. Hedges has not filed a pro se supplemental brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-22\">As the <em>Anders </em>brief acknowledges, (i) we may not consider the issue of ineffective assistance of trial counsel because neither the argument nor the record is adequately developed for review on direct appeal, <em>see United States v. McAdory, </em>501 F.3d 868, 872 (8th Cir.2007); and (ii) Hedges\u2019s objection to the mandatory consecutive five-year sentence for his section 924(c) conviction because he received a ten-year sentence on the related drug charge is precluded by the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Abbott v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 18, 23, 178 L.Ed.2d 348 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-25\">The remaining arguments raised on appeal are within the scope of the appeal waiver. We enforce the appeal waiver because the record establishes that Hedges knowingly and voluntarily entered into both the plea agreement and the appeal waiver, and enforcing the waiver would not result in a miscarriage of justice. <em>See United States v. Andis, </em>333 F.3d 886, 889-92 (8th Cir.2003) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-26\">We have reviewed the record independently pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), and find no nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, we affirm. We grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and deny the motion to unseal documents.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b548-19\">. The Honorable Ortrie D. Smith, United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
