Montgomery, </em>\u2014 Fed.Appx. -, 2007 WL 3122255, *1 (3d Cir. Oct. 26, 2007).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We have already determined that Montgomery\u2019s sentence is reasonable, <em>see id. </em>at *4, and, further, that he is not entitled to a sentence reduction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), because \u201c[t]he more than 150 kilograms of powder cocaine for which he was responsible supports his base offense level, wholly apart from any changes to the Crack Cocaine Guidelines range.\u201d <em>United States v. Montgomery, </em>398 Fed.Appx. 843, 845 (3d Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-12\">In Montgomery\u2019s latest challenge to his sentence, he claimed that he should be resentenced based on the instruction from <em>Spears v. United States, </em>555 U.S. 261, 129 S.Ct. 840, 843, 172 L.Ed.2d 596 (2009) (per curiam), that \u201c[a] sentencing judge who is given the power to reject the disparity created by the crack-to-powder ration must also possess the power to apply a different ratio which, in his judgment, corrects the disparity.\u201d Montgomery invited the District Court to resentence him using the 1:1 ratio found to be appropriate in <em>United States v. Gully, </em>619 F.Supp.2d 633 (N.D.Iowa 2009). The District Court rejected Montgomery\u2019s invitation, concluding that \u201cemploying a different crack-to-powder ratio would have no effect on Montgomery\u2019s base offense level or his sentence.\u201d We agree with that conclusion and will summarily affirm the District Court. <em>See </em>I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b144-13\">. Specifically, Montgomery was convicted by the jury of conspiring to distribute powder cocaine and crack cocaine. \"At sentencing, the [District] Court determined that he was responsible for distributing more than 1.5 kilograms of crack cocaine and, separately, more than 150 kilograms of powder cocaine.\u201d <em>United States v. Montgomery, </em>398 Fed.Appx. 843, 844 (3d Cir.2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
