In June 2010, Wallace filed a pro se habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 in the District Court. After filing his habeas petition, Wallace also filed various motions in the District Court related to pretrial proceedings in the Court of Common Pleas. The Magistrate Judge issued a Report recommending that Wallace\u2019s habeas petition be dismissed because he had not exhausted state court remedies. After rejecting Wallace\u2019s objections, the District Court adopted the Magistrate Judge\u2019s Report, and also intimated that it could properly invoke <em>Younger </em>abstention. Wallace then sought a certificate of appeal-ability from this Court, which we denied. In addition, Wallace filed various post-judgment motions in the District Court, which the District Court has not yet ruled on. On February 28, 2011, Wallace filed this pro se mandamus petition, as well as motions in support thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-22\">It is not entirely clear from Wallace\u2019s petition what exactly he wishes to compel the District Court to rule on. In the petition, Wallace asserts that the county-level magistrate who issued a search warrant in his case did not have jurisdiction to do so. Accordingly, Wallace argues, he is entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>to have the search warrant quashed and to have evidence seized pursuant to the warrant suppressed. Wallace challenged the seizure of evidence in various pre-judgment motions related to his habeas petition, and the District Court dismissed those motions without prejudice. To the extent that Wallace seeks to compel the District Court to rule on any claims raised in those motions, his request is moot because the District Court already ruled on the claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Wallace also raised similar issues complaining of the validity of the search warrant in his \u201cpetition for review,\u201d which he filed after the District Court dismissed Wallace\u2019s habeas petition. To the extent that Wallace seeks to compel the District Court to rule on his petition for review, we conclude that mandamus is not appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Mandamus is a drastic remedy available in only the most extraordinary circumstances. <em>In re Diet Drugs Prods. Liab. Litig., </em>418 F.3d 372, 378 (3d Cir.2005). \u201cA petitioner seeking the issuance of a writ of mandamus must have no other adequate means to obtain the desired relief, and must show that the right to issuance is clear and indisputable.\u201d <em>Madden v. Myers, </em>102 F.3d 74, 79 (3d Cir.1996). In addition, as a general rule, the manner in which a court disposes of cases on its docket is within its discretion. <em>See In re Fine Paper Antitrust Litig., </em>685 F.2d 810, 817 (3d Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">Nonetheless, mandamus may be warranted when a district court\u2019s \u201cundue delay is tantamount to a failure to exercise jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Madden, </em>102 F.3d at 79. The District Court\u2019s delay in this case, however, does not meet that standard. Wallace filed his petition for review on January 12, 2011. Only about a month and a half passed between the time Wallace filed his petition for review and his mandamus petition, which he filed on February 28, 2011. Moreover, considering that Wallace\u2019s state case is still ongoing and that the District Court already dismissed Wallace\u2019s prejudgment motions asserting arguments related to those in his petition for review, it is understandable that the District Court may be proceeding with caution. We cannot say that the delay in adjudicating Wallace\u2019s petition for review is \u201ctantamount to a failure to exercise jurisdiction\u201d or \u201crise[s] to the level of a denial of due process.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">To the extent that Wallace asks us to compel the District Court to grant his post-judgment petition for review (rather than simply rule on it), he has not demonstrated that he has \u201cno other adequate means to obtain the desired relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The District Court still has time in which to rule on the petition for review, and if and when the District Court denies it, Wallace is free to challenge such action via direct appeal. <em>See In re Chambers Dev. Co., </em>148 F.3d 214, 223 (3d Cir.1998) (\u201c[A] writ of mandamus should not be issued where relief may be obtained through an ordinary appeal.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for a writ of mandamus will be dismissed. In reaching our decision, we also considered Wallace\u2019s motions accompanying his petition for a writ of mandamus, and now dismiss those motions along with his petition.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
