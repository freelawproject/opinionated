After exhausting his state remedies, he petitioned the district court for a writ of habeas corpus, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. The court denied relief, and he appeals its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-8\">The district court issued a certificate of appealability on three issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-9\">1. Whether petitioner was denied effective assistance of counsel, where his lawyer failed to object and/or file a motion to dismiss the Amended Information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-10\">2. Whether petitioner was denied effective assistance of counsel, where his lawyer failed to object to and/or otherwise preserve as error the court\u2019s confusing and otherwise misleading instructions to the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-11\">3. Whether petitioner was denied effective assistance of counsel, where his lawyer failed to discover that one of the petitioner\u2019s prior convictions did not qualify as a predicate offense for purposes of his habitual felony offender enhancement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b826-12\">In his brief on appeal, petitioner failed to brief the third issue. We therefore treat it as abandoned, <em>Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008), and turn to the first two issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-13\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of \u00a7 2254 habeas relief <em>de novo. Gamble v. Sec\u2019y Fla. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>450 F.3d 1245, 1247 (11th Cir.2006). A federal, court may grant a writ of habeas corpus only if the decision of the state court adjudicating the petitioner\u2019s claim (1) \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court,\u201d or (2) \u201cwas based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the [sjtate court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1), (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-14\">A state court\u2019s decision is \u201ccontrary to\u201d federal law if \u201cthe state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by [the Supreme Court] on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than th[e] Court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.\u201d <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 412-13, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 1523, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000). A state court\u2019s decision involves \u201can unreasonable application\u201d of federal law if \u201cthe state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from [the Supreme Court\u2019s] decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 413, 120 S.Ct. at 1523.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-15\">To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the petitioner must demonstrate both (1) that his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, <em>i.e., </em>the performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, and (2) that he suffered prejudice as a result of that deficient performance. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687-88, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064-65, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). In determining whether counsel gave adequate assistance, \u201ccounsel is strongly presumed to have rendered adequate assistance and made all significant decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 690, 104 S.Ct. at 2066. Counsel\u2019s per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>formance is deficient only if it falls below the wide range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases. <em>Id. </em>at 688-89, 104 S.Ct. at 2065. To make such a showing, the petitioner must demonstrate that \u201cno competent counsel would have taken the action that his counsel did take.\u201d <em>United States v. Freixas, </em>332 F.3d 1314, 1319-20 (11th Cir.2003) (quotation omitted). A lawyer cannot be deficient for failing to raise a meritless claim. <em>Freeman v. Atty. Gen. </em>536 F.3d 1225, 1233 (11th Cir.2008). Prejudice is a \u201creasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d Strickland 466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">In a \u00a7 2254 proceeding, the petitioner must do more than satisfy the <em>Strickland </em>standard; the petitioner must also show that the state court applied <em>Strickland </em>in an objectively unreasonable manner. <em>Rutherford v. Crosby, </em>385 F.3d 1300, 1309 (11th Cir.2004); <em>Knowles v. Mirzayance, </em>556 U.S. 111, -, 129 S.Ct. 1411, 1420, 173 L.Ed.2d 251 (2009) (noting that the standard of review is \u201cdoubly deferential\u201d when \u201ca <em>Strickland </em>claim [is] evaluated under the \u00a7 2254(d)(1) standard\u201d). With these principles in hand, we consider the two issues before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-9\">Under Florida law, an information may be substantively amended during trial, even over the objection of the defense, in the absence of a showing of prejudice to the substantial rights of the accused. <em>See State v. Anderson, </em>537 So.2d 1373, 1375-76 (Fla.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-10\">Florida criminal law provides the following as to the crime of burglary:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-11\">[ (1) ](b) For offenses committed after July 1, 2001, \u201cburglary\u201d means: 1. Entering a dwelling, a structure, or a conveyance with the intent to commit an offense therein, unless the premises are at the time open to the public or the defendant is licensed or invited to enter;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-12\">(2) Burglary is a felony of the first degree, punishable by imprisonment for a term of years not exceeding life imprisonment ... if, in the course of committing the offense, the offender:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-13\">(b) Is or becomes armed within the dwelling, structure, or conveyance, with explosives or a dangerous weapon;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-14\">(3) Burglary is a felony of the second degree ... if, in the course of committing the offense, the offender does not make an assault or battery and is not and does not become armed with a dangerous weapon or explosive, and the offender enters or remains in a:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-15\">(c) Structure, and there is another person in the structure at the time the offender enters or remains;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b827-16\">Fla. Stat. \u00a7 810.02 (2007). As to lesser included offenses, Fla. R.Crim. P. 3.490 provides: \u201c[i]f the indictment or information charges an offense divided into degrees, the jury may find the defendant guilty of the offense charged or any lesser degree supported by the evidence. The judge shall not instruct on any degree as to which there is no evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b827-17\">The Florida Standard Jury Instructions for criminal cases appear on the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s website. The burglary instruction specifically provides that burglary of an occupied structure, in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 810.02(3)(c), is a lesser in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>eluded offense of armed burglary, in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 810.02(2)(b). http:// www.floridasupremecourt.org/jury_ instructions/instructions.shtml#, Chapter 13.1 at 4-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">The state court reasonably determined, pursuant to <em>Strickland, </em>that petitioner\u2019s lawyer rendered effective assistance even though counsel failed to object or move to dismiss the amended information. Here, counsel did not object to the amended information because the lawful amendment decreased the severity of the charged offense, which benefitted the defendant. Moreover, because burglary of an occupied structure is a lesser included offense of armed burglary under Florida law, the court likely would have instructed the jury as to the lesser offense even without the amendment. Fla. R.Crim. P. 3.490. Thus, counsel\u2019s performance in failing to object did not fall below the wide range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 688, 104 S.Ct. at 2065. Furthermore, petitioner has failed to establish that the outcome of the proceedings would have been different had his counsel objected to the amended information, and thus, he has failed to establish that he suffered any prejudice as a result of counsel\u2019s performance. <em>Id. </em>at 687, 104 S.Ct. at 2064.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">The state court reasonably determined, pursuant to <em>Strickland, </em>that petitioner\u2019s attorney rendered effective assistance even though counsel failed to object to a jury instruction that, petitioner contends, was confusing or misleading. Here, even though the court initially misstated that the defendant was charged with armed burglary, the court read the standard burglary instruction and then instructed the jury to determine whether the structure was occupied. The instruction itself did not mention the word \u201carmed\u201d and it did not instruct the jury to determine whether the defendant was guilty of armed burglary. Because the trial court read the proper instruction and the initial misstatement was minor, the district court did not err in finding that the state court reasonably applied <em>Strickland </em>in determining that counsel\u2019s performance was not deficient. <em>Freeman v. Atty. Gen. </em>536 F.3d 1225, 1233 (11th Cir.2008). Moreover, because petitioner failed to establish that the court\u2019s misstatement impacted the jury\u2019s verdict, the trial court reasonably applied <em>Strickland </em>in concluding that petitioner was not prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s failure to object to the jury instruction. <em>Rutherford, </em>385 F.3d at 1309; <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. at 2064.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
