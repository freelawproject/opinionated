We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-22\">Jackson filed a civil action in District Court by filing a complaint against twenty defendants, naming the Secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections and nineteen officers and employees of the State Correctional Institution-Graterford.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The District Court granted Jackson\u2019s application to proceed <em>informa pauperis </em>and dismissed the complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e), with leave to file an amended complaint within thirty days. The District Court instructed Jackson to describe in his amended complaint, as clearly and briefly as possible, the specific events that violated his constitutional rights, the identities of the persons in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>volved in his claims, and the harm he suffered, if any, from each violation. Jackson requested additional time to file his amended complaint, which the District Court granted, allowing Jackson approximately one additional month beyond the original deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">Jackson filed a \u201cMotion With Leave To File An Amended Complaint,\u201d with a proposed amended complaint and supporting documents attached. Jackson later filed a document titled \u201cPlaintiffs Order To Show Cause For Preliminary Injunction.\u201d On March 18, 2011, the District Court entered a dismissal order, finding that the amended complaint failed to comply with Rule 8 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and noting that the proposed complaint consisted of \u201c53 pages of rambling complaints, handwritten, single spaced, and in many instances difficult if not impossible to read.\u201d The District Court also noted that the \u201cPlaintiffs Order To Show Cause\u201d must be dismissed insofar as it was based upon the motion for leave to file and the amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">Jackson appeals. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint. <em>See Tourscher v. McCullough, </em>184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir.1999). However, we review the District Court\u2019s dismissal of a complaint for failure to comply with Rule 8 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for an abuse of discretion. <em>See In re Westinghouse Sec. Litig., </em>90 F.3d 696, 702 (3d Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">Upon review of the record, and holding Jackson\u2019s amended complaint to less stringent standards in light of his pro se status, <em>see Erickson v. Pardus, </em>551 U.S. 89, 94, 127 S.Ct. 2197, 167 L.Ed.2d 1081 (2007), we agree with the District Court that the amended complaint failed to comply with Rule 8. The amended complaint consists of approximately fifty pages of rambling allegations, presented mostly in single-paragraph style, often with each paragraph spanning several pages.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As the District Court noted, most of the document appears in handwriting that is unreadable in many instances. The amended complaint lacks \u201ca short and plain statement\u201d of the court\u2019s jurisdictional grounds, and of the claim showing entitlement to relief, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a), and the allegations are not \u201csimple, concise, and direct,\u201d <em>see </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 8(d)(1). Accordingly, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Jackson\u2019s amended complaint and the related pending matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-11\">We will affirm the District Court\u2019s order because this appeal does not present a substantial question. <em>See </em>3d Cir. LAR 27.4.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b98-9\">. The complaint was partially on a complaint form and partially handwritten, and the document spanned about thirty pages.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b99-8\">. The accompanying \"Motion With Leave To File An Amended Complaint\u201d is presented in similar style and length.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
