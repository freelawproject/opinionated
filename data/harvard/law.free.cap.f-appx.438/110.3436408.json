We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-13\">Hookey was eight and one-half months pregnant when, in January 2008, she began her incarceration at SCI-Muncy in Clinton Township, Pennsylvania. After Hookey gave birth, her newborn son was placed in the custody of a caretaker from Lighthouse Prison Ministries (\u201cLPM\u201d); pursuant to a prior agreement, he was to return to Hookey\u2019s custody when she completed her prison sentence. In July 2008, however, Judge DiSalle of the Washington County Court of Common Pleas entered an order granting sole custody of Hookey\u2019s son to Aaron Jones, the child\u2019s biological father. With the assistance of Trooper Townsend of the Pennsylvania State Police, Jones acquired physical custody of his and Hookey\u2019s son from the LPM caretaker.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-14\">Since beginning her incarceration at SCI-Muncy, Hookey has filed 39 grievances against various prison officials. Most of the grievances appear to have focused on the alleged refusal of these officials to act on Hookey\u2019s concerns regarding the well-being of her son. Each grievance was denied at the initial review stage, and no administrative appeals were taken prior to Hookey\u2019s initiation of this suit in December 2008. In her third amended complaint, filed in April 2009, Hookey claimed that her constitutional rights had been violated by Judge DiSalle, Trooper Townsend, former LPM employee Harriet Dalton, and several SCI-Muncy prison officials (\u201cthe DOC officials\u201d). Hookey alleged that all named defendants \u201cwere deliberately indifferent to the safety of the Plaintiff, and her infant son[,] by disregarding complaints of kidnapping, abuse and neglect, and numerous criminal and civil law violations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b135-15\">Hookey specifically alleged that Judge DiSalle violated her equal protection rights in (1) failing to appoint counsel in her paternity suit against Jones, (2) failing to stay custody proceedings, (3) failing to allow her to fully participate in the custody proceedings, and (4) awarding Jones custody. Hookey alleged that Trooper Townsend violated her equal protection rights by ignoring her request to file a criminal complaint against Jones, and by carrying the \u201cchild to Jones\u2019 ear because Jones did not know how to pick up the infant, and placed him in a broken carseet [sic] allowing Jones to drive more than 8 hours away in the middle of the night without any supplies or knowledge of the child\u2019s medical needs.\u201d Concerning the DOC officials, Hookey specifically alleged that they had, inter alia, violated her \u201cconstitutional rights to access of [courts] by denying her [access to the] law library and access to legal materials knowing she was handling [her] case pro se.\u201d Finally, Hookey al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>leged that Dalton had violated her constitutional rights in failing to provide sufficient information concerning the custody-proceedings. In addition to filing her amended complaint, Hookey filed a motion to compel the DOC officials to immediately transfer her to a different prison in Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">Judge DiSalle and the DOC officials separately moved to dismiss Hookey\u2019s third amended complaint under Rule 12(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Trooper Townsend joined the motion filed by the DOC officials. Dalton took no action. On March 11, 2010, the District Court denied Hookey\u2019s motion to transfer and, in a separate order, granted Judge DiSalle\u2019s motion to dismiss. With respect to the latter, the District Court agreed with Judge DiSalle that he was entitled to absolute judicial immunity because the \u201callegations raised by Hookey relate to acts or omissions taken by Judge DiSalle during the exercise of his official duties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">On March 15, 2010, the District Court granted the motion to dismiss filed by Trooper Townsend and the DOC officials, concluding that \u201cthe record clearly reflects that [Hookey] has failed to exhaust her administrative remedies with respect to her claims prior to filing this action,\u201d and that \u201csuch a failure to exhaust is fatal to her claims.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In addition, the District Court concluded that Hookey failed to state an equal protection claim against Trooper Townsend, reasoning that \u201cHookey has not shown that Trooper Townshend treated her differently from any other inmate who is a mother and who would have sought similar assistance from him and that any discrimination was intentional.\u201d The District Court further concluded that \u201cto the extent that Hookey believes that Trooper Townshend restricted her access to the court because he should have brought criminal charges against Jones ... she has not demonstrated \u2018a deprivation of an actual constitutional right.\u2019 \u201d (citation omitted). Hookey filed a notice of appeal, which was docketed at CA 10-1874.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">Thereafter, in July 2010, the Clerk of the District Court entered default against Dalton \u201cfor failure to plead or otherwise defend pursuant to Rule 55(a), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\u201d Hookey then moved for entry of default judgment against Dalton. In October 2010, the District Court set aside the entry of default for good cause shown, denied as moot Hookey\u2019s motion for default judgment, dismissed as frivolous Hookey\u2019s amended complaint as to Dalton, and closed the case. Hookey then filed a second notice of appeal, which was docketed at CA 10-4722.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b136-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-11\">We have appellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. <em>See Cape May Greene, Inc. v. Warren, </em>698 F.2d 179, 185 (3d Cir.1983). We exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s dismissal of Hookey\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim. <em>See Dique v. N.J. State Police, </em>603 F.3d 181, 188 (3d Cir.2010). We may summarily affirm a judgment of the District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>if the appeal does not raise a substantial question. LAR 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">Hookey raises two issues on appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> She contends, first, that the District Court erred in determining that she failed to state a claim against Trooper Townsend and, second, that Judge DiSalle is not entitled to absolute judicial immunity. We reject Hookey\u2019s arguments for substantially the reasons given in the District Court\u2019s March 11 and March 15, 2010 opinions. We add that Trooper Townsend\u2019s alleged refusal to file a criminal complaint against Jones does not give rise to a viable \u00a7 1983 claim. <em>See Linda R.S. v. Richard D., </em>410 U.S. 614, 619, 93 S.Ct. 1146, 35 L.Ed.2d 536 (1973) (\u201ca private citizen lacks a judicially cognizable interest in the prosecution or nonprosecution of another,\u201d notwithstanding that \u201cAppellant does have an interest in the support of her child\u201d). We also agree with the District Court that Judge DiSalle is absolutely immune from Hookey\u2019s claims for damages. <em>See Stump v. Sparkman, </em>435 U.S. 349, 356-57, 98 S.Ct. 1099, 55 L.Ed.2d 331 (1978).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">For the reasons given in this opinion, we will summarily affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b136-6\">. In both the March 11 and March 15, 2010 opinions, the District Court noted that it was limiting Hookey's requested relief to monetary damages because \"she is not seeking declaratory relief 'in the true legal sense.\u2019 \u201d (citing <em>Corliss v. O'Brien, </em>200 Fed.Appx. 80, 84 (3d Cir.2006)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b136-12\">. Hookey's two appeals were consolidated for all purposes, but because Hookey refused to pay the filing fee for CA 10-4722 or file a motion to proceed in forma pauperis, that appeal was dismissed on March 30, 2011, for failure to prosecute. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 3(a); LARs 3.3 and Mise. 107.1(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b137-10\">. Hookey has not challenged the District Court's determination that she could not state a claim against the DOC officials because of a failure to exhaust administrative remedies. In any event, it appears that this determination was correct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b137-11\">. Hookey\u2019s reliance on <em>Gross v. Rell, </em>585 F.3d 72, 84 (2d Cir.2009) (noting that judicial immunity applies where a judge acts in excess of his subject matter jurisdiction, but not where he acts in the absence of such jurisdiction), does not help her cause; in fact, it supports the District Court's analysis because Judge DiSalle acted within the scope of his subject matter jurisdiction during the child custody proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
