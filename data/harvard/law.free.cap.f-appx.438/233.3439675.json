On appeal after resentencing, Barr\u2019s counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), in which he states that he finds no meritorious issues for appeal. Counsel questions (1) whether this court has jurisdiction over this appeal because no notice of appeal was filed after resentencing on remand, and (2) whether the district court erred in designating Barr a career offender. Barr, in a supplemental filing, calls for the retroactive application of the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 to his sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-10\">Our review leads us to conclude that we do, in fact, have jurisdiction over this appeal. In our limited remand for resentencing, we specifically retained jurisdiction over the appeal. Thus, no new notice of appeal was required to be filed after the resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-11\">Because Barr failed to object to the career offender designation in the district court, we review the imposition of that designation for plain error. <em>United States v. Branch, </em>537 F.3d 328, 343 (4th Cir.2008). We find no such error. Barr\u2019s two predicate offenses, strong arm robbery and distribution of cocaine base, were separated by an intervening arrest. Therefore, despite Barr being sentenced on the same day for both offenses, the two offenses are counted separately. <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4A1.2 (2008). Contrary to Barr\u2019s assertions, South Carolina\u2019s common law offense of strong arm robbery does qualify as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for purposes of the Guidelines. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 4B1.2(a). Despite the relatively light penalty actually served by Barr, the convictions count as \u201cprior felony convictions\u201d because the offenses are punishable by terms of imprisonment exceeding one year. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 4B1.2 cmt. n. 1. Thus, the district court properly counted both offenses as separate predicate offenses for purposes of designating Barr a career offender under USSG \u00a7 4B1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-13\">Barr also seeks retroactive application of the provisions of the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, Pub.L. No. 111-220. We recently foreclosed this argument for offenders, like Barr, who were sentenced before its effective date. <em>United States v. Bullard, </em>645 F.3d 237, 248, 2011 WL 1718894, at *10 (4th Cir.2011) (\u201cWe agree with all eight circuits that have ruled on the issue that the FSA contains no express statement of retroactivity, nor can any such intent by inferred from its language.\u201d). Thus, this ground lends Barr no aid.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-14\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Barr\u2019s convictions and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform Barr, in writing, of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Barr requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Barr.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Barr\u2019s pending motions to file pro se supplemental briefs are denied as moot. His motion to seal is also denied and his motion to withdraw is hereby struck. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
