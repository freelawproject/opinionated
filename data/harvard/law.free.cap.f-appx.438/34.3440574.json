Eaton, of the United States Court of International Trade, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b59-7\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">Defendant-Appellant Mohit Arora (\u201cArora\u201d) appeals a decision of the District Court granting a motion for summary judgment by plaintiffs-appellees Pearson Education, Inc., and The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. (\u201cplaintiffs\u201d). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history of this action. Arora argues that the District Court erred in granting the motion for summary judgment by ruling that the so-called \u201cfirst sale doctrine,\u201d codified at 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 109(a), does not apply to the sale of copies of copyrighted works manufactured outside the United States. We recently addressed this very question in <em>John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Kirtsaeng, </em>654 F.3d 210 (2d Cir.2011), and held that, indeed, the first sale doctrine does not apply to copies manufactured outside the United States. <em>Id. </em>at 222-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-9\">We are not able to address the question here, however, because, as a threshold matter, we lack jurisdiction over this appeal. Under Rule 3(a) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, a party appealing as of right from a district court must file a notice of appeal with the district clerk within the time allowed by Rule 4. Fed. R.App. P. 3(a)(1). Rule 4(a)(1)(A) requires that \u201cthe notice of appeal required by Rule 3 must be filed with the district clerk within 30 days after the judgment or order appealed from is entered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>R. 4(a)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-13\">The District Court entered its final judgment on June 11, 2010. On July 14, 2010, two days after the deadline set by Rule 4(a)(1)(a),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Arora\u2019s appellate counsel filed a notice of appeal on Arora\u2019s behalf \u201cas an accommodation to [Arora], given that time is of the essence, and not as an entry of appearance before [the District Court], at this time.\u201d Notice of Appeal, <em>Pearson Educ. Inc v. Arora, </em>No. 1:09-cv05741-SAS (July 14, 2010), ECF No. 29.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In his untimely Notice of Appeal, Arora apparently moved for an extension of time. <em>See </em>Notice of Appeal, <em>supra, </em>at 2 (\u201cIn the event that this form was not received in the Clerk\u2019s office within the required time, Mohit Arora respectfully requests the Court to grant an extension of time in accordance with Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5).\u201d). However, he filed no separate motion and, in any event, the District Court never ruled on his request. Arora has argued that the District Court\u2019s reticence simply shows that the form <em>was </em>received in the Clerk\u2019s office within the required time. This conclusion does not follow. The docket sheet and the time-stamps on the Notice itself clearly show that it was filed on July 14, 2010, two days after the deadline prescribed by Rule 3(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>In the absence of a ruling from the District Court granting the motion for extension of time, we are without jurisdiction to consider this appeal. The Supreme Court has made clear that, because Rule 4(a) derives from a federal statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(a), \u201cthe timely filing of a notice of appeal in a civil case is a jurisdictional requirement,\u201d which cannot be waived <em>Bowles v. Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, 214, 127 S.Ct. 2860, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007); <em>see also Silivanch v. Celebrity Cruises, Inc., </em>333 F.3d 355, 363 (2d Cir.2003) (per curiam) (\u201cCompliance with Rule 4(a) is mandatory and jurisdictional.... If no notice of appeal is filed before the deadline provided by Rule 4(a)(1) (or a new deadline set pursuant to Rule 4(a)(5) or (6)), this Court lacks jurisdiction to hear the appeal.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal and remand to the District Court for consideration of Arora\u2019s motion for an extension of time, in accordance with the guidelines set forth in Rule 4(a)(5)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the appeal is DISMISSED and the case is REMANDED to the District Court, solely for consideration of Arora\u2019s motion for extension of time to file his Notice of Appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b59-11\">. Because July 11, 2010, fell on a Sunday, the deadline was automatically extended one day to Monday, July 12, 2010. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 26(a)(1)(C).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b59-14\">. Arora's counsel was later admitted in the District Court <em>pro hac vice. </em>Order, <em>Pearson Educ. Inc. v. Arora, </em>No. 1:09-cv-05741-SAS (Sept. 21, 2010), ECF No. 31.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
