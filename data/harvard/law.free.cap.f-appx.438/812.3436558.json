On appeal, Williams\u2019 sole contention is that the district court erred in concluding that his prior Florida conviction for resisting an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>officer with violence constituted a predicate \u201cviolent felony\u201d for purposes of applying the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) (ACCA). That contention is foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Nix, </em>628 F.3d 1341, 1342 (11th Cir.2010), which is directly on point going the other way.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">Williams\u2019 argument that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Sykes v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 2267, 180 L.Ed.2d 60 (2011), overruled our <em>Nix </em>decision is unpersuasive. In the <em>Sykes </em>case, the Supreme Court held that the Indiana crime of knowing and intentional flight from a law enforcement officer was indeed a \u201cviolent felony\u201d for ACCA purposes. That holding is entirely consistent with our holding in <em>Nix </em>that a Florida conviction for resisting an officer is a \u201cviolent felony\u201d for ACCA purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
