We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-24\">Monette contends that the district court erred by concluding that the AEDPA one-year statute of limitations began to run when his drug possession conviction became final, rather than when the parole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>board\u2019s denial of parole became final on July 6, 2006. He argues that, until the parole board\u2019s decision was final, he could not have known the factual basis for the prejudice prong of his ineffective assistance of counsel claim. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">To establish prejudice in a guilty plea case, a petitioner need only show that but for his counsel\u2019s alleged erroneous advice, he likely would not have pleaded guilty. <em>See Hill v. Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 59, 106 S.Ct. 366, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985) (\u201c[I]n order to satisfy the \u2018prejudice\u2019 requirement, the defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\u201d). Accordingly, by the time his drug possession conviction became final, Monette knew, or through due diligence could have known, the factual basis for both prongs of his ineffective assistance of counsel claim. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A) &amp; (D).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">We decline to consider Monette\u2019s equitable tolling argument because he did not raise that issue before the district court. <em>See United States v. Pimentel-Flores, </em>339 F.3d 959, 967 (9th Cir.2003) (\u201cIssues not presented to the district court cannot generally be raised for the first time on appeal\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b645-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
