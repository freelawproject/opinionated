Turno applied to the district court for attorney\u2019s fees and other litigation expenses, pursuant to the Hyde Amendment, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3006A (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2011). The district court denied Turno\u2019s motion and Turno now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">The burden of proof in a Hyde Amendment action is on the claimant, rather than the Government. <em>In re 1997 Grand Jury, </em>215 F.3d 430, 435 n. 7 (4th Cir.2000). We review a district court\u2019s decision under the Hyde Amendment for abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 436. For Turno to prevail, he must show that the Government\u2019s position was vexatious, frivolous, or in bad faith.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">Our review of the record does not show that the Government\u2019s position was vexatious, frivolous, or made in bad faith. Accordingly, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Turno\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees and other litigation expenses. We affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b266-9\"><em> </em>The Hyde Amendment also requires a claimant to prove: \"(1) the case was pending on or after the enactment of the Hyde Amendment; (2) the case was a criminal case; (3) he was not represented by assigned counsel paid for by the public; (4) he was a prevailing party; (5) ... the attorney\u2019s fees were reasonable; and [ (6) ] no special circumstances exist that would make an award unjust.\u201d <em>In re 1997 Grand Jury, </em>215 F.3d at 436 n. 8 (internal quotation marks omitted). None of these additional factors are at issue in the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
