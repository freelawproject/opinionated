The district court calculated Page\u2019s Guidelines range under the <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(2009) at seventy to eighty-seven months\u2019 imprisonment and sentenced Page to seventy months\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal, counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but questioning whether the district court abused its discretion in imposing sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-22\">We review Page\u2019s sentence \u201cunder a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In conducting this review, we \u201cmust first ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) [ (2006) ] factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. \u201cWhen rendering a sentence, the district court must make an individualized assess<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>ment based on the facts presented,\u201d <em>United States v. Carter, </em>564 F.3d 325, 328 (4th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted), and must \u201cadequately explain the chosen sentence to allow for meaningful appellate review and to promote the perception of fair sentencing,\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 50, 128 S.Ct. 586. \u201cWhen imposing a sentence within the Guidelines, however, the [district court\u2019s] explanation need not be elaborate or lengthy because [Guidelines sentences themselves are in many ways tailored to the individual and reflect approximately two decades of close attention to federal sentencing policy.\u201d <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>603 F.3d 267, 271 (4th Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Once we have determined that the sentence is free of procedural error, we must consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence, \u201ctakflng] into account the totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. If the sentence is within the appropriate Guidelines range, we apply a presumption on appeal that the sentence is reasonable. <em>See United States v. Mendoza-Mendoza, </em>597 F.3d 212, 217 (4th Cir.2010). Such a presumption is rebutted only by showing \u201cthat the sentence is unreasonable when measured against the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375, 379 (4th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">In this case, the district court correctly calculated and considered the advisory Guidelines range and heard argument from counsel and allocution from Page. The court considered relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors and explained that the within-Guidelines sentence was warranted in light of the nature and circumstances of the offense and Page\u2019s history and characteristics. Further, neither counsel nor Page offers any grounds to rebut the presumption on appeal that the within-Guidelines sentence of seventy months\u2019 imprisonment is substantively reasonable. Accordingly, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing Page.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have also reviewed the remainder of the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires that counsel inform Page, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Page requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Page.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
