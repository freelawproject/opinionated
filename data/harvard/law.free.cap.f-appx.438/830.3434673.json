He presents two issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-20\">1. Whether the district court abused its discretion in denying Sanchez\u2019s motion to continue sentencing to allow him to pursue potential exculpatory material covered by <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), and <em>Giglio v. United States, </em>405 U.S. 150, 92 S.Ct. 763, 31 L.Ed.[2d] 104 (1972).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-21\">2. Whether Sanchez\u2019s guilty plea was not knowing, intelligent, and voluntary because it was entered into without knowledge of potential <em>Brady </em>and <em>Giglio </em>material.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b854-22\">A review of the record shows that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Sanchez\u2019s motion to continue sentencing (filed to investigate potential, but <em>speculative, </em>exculpatory <em>Brady </em>and <em>Giglio </em>material): Sanchez had admitted to the facts underlying the offense, including the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>essential elements, when he pleaded guilty. We see no specific substantial prejudice. The record also shows that Sanchez\u2019s guilty plea was knowing, intelligent, and voluntary. The plea complied with the requirements of Rule 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">The conviction and sentence are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
