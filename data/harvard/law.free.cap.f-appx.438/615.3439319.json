We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-19\">Ochoa argues that the administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) improperly disregarded Dr. Carrillo\u2019s opinion. This claim lacks merit. The ALJ provided several reasons for rejecting Dr. Carrillo\u2019s opinion. First, Dr. Carrillo examined Ochoa only once, for the purpose of evaluating whether he could take the citizenship examination, and not for the purpose of determining Ochoa\u2019s ability to work. Second, other physicians who treated Ochoa opined that his seizures did not affect his daily activities and did not warrant any disability. <em>Lester v. Cha</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number><em>ter, </em>81 F.3d 821, 830 (9th Cir.1995) (\u201cAs a general rule, more weight should be given to the opinion of a treating source than to the opinion of doctors who do not treat the claimant.\u201d). Lastly, although Dr. Carrillo noted that Ochoa could not remember the date, time, or year, or make sense of figures or puzzles, Ochoa himself admitted that when he did not have seizures, he did well with concentration and memory. The ALJ\u2019s specific reasons for rejecting Dr. Carillo\u2019s opinion are legitimate and supported by substantial evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 830-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b640-20\"><em> </em>This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
