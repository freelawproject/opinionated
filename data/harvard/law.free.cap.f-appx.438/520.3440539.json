After examining the appellant\u2019s brief and the record, we have concluded that oral argument is unnecessary. Thus, the appeal is submitted on the appellant\u2019s brief and the record. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2)(C).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b544-21\">ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b544-22\">Aaron DeRoo, a federal inmate, appeals from the denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, arguing that two disciplinary decisions to revoke good-time credits were not based on sufficient evidence. Because the evidence in the disciplinary record amply supports those two decisions, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>Disciplinary officers at Terre Haute Correctional Institution have found DeRoo guilty of violating several prison rules while incarcerated there. He highlights three decisions on appeal. First (in June 2000), DeRoo lost 27 days of good-time credit for possessing intoxicants. Second (in February 2001), DeRoo admitted to using intoxicants and again lost 27 days of good-time credit. The hearing officer imposed this penalty after noting that \u201cpast attempts to correct [DeRoo\u2019s] behavior have failed.\u201d Third (in May 2001), DeRoo again admitted to possessing intoxicants. In revoking 40 days of good-time credit, the hearing officer wrote that DeRoo had \u201cnumerous charges for this offense\u201d and that \u201cno other sanction would produce the desired effect\u201d of changing DeRoo\u2019s behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Nine years later, a hearing officer expunged from DeRoo\u2019s record the first violation from June 2000. The Bureau of Prisons reheard that incident because for several years it failed to provide a statement of reasons for its decisions. As we concluded in <em>Deroo v. Holinka, </em>373 Fed.Appx. 617, 618-19 (7th Cir.2010), this failure did not offend due process because the Bureau, after being sued, provided the missing statement of reasons to DeRoo and allowed him to pursue a rehearing. Upon rehearing, the hearing officer found no evidence of guilt and expunged the violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">DeRoo later petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus, claiming that the Bureau violated his right to due process by relying on the now-expunged June 2000 violation to justify revoking 67 total days of good-time credit for the February and May 2001 violations. The district court denied the petition. The court concluded that in both proceedings the prison had complied with due process by providing timely notice, a fair hearing, and a written statement of reasons. Moreover, the court reasoned that because DeRoo confessed to each charge, the prison\u2019s decisions\u2014of both guilt and punishment\u2014were supported by sufficient evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">On appeal DeRoo concedes that his confessions constitute sufficient evidence of guilt but argues that the district court erred in concluding that the confessions by themselves supported the Bureau\u2019s decision to revoke good-time credits. He argues that the district court misread our decision in <em>Scruggs v. Jordan, </em>485 F.3d 934, 940-41 (7th Cir.2007), as saying that a prisoner\u2019s confession justifies not only a finding of guilt but any punishment that the prison sees fit. But even if DeRoo is correct that his confession alone does not necessarily validate the revocation of good-time credits, we review de novo the district court\u2019s judgment, not its reasoning, and may affirm on any basis supported by the record. <em>Jones v. Cross, </em>637 F.3d 841, 845 (7th Cir.2011). In attacking the judgment, DeRoo complains that the hearing officer was not justified in revoking any good-time credits for the second violation in February 2001 because the officer asserted, incorrectly DeRoo says, that \u201cthis [was his] fourth charge for this offense.\u201d According to DeRoo, there is evidence to support only three of those charges, given that the violation from June 2000 has since been expunged. The hearing officer\u2019s report, however, shows that the officer made the \u201cfourth charge\u201d comment and relied upon the now-expunged June 2000 violation only when revoking commissary privileges, not the good-time credits. DeRoo does not have a liberty interest in those privileges, so due process was not offended when the hearing officer relied upon the expunged violation to rescind them. <em>See Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 484, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995); <em>Thomas v. Ramos, </em>130 F.3d 754, 762 n. 8 (7th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>DeRoo does have a liberty interest in good-time credits, <em>Jones, </em>637 F.3d at 845, and due process requires us to ensure that some evidence supports the hearing officers\u2019 decisions to revoke them. <em>Superintendent, Mass. Corr. Inst. v. Hill, </em>472 U.S. 445, 455, 105 S.Ct. 2768, 86 L.Ed.2d 356 (1985). Under the \u201csome evidence\u201d standard\u2014\u201cthe narrowest judicial review we know\u201d\u2014our task is only to identify a modicum of evidence that supports the decisions. Un<em>ited States v. Kizeart, </em>505 F.3d 672, 675 (7th Cir.2007); <em>see also Webb v. Anderson, </em>224 F.3d 649, 651-52 (7th Cir.2000). DeRoo\u2019s disciplinary record easily meets this standard. The officers revoked DeRoo\u2019s good-time credits in February and May 2001 because \u201cpast attempts to correct his behavior had failed.\u201d More than some evidence supports this finding: As DeRoo does not dispute, three intoxicant-related violations (not counting the expunged June 2000 violation) were on DeRoo\u2019s disciplinary record at the time of the February 2001 violation, all of which were added on to his record before the May 2001 violation. Because the record contains adequate evidence that \u201cpast attempts\u201d at correction had failed to stop new offenses, the revocation of good-conduct credits comported with due process. We thus conclude that the district court properly denied his petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
