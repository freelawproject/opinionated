Hansen. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-15\">Under <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579, 597, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993), the district judge has a \u201cgatekeeping role\u201d and must exclude expert scientific testimony that is not sufficiently reliable under Fed.R.Evid. 702. Expert scientific testimony is inadmissible if there is \u201ctoo great an analytical gap between the data and the opinion offered.\u201d <em>Gen. Elec. Co. v. Joiner, </em>522 U.S. 136, 146, 118 S.Ct. 512, 139 L.Ed.2d 508 (1997). We review the district court\u2019s decision on the admissibility of an expert\u2019s opinion for abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 142-43, 118 S.Ct. 512.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-16\">The district court found that Dr. Egilman\u2019s opinion rested on the foundational assumption that the vapors emitted when microwave popcorn is popped are similar to the vapors emitted from large vats of butter-flavored topping slurry at popcorn factories. Studies at popcorn plants did not conclusively show whether workers with no exposure to slurry vapors developed bronchiolitis obliterans. Addi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>tionally, one study suggested that chemicals released when microwave popcorn is popped inhibit the absorption of diacetyl, the likely causal agent for bronchiolitis obliterans. Dr. Egilman did not sufficiently justify his foundational assumption or refute the contrary record evidence. Moreover, as the district court observed, there were problems with Dr. Egilman\u2019s and William Ewing\u2019s estimates of New-kirk\u2019s exposure levels. In light of these concerns, we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the \u201canalytical gap between the existing data and the opinion Dr. Egilman proffers\u201d was too large. <em>See Joiner, </em>522 U.S. at 146, 118 S.Ct. 512.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Because Dr. Egilman could not establish that diacetyl in microwave popcorn vapors was generally capable of causing bronchiolitis obliterans, he could not rely on a differential diagnosis to establish that exposure to microwave popcorn had caused Newkirk\u2019s medical problems. <em>See Clausen v. M/V New Carissa, </em>339 F.3d 1049, 1057-58 (9th Cir.2003). We therefore affirm the exclusion of all of Dr. Egilman\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">Drs. Pue and Parmet did not offer any opinion on whether diacetyl in microwave popcorn vapors is generally capable of causing bronchiolitis obliterans. Moreover, Dr. Pue\u2019s and Dr. Parmet\u2019s specific causation opinions failed to consider several known causes of bronchiolitis obliterans. Those opinions were therefore not admissible to show general or specific causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">Without the proffered expert testimony, Newkirk cannot show that ConAgra and Chr. Hansen caused his disease. Because we affirm the exclusion of that testimony, we also affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b632-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
