Both parties agree that the \u201ccrux\u201d of the issues on appeal is whether Rainwaters entered into a common-law marriage while receiving adult child disability benefits. This is because an individual\u2019s receipt of adult child disability benefits ends when such individual \u201cmarries.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(d)(1)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-16\">On appeal, Rainwaters argues that the district court erred in denying her motion for a judgment of acquittal, and in finding that she (i) had entered into a common-law marriage and (ii) knew that she was common-law married, and as a result, should have informed the Social Security Administration (\u201cSSA\u201d) of this event. Rainwa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>ters argues that the evidence presented by the government at her bench trial was insufficient to support her convictions because the evidence did not establish beyond a reasonable doubt that a common-law marriage existed, that she had knowledge of her marriage, or that she intended to conceal the marriage from the SSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">We review <em>\u201cde novo </em>the denial of a motion for acquittal and the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain a conviction.\u201d <em>United States v. Tampas, </em>498 F.3d 1291, 1297 (11th Cir.2007). \u201cIn reviewing evidentiary sufficiency, we must determine whether the evidence, construed in the light most favorable to the government, would permit the trier of fact to find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Farley, </em>607 F.3d 1294, 1333 (11th Cir.) (quotation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 369, 178 L.Ed.2d 238 (2010). \u201cWe will not reverse unless no reasonable trier of fact could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cIt is not our function to make credibility choices or to pass upon the weight of the evidence. Instead, we must sustain the verdict where there is a reasonable basis in the record for it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations and citation omitted). A district court\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Jones, </em>601 F.3d 1247, 1266 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">In determining whether a common-law marriage existed, the SSA looks to state law, <em>see </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.726, which, in this case, is the law of the State of Alabama. In Alabama, the elements of a common-law marriage are: \u201c(1) capacity; (2) present agreement or mutual consent to enter into the marriage relationship; (3) public recognition of the existence of the marriage; and (4) cohabitation or mutual assumption of marital duties and obligations.\u201d <em>Creel v. Creel, </em>763 So.2d 943, 946 (Ala.2000) (quotation and ellipsis omitted). These elements may be \u201ceither explicitly expressed or implicitly inferred from the circumstances.\u201d <em>Arnold v. Arnold, </em>977 So.2d 501, 508 (Ala.Civ.App.2007) <em>(citing Boswell v. Boswell, </em>497 So.2d 479, 480 (Ala.1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-9\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we find there was sufficient evidence to support each of the counts of conviction for social security fraud and the making of false statements in this case. The district court did not clearly err in finding that a common-law marriage existed, and that Rainwaters knew that such a marriage existed, based upon, among other things, Rainwaters\u2019s own testimony during her divorce proceedings. There was also sufficient evidence that she knowingly concealed the marriage from the SSA. Therefore, we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
