The immigration judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) rejected Kassem\u2019s claim and the Board of Immigration Appeals \u2022 (\u201cBIA\u201d) affirmed. For the following reasons, we DENY the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-12\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b403-13\">Kassem, a citizen of Lebanon and native of Liberia, entered the United States around August 27, 2002 as a nonimmigrant visitor for business. His visa expired on November 7 of that year. After removal proceedings commenced in October 2005, Kassem applied for withholding of removal from Lebanon and Liberia under INA \u00a7 241(b)(3) and protection under the CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-14\">Kassem fears persecution and torture by members of Hezbollah in Lebanon and Liberia in retaliation for his purported sympathy for Israel. He alleges he operated a store in Liberia from 1988 to 1991, where he sold replacement parts for heavy duty machinery. Although he did not realize it initially, one of Kassem\u2019s clients, a logging and construction company named Yona International (\u2018Tona\u201d), was Israeli. Several individuals warned him to stop doing business with Yona. In 1989, Kassem\u2019s mother phoned him and told him that rumors were spreading in Lebanon that he had been interacting socially with Israelis. In 1990, war broke out in Liberia and Kassem\u2019s business relationship with Yona ended. Kassem returned to Lebanon for four months, despite his mother\u2019s warnings. He lived in Beirut again, without being harmed, from April 1996 to June 1997. Kassem claims to have received threatening phone calls in Lebanon (and one in the United States in 2003), but not in Liberia. He admits no one has ever threatened him in person.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-16\">In 2002, Kassem traveled to the United States while his family returned to Lebanon. Kassem\u2019s mother continues to warn him by telephone not to return to Lebanon because it is unsafe for him there. Kassem says he also fears for his safety in Liberia because he claims his residence there was set on fire in 2003 and his business was looted, acts which he interprets as a message not to return. However, he also believes no one would hurt him in Liberia if his family were with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-17\">Before the IJ, Kassem offered no evidence to support his claims besides his own testimony. The IJ asked Kassem to produce corroborating evidence to prove the existence of Yona, his store, and their business relationship. The IJ also asked Kassem why he had not obtained corroboration from his mother. Although Kassem\u2019s mother is illiterate, he admitted that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>his wife, who visits his mother on occasion, could have taken a dictated statement from her.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">In denying Kassem\u2019s claims under the INA and CAT, the IJ held that (1) Kassem\u2019s testimony was incredible; (2) Kassem failed to support his claims with reasonably obtainable corroborating evidence; and (3) even if credible, Kassem\u2019s claims fell far short of establishing a clear probability of persecution or torture. The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision on narrower grounds, holding that Kassem failed to produce reasonably obtainable evidence to corroborate his claims of persecution and failed to establish a clear probability of torture.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">Where, as here, the BIA renders its own opinion, we review the decision of the BIA de novo. <em>Koulibaly v. Mukasey, </em>541 F.3d 613, 619 (6th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">An IJ\u2019s determination regarding the availability of corroborating evidence is not to be reversed unless \u201cthe court finds ... that a reasonable trier of fact is compelled to conclude that such corroborating evidence is unavailable.\u201d INA \u00a7 242(b)(4), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4); <em>Yinggui Lin v. Holder, </em>565 F.3d 971, 977 (6th Cir.2009) (applying the same standard to a BIA opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">Administrative findings of fact are reviewed under the deferential \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard, and we must treat them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d INA \u00a7 242(b)(4)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Zhao v. Holder, </em>569 F.3d 238, 246-47 (6th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">I. Kassem Does Not Qualify for Withholding of Removal Under the INA</p>\n<p id=\"b404-10\">Nothing in the record compels us to reverse the BIA\u2019s finding that Kassem failed to produce reasonably obtainable evidence to corroborate his claims of persecution. To qualify for withholding of removal under the INA, the alien must establish that his \u201clife or freedom would be threatened\u201d in the proposed country of removal on the basis of one of the enumerated grounds, such as \u201cpolitical opinion.\u201d INA \u00a7 241(b)(3)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A); <em>Ndreeaj v. Mukasey, </em>522 F.3d 667, 674 (6th Cir.2008). The alien seeking withholding of removal must establish a \u201cclear probability of persecution,\u201d meaning it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d he would be persecuted. <em>Al-Ghorbani v. Holder, </em>585 F.3d 980, 994-95 (6th Cir.2009) (quoting <em>INS v. Stevie, </em>467 U.S. 407, 413, 424, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-12\">Under the Real ID Act\u2019s amendments to the INA, when the IJ \u201cdetermines that the applicant should provide evidence which corroborates otherwise credible testimony, such evidence must be provided unless the applicant demonstrates that the applicant does not have the evidence and cannot reasonably obtain the evidence.\u201d INA \u00a7 240(c)(4)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(4)(B). Even if an applicant is credible, the failure to provide reasonably available corroborating evidence can lead to a finding that an applicant has failed to meet his burden of proof. <em>Shkabari v. Gonzales, </em>427 F.3d 324, 331 (6th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Dorosh v. Ashcroft, </em>398 F.3d 379, 382 (6th Cir.2004)).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-13\">Kassem does not show the corroborating evidence the IJ requested was not reasonably obtainable. The BIA identified three types of corroborating evidence that Kassem could reasonably have produced, but failed to provide a persuasive explanation for his failure to do so. First, as Kassem acknowledged, he could have procured a letter from Yona to prove the company\u2019s existence and its ties to Israel. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>Second, Kassem could have corroborated his mother\u2019s warnings through a dictated statement to his wife, who lived in Lebanon and occasionally visited her. Third, Kassem could have corroborated the threats against him by obtaining a statement from his wife, with whom he was in regular contact. Any of these three forms of available evidence would have been probative of Kassem\u2019s story: that his business relationship with an Israeli company caused his harassment. <em>See Urbina-Mejia v. Holder, 597 </em>F.3d 360, 368 (6th Cir.2010) (finding an IJ\u2019s request for a letter from the applicant\u2019s father to be \u201cappropriate\u201d because such evidence would have been available and probative of applicant\u2019s fears of persecution). Thus, Kassem does not qualify for withholding of removal under the INA.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Kassem argues the BIA erred by failing to explicitly address the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. However, once we conclude that substantial evidence supports the stated basis for denying relief (here, a lack of reasonable corroboration), \u201cfurther review is foreclosed,\u201d and we need not remand for a credibility determination. <em>Cruz-Samayoa v. Holder, </em>607 F.3d 1145, 1150 (6th Cir.2010) (citing <em>Haider v. Holder, </em>595 F.3d 276, 282-83 (6th Cir.2010)).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">II. Kassem Does Not Qualify for Withholding of Removal Under the CAT</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">Kassem does not demonstrate a clear probability of torture in either Lebanon or Liberia. To warrant protection under the CAT, the applicant bears the burden of proving it is more likely than not that he will be tortured if sent to the country of removal. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">The BIA\u2019s determination that Kassem did not warrant protection under the CAT was supported by substantial evidence and nothing in the record compels us to reverse. Kassem offered no evidence that he had previously been tortured, and his only evidence that he will \u201cmore likely than not\u201d be tortured in the future is the same uncorroborated evidence that failed to support his persecution claim under the INA. Although Hezbollah is arguably a Lebanese governmental entity, <em>see Tarraf v. Gonzales, </em>495 F.3d 525, 527 n.2 (7th Cir.2007), Kassem offered no evidence that Hezbollah threatened him or that any governmental agent or entity in Lebanon or Liberia would consent to his torture. Thus, he is not eligible for protection under the CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-10\">REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
