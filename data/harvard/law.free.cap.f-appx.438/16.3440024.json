Newsom appeals from the July 23, 2009 judgment of the district court, following two separate jury trials, convicting him of conspiracy to engage in securities fraud and mail fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, and securities fraud, in violation of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78j(b), 78ff. In the first trial, <em>United States v. William A. Newsom, </em>Cr. 02-881(S-3)(LDW), <em>(\u201cNewsom I </em>\u201d), a jury found that Newsom, a sales agent, had conspired with others to defraud the investing public in the marketing of a private-placement offering known as Heritage Film Group, LLC (\u201cHeritage\u201d). In the second trial, <em>United States v. William A. Newsom, </em>Cr. 02-879(S-2)(LDW) <em>(\u201cNewsom II </em>\u201d), a jury similarly found that Newsom had conspired with others to defraud the investing public in the marketing of a private-placement offering known as Out of the Black Partners, LLC (\u201cOut of the Black\u201d). On appeal, Newsom argues that he was deprived of his constitutional right to a fair tidal in both cases because the district court improperly admitted, in <em>Newsom I, </em>evidence of Newsom\u2019s involvement in Out of the Black and, in <em>Newsom II, </em>evidence of his role in Heritage. He contends also that the government should have been collaterally estopped from admitting in <em>N\u00e9wsom II </em>evidence of his convictions in <em>Newsom I. </em>We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">We review a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion. <em>See Old Chief v. United States, </em>519 U.S. 172, 174, n. 1, 117 S.Ct. 644, 136 L.Ed.2d 574 (1997); <em>United States v. Kelley, </em>551 F.3d 171, 174 (2d Cir.2009) (per curiam). \u201cWe will find an abuse of discretion only where the trial judge ruled in an arbitrary or irrational fashion.\u201d <em>Kelley, </em>551 F.3d at 175 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">We begin with Newsom\u2019s argument that the district court abused its discretion by admitting, in <em>Newsom I, </em>evidence of Newsom\u2019s involvement in Out of the Black and, in <em>Newsom II, </em>evidence of his involvement in Heritage. Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) provides in pertinent part that \u201c[ejvidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\u201d Fed. R.Evid. 404(b). \u201cThe Second Circuit\u2019s inclusionary approach to the admission of other act evidence allows such evidence to be admitted for any purpose other than to demonstrate criminal propensity.\u201d <em>United States v. Guang, </em>511 F.3d 110, 121 (2d Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cTo determine whether a district court properly admitted other act evidence, the reviewing court considers whether (1) it was offered for a proper purpose; (2) it was relevant to a material issue in dispute; (3) its probative value is substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect; and (4) the trial court gave an appropriate limiting instruction to the jury if so requested by the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). We address each of these factors in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">As an initial matter, there is no dispute that evidence of Newsom\u2019s involvement in Out of the Black and Heritage was both relevant and offered for a proper purpose in <em>Newsom, I </em>and <em>Newsom II, </em>respectively. Here, Newsom placed his intent at issue in both trials. In <em>Newsom I, </em>Newsom\u2019s counsel stated in opening: \u201cThis case is about intent.... I submit to you that when you listen to the evidence in this case, you will see that [Newsom] did not have intent to deceive the investors.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>Gov\u2019t App. 2. Newsom\u2019s counsel likewise stated in opening in <em>Newsom II: </em>\u201cThe evidence will show that Mr. Newsom acted reasonably and in good faith, based on information that he had from various sources.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 18. In these circumstances, evidence of similar acts was offered properly by the government and relevant to prove Newsom\u2019s intent. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Myerson, </em>18 F.3d 153, 166-67 (2d Cir.1994) (concluding that evidence of prior frauds was relevant and admissible to rebut defendant\u2019s assertion that a recent divorce caused him to engage in charged fraud).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">The next question is whether the probative value of such evidence is outweighed by its prejudicial effect. We have observed that evidence is unfairly prejudicial \u201conly when it tends to have some adverse effect upon a defendant beyond tending to prove the fact or issue that justified its admission into evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Figueroa, </em>618 F.2d 934, 943 (2d Cir.1980); <em>see also United States v. Roldan-Zapata, </em>916 F.2d 795, 804 (2d Cir.1990) (holding that evidence of similar acts was not unfairly prejudicial where it was not \u201cany more sensational or disturbing than the crimes\u201d with which the defendant was charged). Newsom maintains that admission of the \u201cother acts\u201d evidence was improper because the district court did not explicitly balance the potential prejudice of that evidence against its probative value. We have held, however, that \u201ca mechanical recitation of the Rule 403 [balancing] analysis is not required.\u201d <em>United States v. Pitre, </em>960 F.2d 1112, 1120 (2d Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">Newsom rejoins that the evidence of other acts was unfairly prejudicial because of the similarity between Heritage and Out of the Black. In fact, however, \u201cother acts\u201d evidence is considered to be probative if it is substantially similar to evidence of the charged conduct. <em>See United States v. Downing, </em>297 F.3d 52, 59 (2d Cir.2002) (\u201c[The defendant\u2019s] own defense strategy ... made evidence of his previous participation in a substantially similar scheme highly probative. That [the defendant] previously prepared false audit reports to facilitate a securities fraud scheme tends strongly to belie his assertion that he did not understand the nature of the scheme for which he was being prosecuted.\u201d). By arguing that the \u201cother acts\u201d evidence was \u201cvirtually identical to the conduct charged in the indictment being tried,\u201d Def. Br. 37-38, Newsom essentially concedes that such evidence was highly probative of his intent to conceal from investors the commissions he received in connection with the charged crimes. In any event, we find that the proffered other-acts evidence was not \u201cany more sensational\u201d than the evidence of the charged crimes. <em>Roldan-Zapata, </em>916 F.2d at 804. Accordingly, the probative value of the other-acts evidence was not outweighed by any prejudicial effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">Finally, we reject Newsom\u2019s contention that the district court\u2019s limiting instructions during both trials were \u201cutterly ineffective.\u201d Def. Br. 26. The district court correctly charged the jury, in pertinent part, that \u201cthe defendant to whom that evidence relates is not on trial for those acts. Accordingly, you may not consider the evidence of similar acts as a substitute for proof that a defendant committed the crime charged. Nor may you consider this evidence as proof that a defendant has a criminal personality or bad character.\u201d Gov\u2019t App. 16. Therefore, having considered each of the Rule 404(b) factors, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion by admitting, in <em>Newsom I, </em>evidence of Newsom\u2019s involvement in Out of the Black or, in <em>Newsom II, </em>evidence of his involvement in Heritage.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>We turn next to Newsom\u2019s argument that admission in <em>Newsom II </em>of his convictions for mail fraud and securities fraud in <em>Newsom I </em>violates the doctrine of collateral estoppel. \u201cWhen the defendant invokes collateral estoppel in the usual criminal case, the Government is seeking to relitigate an issue in a second prosecution that was necessarily resolved in defendant\u2019s favor in an earlier proceeding.\u201d <em>Pinkney v. Keane, </em>920 F.2d 1090, 1097 (2d Cir.1990). Here, there is no support for Newsom\u2019s contention that the government sought to relitigate in <em>Newsom II </em>any issues decided in Newsom\u2019s favor in <em>Newsom I. </em>Instead, the government sought admission of Newsom\u2019s prior convictions for purposes of impeachment. Although Newsom argues that the government sought to admit the convictions under Rule 404(b), the government stated at trial that it would seek to elicit evidence of the convictions only if Newsom testified. GA 20. In fact, it was Newsom\u2019s counsel, not the government, who elicited such evidence from Newsom during his direct examination in <em>Newsom II. </em>In any event, evidence of Newsom\u2019s convictions for mail fraud and securities fraud was admissible in <em>Newsom II </em>because they required \u201cproof or admission of an act of dishonesty or false statement\u201d under Rule 609(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">We have considered Newsom\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. For the reasons stated herein, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
