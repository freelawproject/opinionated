In their informal brief, Appellants fail to address the district court\u2019s ruling on attorney\u2019s fees. Therefore, Appellants have forfeited appellate review of that issue. <em>See </em>4th Cir. R. 34(b) (limiting review to issues raised in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>informal brief); <em>see also Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, </em>178 F.3d 231, 241 n. 6 (4th Cir.1999) (finding failure to raise issue in opening brief constituted abandonment of that issue). Accordingly, we affirm.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b246-16\"> To the extent that Appellants also seek review of the district court's orders accepting the recommendations of the magistrate judge and denying relief on their civil complaints as well as denying their subsequent motions for reconsideration, we conclude that any appeal from these orders is untimely. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
