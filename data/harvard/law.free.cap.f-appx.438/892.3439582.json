Plaintiff did not cure the deficiencies; instead, he made his claims even more difficult to discern. Moreover, Plaintiff made it clear that it would be futile for the Court to order him to restate his Complaint once again. The Court already ordered Plaintiff to set forth a short and plain statement of each claim showing that he is entitled to relief; instead of complying with that Order, Plaintiff filed a 209-page Amended Complaint that does not elucidate- his claims in the slightest. Because Plaintiff failed to comply with the Court\u2019s Order to cure the deficiencies in his original Complaint\u2014and because ordering Plaintiff to restate his Complaint again would do no good\u2014the Court finds that dismissal of Plaintiffs action is warranted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b917-7\">Order, September 29, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-8\">We review a district court\u2019s dismissal for failure to comply with a court order for abuse of discretion. <em>See Betty K Agencies, Ltd. v. M/V MONADA, </em>482 F.3d 1333, 1337 (11th Cir.2005). Discretion means that the district court may act within a \u201crange of choice,\u201d and that we will not disturb its decision as long as it \u201cstays within that range and is not influenced by any mistake of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). \u201c[Dismissal upon disregard of an order, especially where [,as here,] the litigant has been forewarned, generally is not an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Moon v. Newsome, </em>863 F.2d 835, 837 (11th Cir.1989) (citations omitted) (dismissing <em>pro se </em>plaintiffs complaint with prejudice when plaintiff \u201cstubbornly violated\u201d a sanction order). A <em>pro se </em>complaint is held to less stringent standards than pleadings drafted by attorneys, but the <em>pro se </em>litigant is not excused from complying with the relevant rules of substantive law and procedure. <em>Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 595, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972); <em>see Brown v. Crawford, </em>906 F.2d 667, 670 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-10\">We find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s dismissal of Arnold\u2019s complaint, as amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
