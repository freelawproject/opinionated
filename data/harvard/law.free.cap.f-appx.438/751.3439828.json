George argues that the district erred in finding that his \u00a7 2254 petition was untimely, because he was entitled to equitable tolling under <em>Holland v. Flori</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number><em>da, </em>560 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2549, 177 L.Ed.2d 130 (2010).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Specifically, he argues that (1) he demonstrated diligence through his attempts to communicate with his attorney regarding the AEDPA time requirements and his wish to preserve his right to file a \u00a7 2254 federal habeas petition; and (2) he demonstrated extraordinary circumstances through his attorney\u2019s failure to satisfy professional standards of care. After careful review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal decision on equitable tolling. <em>Drew v. Dep\u2019t of Corrs., </em>297 F.3d 1278, 1283 (11th Cir.2002). We review a district court\u2019s determination of the relevant facts, however, including those related to a petitioner\u2019s diligence, for clear error. <em>Id. </em>Thus, we must \u201caffirm a district court\u2019s findings of fact unless the record lacks substantial evidence to support that determination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1283, 1289 (quotation marks omitted). We must construe the pleadings of a <em>pro se </em>litigant liberally. <em>Gomez-Diaz v. United States, </em>433 F.3d 788, 791 (11th Cir.2005). However, \u201c[i]n deciding issues on appeal we consider only evidence that was part of the record before the district court.\u201d <em>Selman v. Cobb Cnty. Sch. Dist., </em>449 F.3d 1320, 1332 (11th Cir.2006); <em>see also Dominick v. Dixie Nat\u2019l Life Ins. Co., </em>809 F.2d 1559, 1573 (11th Cir.1987) (declining to consider exhibits attached to appellate briefs that were not presented to the trial court prior to the grant of summary judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-12\">AEDPA imposes a one-year statute of limitations for filing a \u00a7 2254 petition. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). In this case, that one-year statute of limitations began to run from \u201cthe date on which the judgment became final.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court concluded that the judgment became final on June 13, 2007, ninety days after the denial of George\u2019s motion for a rehearing, and that George therefore had until June 13, 2008 to seek habeas relief. George filed his \u00a7 2254 petition on February 10, 2010, about twenty months after the one-year limitations period had expired.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> George argues that although his \u00a7 2254 petition was untimely, he is entitled to equitable tolling.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>Equitable tolling of the limitations period applies when a petitioner \u201cuntimely files because of extraordinary circumstances that are both beyond his control and unavoidable even with diligence.\u201d <em>Steed v. Head, </em>219 F.3d 1298, 1300 (11th Cir.2000) (quotation marks omitted). \u201c[Ejquitable tolling is an extraordinary remedy [that] is limited to rare and exceptional circumstances and typically applied sparingly.\u201d <em>Hunter v. Ferrell, </em>587 F.3d 1304, 1308 (11th Cir.2009) (quotation marks omitted). Equitable tolling of the AEDPA\u2019s one-year limitation period is warranted only if the federal habeas petitioner shows \u201c(1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way and prevented timely filing.\u201d Holland, 560 U.S. at-, 130 S.Ct. at 2562 (quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Diaz v. Sec\u2019y for Dep\u2019t of Corrs., </em>362 F.3d 698, 702 (11th Cir.2004) (explaining that a petitioner must show <em>\u201cboth </em>extraordinary circumstances and due diligence\u201d). \u201cReasonable diligence,\u201d rather than \u201cmaximum feasible diligence\u201d is required for equitable tolling purposes. <em>Holland, </em>560 U.S. at -, 130 S.Ct. at 2565 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-8\">The district court explained that \u201cthere is no indication that Mr. George diligently inquired of his attorney concerning the filing of the post-conviction motion or the effect that a later filing would have on a federal habeas corpus petition.\u201d Before the district court, George argued that \u201che has diligently pursued his legal rights by having his family retain ... a postconviction attorney to represent him in filing any and all motions and petitions regarding his conviction and sentence.\u201d <em>Holland </em>makes clear that only \u201creasonable diligence\u201d is required to satisfy the first prong of the equitable tolling test. 560 U.S. at-, 130 S.Ct. at 2565. But nothing in <em>Holland </em>suggests that a petitioner may establish reasonable diligence merely by retaining an attorney. Instead, the Supreme Court in <em>Holland </em>focused on the petitioner\u2019s own actions in the face of his attorney\u2019s inaction. <em>Id. </em>In concluding that the petitioner had exercised reasonable diligence, the Court observed that the petitioner \u201cwrote his attorney numerous letters seeking crucial information and providing direction,\u201d and \u201crepeatedly contacted the state courts, their clerks, and the Florida State Bar Association in an effort to have [the attorney] removed from his case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The district court did not clearly err in finding that George\u2019s hiring of post-conviction counsel was not enough to establish reasonable diligence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b777-14\">On appeal, George points to two letters he wrote to his post-conviction counsel, which he has included in his appendix to his initial brief before this Court, but which he failed to present to the district court. In the first letter, dated September 2, 2007, George asked his post-conviction counsel to file a state post-conviction motion under Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.850 soon so that George could file his federal habeas petition within the one-year time limit.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In the second letter, dated November 15, 2007, George again urged his attorney to file his Rule 3.850 motion soon because he \u201cd[id] not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>wish to wa[i]ve the opportunity to take [his] case to the federal courts.\u201d But because George did not present these letters to the district court in his response to the court\u2019s order directing him to respond to the limitations period, we cannot consider them in determining whether the district court clearly erred in finding that George had not exercised reasonable diligence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See Selman, </em>449 F.3d at 1332; <em>Dominick, </em>809 F.2d at 1573.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">For these reasons, we conclude that the district court did not clearly err in finding that George did not exercise reasonable diligence, and as a result did not err in determining that George was not entitled to equitable tolling under <em>Holland.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We therefore AFFIRM the district court\u2019s order dismissing George\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b776-6\">. The district court issued a certificate of appealability (''COA\u201d) under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c) only on the issue of \"whether [George] is entitled to equitable tolling pursuant to <em>Holland v. Florida, [560 </em>U.S.-,] <em>130 </em>S.Ct. 2549 (2010).\u201d Our review is therefore limited to this issue. <em>Hodges v. Att'y Gen., State of Fla., </em>506 F.3d 1337, 1340-41 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b776-9\">. This is because \u00a7 2244(d)(l)(B)-(D) would not provide a later triggering date for the statute of limitations in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b776-10\">. George filed a motion to modify his sentence under Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.800 on May 31, 2007. That motion was denied on June 26, 2007, and George did not appeal that ruling. We have previously held that a Rule 3.800(c) motion to reduce a legal sentence is not a tolling motion under \u00a7 2244(d)(2) because the rule does not provide a procedure for raising a legal challenge, but functions as a way for a petitioner to request leniency from a legal sentence. <em>Alexander v. Secy, Dep't of Corrs., </em>523 F.3d 1291, 1292, 1295 (11th Cir.2008). But the Supreme Court has recently held that a similar motion to reduce a sentence qualified as an application for 'collateral review' under \u00a7 2244(d), and rejected the argument that an application merely seeking sentencing leniency does not provide for statutory tolling. <em>Wall v. Kholi, </em>562 U.S.-,-, 131 S.Ct. 1278, 1286-87, 179 L.Ed.2d 252 (2011). The Supreme Court in Wall cited <em>Alexander </em>in illustrating the circuit split that the Court sought to resolve in <em>Wall. Id. </em>at-, 131 S.Ct. at 1283 &amp; n. 2. However, even assuming without deciding that <em>Wall </em>abrogated <em>Alexander </em>and that George\u2019s AEDPA time clock was therefore tolled during the twenty-six days while his Rule 3.800 motion was pending, George\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition still would not have been filed until nineteen months after the limitations period expired.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b777-9\">. In objecting to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, George also stated that he had shown diligence \u201cby communicating his concerns to [his] attorney regarding preservation of timeliness of the filing of a Habeas petition.\" But we cannot conclude on the basis of this one vague and unsubstantiated statement that the district court clearly erred in finding that George failed to exercise reasonable diligence during the thirty-two month period following the commencement of his AEDPA time clock.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b777-16\">. Our review is limited by the COA to the issue of equitable tolling, but we note by way of explanation that \u00a7 2244(d)(2) does not pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>vide for statutory tolling here because the one-year limitations period provided by AED-PA had already expired when George filed his state post-conviction motion on March 16, 2009. <em>See Tinker </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>255 F.3d 1331, 1333 (11th Cir.2001) (holding that a properly filed application for state post-conviction relief does not provide statutory tolling of AED-PA limitations period where the motion for state post-conviction relief was not filed until after \u00a7 2244(d)'s one-year limitation period had expired).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b778-8\">. George points to other letters he sent to his attorney, but concedes that these letters were not related to the filing of his Rule 3.850 motion or his \u00a7 2254 petition. In any event, these letters were also not presented to the district court. George additionally points to two letters he received from his post-conviction counsel, which he did present to the district court. In a letter dated April 11, 2007, his post-conviction counsel indicated that she intended to file a Rule 3.850 motion after filing a Rule 3.800 motion to modify George\u2019s sentence. In a letter dated February 2, 2010, George's post-conviction attorney acknowledged that she did not file the Rule 3.850 motion in time to toll George's AEDPA time clock. In that letter, George\u2019s attorney stated that because she was employed by an insurance company while also continuing her private post-conviction representation of George, he might be able to argue for equitable tolling on the theory that she \u201chad divided loyalties,\u201d but she maintained that she never \"acted in bad faith or dishonestly towards\u201d George. While these letters from George's attorney may show the deficiencies in her representation of him, they do not show in any way that George himself was diligent in pursuing his rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b778-19\">. Because we conclude that the district court did not clearly err in finding that George failed to exercise reasonable diligence in pursuing his rights, we need not consider whether extraordinary circumstances existed to satisfy the second prong of the equitable tolling test. <em>See Diaz, </em>362 F.3d at 702 n. 7.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
