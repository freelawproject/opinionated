Murphy alleges disability due to back pain. The administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) held that Murphy was not disabled because she was able to perform her past work as a cashier. Murphy argues that the district court ignored her objections and improperly weighed medical evidence.<footnotemark>****</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>First, the ALJ found that Murphy\u2019s \u201cstatements concerning the intensity, duration and limiting effects of [her] symptoms are not entirely credible.\u201d Such an adverse credibility finding must be supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Tommasetti v. Astrue, </em>533 F.3d 1035, 1039 (9th Cir.2008). The ALJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding in this case is adequately supported by several pieces of evidence, including Murphy\u2019s giving much inconsistent information to her doctors regarding her prior medical diagnoses and the origin of her back pain, and Murphy\u2019s apparent effort to doctor-shop until she received a diagnosis that she was seriously injured and disabled. Because the ALJ\u2019s reasons for discounting Murphy\u2019s testimony are clear, convincing, and supported by substantial evidence, we do not disturb the ALJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding. <em>See id. </em>at 1039-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Second, Murphy argues that her objections below were ignored and that her medical evidence was improperly evaluated, but these allegations are without merit. There is no indication in the record that either the ALJ or the district court ignored any of Murphy\u2019s objections. Moreover, both courts carefully and thoroughly examined Murphy\u2019s abundance of medical evidence, which included several reports from her many doctors. Indeed, Murphy fails to specify which pieces of evidence were allegedly ignored or improperly evaluated. Thus, Murphy\u2019s arguments about ignored objections and evidence are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Because the ALJ\u2019s finding that Murphy was not disabled is supported by substantial evidence and contains no legal error, it should not be disturbed. <em>See id. </em>at 1038.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b576-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
