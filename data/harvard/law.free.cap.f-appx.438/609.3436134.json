If a claimant presents objective medical evidence of an underlying impairment and there is no evidence of malingering, \u201c \u2018the ALJ can reject the claimant\u2019s testimony about the severity of her symptoms only by offering specific, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>clear and convincing reasons for doing so.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lingenfelter v. Astrue, </em>504 F.3d 1028, 1036 (9th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Smolen v. Chater, </em>80 F.3d 1273, 1281 (9th Cir.1996)). Although not every reason given by the ALJ met this standard, it was nonetheless proper for the ALJ to discount Williamson\u2019s testimony based on Dr. Eckstein\u2019s observation that there was reason to suspect that Williamson exaggerated her symptoms. <em>See Tonapetyan v. Halter, </em>242 F.3d 1144, 1148 (9th Cir.2001) (holding that a credibility determination based on, among other things, a tendency to exaggerate, was supported by substantial evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Nor did the ALJ err in affording less than full weight to the testimony of lay witness Diane Brending (\u201cBrending\u201d). \u201cIf an ALJ disregards the testimony of a lay witness, the ALJ must provide reasons \u2018that are germane to each witness.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bruce v. Astrue, </em>557 F.3d 1113, 1115 (9th Cir.2009) (quoting <em>Nguyen v. Chater, </em>100 F.3d 1462, 1467 (9th Cir.1996)). That much of Brending\u2019s opinion was based on Williamson\u2019s subjective complaints was a germane reason for rejecting that testimony. Also germane to rejection in part of Brending\u2019s testimony was the ALJ\u2019s determination that objective evidence did not support that Williamson suffered limitations to the extent testified to by Brending.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">The ALJ did not err in giving less than full weight to the opinion of Dr. Eckstein. \u201cThe ALJ is responsible for resolving conflicts in the medical record,\u201d <em>Carmickle v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>533 F.3d 1155, 1164 (9th Cir.2008), and \u201c \u2018must provide clear and convincing reasons for rejecting the uncontradicted opinion of an examining physician,\u2019 \u201d <em>Widmark v. Barnhart, </em>454 F.3d 1063, 1066 (9th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>Lester v. Chater, </em>81 F.3d 821, 830 (9th Cir.1995)). In explaining the weight given to Dr. Eckstein\u2019s report, the ALJ noted that Dr. Eckstein \u201cacknowledged that her conclusions were tentative and might over-represent the degree of pathology\u201d because objective testing showed exaggeration by Williamson. ER 16. This reason was a clear and convincing ground for not fully crediting Dr. Eckstein\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-10\">However, the ALJ erred by not considering Williamson\u2019s concentration, pace, and persistence limitations\u2014as attested to by Brending and Dr. Eckstein\u2014 in making a residual functional capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d) assessment and in questioning the vocational expert (\u201cVE\u201d). In determining a claimant\u2019s RFC, an ALJ must assess all the relevant evidence, including medical reports and witnesses\u2019 descriptions of limitation, to determine what capacity the claimant has for work. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.945(a). Similarly, hypothetical questions that an ALJ poses to a VE to determine what work a claimant can perform \u201cmust include \u2018all of the claimant\u2019s functional limitations, both physical and mental\u2019 supported by the record.\u201d <em>Thomas v. Barnhart, </em>278 F.3d 947, 956 (9th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Flores v. Shalala, </em>49 F.3d 562, 570-71 (9th Cir.1995)). Brending testified that Williamson suffered pace and persistence problems, and Dr. Eckstein\u2019s testing results indicated that Williamson suffered from low psychomotor speed. Consistent with this evidence, the ALJ found that Williamson had moderate limitations of concentration, persistence, and pace. ER 13,16-17. But the ALJ did not account for these nonexertional limitations when he assessed Williamson\u2019s RFC or when he posed hypothetical questions to the VE about the type of work that Wil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>liamson was able to perform. This oversight was error. <em>See Valentine v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>574 F.3d 685, 690 (9th Cir.2009) (\u201cThe hypothetical an ALJ poses to a vocational expert, which derives from the RFC, \u2018must set out <em>all </em>the limitations and restrictions of the particular claimant.\u2019 Thus, an RFC that fails to take into account a claimant\u2019s limitations is defective.\u201d (quoting <em>Embrey v. Bowen, </em>849 F.2d 418, 422 (9th Cir.1988))).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">We reverse the judgment of the district court and remand with directions that it remand this case to the Commissioner for further administrative proceedings. In those proceedings, the ALJ shall include Williamson\u2019s concentration, pace, and persistence limitations in its RFC assessment and its inquiries to the VE.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b634-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AzW\">.

Because the ALJ did not err in giving limited weight to Brending\u2019s testimony, the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Williamson does not meet the criteria of any of the listed impairments, <em>see </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920(d), was also not erroneous.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
