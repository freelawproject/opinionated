He contends that the district court plainly erred when it enhanced his sentence based on a finding that his prior conviction for aggravated assault of a peace officer in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 22.02(a)(2)(A) (1991) was a crime of violence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16 and, thus, an aggravated felony for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(C) and \u00a7 1326(b)(2). Because Mendez-Rubi did not object to the aggravated felony enhancement in the district court, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 358 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">A conviction for aggravated assault of a peace officer in violation of \u00a7 22.02(a)(2)(A) (1991) does not qualify as a crime of violence under \u00a7 16(a) because the use of force was not an element of the offense. <em>See United States v. Villegas-Hernandez, </em>468 F.3d 874, 879, 882 (5th Cir.2006). However, because we have yet to decide whether such a conviction constitutes a crime of violence under \u00a7 16(b) and precedent would have to be extended to compel the result urged by Mendez-Rubi, the alleged error is not clear or obvious. <em>See United States v. Trejo, </em>610 F.3d 308, 319-20 (5th Cir.2010). Accordingly, the error, if any, is not plain. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b318-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm.
