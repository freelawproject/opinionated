We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-23\">Pi\u00f1a argues that he was entitled to due process before his sex offender risk level status was elevated because he had a constitutionally protected liberty interest at stake. The district court properly dismissed the DoC defendants as to this claim because Pi\u00f1a failed to allege personal involvement by any DoC defendants with respect to elevation of his risk status. <em>See Jones v. Williams, </em>297 F.3d 930, 934 (9th Cir.2002) (to state a claim under 42 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>\u00a7 1983, plaintiff must allege \u201cpersonal participation in the alleged rights deprivation\u201d). Any statements by DoC officials regarding Pi\u00f1a\u2019s risk level separate from the official elevation did not rise to the level of constitutional violations. <em>See Paul v. Davis, </em>424 U.S. 693, 698, 96 S.Ct. 1155, 47 L.Ed.2d 405 (1976) (Even if state officials\u2019 acts were to qualify as defamation under state law, such \u201caction is [not] ... transmuted into one for deprivation by the State of rights secured under the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">The district court properly found that Detective Robert Schilling was entitled to qualified immunity. We have not previously addressed whether an individual has a liberty interest at stake in risk level classification under Washington law. We have, however, held that individuals do not have a privacy right at stake in the statute\u2019s notification provisions. <em>See Russell v. Gregoire, </em>124 F.3d 1079, 1094 (9th Cir.1997) (\u201cThe collection and dissemination of information under the Washington Law does not violate any protected privacy interest, and does not amount to deprivation of liberty or property.\u201d). The Washington Supreme Court has interpreted <em>Russell </em>to hold generally that the Washington sex offender registration statute does not implicate a protected interest, although that case did not address the elevation claim made here. <em>See In Re Meyer, </em>142 Wash.2d 608, 16 P.3d 563, 568 (2001). In line with these cases, we are unpersuaded that Pi\u00f1a was entitled to a hearing prior to the elevation of his risk level status. In any event, a reasonable official in Schilling\u2019s position would lack notice of any protected interest. Schilling is therefore entitled to qualified immunity. <em>See Pearson v. Callahan, </em>555 U.S. 223, 129 S.Ct. 808, 815, 172 L.Ed.2d 565 (2009) (An official is entitled to qualified immunity if the \u201cconduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">Pi\u00f1a argues that DoC officials violated his Fourth, Fifth, and substantive due process rights during implementation of the polygraph testing required by Pi\u00f1a\u2019s community custody conditions. Pi\u00f1a failed to allege an unlawful search or a Fourth Amendment violation before the district court, and that claim is therefore waived. <em>See White v. Martel, </em>601 F.3d 882, 885 (9th Cir.2010) (per curiam) (\u201cGenerally, arguments not raised before the district court are waived on appeal.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">To the extent Pi\u00f1a argues that his exercise of Fifth Amendment rights was in fact used against him, he limits that argument to the moments at which he refused to sign the polygraph waiver forms, expressly declining to argue that his incarceration for failure to abide by community custody conditions constituted the basis of his Fifth Amendment claim. As noted in his reply brief, \u201cPi\u00f1a merely takes issue with the way the process was actually applied, challenging ... the DoC Appellees\u2019 effort to get him to preemptorily waive his Fifth Amendment rights.\u201d Pi\u00f1a has thus failed to allege that his exercise of Fifth Amendment rights was used against him as required to sustain a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action. <em>See Chavez v. Martinez, </em>538 U.S. 760, 769, 123 S.Ct. 1994, 155 L.Ed.2d 984 (2003) (\u201c[M]ere coercion does not violate the text of the Self-Incrimination Clause absent use of the compelled statements in a criminal case against the witness.\u201d); <em>see also Image Technical Serv., Inc. v. Eastman Kodak Co., </em>136 F.3d 1354, 1356 (9th Cir.1998) (matters \u201cnot specifically and distinctly argued in appellant\u2019s opening brief\u2019 are ordinarily waived).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">Because Pi\u00f1a\u2019s substantive due process claim relies on the alleged Fourth and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>Fifth Amendment violations, the claim is properly brought under those amendments and not the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>See Patel v. Penman, </em>103 F.3d 868, 874 (9th Cir.1996), (\u201c[W]here a particular amendment provides an explicit textual source of constitutional protection against a particular sort of government behavior, that Amendment, not the more generalized notion of substantive due process, must be the guide for analyzing a plaintiffs claims.\u201d (citations, internal quotations, and brackets omitted)), <em>overruled, in part on other grounds as recognized by Nitco Holding Corp. v. Boujikian, </em>491 F.3d 1086 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Pifia also argues that his risk level elevation was based on facts not found by a jury and thus violated the Sixth Amendment. We have previously held that \u201cthe registration provisions of [Washington\u2019s sex offender statute] do not amount to punishment subject to the Ex Post Facto clause,\u201d and in doing so we applied the factors relevant for determining whether an act constitutes punishment under the Sixth Amendment. <em>See Russell, </em>124 F.3d at 1089. Accordingly, Pifia\u2019s Sixth Amendment claim is foreclosed by <em>Russell.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b599-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
