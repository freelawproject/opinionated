WHITE, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">Plaintiff Mark Jones appeals the denial of his motions for judgment as a matter of law and for a new trial filed after the jury returned a verdict finding that he did not prove that his employer, Defendant Nissan North America, Inc., discriminated against him in violation of the Americans With Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101, or the Tennessee Disability Act, Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7 8-50-103 <em>et seq. </em>We REVERSE and REMAND for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">Mark Jones began working for Nissan in 1997, as an auto assembly production technician at Nissan\u2019s manufacturing plant in Smyrna, Tennessee. Jones initially worked the night shift on the metal line where he used power tools to do welding and grinding. Later, he worked the \u201chood install\u201d job on the metal line, working on Nissan Altima cars during the afternoon shift. In April 2003, Jones injured his right elbow while working the \u201chood install\u201d job.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">Jones reported his injury to Nissan, and the company provided him with a choice of three treating physicians from whom he could receive treatment. Jones chose Dr. Douglas Weikert, who diagnosed Jones with right lateral epicondylitis, or tennis elbow. Dr. Weikert treated Jones with therapy and cortisone shots, and eventually recommended surgery, which Jones had in September 2004. Dr. Weikert restricted Jones from returning to work until January 2005, and then released him to return to work with no restrictions. As Jones\u2019s treating physician for workers\u2019 compensation purposes, Dr. Weikert assigned Jones an anatomical impairment rating of 3% to his right arm.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">By 2006, Jones was working the day shift in the trim area of the body shop. This job, \u201cbody trim fits,\u201d entailed light lifting and did not require the use of power tools. Jones used hand tools\u2014specifically a light rubber hammer, a chisel, and a plastic finesse tool\u2014to adjust car panel gaps. As a part of the job, Jones often had to open and close the hoods of various vehicles; some vehicles\u2019 hoods had a hydraulic lift, which allows a hood to hold up its own weight, and some did not. Jones made approximately $25 per hour. In January 2006, Jones visited Dr. Weikert again complaining of discomfort in his arm. Dr. Weikert examined Jones and again released him to return to work with no restrictions as of January 18, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-10\">Jones\u2019s supervisor, Area Manager Guerry Marsh, found Jones to be a hard worker and was satisfied with his job performance. He never observed Jones being unable to perform, or having difficulty with, any of the tasks associated with his job. Jones never asked for any changes to be made to his duties; nor did he ever complain that he was having difficulty. Marsh testified that Jones could do the lifting associated with the body-trim-fits job and could use all of the tools required for the job, and that there was nothing that caused him to believe that Jones could not physically perform the job.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-11\">On June 8, 2006, Jones\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim against Nissan for his right-elbow injury was tried in the Chancery Court for Wilson County, Tennessee, before Chancellor C.K. Smith. The court heard testimony from Jones and Guerry Marsh, and considered Dr. Weikert\u2019s deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-12\">At the conclusion of the workers\u2019 compensation trial, Chancellor Smith gave an oral ruling from the bench, stating, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABT\">So on 9/21/04 Dr. Weikert performed surgery on the plaintiff here.... As I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>stated, [the doctor] put him back to work full-time with no restrictions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-5\">After the surgery the plaintiff says\u2014 and he seems to be a very honest, credible witness. There\u2019s no reason for me not to believe him. That he\u2019s still having pain and couldn\u2019t probably do the job that he was doing at the time of his injury because it required a lot of lifting and more use of vibratory tools. He says that he doesn\u2019t think he could use tools that\u2014-that vibrate a lot. Right now all he has to use is a hammer and a chisel. And according to the video, that\u2019s not how one might imagine one using a hammer and a chisel. It\u2019s just a pecking. In other words, not a\u2014not a great deal of chiseling going on. It\u2019s just kind of knocking\u2014I forget what he called it\u2014but kind of knocking trim in or screw in or something. But it\u2019s very light\u2014light type of use of a hammer and a chisel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-6\">He says that\u2014he asked the doctor not to put him on any permanent restrictions because Nissan is\u2014just won\u2019t hardly work you if you\u2019ve got permanent restrictions. But the doctor didn\u2019t say anything about that. He just said that the plaintiff had no restrictions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-7\">He says the job[ ] he\u2019s on now\u2014and it doesn\u2019t require any heavy lifting, maybe sometime a hood, the trunk, or whatever, the door, or whatever that back hatch is behind those vans might be called. But it\u2019s very light because they have some type of spring fed\u2014-something that helps raise the hood and so forth. So they\u2019re not very difficult to raise. But he feels like [there are] jobs that are there that require a lot of heavy lifting and use of power tools or vibratory tools, that he wouldn\u2019t be able to do. He said he would attempt to do them if it meant do that or lose his job.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-8\">He\u2019s working ... back at the same job\u2014or back at the same employer, different job there. He says the pain\u2019s constant. It\u2019s worse when he\u2019s working, and he tires quickly, doesn\u2019t have as much grip strength. The only hobby it interferes with basically is throwing a baseball to his boys. He\u2019s a baseball coach. He can\u2019t throw it as well, he said, as he could before. At the house he can\u2019t lift much. And when he has to use a screwdriver to screw something in he has to take breaks. It\u2019s painful. Can\u2019t use lawn mowers or weedeaters like he could before. The vibration causes him a lot of pain and hurts him. Takes a lot of Advil. And he\u2019s on a prescription of anti-inflammatory.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-10\">... Since his date of release he\u2019s missed no work because of this injury. Feels like he could continue to do the job that he\u2019s doing.... As the area manager testified ... he had no complaint about the work performance of the plaintiff....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-11\">But I believe that he does have a\u2014a disability to his right arm. And if I didn\u2019t say this, the doctor gave him a three percent rating to his arm according to the AMA Guides, Dr. Weikert. And I feel like that he has a permanent partial vocational disability of 30 percent to his upper right extremity based on the statements I\u2019ve made above and the fact that he does have continued pain, can\u2019t use certain vibratory tools, lawn mower, weedeater, can\u2019t lift as much as he could before....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-12\">... But based upon all the evidence I\u2019ve heard-\u2014and I do think he has some restrictions and because of that and the pain and the restrictions that I feel like he has based upon his testimony, I think he\u2019s entitled to 30 [percent] vocational disability. Thanks, y\u2019all.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-13\">(App.49-53.)</p>\n<p id=\"b415-14\">Nissan\u2019s counsel then asked the chancellor to elaborate on what restrictions he felt Jones had. The court responded,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>I think using\u2014I think tools\u2014like I stated\u2014vibratory tools, lawn mower, weedeater, anything that would vibrate will cause his elbow to hurt. And I think lifting\u2014he\u2019s testified to lifting and rolling motion of his arm kind of hurts him and throwing balls and stuff like that. I just think that those are legitimate. And that\u2019s what he testified to. Those are the only ones\u2014and he has constant pain all the time as well. Has grip strength loss. I think that\u2019s about\u2014I think I\u2019ve covered most everything. I might have left something out. But I think those are the things that\u2014 that I feel like that he\u2019s lost as a result of this. And because of that I think his vocational disability is substantial, not as substantial maybe as the plaintiffs feel, but I feel like that it\u2019s something he\u2019s got to live with and deal with the rest of his life, and he should be entitled to [a] vocational disability rating of 80 percent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AD5\">(App.53-54.)</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">Counsel for Nissan then drafted a written order, which Jones\u2019s counsel reviewed and the court signed on June 20, 2006. It incorporated the chancellor\u2019s previously stated findings of fact and conclusions of law (excerpted above) and also provided in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-5\">Plaintiff retains a 3 % permanent anatomical impairment to the right upper extremity. Based on this rating, his restrictions against working with power tools and against lifting, his ability to return to his pre-injury employer at or above his pre-injury wage rate, his education, his job skills, and his employability on the open labor market, Plaintiff retains a 30% permanent disability to the right arm. This entitled Plaintiff to XXXX weeks of benefits at the stipulated weekly rate of $ XXXX, all of which have accrued at the time of trial, and, therefore, are due and payable in a lump sum of $XXXX.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-10\">... It is therefore, ORDERED, ADJUDGED, and DECREED that Plaintiff shall recover from Defendants:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-11\">(1) XXXX weeks of permanent disability benefits at the weekly rate of $ XXXX for lump sum of $ XXXX;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-12\">(2) future medical expenses pursuant to T.C.A. \u00a7 50-6-204; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-13\">(3) reimbursement of discretionary costs totaling $280.00.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-14\">(App.44.) (redaction in original.) Following the trial, Jones returned to his body-fits job.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-15\">The award of benefits was higher than Nissan was expecting.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nissan initially appealed, but later withdrew its appeal. Jones and his counsel considered asking the court to change or clarify its ruling,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but did not request an amendment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b416-16\">Kitty Boyte, counsel for Nissan in the workers\u2019 compensation case, emailed the result of the trial to Nissan\u2019s legal department and to Miles Tate, a representative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>of Nissan\u2019s on-site third-party administrator for workers\u2019 compensation claims.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Boyte\u2019s June 8, 2006, email summarized the court\u2019s decision as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-5\">In his Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, Chancellor Smith made a point of saying on the record that he found that Plaintiff was restricted ... from lifting and using power tools.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Afu\">(App.28.) On June 13, 2006, Boyte wrote an email to Ray Coss, Nissan\u2019s in-house counsel, and copied (among others) Kerry Dove, the department manager of safety and medical management for Nissan. Boyte wrote in part,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-6\">But in his FoF/CoL [Findings of Fact/Conclusions of Law], Chancellor Smith commented that ... (2) Plaintiff testified that he (Jones) did not feel that he was capable of performing any jobs that required use of power tools, had problems operating a screwdriver when performing tasks at home, and could not lift heavy objects without experiencing pain and weakness in his arm, (3) Only Plaintiff knew what he could and could not do safely and comfortably, and since he (Jones) felt that he was unable to perform those tasks, he ([Chancellor] Smith) felt that he was restricted from performing those types of tasks. When [Chancellor] Smith said, \u201cI find him to be restricted, and therefore I find him to be 30% disabled[,\u201d] and then asked if there were any other issues to be determined that he had not mentioned, I asked him what he meant by Plaintiff being restricted. He went back and said (again) that Plaintiff said he was unable to operate power tools and unable to lift, and that he (Jones) knew best about what he could and couldn\u2019t do safely and comfortably, and therefore he ([Chancellor] Smith) found him to be restricted from the use of power tools and from lifting.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-10\">(App.25.) On June 14, 2006, Dove emailed Coss and others, stating in part,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-11\">... If [Jones] feels he cannot perform those tasks without getting injured and the judge agrees, we need to honor that. It is my opinion that his restrictions should be <em>no lifting, no me of power tools, and no use of hand tools. </em>We should move on this ASAP and determine if he is working within those restrictions. I am truly concerned that if his job requires him to perform these tasks he may be in harm[\u2019]s way. Pat, please have Wade review his jobs ASAP to determine if he is exceeding these restrictions imposed by the judge and we will take action from there.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-12\">(App.23.) (emphasis added.) Dove testified that when he wrote that email message, he had not yet read the court\u2019s oral ruling or written order.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He based his understanding of the court\u2019s ruling on Kitty\u2019s Boyte\u2019s email, notwithstanding that Boyte\u2019s email does not state that Jones was restricted in his use of hand tools on the job.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-13\">In response to Dove\u2019s email, Wade Pinkard, a job-placement coordinator for Whole Health Management, an entity that provides health providers for the clinic at Nissan, replied on June 19, 2006,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-14\">In Kitty\u2019s June 08 message she states Chancellor Smith found EE [employee] to be restricted from lifting and using power tools. In your June 14 message you opine [permanent] restrictions should be no lifting, no use of power <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>tools, and no use of hand tools. <em>The m use of hand tools is very significant. </em>Should Dr. Kubina review and make recommendations regarding permanent restrictions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-4\">If permanent restrictions are imposed, the EE\u2019s medical file should be brought current, and the restrictions entered in KCRS.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">(App.22.) (brackets in original) (emphasis added.) That same day, Dove responded,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Atc\">Yes, please get Dr. Kubina\u2019s opinion and hers should be our official stance. I got that from the statement that he could not use a serewdrivei\u2019, but I\u2019m no doctor. Thanks!</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">(App.22.) At trial, Dove conceded that Boyte\u2019s email had not said that Jones could not use a screwdriver, but that he \u201chad problems operating a screwdriver when performing tasks at home.\u201d Dove testified that he consulted the legal department about how to get the restrictions into Jones\u2019s medical record. Dove understood the issue to be a legal matter, not a medical one. Ray Coss, Nissan\u2019s in-house counsel met with Dove. Coss interpreted the court\u2019s order as affirmatively \u201corder[ing Nissan] to impose medical restrictions on Mark Jones.\u201d Coss admitted that whatever the chancellor said about restrictions was not a medical judgment, but testified that \u201cin the context of this workers\u2019 comp trial and order, we treated [ ] this as if it was a medical restriction.\u201d Specifically, Coss read the court order as saying \u201cno use of power tools, no lifting, and no use of hand tools.\u201d Coss testified that he reached this conclusion by taking the court\u2019s oral ruling and its written order together, and reading them \u201cin totality.\u201d Coss conceded that the court\u2019s ruling did not specifically say anything about the use of hand tools, but stated that that finding was supported by the part of the judge\u2019s ruling which acknowledged that Jones would be unable to do the metal-line job (the job he had before the body trim fits job and the job in which he was injured), and that Jones had used hand tools in that job. Coss also testified that, although the court\u2019s order does not say that Jones is permanently restricted from all lifting, he interpreted the language in the court\u2019s written order referencing a \u201crestriction! ] ... against lifting,\u201d to mean that Jones was not permitted to lift anything at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">Coss testified that he informed Dr. Anne Kubina, onsite medical director for Nissan, of his interpretation of the court\u2019s order, and instructed her to place the permanent restrictions in Jones\u2019s medical file. Nissan did not ask Dr. Kubina for her medical opinion of Jones\u2019s ability to work; Dr. Kubina examined or even met Jones. Dr. Kubina testified that she had not read the court\u2019s order when she entered the restrictions. Dr. Kubina had been included in the email chain describing the court\u2019s order, however, and she stated that she trusted her sources. Dr. Kubina understood her role to be \u201cdocumenting\u201d the restrictions that the chancellor had already assigned. Accordingly, on July 18, 2006, Dr. Kubina made an entry in Jones\u2019s medical record stating that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-9\">EE was not seen in office, but a recent court ruling has caused him to have new permanent restrictions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-10\">... Per recent judicial ruling, EE now has the following permanent restrictions: no lifting, no use of <em>power </em>tools, and no use of hand tools.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-11\">(App.41.) Dr. Kubina conceded that she \u201chad no idea about how the restrictions that [she] put in th[e] medical record matchfed] up to Mark Jones\u2019 actual medical condition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-12\">After the restrictions were documented, Nissan evaluated whether it had any jobs Jones could perform within the restric<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>tions. Finding none, Nissan informed Jones on July 25, 2006, that he was immediately being placed on a medical leave of absence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Nissan told Jones that it had placed him on leave because he had permanent restrictions and it was unable to find a job for him within those restrictions. A few days later, Jones returned for a \u201cleave information meeting,\u201d during which he was asked to sign a form indicating he was restricted from lifting, using power tools, and using hand tools. Jones refused to sign the form, explaining \u201cI was not on any restrictions, I could do my job, and I was able to do my job.\u201d Jones was encouraged to apply for long-term disability, but did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">After being placed on medical leave, Jones repeatedly contacted Nissan requesting unsuccessfully to have the restrictions lifted and to be allowed to return to his job. According to Nissan, there were no jobs available during that time that met Jones\u2019s restrictions. As of the start date of his medical leave on July 25, 2006, Jones no longer received a paycheck from Nissan, though the company did pay a portion of his health insurance premiums. On October 14, 2007, citing the need to provide for his family, Jones took a job as a fleet manager with American Residential Services that paid him $13 per hour ($15 per hour by the time of trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">Nissan policy prevents employees on leave to work without obtaining advance approval. Jones testified at trial that he did not seek Nissan\u2019s permission to work because \u201cI knew what their view was going to be. What job could I work with no lifting, no use of power tools, and no hand tools, with me being a laborer? I knew I wasn\u2019t going to be able to find something with them okaying it, ... \u201d Nissan learned about Jones\u2019s new job in January 2008 during his deposition. Nissan\u2019s human resources department recommended that Jones\u2019s employment be terminated, and Jones was fired on January 22, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-11\">Jones filed suit in federal court alleging discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101, and what is now the Tennessee Disability Act (TDA), Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7 8-50-103. Following discovery, both Jones and Nissan filed motions for summary judgment, which the district court denied. At the jury trial held from April 21 to 24, 2009, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>only Jones presented a case-in-chief; Nissan did not present other witnesses. At the conclusion of Jones\u2019s case, both parties made oral motions for judgment as a matter of law (JMOL), and responded to the other side\u2019s motion. The court denied both motions in an oral ruling and denied the parties\u2019 objections to the proposed jury instructions. The jury returned a verdict for Nissan.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">On May 8, 2009, Jones filed a motion for JMOL, or alternatively, a new trial. The district court denied the motion in a June 24, 2009, memorandum and order. The court rejected Jones\u2019s \u201ccertitude that Nissan perceived or regarded him as disabled and because of such misperception wrongfully placed him on a medical leave of absence\u201d and concluded that \u201cbased upon the evidence presented, a jury could (and presumably did) conclude that Nissan was acting in accordance with its interpretation that the Chancery Court Order placed certain restrictions on Jones and precluded him from working on the assembly line, as well as in certain other jobs at Nissan.\u201d Jones timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">I. \u201cRegarded As\u201d Disability Discrimination Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">A.

In this regard, the ADA provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-7\">(2) Disability</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-8\">The term \u201cdisability\u201d means, with respect to an individual\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-9\">(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-13\">(B) a record of such an impairment; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-14\">(C) <em>being regarded as having such an impairment.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-15\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12102 (2008) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In this case, Jones claims he falls under \u00a7 12102(2)(C)\u2014that is, he claims not that he actually was disabled, but that he was so regarded by Nissan.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201cIt is not enough that the employer regarded that individual as somehow disabled; rather, the plaintiff must show that the employer regarded the individual as disabled within the meaning of the ADA.\u201d <em>Ross v. Campbell Soup Co., </em>237 F.3d 701, 709 (6th Cir.2001) (citations and quotations omitted). Combining the requirements of subsections (A) and (C) of \u00a7 12102, Jones must show that Nissan regarded him as having a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of his major life activities. As the Supreme Court explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-16\">There are two apparent ways in which individuals may fall within this statutory definition: (1) a covered entity mistakenly believes that a person has a physical impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, or (2) a covered entity mistakenly believes that an actual, nonlimiting impairment substantially limits one or more major life activities. In both cases, it is necessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>that a covered entity entertain misperceptions about the individual\u2014it must believe either that one has a substantially limiting impairment that one does not have or that one has a substantially limiting impairment when, in fact, the impairment is not so limiting.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-4\"><em>Sutton v. United Air Lines, </em>527 U.S. 471, 489, 119 S.Ct. 2139, 144 L.Ed.2d 450 (1999), <em>superseded by statute on other grounds, see </em>n. 9. Jones argues that he falls in the second category, that he had a physical impairment that did not substantially limit him in a major life activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">The relevant major life activities in this case are lifting and \u201cperforming manual tasks,\u201d a category that this court has found includes the use of hand tools, vibrating power tools, etc. <em>See Wysong v. Dow Chemical Co., </em>503 F.3d 441, 450 (6th Cir.2007) (lifting a major life activity); <em>Kiphart v.

City of Chattanooga, </em>206 F.3d 637 (6th Cir.2000), that an employer is required to conduct an \u201cindividualized inquiry\u201d into the plaintiffs <em>actual medical condition:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-10\">The ADA mandates an individualized inquiry in determining whether an employee\u2019s disability or other condition disqualifies him from a particular position. In order to properly evaluate a job applicant on the basis of his personal characteristics, the employer must conduct an individualized inquiry into the individual\u2019s actual medical condition, and the impact, if any, the condition might have on that individual\u2019s ability to perform the job in question.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 643.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-12\">C. The Parties\u2019 Positions</p>\n<p id=\"b422-13\">Jones argues that the undisputed material facts establish that Nissan regarded him as having a substantially-limiting impairment that he did not have. Jones maintains that he did not actually have the physical limitations Nissan placed in his medical record, citing in support that he had been satisfactorily performing all the physical tasks associated with his job until he was removed, that no doctor ever assigned him any restrictions, that he did not testify at the workers\u2019 compensation hearing that he could not lift at all or use any power or hand tools at all, that the chancellor\u2019s order referenced his \u201cability to return to his pre-injury employer,\u201d that the chancellor was not qualified to impose medical restrictions, and that even Nissan thought that the restrictions it contends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>the chancellor imposed were \u201ccompletely unsubstantiated.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">Jones contends that Nissan\u2019s interpretation of the chancellor\u2019s ruling is not a legally sufficient evidentiary basis upon which a jury could rely because Nissan relied on unsubstantiated restrictions, and did not conduct an individualized inquiry into Jones\u2019s actual medical condition as required by <em>Holiday, </em>206 F.3d at 643. He argues that Nissan\u2019s \u201cinterpretation\u201d of the chancellor\u2019s order was incorrect as a matter of law because 1) the chancellor did not affirmatively order Nissan to do anything other than pay workers\u2019 compensation benefits, 2) the order did not state that Jones was restricted from all lifting or using hand tools (the order did not even include the words \u201chand tools\u201d), and 3) the order never stated that Jones was unable to do his job.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">Nissan does not dispute Jones\u2019s arguments about his actual medical condition, but counters that it could not have \u201cdisregarded a court order,\u201d and that its imposition of workplace restrictions was merely an attempt to comply with the chancellor\u2019s ruling. Nissan argues that it did not treat Jones as if his elbow injury were substantially limiting, as evidenced by the fact that Nissan returned Jones to work after Jones returned from the injury in January 2005 and only placed him on leave after the Chancery Court issued its June 2006 order. Nissan stresses that its employees did not harbor any myths, fears, or stereotypes about Jones\u2019s medical condition, nor did they even consider the chancellor\u2019s order to be a medical judgment, thereby positioning this case outside the realm of regarded-as discrimination cases. Nissan insists that this is not a disability-discrimination case because Nissan did not believe that Jones was unable to do the job. Rather, it believed that the chancellor had declared Nissan could not permit Jones to do his job.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-11\">Nissan responds to Jones\u2019s argument that the chancellor\u2019s ruling is not a legally sufficient evidentiary basis for the jury\u2019s verdict by citing various cases for the proposition that court orders must be complied with promptly. Concerning its interpretation of the order, Nissan argues that so long as its actions were based on an \u201chonest belief\u2019 rather than discriminatory animus, it did not discriminate. Finally, Nissan argues that this court should not make any determinations about the chancellor\u2019s order as a matter of law because in the disability-discrimination context, the order is relevant only as the basis for Nissan\u2019s actions, and a jury is entitled to decide whether it provides a valid, nondiscriminatory reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-12\">The court instructed the jury, consistent with Nissan\u2019s position:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>All persons who are subject to an order of a court have an obligation to comply and to follow the court\u2019s order. A person subject to a court order may not ignore or violate that order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-4\">[ ] \u201cif you find that Defendant honestly believed it was acting as required by Chancellor Smith\u2019s ruling and that it honestly believed that because of the ruling Plaintiff could not perform the essential functions of an available job at Nissan, then you may not conclude that Defendant acted for a discriminatory reason\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">(Trial Tr. 657.)</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">D. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">This is an atypical regarded-as discrimination case in that the purported source of the physical restrictions Nissan imposed on Jones was a state-court order rather than Nissan\u2019s own conclusions about Jones\u2019s capabilities. Thus, this case turns on the legitimacy of Nissan\u2019s interpretation of the court order to impose ability restrictions on Jones and whether Nissan had an independent obligation to ascertain Jones\u2019s medical condition and capabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">1. Jones was entitled to Judgment as a Matter of Law</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">The central issue is the legitimacy of the nondiscriminatory reason offered by Nissan for its actions\u2014that it relied on the order of the workers\u2019 compensation chancellor. This defense fails as a matter of law because 1) as a matter of law and fact, the order did not require that Nissan take the actions it took; 2) there was no genuine issue whether Nissan independently assessed Jones\u2019s physical capabilities; and, 3) there was no genuine issue whether Nissan made the reasonable assessment and inquiry required to assert an honest-belief defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-10\">a. The order did not require that Nissan impose medical restrictions on Jones</p>\n<p id=\"b424-11\">Nissan\u2019s defense, and the district court\u2019s denial of Jones\u2019s post-trial motions, was based on the premise that Nissan imposed unsubstantiated medical restrictions on Jones because it believed the chancellor\u2019s decision and order required it to do so. We will assume arguendo that if an employer is ordered by a court to impose restrictions on an employee\u2019s work activities, the employer cannot be found to have violated the ADA simply by obeying the court\u2019s order, the theory being that the employer has imposed the restrictions without regard to its perception of the employee\u2019s physical disabilities, and in compliance with the court order. Or, stated differently, the employer\u2019s view of the employee\u2019s disability is not the cause of the restrictions because the employer was obliged to impose the restriction in any event due to the court order.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-12\">In the instant case, however, notwithstanding Nissan\u2019s arguments to the contrary, it is clear beyond peradventure that the chancellor\u2019s order did not direct Nissan to restrict Jones from continuing in the trim-fit position he was performing at the time of the workers\u2019 compensation trial. The order only directs Nissan to pay certain benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-13\">Further, even if, as Nissan argues, the findings of the workers\u2019 compensation chancellor could amount to an order to impose restrictions, Nissan employees continually revised the chancellor\u2019s findings without regard to what the chancellor actually stated. Most glaringly, Nissan concluded that Jones was restricted from using \u201chand tools,\u201d despite the fact that the chancellor did not make a single finding with regard to Jones\u2019s ability to use hand tools in his job.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>Thus, it cannot fairly be said that Nissan imposed the medical restrictions in compliance with the court order. At best, Nissan imposed the restrictions based on its conclusion that the order required it to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">b. There was no genuine issue whether Nissan conducted an individualized inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">The law is clear that an employer cannot simply rely on a third-party\u2019s assessment that an employee is disabled. <em>Holiday, </em>206 F.3d at 643, explains that an employer is required to conduct an \u201cindividualized inquiry\u201d into the plaintiffs <em>actual medical condition. </em>The record reflects a complete lack of evidence that Nissan took any steps to ascertain Jones\u2019s actual medical condition. In fact, Nissan acknowledged that it conducted no such inquiry because it determined that it did not matter whether Jones was medically disabled. Nissan\u2019s own physician never saw Jones or even evaluated his medical file and instead placed medical limitations on Jones citing a \u201crecent judicial ruling.\u201d Coss admitted that whatever the chancellor said about restrictions was not a medical judgment \u201cin the classical sense,\u201d but stated that nevertheless, \u201cin the context of this workers\u2019 comp trial and order, we treated [ ] this as if it was a medical restriction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">Nissan argues that it did not have to inquire into Jones\u2019s true medical condition because it did not base its decision on whether it regarded Jones as medically unable to perform his job functions but, rather, on its honest belief regarding the meaning of the chancellor\u2019s order. Nissan insists that it did not regard Jones as disabled and believed he could do the job, as evidenced by the fact that it let him perform his job until the chancellor\u2019s decision. But that is irrelevant; Jones does not claim he was regarded as disabled before the chancellor\u2019s decision. He claims that as a result of the chancellor\u2019s decision, Nissan regarded him as unable to perform his job. Nissan responds that after the chancellor\u2019s decision it still believed Jones was able to perform his job, but also believed it was required to impose medical restrictions consistent with the chancellor\u2019s findings. Coss acknowledged that he treated the chancellor\u2019s findings as medical restrictions and directed that the restrictions be placed in Jones\u2019s file.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">Thus, Nissan attempts to draw a distinction between misperceptions of an employee\u2019s medical condition and misperception of his legal status. We reject that effort in the context of this case. Here the misperception motivating Nissan was that the chancellor concluded that Jones could not use hand tools and could do no lifting at all. It is clear that had a doctor used the same words as the chancellor used, Nissan would have been obligated to look beyond its perception of the doctor\u2019s conclusions and make an individualized assessment of Jones\u2019s abilities. <em>See Holiday, </em>206 F.3d at 643-44, and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-10\">The question then is whether when an employer takes action based on a third party\u2019s judgment regarding the employee\u2019s physical ability to perform the job, it is excused from making an individualized inquiry if it perceives that it is required to follow the third party\u2019s judgment without regard to the accuracy of that judgment. Nissan argues that in such a case the employer is not acting based on prejudice, myths or preconceived notions about an employee\u2019s physical abilities, but rather on its understanding, albeit possibly mistaken, of its obligations separate and apart from its perceptions of the employee\u2019s physical capabilities. Nissan thus seeks refuge behind the chancellor\u2019s conclusions by casting them as legal, rather than medical, conclusions. But the chancellor\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>statements were neither; they were findings in support of the chancellor\u2019s ruling. In making these findings, the chancellor did not impose restrictions on Jones; the chancellor simply stated, in response to Nissan\u2019s counsel\u2019s request for clarification, what the chancellor found to be the injury\u2019s effect on Jones\u2019s ability to perform various tasks. Whether this is labeled as a medical determination or some other type of determination, this determination concerns Jones\u2019s physical ability to perform his job. Were employers permitted to infer an inability to do the job based on workers\u2019 compensation findings of fact, the purposes of the ADA would be undermined. Although Nissan disavows sharing the chancellor\u2019s view of Jones\u2019s limitations, it nevertheless drew unfounded inferences from those findings, leading it to impose unsupported medical restrictions on Jones. This constitutes discrimination under the ADA. Although the basis for the judgment may have been the chancellor\u2019s ruling, it is undisputed that Nissan regarded Jones as having physical/medical restrictions rendering him unable to perform his job.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">c. There was no genuine issue whether Nissan is entitled to the honest-belief defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Nissan has consistently defended this action on the basis that it honestly believed that it was required to impose restrictions by the chancellor\u2019s order. The district court rejected Jones\u2019s post-trial motion on the basis that the jury reasonably concluded that Nissan did not regard Jones as disabled but honestly believed it was required to impose the disqualifying medical restrictions based on the chancellor\u2019s order. We therefore turn to the \u201chonest belief\u2019 rule.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">The general rule provides that \u201cso <em>long </em>as the employer honestly believed in the proffered reason for its employment action, the employee cannot establish pretext even if the employer\u2019s reason is ultimately found to be mistaken, foolish, trivial, or baseless.\u201d <em>Smith v. Chrysler Corp., </em>155 F.3d 799, 806 (6th Cir.1998). However, this circuit employs a modified honest-belief approach. <em>See Clay v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., </em>501 F.3d 695, 714 (6th Cir.2007). In contrast to the \u201cbare\u201d honest-belief approach described above, in this circuit \u201cthe employer must be able to establish its reasonable reliance on the particularized facts that were before it at the time the decision was made\u201d in order to avoid the finding that its claimed nondiscriminatory reason was pretextual. <em>Id. </em>(applying approach to race discrimination retaliation claim); <em>see also Mickey v. Zeidler Tool &amp; Die Co., </em>516 F.3d 516, 526 (6th Cir.2008) (in the ADEA context), <em>Smith, </em>155 F.3d at 806-07(ADA). This Court has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-9\">In determining whether an employer \u201creasonably relied on the particularized facts then before it, we do not require that the decisional process used by the employer be optimal or that it left no stone unturned. Rather, the key inquiry is whether the employer made a reasonably informed and considered decision before taking an adverse employment action.\u201d <em>[Smith, </em>155 F.3d at 807] (citing <em>[Texas Dep\u2019t of Cmty. Affairs v.] Burdine, </em>450 U.S. [248, 256, 101 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981)]). Although we will not \u201cmicro-manage the process used by employers in making their employment decisions,\u201d we also will not \u201cblindly assume that an employer\u2019s description of its reasons is honest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, \u201c[w]hen the employee is able to produce sufficient evidence to establish that the employer failed to make a reasonably informed and considered decision before taking its adverse employment action, thereby making its decisional process \u2018unworthy of credence,\u2019 then any reliance placed by the employer in such a process cannot be said to be honestly held.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 807-08.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-5\"><em>Wright v. Murray Guard, Inc., </em>455 F.3d 702, 708 (6th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">Nissan\u2019s reliance on its interpretation of the court order as affirmatively requiring it to impose the restrictions on Jones runs afoul of the honest-belief rule. Coss, Nissan\u2019s in-house counsel, testified that Nissan \u201cdid our best to try to understand [the order],\u201d and described how he concluded after reading the findings of fact and conclusions of law \u201ctaken together and read in totality,\u201d that the court order affirmatively ordered Nissan to impose the restrictions. In closing argument, counsel for Nissan argued that Coss consulted with other lawyers, and was methodical and deliberate in his consideration of the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">However, notwithstanding Coss\u2019s characterizations of his own and Nissan\u2019s efforts, there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis to support that conclusion. All the evidence supports that Nissan did not engage in a reasonably informed and considered decision. Neither the court\u2019s oral ruling nor the written order directed Nissan to impose restrictions on Jones. Kerry Dove, the individual at Nissan who first articulated the \u201cno lifting,\u201d \u201cno use of power tools,\u201d and \u201cno use of hand tools\u201d restrictions, had not read the chancellor\u2019s order when he proposed the restrictions. Had Dove read the order before recommending restrictions for Jones, he would have realized that the order did not mention hand tools, nor even state that Jones was \u201chaving problems\u201d using a screwdriver, the understanding on which he testified he based that restriction. The chancellor actually stated that when using a screwdriver at home Jones had to take breaks, and it caused him pain; but the same opinion stated Jones had no trouble with the hand tools he uses in his job\u2014a light rubber hammer and a chisel. There is absolutely nothing in the decision that can reasonably be understood as finding that Jones was unable to perform the trim fits job. Indeed, the opinion makes clear that while Jones would likely be unable to perform the job he was doing when he was injured, he was at the time of trial, successfully performing the trim fits job.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">Nor was the significance of Jones\u2019s ability to use hand tools unnoticed by Nissan. Wade Pinkard, a job-placement coordinator questioned Dove\u2019s interpretation of Boyte\u2019s email, especially his conclusion that Jones could not use hand tools:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-10\">In Kitty\u2019s June 08 message she states Chancellor Smith found EE to be restricted from lifting and using power tools. In your June 14 message you opine [permanent] restrictions should be no lifting, no use of power tools, and no use of hand tools. The no use of hand tools is very significant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-11\">Dove responded that Pinkard should obtain Dr. Kubina\u2019s opinion and that her opinion should be the company\u2019s official stance. Nevertheless, despite his own uncertainty about his conclusions, Dove then went to the legal department to see how to get his restrictions into Jones\u2019s medical record, and met with Coss.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>Coss interpreted the court\u2019s order as affirmatively \u201cordering Nissan] to impose medical restrictions on Mark Jones.\u201d But Coss\u2019s stated rationale for the restrictions of no lifting, no use of power tools, and no use of hand tools was no more rooted in evidence than Dove\u2019s. Coss conceded that the court\u2019s ruling did not specifically say anything about the use of hand tools, but testified that his conclusion was supported by the part of the judge\u2019s ruling that acknowledged that Jones was having pain in his metal-line job, and that Jones had used hand tools in that job. Coss\u2019s conclusion is not the result of reasonable reliance on particularized facts. The metal-line job was Jones\u2019s position when he was injured, not the job Jones was performing at the time Coss was determining restrictions. Nor did the opinion state anything about hand tools in Jones\u2019s old metal-line job. The opinion states that Jones probably could not do the metal-line job again because it \u201crequired a lot of lifting and more use of <em>vibratory </em>tools.\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">Coss also testified that, though the court\u2019s order does not say that Jones is permanently restricted from all lifting, he interpreted the language in the chancellor\u2019s written order (drafted by Nissan\u2019s own attorney) referencing a \u201crestriction[ ] ... against lifting,\u201d to mean that Jones was not permitted to lift anything at all. There is simply no reason for Nissan to interpret the phrasing it selected in this narrow way. The chancellor had stated that Jones \u201ccan\u2019t lift as much as he could before,\u201d but also distinguished the job that Jones could no longer do\u2014\u201cthe job he was doing at the time of his injury,\u201d which \u201crequired a lot of lifting and more use of vibratory tools\u201d\u2014from the job he was doing at the time of the workers\u2019 compensation trial\u2014\u201cRight now all he has to use is a hammer and a chisel____But it\u2019s very ... light type use of a hammer and a chisel ____and it doesn\u2019t require any heavy lifting, maybe sometime a hood, ... it\u2019s very light ... they\u2019re not very difficult to raise.\u201d Further, Dr. Weikert, Jones\u2019s Nissan-chosen physician, had released him back to work with <em>no </em>restrictions, lifting or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">Also strikingly contradictory to Nissan\u2019s interpretation of the chancellor\u2019s ruling and order is the statement in the order, drafted by Nissan\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation counsel, stating that the workers\u2019 compensation award is based on several factors, including Jones\u2019s \u201cability to return to his pre-injury employer at or above his preinjury wage rate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-10\">No reasonable jury could conclude that Nissan had an honest belief based on a \u201creasonably informed and considered decision\u201d that the chancellor had ordered Nissan to impose restrictions on Jones such that he could no longer do the job the chancellor found he was able to do and assumed he would continue doing.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-11\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the district court erred in denying Jones\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law and remand for a determination/new trial limited to the issue of damages.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>2. Limitations-on-remedies instruction</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">Jones argues that the district court erred in instructing the jury regarding limiting damages based on his accepting other employment without seeking Nissan\u2019s permission. Jones argues that the jury instructions based upon <em>McKennon v. Nashville Banner Publ\u2019g Co., </em>513 U.S. 352, 115 S.Ct. 879, 130 L.Ed.2d 852 (1995), are prejudicial and should be excluded from any new trial on damages. In <em>McKennon, </em>the Supreme Court established the \u201cafter-acquired evidence\u201d defense, which allows a defendant employer to show that an employee would have been terminated anyway had the employer known of wrongful conduct by the employee plaintiff. 513 U.S. at 362, 115 S.Ct. 879. If the defense applies, it generally bars the employee from obtaining front pay and reinstatement, and limits backpay. <em>See Thurman v. Yellow Freight Sys., Inc., </em>90 F.3d 1160, 1168 (6th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">In the instant case, the district court instructed the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-9\">As a general rule, back pay damages, if any, apply from the time Plaintiff suffered an adverse action until the date of your verdict. However, in this case ... Defendant contends that regardless of any claimed disability or perception of disability, it would have made the decision to terminate Plaintiff on January 25, 2008, because of conduct the Defendant discovered after it placed Plaintiff on leave. Specifically\u2014specifically, Defendant claims that when it became aware of the Plaintiff working for another employer in violation of the Defendant\u2019s rule prohibiting unauthorized work while on leave without permission, Defendant would have made the decision to terminate Plaintiffs employment at that point in time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-10\">If Defendant proves by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have made the same decision and would have terminated Plaintiff on January 25, 2008, because it discovered Plaintiff was work<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>ing while on leave, you must limit an award of back pay from the time Plaintiff was placed on leave until January 25, 2008.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-4\">Next, front pay damages under ADA and TDA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-5\">Damages also may be awarded on the ADA and the TDA for what is called front pay. An[] award of front pay compensates Plaintiff for the loss of future wages and employment benefits that have been caused by the Defendant\u2019s discriminatory conduct. The purpose of front pay is to restore Plaintiff to the position he would have been in absent the discrimination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-6\">Therefore, if you find the Defendant would have terminated Plaintiff on January 25, 2008, after it discovered Plaintiff was working while on leave in violation of company policy, you may not award front pay damages. If, however, you decide that Defendant has not proven that it would have terminated Plaintiff on January 25, 2008, then you should consider the issue of front pay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">(Trial Tr. 661-62.)</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">Jones contends that <em>McKennon </em>does not apply in this case because his alleged wrongdoing occurred after Nissan\u2019s adverse action, and only occurred because of it. He stresses that Nissan\u2019s own improper conduct was the necessary precursor to his being forced to find other employment. Nissan counters that <em>McKennon </em>states that it applies even where the employer does not find out about the wrongdoing until (as here) engaging in discovery in a subsequent action by the plaintiff employee for discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-9\">Nissan\u2019s argument does not address the main issue here. It is clear under <em>McKennon </em>that the plaintiff employee is not excused by the fact that the defendant employer did not <em>find out </em>about the employee\u2019s wrongdoing until well after the fact. What is not clear is if <em>McKennon </em>applies to an employee\u2019s wrongdoing that <em>did not occur </em>until after some sort of adverse action was already taken by the employer against the plaintiff employee. Although it appears to be an issue of first impression in this circuit, several courts have addressed, and sharply divided on, whether <em>McKennon\u2019s </em>rule applies to <em>post-termination </em>wrongdoing. <em>See McKenna v. City of Philadelphia, </em>636 F.Supp.2d 446, 459 &amp; n. 4 (E.D.Pa.2009) (collecting cases). Two circuit courts have concluded that post-employment misconduct <em>could </em>be the basis for applying <em>McKennon\u2019s </em>after-acquired evidence defense. <em>See Sellers v. Mineta, </em>358 F.3d 1058, 1064 (8th Cir.2004) (\u201can employee\u2019s post-termination conduct can, in some circumstances, limit an employee\u2019s remedies for a wrongful discharge\u201d); <em>Medlock v. Ortho Biotech, Inc., </em>164 F.3d 545, 555 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 813, 120 S.Ct. 48, 145 L.Ed.2d 42 (1999) (acknowledging \u201cthe possibility that in appropriate circumstances the logic of <em>McKennon </em>may permit certain limitations on relief based on post-termination conduct\u201d but affirming district court\u2019s refusal to give <em>McKennon </em>instruction where alleged misconduct arose \u201cas a direct result of retaliatory termination\u201d); <em>see also McKenna, </em>636 F.Supp.2d at 461 <em>(McKennon\u2019s </em>holding \u201cthat a plaintiffs pre-termination misconduct must be considered in evaluating equitable damages\u201d should be extended to post-termination conduct); <em>Cohen v. Gulfstream Training Acad., Inc., </em>2008 WL 961472 at *3 (S.D.Fla.2008) (unpublished) (noting that the post-temiination conduct \u201cdirectly flows from the conduct that occurred pre-termination\u201d). Other courts have concluded that, because <em>McKennon </em>was premised on an employee-employer relationship, any misconduct occurring outside that relationship falls outside of the reach of the rule. <em>See, e.g., Sigmon v. Parker Chapin Flattau &amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number><em>Klimpl, </em>901 F.Supp. 667, 682-83 (S.D.N.Y.1995); <em>Ryder v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., </em>879 F.Supp. 534, 537-38 (W.D.Pa.1995); <em>Carr v. Woodbury Cnty. Juv. Det. Ctr., </em>905 F.Supp. 619, 627-28 (N.D.Iowa 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">Complicating matters somewhat, Jones\u2019s wrongful conduct does not fit neatly into the post-termination category. Although his violation of Nissan\u2019s procedures did occur after Nissan\u2019s wrongful discrimination against him, Jones was on medical leave and still an employee at the time. Accordingly, the logic of the cases refusing to apply the <em>McKennon </em>rule because of a lack of employment relationship do not apply. However, cases like <em>Medlock </em>and <em>McKenna </em>which allow that the <em>McKennon </em>rule might be applicable, but counsel against applying it to limit recovery where the misconduct can be attributable to the defendant\u2019s prior illegal action are relevant. <em>See Medlock, </em>164 F.3d at 555 (affirming refusal to give <em>McKennon, </em>instruction where alleged misconduct arose \u201cas a direct result of retaliatory discrimination\u201d); <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>McKenna, </em>636 F.Supp.2d at 462 (\u201ca plaintiffs post-termination wrongdoing must not be attributable to the defendant\u2019s conduct\u201d).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">Jones testified that he applied for other jobs without permission because he did not receive a paycheck while on medical leave from Nissan, and he needed to support his family. He also testified that he did not seek prior authorization from Nissan because he already knew what Nissan\u2019s answer would be.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The level of causation in this case is comparable to <em>Medlock, </em>and less attenuated than in <em>McKenna. </em>Were it not for Nissan\u2019s wrongful imposition of medical restrictions rendering Jones medically unfit for any position at Nissan, Jones would not have been in the position of seeking employment without Nissan\u2019s permission, in violation of its rules. Without Nissan\u2019s wrongful conduct, Jones would not have violated any rule. We therefore conclude that it was error to give the <em>McKennon </em>instruction limiting damages.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b431-10\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b431-11\">Accordingly, we REVERSE, direct the district court to enter judgment in Jones\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>favor, and REMAND for a determination/new trial on the issue of damages.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b416-6\">. Ray Coss, Nissan's in-house counsel explained why die company thought the award was excessive: \"... the judge imposed what we thought were unsubstantiated medical restrictions. The judge basically was acting like a doctor, we felt, and gave substantial restrictions, and we think, gave a substantial-\u2014or under workers' comp law he\u2019s allowed to multiply the impairment rating by a certain factor. And he applied a factor that usually corresponded with a no return to work.\u201d (Trial Tr. 346.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b416-17\">. On cross-examination, Jones agreed that he had stated in a previous deposition that \"the judge in the workers\u2019 compensation trial overstated the extent of [his] injury.\u201d (Trial Tr. 543-44.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b416-18\">. Jones\u2019s workers' compensation counsel did not testily at trial. Jones testified that it was his understanding that Nissan had \u201cdropped the appeal before we could have a chance\u201d to ask for clarification.

Dove could not identify the transcript of the court\u2019s statements at trial, and testified that the first time he read the court order was when preparing to be deposed in this suit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b419-6\">. Nissan\u2019s in-house counsel, Coss, testified that the decision to drop Nissan\u2019s appeal in Jones's workers\u2019 compensation case occurred the same day. Jones contends that Nissan dropped its appeal then so that the permanent restrictions that Jones learned about that day would be instantly final. Jones argues that Nissan was concerned that while the appeal was still pending, Jones's counsel could have gone back to the workers\u2019 compensation court, and had the court specify that it did not mean to assign permanent restrictions, thereby undermining the permanent restrictions Nissan had just imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">An exchange between Coss and Jones\u2019s counsel supports this understanding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-8\">Q: Appealing] ... the [chancellor\u2019s] decision would mean and Nissan believed that appealing the judge's decision would mean that the workers\u2019 compensation case was not final, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-12\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-13\">Q: Okay. Nissan felt that if the workers' comp case was not final, then that could impact if the permanent restrictions remained or not, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-14\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-15\">Q: If Nissan continued the appeal, Nissan felt that Mark Jones\u2019 workers\u2019 compensation attorney might try to get the permanent restrictions lifted, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-16\">A: We expected them to do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-17\">Q: You considered that possibility and you decided to drop the appeal, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-18\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-19\">(Trial Tr. 342.) However, Coss later stated that preventing Jones\u2019s counsel from doing anything about the restrictions \u201cwasn\u2019t a consideration\u201d in deciding whether to drop the appeal. (Trial Tr. 353.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"AWq\">. The jury was asked whether Jones had proved by a preponderance of the evidence that he was discriminated against in violation of his rights under the ADA, and the same question with regard to the TDA. The jury answered no to both questions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b421-10\">. The TDA provides, \"There shall be no discrimination in the hiring, firing, and other terms and conditions of employment of ... any private employer ... based solely upon any physical, mental or visual disability of the applicant, ...\u201d Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7 8-50-103(b). The elements of the TDA and the ADA are \"very similar,\u201d thus, a claim brought under the TDA is analyzed \"under the same principles as those utilized for the [ADA].\u201d <em>See Bennett v. Nissan North America, Inc., </em>315 S.W.3d 832, 841-43 (Tenn.Ct.App.2009) (unpublished); <em>Sasser v.

In 2008, the ADA was modified by the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendment Act (\"ADAAA\"), Pub.L. No. 110-325, 122 Stat. 3553. The ADAAA broadened the definition of disability in \u00a7 12102. However, this court has determined that the ADAAA does not apply to pre-amendment conduct, making it inapplicable to this case. <em>See Milholland v. Sumner Cnty. Bd. of Educ., </em>569 F.3d 562, 567 (6th Cir.2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b421-18\">. Tennessee has an equivalent \"regarded as\u201d provision. <em>See </em>Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7 4-21-102(3)(A)(iii).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b422-8\">. Alternatively, the major life activity of \"working\u201d may be at issue here. The definition for \"substantially limits\u201d specific to working is: \"significantly restricted in the ability to perform either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes as compared to the average person having comparable training, skills and abilities.\u201d <em>Wysong, </em>503 F.3d at 451 (6th Cir.2007) (citing 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(j)(3)(i)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b423-7\">. The \"completely unsubstantiated\" label comes from the testimony of Ray Coss, Nissan's in-house counsel, explaining why the company thought the workers\u2019 compensation award was excessive.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b423-8\">. At one point, in the string of e-mails, Dove wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-9\"><em>It is my opinion that his restrictions should be no lifting, no use of power tools, and no use of hand tools. </em>We should move on this ASAP and determine if he is working within those restrictions. I am truly concerned that if his job requires him to perform these tasks he may be in harm[\u2019]s way. Pat, please have Wade review his jobs ASAP to determine if he is exceeding these restrictions imposed by the judge and we will take action from there.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-14\">The implication here is that Dove was actually concerned about Jones\u2019s safety, i.e., that he thought he was actually disabled from the position. Nissan has retreated from that position and has defended the case on the basis that it did not believe Jones was, in fact, disabled from the position, and was simply relying on its interpretation of the chancellor\u2019s order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b426-6\">. As a preliminary matter, it is unclear whether a defendant is entitled to the benefit of the rule beyond the summary judgment stage of the proceedings. <em>See Clay v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., </em>501 F.3d 695, 714 (6th Cir.2007) (\"The honest-belief rule is, in effect, one last opportunity for the defendant to prevail on summary judgment.\u201d). <em>But see Weimer v. Honda of Am. Mfg. Inc., </em>356 Fed.Appx. 812, 817-18 (6th Cir.2009) (district court did not commit reversible error by instructing the jury on honest-belief rule in FMLA case).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b428-5\">. Although our decision that Jones is entitled to judgment as a matter of law renders it unnecessary to reach most of his additional arguments, we nevertheless observe that for the reasons set forth above, the verdict and judgment were against the great weight of the evidence, and were Jones not entitled to a JMOL, he would clearly be entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-12\">Further, the Court's instructions did not fairly present the issue to the jury. The district court instructed the jury that it was obliged to find in Nissan\u2019s favor if it concluded that Nissan honestly believed it was acting as required by the chancellor's ruling and honestly believed that because of that ruling Jones could not perform the essential functions of his job, but refused to give <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>Jones's requested instruction, explaining that an honest belief is one made after a \"reasonably informed and considered decision.\" Thus, that the jury was instructed on the honest-belief rule and ultimately found for Nissan does imply a legitimate conclusion that Nissan is entitled to the benefit of the rule. The jury\u2019s verdict did not contain any particularized finding and the district court\u2019s instructions improperly characterized the rule, completely omitting the important reasonable-reliance-on-particularized-facts requirement that applies in this circuit and ignoring that \u201d[w]hen the employee is able to produce sufficient evidence to establish that the employer failed to make a reasonably informed and considered decision before taking its adverse employment action, thereby making its decisional process 'unworthy of credence,\u2019 then any reliance placed by the employer in such a process cannot be said to be honestly held.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">Moreover, this incomplete instruction coupled with the instruction that \"[a]ll persons who are subject to an order of a court have an obligation to comply and to follow the court\u2019s order\" and \"[a] person subject to a court order may not ignore or violate that order\u201d allowed the jury to infer that the order indeed required Nissan to impose the medical restrictions. Jones objected to the instruction, arguing that because the order did not oblige Nissan to impose the restrictions the instruction would be prejudicial. The court accepted Nissan\u2019s argument that the true meaning of the order did not matter, only Nissan\u2019s understanding of the order. But, in this context, Jones was entitled to have the jury instructed that the order did not, in fact, require that Nissan impose medical restrictions. In the absence of such an instruction the jury was permitted to believe, based on Nissan's in-house attorney\u2019s testimony, that the order actually required that the medical restrictions be imposed. The meaning of the order was not a question of fact. Although Nissan's honest belief might have been had there been adequate evidence to create a genuine issue, surely the true legal significance of the order would be relevant to this issue, especially where Nissan's main actor and witness on this issue was a lawyer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b431-6\">. In <em>Medlock, </em>the plaintiff \"touched and cursed at Defendant's counsel\" at his unemployment compensation benefits hearing. In determining that the \"necessary balancing of equities\u201d cut against a <em>McKennon </em>instruction, the court noted, \"It is not difficult to envision a defendant goading a former employee into losing her temper, only to claim later that certain forms of relief should be unavailable because it would have discharged the plaintiff based on her inability to control her temper.\u201d 164 F.3d at 555.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b431-7\">. The <em>McKenna </em>court found that the plaintiff's use of marijuana and his resulting conviction were sufficiently causally related to the defendant city's discrimination that it would be inequitable to restrict the plaintiff\u2019s back pay as a result of the conviction. As the court put it, \"[h]ad [the plaintiff] not been wrongfully terminated, he would have continued to have been employed by the Philadelphia police department and would have had the insurance and the salary to treat his depression.\u201d The plaintiff had argued that he had never used marijuana until after his firing, and attributed it to the exacerbation of his depression, which he had had to stop treating because he had no medical insurance after being fired. <em>See McKenna, </em>636 F.Supp.2d at 463.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b431-13\">. Jones testified that he did not seek permission from Nissan to accept a position with American Residential Services because \"I knew what their view was going to be.

I knew I wasn't going to be able to find something with them okaying it</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b431-14\">.
