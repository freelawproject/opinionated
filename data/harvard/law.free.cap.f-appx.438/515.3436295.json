On appeal he contends that the district court procedurally erred by (1) not explicitly discussing the factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a); (2) ignoring his arguments in mitigation about his advancing age and cooperation with the government; and (3) presuming that a within-guidelines sentence was reasonable. AVe affirm the judgment, but we emphasize that the court\u2019s articulation of the factors under \u00a7 3553(a) was just enough to meet the procedural requirements of sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">Jones traveled with a companion\u2014an undercover government informant\u2014from Quincy, Illinois to St. Louis, Missouri to purchase crack cocaine. Responding to the informant\u2019s tip, police officers stopped Jones in his vehicle after he crossed the bridge from Missouri to Illinois, and canines alerted officers to the presence of drugs. The informant then turned over 10.7 grams of cocaine base to the officers. Jones later admitted to purchasing crack cocaine from his source in St. Louis. Following his indictment on one count of drug possession with intent to distribute, Jones moved to suppress evidence from the traffic stop and interview. The district court denied the motion, adopting the recommendation of a magistrate judge who found, after an evidentiary hearing, that the police officers had probable cause to stop Jones\u2019s vehicle. The day before trial, Jones pleaded guilty. He later filed two pro se motions to withdraw that plea; the court denied those motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">The district court adopted the probation officer\u2019s calculated guidelines range of 262 to 327 months\u2019 imprisonment (reflecting a base offense level of 32, a two-level increase based on Jones\u2019s career-offender status, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a), and a Category VI criminal history). In doing so, the court noted that the guidelines range is advisory and acknowledged that it could impose a sentence outside the range. The court denied any reduction for acceptance of responsibility based on Jones\u2019s waiting until the eve of trial to plead guilty and later moving to withdraw that plea. Next the court heard the prosecutor\u2019s argument that Jones should receive a 262-month sentence because he had cooperated only partially with the government to help secure convictions against other people. Defense counsel countered that Jones deserved a below-guidelines sentence of 240 months based on his partial cooperation with the government; this cooperation, counsel noted, assisted authorities in gaining at least six other convictions, though counsel acknowledged that Jones \u201cgrew frustrated with the cooperation process\u201d because the government deemed some of his information unhelpful and Jones \u201cdid start to backpedal on his cooperation.\u201d Counsel also argued that Jones\u2019s advancing age\u201451 years\u2014meant he would likely die in prison if sentenced to 262 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-11\">The district court adopted the government\u2019s recommendation and sentenced Jones to 262 months. In doing so, the court stated that a defendant\u2019s cooperation \u201chas to be 100 percent\u201d to be considered a mitigating circumstance, and here defense counsel and the prosecutor had both described Jones\u2019s cooperation as less than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>100 percent. After announcing the sentence, the court twice asked defense counsel whether it had \u201cmissed\u201d anything; counsel replied no. The court then wished Jones \u201cthe best of luck,\u201d remarking that Jones \u201chad quite a record\u201d and \u201ca lot of baggage\u201d as described in the presentence report. In the written statement of reasons, the court listed \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense,\u201d \u201cthe history and characteristics of the defendant,\u201d and \u201cprotection to] the public from further crimes of the defendant\u201d under \u00a7 3553(a) to explain the sentence. The court also noted Jones\u2019s criminal history and conviction for sexual abuse of a minor and wrote that Jones\u2019s \u201chistory and characteristics suggest that he will have great difficulty becoming a productive member of society.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">On appeal Jones raises three procedural challenges to the adequacy of the district court\u2019s explanation at sentencing of the factors under \u00a7 3553(a), but the government asserts that he raises these for the first time on appeal and that they should therefore be reviewed for plain error instead of de novo. The government characterizes these procedural challenges as forfeited because the court after pronouncing the sentence twice directly asked defense counsel whether it had \u201cmissed\u201d anything, and both times counsel said no.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">We are not persuaded by the government\u2019s position in this case. As the Third and Fourth Circuits have recently explained, a party preserves procedural challenges to the district court\u2019s discussion of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors so long as the party at some point during sentencing \u201cdraw[s] arguments from \u00a7 3553 for a sentence different than the one ultimately imposed[.]\u201d <em>United States v. Lynn, </em>592 F.3d 572, 578 (4th Cir.2010); <em>see also United States v. Fumo, </em>655 F.3d 288, 309 (3d Cir.2011); <em>United States v. Powell, </em>650 F.3d 388, 395 (4th Cir.2011); <em>United States v. Boulware, </em>604 F.3d 832, 838 (4th Cir.2010); <em>United States v. Sevilla, </em>541 F.3d 226, 231 (3d Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Grier, </em>475 F.3d 556, 571 &amp; n. 11 (3d Cir.2007) (en banc). <em>But see, e.g., United States v. Davila-Gonzalez, </em>595 F.3d 42, 46-47 (1st Cir.2010); <em>United States v. Villafuerte, </em>502 F.3d 204, 206-09 (2d Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Lopez-Flores, </em>444 F.3d 1218, 1219-21 (10th Cir.2006). \u201cBy drawing arguments from \u00a7 3553 for a sentence different than the one ultimately imposed, an aggrieved party sufficiently alerts the district court of its responsibility to render an individualized explanation addressing those arguments, and thus preserves its claim.\u201d <em>Lynn, </em>592 F.3d at 578. Requiring a party to object to the court\u2019s \u00a7 3553(a) analysis immediately after the sentencing pronouncement, as the government urges, would result primarily in unhelpful \u201cformulaic\u201d objections, <em>Lynn, </em>592 F.3d at 578 (quoting <em>United States v. Castro-Juarez, </em>425 F.3d 430, 433-34 (7th Cir.2005)), and unreasonably burden defendants, who would be expected to promptly assert procedural challenges at the same time they were absorbing the impact of the sentencing pronouncement. In this case, Jones adequately preserved his procedural challenges by raising arguments during the sentencing hearing\u2014but before the court pronounced the sentence\u2014about his cooperation and advancing age (characteristics under \u00a7 3553(a)(1)) and requesting a sentence that was lower than the one he ultimately received. <em>See Lynn, </em>592 F.3d at 577-79; <em>Sevilla, </em>541 F.3d at 231.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">As for Jones\u2019s procedural challenges, he first argues that the district court erred by failing to mention explicitly any factors under \u00a7 3553(a) before pronouncing the sentence. He also contends that the court should have discussed his criminal record\u2014a factor under \u00a7 <em>3553(a)\u2014before </em>sentencing him, rather <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>than presenting it \u201cas justification after-wards.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">But the district court was not required to mention explicitly any factors under \u00a7 3553(a); instead it need only \u201cgive an adequate statement of reasons, <em>consistent with </em>\u00a7 3553(a)\u201d for believing that it was selecting an appropriate sentence. <em>United States v. Baker, </em>655 F.3d 677, 683 (7th Cir.2011) (internal quotation omitted) (emphasis added). Here the court mentioned Jones\u2019s partial cooperation with the government and his extensive criminal record, and the court\u2019s discussion was adequate (though we would have preferred a more detailed discussion) because it imposed a within-guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Harris, </em>567 F.3d 846, 854 (7th Cir.2009). It is irrelevant that the court mentioned Jones\u2019s criminal record just after announcing the sentence; a court must state its reasons \u201cat the time of sentencing,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c), as opposed to during a later proceeding, <em>United States v. Miqbel, </em>444 F.3d 1173, 1179-80 (9th Cir.2006), or solely in a subsequent written statement, <em>United States v. Molina, </em>356 F.3d 269, 277 (2d Cir.2004). Here the court properly stated its reasons at the time of sentencing because it expressly adopted the presentence report\u2019s findings and the record as a whole contained mention\u2014though brief\u2014of factors under \u00a7 3553(a), <em>see United States v. Scott, </em>631 F.3d 401, 409 (7th Cir.2011); <em>cf. United States v. Salem,, </em>597 F.3d 877, 887 (7th Cir.2010). Moreover, the court elaborated upon the sentence in its written statement of reasons, which we read \u201cas an aid to the interpretation of [the judge\u2019s] oral statement,\u201d <em>United States v. Pape, </em>601 F.3d 743, 747 (7th Cir.2010); that statement included details of Jones\u2019s criminal history to justify the sentence under \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">Next Jones argues that the district court erred by not addressing his arguments in mitigation that (1) his partial cooperation assisted the government in securing convictions against several other people and (2) his advanced age\u201451 years\u2014increased the likelihood that he would die in prison if sentenced within the guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">Neither argument has merit. A defendant\u2019s claim that substantial assistance to the government warrants leniency is \u201croutine,\u201d we have observed, and thus a sentencing court may reject that claim with little or no explanation. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>462 F.3d 754, 756 (7th Cir.2006). And at any rate the district court here did not ignore Jones\u2019s argument about the scope of his cooperation. After Jones conceded that he \u201cbackpedal[ed]\u201d on his cooperation, the court stated that cooperation \u201chas to be 100 percent,\u201d noted that Jones\u2019s cooperation was not 100 percent, and accounted for Jones\u2019s partial cooperation by sentencing him to the bottom of the guidelines range. The court, in exercising its discretion, was not required to go below the guidelines range to account for that partial cooperation. <em>See United States v. Arceo, </em>535 F.3d 679, 688 (7th Cir.2008). As for Jones\u2019s argument concerning his advancing age, he never explained why his age justified a below-guidelines sentence (for example, by pointing to poor health), and thus the court was not required to address it. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Nurek, </em>578 F.3d 618, 626 (7th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Lee, </em>454 F.3d 836, 839 (8th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">Jones also argues that the district court erred by presuming that a within-guidelines sentence was reasonable. Jones locates this presumption in the court\u2019s comments at sentencing: \u201cWhat [the prosecutor] has done in the final analysis is say on behalf of the government, you\u2019ve got a bottom line of 262\u201d and \u201c[H]ere we are faced with a minimum of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>262 months in the guidelines range.\u201d He also proposes that this sentencing judge has applied this same presumption in three other cases pending on appeal before us at the time he filed his <em>brief\u2014United States v. Call, </em>No. 11-1543, <em>United States v. Akins, </em>No. 11-1303, and <em>United States v. Pennington, </em>No. 11-1257.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">A sentencing judge may not presume the reasonableness of a within-guidelines sentence, <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 50-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), but here the district court made no such presumption. The court properly exercised its discretion at sentencing because it explicitly stated that the guidelines are advisory, commented about the propriety of a 262-month sentence in the context of noting Jones\u2019s less-than-100 percent cooperation with the government, and adopted the prosecutor\u2019s sentencing recommendation. And Jones\u2019s assessment of a pattern in the court\u2019s sentencing errors is unpersuasive because we recently affirmed the judgments in <em>United States v. Call, </em>426 Fed.Appx. 463, 465-67 (7th Cir.2011) (nonprecedential) and <em>United States v. Akins, </em>427 Fed.Appx. 534, 537-38 (7th Cir.2011) (nonprecedential). (We have not yet ruled in <em>United States v. Pennington, </em>No. 11-1257.)</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
