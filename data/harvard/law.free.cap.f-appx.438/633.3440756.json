The facts are known to the parties and will not be repeated here except to the extent necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on the hostile work environment claim. Peterson failed to raise a triable issue as to whether she was subjected to conduct that was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the terms and conditions of her employment and to create an abusive work environment. <em>See Kortan v. Cal. Youth Auth., </em>217 F.3d 1104, 1110-11 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">The district court also properly granted summary judgment on Peterson\u2019s retaliation claims. Even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that Peterson\u2019s transfer to the fourth floor was an adverse employment action, she failed to show that she had engaged in any protected activity that was linked causally to her transfer. <em>See Clark Cnty. Sch. Dist. v. Breeden, </em>532 U.S. 268, 270-71, 121 S.Ct. 1508, 149 L.Ed.2d 509 (2001) (per curiam). Although Peterson\u2019s termination was an adverse employment action, and she had engaged in protected activity by filing a discrimination charge, she failed to present sufficient evidence of a causal link between these two events. <em>See id. </em>at 273, 121 S.Ct. 1508. Nor did Peterson raise \u201cspecific and substantial\u201d evidence of pretext. <em>Munoz v. Mabus, </em>630 F.3d 856, 865-66 (9th Cir.2010) (quoting <em>Godwin v. Hunt Wesson, Inc., </em>150 F.3d 1217, 1222 (9th Cir.1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b658-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
