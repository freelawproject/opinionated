Schoppert, which denied her application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Yi Mei Liu, </em>No. A099 034 766 (B.I.A. May 27, 2010), <em>aff'g </em>No. A099 034 766 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Sept. 11, 2008). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-21\">Under the circumstances of this case, we have reviewed both the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s opinions \u201cfor the sake of completeness.\u201d <em>Zaman v. Mukasey, </em>514 F.3d 233, 237 (2d Cir.2008) (per curiam). The applicable standards of review are well-established. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Yanqin Weng v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 510, 513 (2d Cir.2009). For applications, such as this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>one, governed by the REAL ID Act of 2005, the agency may, considering the totality of the circumstances, base a credibility finding on an asylum applicant\u2019s demeanor, the plausibility of his account, and inconsistencies in his statements, without regard to whether they go \u201cto the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii); <em>see also Matter of J-Y-C- </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 260, 265 (BIA 2007). Analyzed under the REAL ID Act, the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">In finding Liu not credible, the IJ relied in part on her demeanor, noting that she testified \u201cin a somewhat rote manner,\u201d her testimony \u201cat times ... closely track[ed her] written statement,\u201d and \u201cshe did not ... appear to be testifying from her memory of actual events through which she had lived but, rather, from a script.\u201d Because the IJ was in the best position to observe Liu\u2019s manner while testifying, we accord his demeanor finding particular deference. <em>See Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73-74 (2d Cir.2004), <em>overruled on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296 (2d Cir.2007). Moreover, because the IJ identified other reasons to doubt Liu\u2019s credibility, we may confidently rely on the IJ\u2019s demeanor finding. <em>See Li Hua Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>453 F.3d 99,109 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">In finding Liu not credible, the agency also reasonably relied on the fact that Liu\u2019s testimony before the IJ was inconsistent with her testimony during her credible fear interview. <em>See Diallo v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 624, 632-33 (2d Cir.2006). The summary of Liu\u2019s credible fear interview reflects that her employer accused her of distributing Falun Gong material even though Liu, as a Buddhist, had neither an understanding of, nor an interest in, Falun Gong. She testified, in contrast, that she supported Falun Gong in China by telling people of the benefits of its practice, which resulted in her arrest, detention, and beating by village cadres.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">We have cautioned that when discrepancies arise from an applicant\u2019s statements in an airport or credible fear interview, the agency must closely examine the record of the interview to ensure that it represents a \u201csufficiently accurate record\u201d of the applicant\u2019s statements to merit consideration in determining whether the applicant is credible. <em>Ming Zhang v. Holder, </em>585 F.3d 715, 723-25 (2d Cir.2009); <em>Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 179 (2d Cir.2004). Here, the IJ assessed the probative value of Liu\u2019s credible fear interview, noting that Liu acknowledged that she had testified falsely under oath that she had no interest in Falun Gong. In addition, in her asylum application, Liu expressly conceded the inconsistencies between her original statement and her revised account. Because Liu acknowledged the discrepancy, our concerns regarding the agency\u2019s reliance on the summary of the credible fear interview are ameliorated. <em>See Diallo, </em>445 F.3d at 633 &amp; n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-9\">Although Liu explained that she lied during her credible fear interview because the smuggler instructed her to do so, the agency was not required to credit the explanation. <em>See Yun-Zui Guan v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 391, 397 n. 6, 399 n. 8 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam); <em>Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 80-81 (2d Cir.2005). Accordingly, given the material differences between Liu\u2019s original statement and her testimony, as well as the demeanor finding, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s determination that Liu\u2019s testimony was not credible. <em>See Yun-Zui Guan, </em>432 F.3d at 400.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-10\">The agency further found that even if it accepted Liu\u2019s testimony that she had begun practicing Falun Gong in the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>States, she failed to demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution. We have explained that absent evidence of past persecution \u201can alien must make some showing that authorities in his country of nationality are either aware of his activities or likely to become aware of his activities.\u201d <em>Hongsheng Leng v. Mukasey, </em>528 F.3d 135, 143 (2d Cir.2008) (per curiam). As the IJ noted, Liu testified that she practiced Falun Gong only at home alone and that she would not continue to practice Falun Gong in China. Accordingly, Liu failed to demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution on account of her practice of Falun Gong in the United States. <em>See id. </em>at 142-43. Because the adverse credibility determination is dispositive of Liu\u2019s claim of past persecution, and because she failed to demonstrate a well-founded fear of future persecution, the agency\u2019s denial of asylum and withholding of removal was reasonable. <em>See Delgado v. Mukasey, </em>508 F.3d 702, 705 (2d Cir.2007) (recognizing that the standard for withholding of removal is higher than that for asylum).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
