Glenn now appeals his sentence, contending that the district court did not adequately explain why it rejected his plea for a lower sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-23\">According to Glenn\u2019s presentence investigation report (PSR), his base offense level was 20. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2B3.1(a) (2009). Two levels were added because the property of a federal financial institution was taken. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(l). Three levels were added because Glenn brandished a dangerous weapon. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(E). Glenn\u2019s adjusted offense level was 25. (J.A. vol.2).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-25\">Glenn was a career offender. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 4Bl.l(a). The maximum statutory penalty for armed bank robbery is twenty-five years. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(d). Accordingly, Glenn\u2019s offense level as a career offender <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>was 34. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 4Bl.l(b)(B). Because this was higher than the level calculated under USSG \u00a7 2B3.1, Glenn\u2019s offense level was 34. <em>See id. </em>His criminal history-category was VI. <em>See id. </em>Taking into account the statutory maximum of twenty-five years, Glenn\u2019s advisory Guidelines range was 262-300 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">At sentencing, defense counsel agreed that the calculations in the PSR were correct. The court rejected Glenn\u2019s request that he receive an adjustment based on acceptance of responsibility. Glenn then asked for a below-Guidelines sentence based on his having been a productive member of society who had met his job and family responsibilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">After hearing from Glenn, the court sentenced him to 300 months in prison. In imposing sentence, the court stated that it had considered the advisory Guidelines as well as the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2006) sentencing factors. According to the court, the chosen sentence reflected the seriousness of Glenn\u2019s offense and provided just punishment for that offense. Additionally, the sentence took into account Glenn\u2019s criminal history and the need to protect the public and to deter future criminal conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">We review a sentence for reasonableness, applying an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In conducting our review, we first examine the sentence for \u201csignificant procedural error,\u201d including \u201cfailing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) [2006] factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence .... \u201d <em>Id. </em>In imposing sentence, the district court must provide an \u201cindividualized assessment\u201d based upon the specific facts before it. <em>United States v. Carter, </em>564 F.3d 325, 328 (4th Cir.2009). A sentence within the properly calculated Guidelines range is presumptively reasonable. <em>See United States v. Pauley, </em>511 F.3d 468, 473 (4th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">Assuming that the sentence is procedurally reasonable, we then \u201cconsider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. At this stage, we \u201ctake into account the totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">Here, the district court correctly calculated Glenn\u2019s advisory Guidelines range, performed an individualized assessment of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors as they applied to the case, and stated in open court the reasons for the selected sentence. Glenn\u2019s sentence, which falls within his correctly calculated Guidelines range of 262-300 months, is presumptively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-10\">We reject Glenn\u2019s contention that his sentence is unreasonable because the court did not specifically address his request for a below-Guidelines sentence. \u2018Where a [sentencing] matter is ... conceptually simple ... and the record makes clear that the sentencing court considered the evidence and arguments,\u201d extensive explanation of the sentence is not required. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 359, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Nor is it necessary that the sentencing court address every \u00a7 3553(a) factor on the record, <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 345 (4th Cir.2006), or respond to \u201ceach and every argument for leniency that it rejects in arriving at a reasonable sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Jarrillo-Luna, </em>478 F.3d 1226, 1229 (10th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-11\">We hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing Glenn to 300 months in prison. Accordingly, we affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
