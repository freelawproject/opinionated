Famacion further contends the BIA erred when it declined to address the Immigration Judge (IJ)\u2019s determination that Famacion provided material support to a terrorist organization, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(3)(B)(IV), thus rendering him ineligible for voluntary departure under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(a)(l). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We deny the petition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding against Famacion. The IJ noted several inconsistencies in Famacion\u2019s testimony as to the timeline of his and his wife\u2019s purported persecution and arrival in the United States. In addition, the IJ noted that Famacion became flustered during his testimony, paused at great lengths, and appeared to be at a loss for words. We give the IJ \u201cspecial deference to a credibility determination that is based on demeanor.\u201d <em>Jibril v. Gonzales, </em>423 F.3d 1129, 1137 (9th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). Because Famacion was not credible, his asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT claims were properly denied.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">We decline to address Famacion\u2019s contention that the BIA erred when it failed to address the IJ\u2019s determination that Famacion had provided material support to a terrorist organization. Famacion did not raise this issue in his opening brief to this court. Thus, he has waived it. Absent \u201cmanifest injustice,\u201d we review only issues which \u201care argued specifically and distinctly in a party\u2019s opening brief.\u201d <em>Greenwood v. FAA, </em>28 F.3d 971, 977 (9th Cir.1994). In view of the adverse credibility finding, there is little prospect that his denial as to provision of material support to a terrorist organization would be believed. In any event, no manifest injustice will result from our holding that Famacion waived this issue\u2014which goes only to the IJ\u2019s discretionary withholding of voluntary departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-10\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b646-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.

Moreover, even had Famacion testified credibly, the unfulfilled threats to which he testified do not rise to the level of persecution which would render him eligible for relief. <em>Lim v. INS, </em>224 F.3d 929, 935 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
