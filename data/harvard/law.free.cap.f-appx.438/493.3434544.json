A grand jury charged him with one count each of distributing and possessing child pornography. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(2)(A), (a)(5)(B). He pleaded guilty to both counts, and the district court sentenced him to a total of 210 months\u2019 imprisonment plus a lifetime term of supervised release. Shipley filed a notice of appeal, but his appointed lawyer moves to withdraw on the ground that the appeal is frivolous. <em>See Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Shipley has not responded to counsel\u2019s submission. <em>See </em>Cir. R. 51(b). We confine our review to the potential issues identified in the brief supporting counsel\u2019s motion. <em>See United States v. Schuh, </em>289 F.3d 968, 973-74 (7th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-10\">Shipley has not said that he wishes to challenge his guilty pleas, so counsel properly omits discussion about the adequacy of the plea colloquy or the voluntariness of the pleas. <em>See United States v. Knox, </em>287 F.3d 667, 670-72 (7th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-11\">Counsel first considers whether Shipley could argue that the district court imposed an unduly broad special condition of supervised release by requiring that Shipley</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-13\">submit his person, and any property, house, residence, vehicle, papers, computer, other electronic communications or data storage devices or media, and effects to search at any time, with or without a warrant, by any law enforcement or probation officer with reasonable suspicion concerning a violation of a condition of supervised release or unlawful conduct by the person, and by any probation officer in the lawful discharge of the officer\u2019s supervision functions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-14\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(d). Specifically, counsel questions whether Shipley could argue that this special condition is worded so broadly that it can be read to require him to give his permission to search third-party belongings in his possession but over which he has no authority. Shipley raised this concern to the district court, which concluded that the special condition (the language of which is taken directly from 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(d)) must be interpreted to limit the scope of any search to property belonging to Shipley. Our review of the contention would be for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Angle, 598 </em>F.3d 352, 360 (7th Cir.2010); <em>United States v. Schave, </em>186 F.3d 839, 841 (7th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-15\">Appellate counsel contends that this proposed argument would be frivolous because the district judge, in open court, gave the special condition a narrowing construction to limit its reach to Shipley\u2019s belongings. But the court did not revise the language of the condition to reflect this narrowing construction, though Shipley presumably can seek a correction of the judgment under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 36. As the condition stands, however, we would conclude that any claim about its scope vis-a-vis the possessions of third parties is frivolous. Shipley can consent to a search over any property over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>which he has common authority or joint control. <em>See United States v. Matlock, </em>415 U.S. 164, 170, 94 S.Ct. 988, 39 L.Ed.2d 242 (1974); <em>United States v. James, </em>571 F.3d 707, 714 (7th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">To the extent that a third party might not want Shipley to permit searches of commonly controlled property, the district coui\u2019t\u2019s judgment imposed a standard condition of supervised release requiring that Shipley, at the direction of his probation officer, notify third parties of his criminal record and personal history or permit the probation officer to do so. Yet another condition, moreover, requires in part that Shipley \u201cconsent to third-party disclosure to any employer or potential employer, concerning any computer-related restrictions that may be imposed\u201d and that he \u201cwarn other residents or occupants of his home that computer systems will be subject to inspection by the probation officer\u201d or other authorized contractor. These provisions obviate the concern that Shipley will be asked to authorize searches of property in his possession that belongs exclusively to third parties. In light of these warnings, third parties who permit Shipley to have joint control over their premises or possessions assume the risk that their property will be searched. <em>See Matlock, </em>415 U.S. at 171, 94 S.Ct. 988; <em>James, </em>571 F.3d at 713-14. And, at all events, should the provision later present a problem, Shipley can always seek a modification to the terms of his release. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(2); Fed.R.Crim.P. 32.1(c); <em>United States v. Tejeda, </em>476 F.3d 471, 475 (7th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Counsel also evaluates whether Shipley could challenge his sentencing proceeding but concludes that the claim would be frivolous. Shipley\u2019s total offense level of 34 and criminal history category of III yielded a guidelines imprisonment range of 188 to 235 months. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5A (Sentencing Table). The 210-month imprisonment term he received is just below the midpoint of this range. Counsel identifies neither any procedural defect in the district court\u2019s calculation, nor any reason to doubt the substantive reasonableness of the sentence the district court imposed. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 347, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>United States v. Pape, </em>601 F.3d 743, 746 (7th Cir.2010); <em>United States v. Wallace, </em>531 F.3d 504, 507 (7th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">Finally, Shipley\u2019s lawyer says that ineffective assistance of counsel is a possible ground for appeal. But counsel, who also represented Shipley in the district court, has not characterized any aspect of her performance as deficient, and so we do not have even a potential claim before us. Nor would we have expected counsel to accuse herself of ineffective assistance. <em>United States v. Rezin, </em>322 F.3d 443, 445 (7th Cir.2003); <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>169 F.3d 1049, 1052 (7th Cir.1999). If there is an argument about her performance, that contention is best presented on collateral review, where the record can be further developed. <em>See Massaro v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 504-05, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003); <em>United States v. Harris, </em>394 F.3d 543, 557-58 (7th Cir.2005); <em>Martinez, </em>169 F.3d at 1052.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
