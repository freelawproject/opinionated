Upon de novo review of the record, <em>see Moore ex rel. Moore v. Barnhart, </em>413 F.3d 718, 721 (8th Cir.2005), we conclude (1) that it was proper for the administrative law judge (ALJ) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>not to give controlling weight to the opinions of treating physician Kevin Jackson and one-time consulting psychologist Vann Smith, <em>see Medhaug v. Astrue, </em>578 F.3d 805, 815 (8th Cir.2009) (because record must be evaluated as whole, treating physician\u2019s opinion does not automatically control); <em>Charles v. Barnhart, </em>375 F.3d 777, 783 (8th Cir.2004) (generally when consulting physician examines claimant only once, his opinion is not substantial evidence); and (2) that substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s determination that J.A.J. had less-than-marked limitations in the functional domains of attending and completing tasks and health and physical well-being, <em>see </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.926a (functional equivalence for children). The district court is affirmed. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b550-20\">.
