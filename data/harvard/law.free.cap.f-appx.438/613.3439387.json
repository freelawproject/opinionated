We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We affirm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">Under Arizona law, the tort of negligent misrepresentation requires a plaintiff to prove the defendant misrepresented present facts. <em>See McAlister v. Citibank, </em>171 Ariz. 207, 829 P.2d 1253, 1261 (Ariz.Ct.App.1992). A negligent misrepresentation claim cannot be based upon a promise of future conduct. <em>Id. </em>Here, even if Honeywell misrepresented to Bowman\u2014prior to December 10, 2007\u2014that Bowman <em>would </em>start work at Honeywell on December 10, 2007 if she passed her background check, this purported misrepresentation would have dealt with a promise to hire Honeywell <em>in the future. </em>No reasonable juror could find that the promises made to Bowman dealt with anything other than her future employment. Thus, the district court correctly granted summary judgment to Honeywell on Bowman\u2019s negligent misrepresentation claim.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">Arizona law prohibits an action based on the promissory estoppel theory of liability if there is an express, written contract on the same subject matter. <em>Chanay v. Chittenden, </em>115 Ariz. 32, 563 P.2d 287, 290 (1977). Here, any promises Honeywell made to Bowman dealt with Bowman\u2019s future employment with Honeywell. However, there was an express contract\u2014the employment offer letter-\u2014on the subject matter of Bowman\u2019s future employment. That contract explicitly stated Bowman\u2019s employment was subject to her passing a background investigation. Bowman stated in her deposition that she signed the contract and read and understood all its terms. No reasonable juror could find that there was not an express contract on the subject of Bowman\u2019s future employment. Thus, the district court correctly granted summary judgment to Honeywell on Bowman\u2019s promissory estoppel claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b638-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b638-23\">. Bowman is an Arizona resident; Honeywell is a New Jersey corporation with its principal place of business in New Jersey. Bowman filed suit in Arizona state court; Honeywell removed to federal court pursuant to diversity jurisdiction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b639-7\">. Because the parties are familiar with the facts of the case, we will repeat them here only to the extent necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b639-8\">. The three negligent misrepresentation claims which Bowman brings for the first time on appeal\u20141) that Honeywell negligently represented that Bowman was \"qualified and ready to work\u201d; 2) that Honeywell falsely told Bowman the decision not to hire her had been based on information provided by Hire-Right; and 3) that Honeywell misrepresented Bowman\u2019s right to dispute HireRight\u2019s report\u2014are waived. <em>Whittaker Corp. v. Execuair Corp., </em>953 F.2d 510, 515 (9th Cir.1992). In any event, there is no evidence in the record that any of these statements <em>were </em>false\u2014a required element for a negligent misrepresentation claim under Arizona law. Further, the first statement\u2014that Bowman was \"qualified and ready to work\u201d\u2014was conditioned on a future event; a (to be given) background check.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
