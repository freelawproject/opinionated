Parker also asserts that the district court abused its discretion in denying leave to amend the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-9\">1. The district court properly dismissed Parker\u2019s Sixth Amendment claims. Parker\u2019s conelusory allegation that he \u201csuffered prejudice or substantial detriment\u201d failed to satisfy the requisite pleading standards. <em>See Telesaurus VPC, LLC v. Power, </em>623 F.3d 998, 1003 (9th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-10\">2. In his opposition to the motion to dismiss, Parker alleged that he was prejudiced by the unlawful interrogation because he was forced to accept a plea offer. The district court properly held that Parker\u2019s untimely allegation could not cure the complaint\u2019s defects. <em>See Broam v. Bogan, </em>320 F.3d 1023, 1026 n. 2 (9th Cir.2003) (\u201cIn determining the propriety of a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal, a court <em>may not </em>look beyond the complaint to a plaintiffs moving papers, such as a memorandum in opposition to a defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss.\u201d) (citation omitted) (emphasis in the original). In any event, Parker\u2019s speculative allegation regarding the plea offer is insufficient, as it lacks the requisite facial plausibility. <em>See Caviness v. Horizon Comm. Learning Ctr., Inc., </em>590 F.3d 806, 812 (9th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-14\">3. Because Parker failed to sufficiently allege a Sixth Amendment violation, the district court properly dismissed Parker\u2019s related conspiracy claim. <em>See San Diego Police Officers\u2019 Ass\u2019n v. San Diego City Employees\u2019 Retirement Sys., </em>568 F.3d 725, 740 (9th Cir.2009) (\u201c[T]he absence of any actionable constitutional violation negates by definition the existence of a conspiracy to violate constitutional rights.\u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-15\">4. The district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Parker\u2019s claims without leave to amend, as \u201cother facts consistent with the challenged pleading could not possibly cure the deficiency.\u201d <em>Abagninin v. AMVAC Chem. Corp., </em>545 F.3d 733, 742 (9th Cir.2008) (citation omitted). Parker\u2019s counsel also informed the district court that there was nothing to be gained by further amendments. <em>See Krainski v. Nev. ex rel. Bd. of Regents of Nev. Sys. of Higher Educ., </em>616 F.3d 963, 972 (9th Cir.2010) (\u201cHere, [Parker] conceded that there were no new facts that [he] would include in [his] complaint to overcome its shortcomings. Under the circumstances ... the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying [Par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>ker] leave to amend [his] complaint.\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ArD\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b667-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b668-15\">. Parker did not challenge in his opening brief the district court's rulings in favor of Thomas Allman, Mendocino County Sheriff\u2019s Office, and the County of Mendocino. As a result, Parker has waived any challenges to those rulings. <em>See Cook v. AVI Casino Enter., Inc., </em>548 F.3d 718, 726 n. 6 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
