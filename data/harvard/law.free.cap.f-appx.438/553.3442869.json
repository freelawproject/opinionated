Zarce\u00f1o alleges persecution by the Salvadoran \u201cMara 18\u201d gang. He alleges that he was targeted by the gang because he is a lawyer and he refused to represent members of the gang in criminal matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-15\">We review a denial of asylum by the BIA for substantial evidence. <em>Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1184-85 (9th Cir.2006). This means that \u201cunless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B), we must affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-16\">Even if we assume that lawyers who refuse to represent gang members are a particular social group as contemplated by the asylum laws, and even if we assume that Mara 18 was a state actor or could not be controlled by state authorities, there was sufficient evidence for the BIA to conclude that Zarce\u00f1o was not persecuted on account of his membership in a particular social group. At his asylum hearing, Zarce\u00f1o testified that he was approached by the gang for money. When asked by. the government\u2019s lawyer why he was targeted, Zarce\u00f1o responded, \u201cIt was not for political motivations, it was for monetary motivation. They thought because I\u2019m a lawyer that I have money.\u201d This was sufficient for the BIA to conclude that Zarce\u00f1o was not persecuted on account of a protected ground. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481-82, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). For similar reasons, this was sufficient for the BIA to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>deny Zarceno\u2019s application for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">As Zarce\u00f1o provides no argument on appeal why the BIA\u2019s denial of protection under CAT was in err, we do not address his CAT claim. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259 (9th Cir.1996) (\u201cIssues raised in a brief that are not supported by argument are deemed abandoned.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b578-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
