Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen. <em>Sembir</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number><em>ing v. Gonzales, </em>499 F.3d 981, 985 (9th Cir.2007). We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">The agency did not abuse its discretion in denying Wang\u2019s motion to reopen where she failed to overcome the presumption of effective delivery of her notice of hearing, <em>see id. </em>at 986-88, and failed to establish that the alleged ineffective assistance of an immigration consultant constituted an exceptional circumstance warranting rescission of her in absentia removal order, <em>see Monjaraz-Munoz v. INS, </em>327 F.3d 892, 896 (9th Cir.2003) (petitioner must show the alleged ineffective assistance was the cause of her failure to appear for her hearing).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">We lack jurisdiction to consider Wang\u2019s contention that she received ineffective assistance of counsel from the attorney who prepared her motion to reopen and her BIA appeal because she failed to exhaust this contention before the BIA. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 677-78 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">Wang\u2019s remaining contentions are unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b661-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
