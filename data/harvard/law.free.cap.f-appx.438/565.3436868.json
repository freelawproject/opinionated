R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b590-10\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b590-11\">Arthur Ashley appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas petition, which the district court found untimely under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-12\">We granted a certificate of appealability (COA) on two issues: (1) whether the district court was correct in concluding that Ashley\u2019s conviction was \u201cfinal\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A) at the time the appellate court entered its formal judgment, and (2) whether Ashley was entitled to equitable tolling due to his hernia condition. Because neither party argues on appeal that the district court erred in determining when Ashley\u2019s conviction was \u201cfinal\u201d under \u00a7 2244, and because the statute of limitations is not jurisdictional, <em>see Day v. </em>McDonough, 547 U.S. 198, 205, 126 S. Ct. 1675, 164 L.Ed.2d 376 (2006), we decline to consider the first certified issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-14\">We reject Ashley\u2019s argument that he was entitled to equitable tolling due to his hernia, because nothing in the record suggests that his condition was an \u201cimpairment so severe that ... [it] made it impossible under the totality of the circumstances to meet the filing deadline despite petitioner\u2019s diligence.\u201d <em>Bills v. Clark, </em>628 F.3d 1092, 1093 (9th Cir.2010). The district court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to hold an evidentiary hearing. <em>See Roberts v. Marshall, </em>627 F.3d 768, 773 (9th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-19\">Ashley raises three uncertified issues, which we construe as a motion to expand the COA, and deny. <em>See </em>9th Cir. R. 22-1(e). Ashley has not made a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right\u201d with respect to any of the uncertified issues. <em>Hiivala v. Wood, </em>195 F.3d 1098, 1104 (9th Cir.1999) (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2)) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b590-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
