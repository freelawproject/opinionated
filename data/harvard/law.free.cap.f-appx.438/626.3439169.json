R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b652-13\"> The Honorable Lawrence L. Piersol, Senior United States District Judge for the District of South Dakota, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b652-11\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>***</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b652-12\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in bifurcating the trial into a statute of limitations phase and a liability phase because the statute of limitations issue was dispositive, <em>see Exxon Co. v. Sofec, Inc., </em>54 F.3d 570, 575 (9th Cir.1995); <em>see also </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 42(b), and the issues associated with the equitable estoppel and liability claims were not so interwoven as render bifurcation inappropriate, <em>see Hilao v. Estate of Marcos, </em>103 F.3d 767, 782 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-17\">The district court did not improperly exclude evidence regarding the fourth surveillance tape or the white car. The Gomezes never offered the fourth surveillance video for admission into evidence. Any error in excluding evidence regarding Officer Maitlen\u2019s alleged fabrication of a story about a driver of a white car was harmless as to the Gomezes\u2019 equitable estoppel claim, because there was no evidence that the Gomezes were aware of this incident, and so they could not have relied on Officer Maitlen\u2019s alleged misrepresentation. <em>See Guerrero v. Gates, </em>442 F.3d 697, 706-07 (9th Cir.2006); <em>Santa Maria v. Pac. Bell, </em>202 F.3d 1170, 1176 (9th Cir.2000). The exclusion of the \u201cwhite car\u201d evidence was also harmless as to the Gomezes\u2019 imputed concealment claim (i.e., the claim that Officer Maitlen\u2019s alleged intent to defraud the Gomezes by proffering the white car story should be imputed to the police department), because the Gomezes offered no evidence of collusion between Maitlen and the police department on this issue. <em>Cf. Riddell v. Riddell Wash. Corp., 866 </em>F.2d 1480, 1493 (D.C.Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-18\">Although the district court erred in failing to instruct the jury that \u201cthe plaintiffs actual and reasonable reliance on the defendant\u2019s conduct or representations\u201d is one factor in a finding of equitable estop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>pel, <em>Santa Maria, </em>202 F.3d at 1176, the error was harmless because the Gomezes failed to offer evidence that they relied on the police report or that the attorneys whom they consulted declined to take the case because of the police report, <em>see Snyder v. Freight, Constr., Gen. Drivers, Warehousemen &amp; Helpers, Local No. 287, </em>175 F.3d 680, 688 n. 12 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">The district court did not err in failing to define the word \u201cprevent,\u201d because it is a \u201c\u2018common term[] that [is] readily understandable to the jury,\u2019 \u201d <em>see United States v. Somsamouth, </em>352 F.3d 1271, 1275 (9th Cir.2003) (quoting <em>United States v. Shryock, </em>342 F.3d 948, 986 (9th Cir.2003)), and any ambiguity regarding the intent requirement was clarified earlier in the jury instructions, <em>see Guebara v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>237 F.3d 987, 992 (9th Cir.2001). Finally, although the district court erred in instructing the jury that, in order to impose liability on the City, the Gomezes were required to prove that an individual city official or employee was liable for any fraudulent concealment pursuant to a \u201cpolicy, custom, or longstanding practice,\u201d such error was harmless because the verdict form indicates that the jury did not find that any of the individual defendants were liable. The Gomezes waived their claim that including the names of police officers who were not defendants on the verdict form was an error because they failed to offer or develop any argument regarding this claim in their opening brief. <em>United States v. Kama, </em>394 F.3d 1236, 1238 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">The district judge\u2019s questioning of witnesses and the judge\u2019s allegedly improper gestures and expressions at trial did not deprive the Gomezes of a fair trial. The district judge\u2019s questioning of witnesses was not improper and appears to have been for the purpose of clarifying each witness\u2019s testimony, <em>see United States v. Mostella, </em>802 F.2d 358, 361 (9th Cir.1986), and there is no evidence in the record that the district judge\u2019s expressions or gestures overstepped propriety, <em>see Larson v. Palmateer, </em>515 F.3d 1057, 1067 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b652-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
