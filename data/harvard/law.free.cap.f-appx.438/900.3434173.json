A party seeking a writ bears the burden of proving that it has no other means of obtaining the relief desired, <em>Mallard v. U.S. Dist. Court, </em>490 U.S. 296, 309, 109 S.Ct. 1814, 104 L.Ed.2d 318 (1989), and that the right to issuance of the writ is \u201cclear and indisputable,\u201d <em>Allied Chem. Corp. v. Daiflon, Inc., </em>449 U.S. 33, 35, 101 S.Ct. 188, 66 L.Ed.2d 193 (1980). To the extent that Wickliffe seeks from us an order directing the Court of Federal Claims to take any action concerning discovery, etc., Wickliffe has not shown that he has no other means of obtaining the relief desired, because he has not shown that he cannot request the relief on appeal from any final judgment. To the extent that Wickliffe seeks from us an order directing the District of Columbia Circuit to take an action, we do not have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>jurisdiction to review that court\u2019s decisions and thus we dismiss his \u201calternative writ.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">It Is Ordered That:</p>\n<p id=\"b925-7\">The petition for a writ of mandamus is denied. The \u201calternative writ\u201d is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
