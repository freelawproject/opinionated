The district court sentenced him to 46 months in prison, within the advisory sentencing guidelines range of 46 to 57 months. Garcia challenges the substantive reasonableness of his sentence, arguing that his sentencing range was greater than necessary to meet 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s goals of providing just punishment, that it overstated the seriousness of his offense, and that it failed to take into account mitigating factors. Specifically, Garcia argues that his offense of reentry was \u201cat bottom, an international trespass.\u201d He continues that \u00a7 2L1.2 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines places heavy emphasis on a pri- or conviction, counting it for both criminal history and the 16-level enhancement. He also argues that his reasons for reentry into and remaining in the United States mitigate the seriousness of his offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-24\">We review sentences for reasonableness, employing a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard, and we presume that a sentence within a properly calculated guidelines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>range is reasonable. <em>See Gall v. United States, 552 </em>U.S. 38, 49-50, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 1930, 176 L.Ed.2d 397 (2010). The purported double-counting and lack of empirical basis for \u00a7 2L1.2 do not necessarily render a within-guidelines sentence unreasonable. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009). We likewise see no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s rejection of Garcia\u2019s contention that illegal reentry\u2014a federal felony carrying significant criminal penalties\u2014is merely an international trespass, nor do we discern any improper weighing of the other factors cited by Garcia, including his personal history and characteristics. <em>See Cooks, </em>589 F.3d at 186. The district court considered Garcia\u2019s arguments, the facts of the case, and the appropriate statutory sentencing factors before concluding that a within-guidelines sentence was appropriate. That determination is owed deference, and Garcia\u2019s disagreement with the district court\u2019s assessment of those factors is insufficient to rebut the presumption that the sentence is reasonable. <em>See United States v. Ruiz, </em>621 F.3d 390, 398 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">Additionally, as Garcia concedes, his argument that the lack of a \u201cfast-track\u201d disposition program in the Western District of Texas creates an unwarranted sentencing disparity is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 562-64 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b329-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
