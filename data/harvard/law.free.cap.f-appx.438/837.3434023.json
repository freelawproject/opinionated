In his Complaint, Alford contended his constitutional rights were violated when his employment with the Consolidated Government of Columbus, Georgia, was terminated for allegedly viewing pornographic and obscene materials at work, while other municipal employees were not disciplined for similar conduct. Alford asserts several issues on appeal, which we address in turn. The Appellees have moved for sanctions against Alford and his attorney for pursuing a frivolous appeal. After review,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-9\">Alford initially contends the district court erred in failing to properly review his claim for a violation of procedural due process. Specifically, he asserts the court\u2019s procedural due process analysis only addressed the number of members of the Columbus Personnel Review Board present at his post-termination hearing, and not the additional allegations or issues identified in his counseled Complaint under the rubric of his substantive due process claim. Relying on our decision in <em>McKinney v. Pate, </em>20 F.3d 1550 (11th Cir.1994), Alford maintains the district court was obliged to review all allegations of due process issues, including those made in connection with his substantive due process claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-12\">Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2), a complaint must contain \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief, in order to give the defendant fail-notice of what the claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.\u201d <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007) (quotations and ellipses omitted). Although a complaint attacked under Rule 12(b)(6) does not need detailed factual allegations, a plaintiffs obligation to provide the grounds of his entitlement to relief requires sufficient allegations to raise a right to relief above the speculative level. <em>Id. </em>(quotations and alterations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-13\">Federal courts generally abide by the \u201cprinciple of party presentation,\u201d relying \u201con the parties to frame the issues for decision and assign to courts the role of neutral arbiter of matters the parties present.\u201d <em>Greenlaw v. United States, </em>554 U.S. 237, 243, 128 S.Ct. 2559, 171 L.Ed.2d 399 (2008). As the Supreme Court has emphasized, \u201cour adversary system is designed around the premise that the parties know what is best for them, and are responsible for advancing the facts and arguments entitling them to relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To the extent that courts have varied from this general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>principle, they usually have done so in order to protect the rights of <em>pro se </em>litigants. <em>Id. </em>at 244-45, 128 S.Ct. 2559. Even so, while <em>pro se </em>pleadings are liberally construed, \u201cthis leniency does not give a court license to serve as <em>de facto </em>counsel for a party or to rewrite an otherwise deficient pleading in order to sustain an action.\u201d <em>GJR Investments, Inc. v. Cnty. of Escambia, Fla., </em>132 F.3d 1359, 1369 (11th Cir.1998) (internal citation omitted), <em>overruled on other grounds as recognized in Randall v. Scott, </em>610 F.3d 701, 706 (11th Cir.2010). This principle is particularly true where a party is represented by counsel, who does not enjoy the leniency afforded <em>pro se </em>litigants. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">Pursuant to Rule 8(a)(2), as well as the general principle of party representation, Alford and his attorney were obligated to set forth the specific grounds supporting the procedural due process claim in order to give the defendants fair notice of the nature of that claim. To the extent that Alford intended to raise a procedural due process claim that transcended the adequacy of the number of Board members present at his post-termination hearing, his Complaint failed to indicate or provide fair notice of this fact. Moreover, particularly as Alford was represented by counsel, the district court was not required to liberally construe the procedural due process claim raised in his Complaint to encompass those allegations raised solely in connection with his distinct substantive due process claim. Contrary to Alford\u2019s suggestion, our decision in <em>McKinney v. Pate </em>does not dictate a different conclusion or absolve him and his attorney of an obligation to set forth the specific grounds upon which the procedural due process claim rested. Accordingly, the district court did not err in limiting its consideration of the procedural due process claim to the specific grounds raised in Alford\u2019s counseled Complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">Alford next asserts the district court erroneously concluded the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Engquist v. Oregon Department of Agriculture, </em>553 U.S. 591, 128 S.Ct. 2146, 170 L.Ed.2d 975 (2008), precluded his equal protection claim. Specifically, he maintains <em>Engquist\u2019s </em>prohibition against class-of-one equal protection claims in the public employment context is limited to at-will employees, and does not extend to merit system or civil service employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-8\">The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment generally requires government entities to treat similarly situated individuals alike. <em>Campbell v. Rainbow City, Ala., </em>434 F.3d 1306, 1313 (11th Cir.2006). In a traditional employment case brought under the Equal Protection Clause, an employee asserts that he was discriminated against on account of his membership in an identifiable or protected class, such as race, religion, sex, or national origin. <em>See Engquist, </em>553 U.S. at 594-95, 128 S.Ct. 2146; <em>Sweet v. Sec\u2019y Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>467 F.3d 1311, 1318-1319 (11th Cir.2006) (noting a plaintiff typically must allege that he was treated differently \u201cbased on race, religion, national origin, or some other constitutionally protected basis\u201d to establish an equal protection claim). In a \u201cclass of one\u201d equal protection claim, however, a plaintiff does not allege discrimination against a protected class or on account of membership in a particular group, but rather, asserts that he has been treated differently from others similarly situated for arbitrary or irrational reasons. <em>See Engquist, </em>553 U.S. at 595-97, 128 S.Ct. 2146; <em>Leib v. Hillsborough Cnty. Pub. Transp. Comm\u2019n, </em>558 F.3d 1301, 1306 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-9\">In <em>Engquist, </em>a state employee alleged she had been effectively laid off for \u201carbi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>trary, vindictive, and malicious reasons.\u201d 553 U.S. at 594-95, 128 S.Ct. 2146. Without qualification or expressed limitation, the Supreme Court broadly held \u201csuch a \u2018class-of-one\u2019 theory of equal protection has no place in the public employment context.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 594, 128 S.Ct. 2146. The Court concluded that, while \u201cthe Equal Protection Clause is implicated when the government makes class-based decisions in the employment context, treating distinct groups of individuals categorically differently,\u201d it has no application when \u201cgovernment employers are alleged to have made an individualized, subjective personnel decision in a seemingly arbitrary or irrational manner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 605, 128 S.Ct. 2146. Although the Supreme Court stated a class-of-one theory of equal protection is contrary to the concept of at-will employment, the Supreme Court further reasoned \u201ca government\u2019s decision to limit the ability of public employers to fire at will is an act of legislative grace, not constitutional mandate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 606-07, 128 S.Ct. 2146.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">Alford\u2019s attempt to limit <em>Engquist </em>to at-will public employees is not supported by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision. <em>Engquist </em>holds that class-of-one equal protection claims are categorically prohibited in the public employment context, regardless of whether the aggrieved employee is an at-will employee or subject to statutory protection from wrongful discharge. Moreover, the district court correctly construed Alford\u2019s equal protection claim as resting on a class-of-one theory. Although Alford insisted that he was a member of the class of merit system employees, he did not suggest that he was treated differently on account of his membership in this particular group, or allege that similarly situated employees outside the class of merit system employees were treated more favorably. To the contrary, his contention was that he was arbitrarily treated differently than other municipal employees. Accordingly, the district court properly concluded that Alford\u2019s class-of-one equal protection claim was foreclosed under <em>Engquist.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-8\">The Appellees seek sanctions against Alford and his counsel, in the form of attorneys\u2019 fees, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> They maintain that opposing counsel, Ron Iddins, has knowingly and recklessly pursued frivolous claims on appeal that unreasonably multiplied the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-9\">Pursuant to \u00a7 1927, federal courts, including courts of appeals, may require any attorney \u201cwho so multiplies the proceedings in any case unreasonably and vexatiously ... to satisfy personally the excess costs, expenses, and attorneys\u2019 fees reasonably incurred because of such conduct.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927; <em>see also Reynolds v. Roberts, </em>207 F.3d 1288, 1302 (11th Cir.2000) (concluding courts of appeals have authority to award fees and costs under \u00a7 1927). To justify an award of sanctions under \u00a7 1927, \u201can attorney must engage in unreasonable and vexatious conduct; this conduct must multiply the proceedings; and the amount of the sanction cannot exceed the costs occasioned by the objectionable conduct.\u201d <em>Peer v. Lewis, </em>606 F.3d 1306, 1314 (11th Cir.2010) (quotations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>omitted). \u201cAn attorney multiplies the proceedings unreasonably and vexatiously only when the attorney\u2019s conduct is so egregious that it is tantamount to bad faith.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted). The standard is an objective one, turning on how a reasonable attorney would have acted under the circumstances rather than on the particular attorney\u2019s subjective intent. <em>Norelus v. Denny\u2019s Inc., </em>628 F.3d 1270, 1282 (11th Cir.2010). A bad faith determination is warranted where an attorney knowingly or recklessly pursues a frivolous claim. <em>Amlong &amp; Amlong, P.A. v. Denny\u2019s Inc., </em>500 F.3d 1230, 1242 (11th Cir.2007). Something more than a lack of merit or negligent conduct is needed to support the imposition of sanctions under \u00a7 1927. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">As previously stated, counsel\u2019s contentions on appeal are wholly unsupported by existing law. The challenge to the district court\u2019s construction of Alford\u2019s procedural due process claim plainly conflicts with both the requirements of Rule 8(a)(2) and the general principle of party presentation upon which our adversary system is based, effectively seeking to absolve counsel of his own shortcomings in drafting Alford\u2019s Complaint. Moreover, counsel\u2019s attempt to limit the holding of <em>Engquist </em>is at least equally frivolous, unsupported by the decision itself and other caselaw. Despite being previously admonished and sanctioned by the district court for ignoring the clear holding of <em>Engquist, </em>counsel has insisted on pursuing an identical claim on appeal. Under the circumstances, counsel has multiplied the proceedings by pursuing frivolous claims in an objectively reckless manner. We therefore grant the Appellees\u2019 motion for sanctions to the extent that it relies on \u00a7 1927, and remand this case to the district court for the limited purpose of determining the amount of attorneys\u2019 fees reasonably incurred by the appellees in litigating this appeal and to assess that amount solely against the appellant\u2019s attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6), AWARD SANCTIONS to the appellees pursuant to \u00a7 1927, and REMAND the case to the district court to determine and assess a reasonable amount of attorneys\u2019 fees for the defense of this appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b862-10\">. We review <em>de novo </em>the grant of a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim, accepting the factual allegations in the complaint as true and construing them in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Edwards v. Prime, Inc., </em>602 F.3d 1276, 1291 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b864-5\">. The Appellees also seek sanctions under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 38, and have filed a corresponding motion for authorization to file an out-of-time request for Rule 38 sanctions. By separate order, we deny the appellees' motion to seek Rule 38 sanctions out of time, as they have failed to demonstrate a sufficient basis for excusing their failure to comply with the applicable deadline. <em>See </em>11th Cir. R. 38-1 (\u201cMotions for damages and costs pursuant to FRAP 38 must be filed no later than the filing of appellee\u2019s brief.\u2019\u2019). We also deny their motion for sanctions to the extent that it relies on Rule 38 as untimely.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
