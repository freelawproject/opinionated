Nelson denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Mengquan Zhao, </em>No. A099 679 936 (B.I.A. July 19, 2010), <em>aff'g </em>No. A099 679 936 (Immig. Ct. N.Y.C. Sept. 24, 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">Zhao\u2019s requests for relief are based on the claims that his wife had been forcibly aborted, that he and his wife had been forced to pay a fine for her unauthorized pregnancy, and that he feared he would be persecuted if returned to China as a result of their violation of China\u2019s family planning policy. Certified Administrative Record (\u201cCAR\u201d) at 221-34. The IJ found that Zhao was not credible, pointing to inconsistencies between Zhao\u2019s testimony and his written statement as well as inconsistencies between two letters from Zhao\u2019s wife, noting that it appeared that Zhao changed his story to reflect \u201cother resistance\u201d after this court clarified that an applicant is not eligible for asylum based on the forced abortion of his spouse. <em>Id. </em>at 72-75 (citing <em>Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296 (2d Cir.2007)). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the additional underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">Contending that Zhao\u2019s petition is frivolous, Respondent moved for summary denial of the petition. This court may \u201cdismiss [a] ... petition for review as frivolous when the ... petition presents no arguably meritorious issue for [ ] consideration.\u201d <em>Pillay v. INS, </em>45 F.3d 14, 17 (2d Cir.1995). Accordingly, we treat this motion as one for summary dismissal. Summary action is, however, \u201ca rare exception to the completion of the appeal process[,] ... available only if an appeal is truly \u2018frivolous.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Davis, </em>598 F.3d 10, 13 (2d Cir.2010) (distinguishing between an easy case for which the outcome \u201cseems obvious\u201d and a frivolous case that is \u201cinarguable or fanciful\u201d); <em>accord Love v. McCray, </em>413 F.3d 192, 194 (2d Cir.2005). A petition is frivolous if it lacks an arguable basis in law or fact such that it presents an \u201cindisputably meritless legal theory\u201d or \u201cfactual contentions [that] are clearly baseless.\u201d <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 327, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989); <em>see also Der-Rong Chour v. INS, </em>578 F.2d 464, 468 (2d Cir.1978) (granting summary denial where the petition raised no \u201ccolorable legal or factual basis for the relief sought\u201d); <em>Pillay, </em>45 F.3d at 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-9\">Zhao\u2019s argument\u2014that the IJ erred in finding him incredible\u2014is comfortably within the range of arguments we entertain in typical immigration proceedings. Were we to agree with him that the IJ erred, he would be entitled to have his case remanded for reconsideration. This makes his legal theory not \u201cindisputably meritless.\u201d Indeed, this case is precisely the type in which the outcome \u201cseems obvious\u201d but the arguments are not \u201cfanciful.\u201d Therefore, summary dismissal is inappropriate here. Respondent\u2019s motion is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-10\">Because both parties have submitted briefs dealing with the merits of Zhao\u2019s petition, however, in the interests of judicial economy, we see fit to dispose of the petition on its merits now. Under the circumstances of this case, we consider both the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s opinions \u201cfor the sake of completeness.\u201d <em>Zaman v. Mukasey, </em>514 F.3d 233, 237 (2d Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). The applicable standards of review are well established. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Corovic v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 90, 95 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>(2d Cir.2008). Zhao\u2019s application is governed by the REAL ID Act, and so the agency may base a credibility finding on an asylum applicant\u2019s demeanor, the plausibility of his or her account, and inconsistencies in his or her statements, without regard to whether they go \u201cto the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">We \u201cdefer ... to an IJ\u2019s credibility determination unless, from the totality of the circumstances, it is plain that no reasonable fact-finder could make such an adverse credibility ruling.\u201d <em>Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 167 (2d Cir.2008). Given the omissions in Zhao\u2019s written application and in the letter submitted by his wife, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(C) (cross-referencing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii)). Nothing Zhao presents in his petition compels reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">Because Zhao\u2019s claims all were based on the same factual predicate, the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination constitutes a proper basis for the denial of his withholding of removal and CAT claims as well. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 523 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
