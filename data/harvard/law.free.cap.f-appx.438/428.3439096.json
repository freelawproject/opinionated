Pursuant to the United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6), the district court applied a four-point enhancement to Wagers\u2019 base-level offense of felon-in-possession after finding the Appellant\u2019s brandishing of the weapon exhibited wanton endangerment under Kentucky Revised Statute (\u201cKRS\u201d) \u00a7 508.060.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Wagers continues to justify his action as self-defense. The government contends, as it did during the sentencing hearing, that Wa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>gers may not avail himself of a claim of self-defense in justifying wielding a loaded shotgun unless he reasonably believed \u201cthat such force [was] necessary to protect himself against death [or] serious physical injury.\u201d KRS \u00a7 503.050(2).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">For the reasons set forth below, we find the district court did not err in the application of the sentencing enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">The evidence indicates that on 15 April 2008, Harold Wagers learned that Shawn Wombles (\u201cWombles\u201d) was responsible for shooting into the dashboard of the Appellant\u2019s vehicle. That evening, after drinking and playing poker together, Wagers, Wombles, and a third, unidentified, individual came to blows over the dashboard incident. During the fight Wombles struck Wagers several times with the butt-end of a handgun, while the third individual struck Wagers using the stock of a loaded shotgun. In the ensuing struggle, Wagers managed to wrest the loaded shotgun from the unidentified assailant and to flee the scene with the weapon in hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">Wagers made his way to a telephone and notified his companion, Nicole Henson, that he needed to be taken to the hospital for treatment. Henson picked up Wagers and together, with the couple\u2019s two young children also in the car, the foursome stopped at a convenience store to refuel for the trip to the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">While at the convenience store, a vehicle with Wagers\u2019 two assailants pulled up and parked next to Appellant\u2019s car. At the evidentiary hearing held by the district court prior to sentencing, Wagers testified that his assailant, Wombles, said, \u201cThere\u2019s that son-of-a-\u2018you-know-what,\u2019 \u201d and \u201cwe\u2019re going to kill you and your whole family.\u201d Wagers then pulled from his car the loaded shotgun he had been struck -with earlier in the evening and pointed it at his two former assailants. Wagers testified that he told the two men he would shoot them if they pulled a weapon, and that he was going to protect his children. Wagers also admitted that he was intoxicated, that he did not see a weapon on either man, and that the men did not mention weapons when they threatened him.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-14\">As this event unfolded, a Manchester City Police Officer pulled into the parking lot of the convenience store. The officer testified at the evidentiary hearing that he witnessed Wagers\u2019 two assailants moving away from Appellant. The officer also explained that the shotgun held by Wagers was pointed in such a manner as to place the convenience store clerks in the line of fire. The officer testified that he ordered Wagers to drop the shotgun. While Wagers claimed he gave the gun up immediately, the officer testified he ordered Wagers to drop the weapon \u201cseven or eight times\u201d before he complied. The officer testified that Wagers was intoxicated and that he found no weapons of any sort either on Wagers\u2019 assailants or in their vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>After the evidentiary hearing on Harold Wagers\u2019 objection to the application of the four-point Sentencing Guidelines enhancement the district court detei\u2019mined by a preponderance of the evidence that \u201cthere were repeated attempts to get the defendant to drop the firearm.\u201d The district court overruled Mr. Wagers\u2019 objection to the enhancement and imposed a sentence of 120 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">II. Law &amp; Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">This court reviews a sentencing decision for procedural and substantive reasonableness. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The former includes review for \u201cprocedural error in the calculation of the guideline range[.]\u201d <em>United States v. Bartee, 529 </em>F.3d 357, 358 (6th Cir.2008). Although we review factual determinations made during sentencing for clear error, <em>United States v. Webb, </em>616 F.3d 605, 609 (6th Cir.2010), we review legal conclusions regarding the application of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo, United States v. Hover, </em>293 F.3d 930, 933 (6th Cir.2002). The Sentencing Guidelines instruct a court to increase a defendant\u2019s base offense level by four points \u201c[i]f the defendant used or possessed any firearm or ammunition in connection with another felony offense[.]\u201d USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6). Thus, we review <em>de novo </em>the question of whether a four-point enhancement was appropriate under USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) given the facts in this case. <em>See United States v. McKenzie, </em>410 Fed.Appx. 943, 944-45 (6th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">B. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">Harold Wagers argues that the district court erred in applying a four-point enhancement under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) of the Sentencing Guidelines. That enhancement is appropriate if the district court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant \u201cused or possessed [a] firearm ... in connection with another felony offense!;.]\u201d USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6); <em>United States v. Gates, </em>461 F.3d 703, 708 (6th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">Wagers maintains the application of the enhancement was not appropriate because he propounded a viable defense. The Appellant contends he was justified in pointing the loaded shotgun at his former assailants after they verbally threatened him and his family in the parking lot of the convenience store. On appeal, Wagers urges the Court to remand the sentence for removal of the enhancement in light of the \u201ctotality of the circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-11\">The evidentiary record indicates that while Wagers was initially charged in state court with wanton endangerment, the charge was dismissed after Appellant was charged in federal court. At his evidentiary hearing Wagers conceded that the act of pointing the loaded shotgun at his two former assailants constituted felony wanton endangerment under Kentucky state law. <em>See </em>KRS \u00a7 508.060. In his brief on appeal Wagers admits that the dismissal of the wanton endangerment charge by the state did not determine the sufficiency of its application in the context of his federal sentence. Finally, Wagers acknowledges the nexus between his wielding the loaded shotgun and the resulting wanton endangerment.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-12\">At the evidentiary hearing, the government maintained Wagers\u2019 self-defense claim was unavailable under the circumstances. <em>See Justice v. Commonwealth, </em>608 S.W.2d 74, 75 (Ky.Ct.App.1980) (finding of self-protection precluded conviction for wanton endangerment). Under Kentucky\u2019s general self-defense statute, KRS \u00a7 503.050, Wagers might successfully avail himself of a self-defense argument only if his threatened use of deadly force was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>\u201cnecessary to protect himself against death [or] serious physical injury.\u201d KRS \u00a7 503.050(2). Because Wombles was neither wielding a weapon, nor proximate to the Appellant, and was, by all accounts, backing away from the loaded shotgun held by Wagers, the government maintained the Appellant could not reasonably believe he, or his family, were under imminent risk of death or serious physical injury. Further, the government argued then, as it does now, that Wagers\u2019 self-defense argument could not reasonably be extended to cover the wanton endangerment of the two convenience store clerks in the line of fire from the loaded shotgun. Neither store clerk presented an imminent risk of death or serious physical injury to Wagers.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">After considering the evidence, the district judge found by a preponderance of the evidence that Wagers could not justify his conceded acts of wanton endangerment as performed in the service of self-protection. In making that determination, the district court relied upon Wagers\u2019 testimony that he was 15 to 20 feet from Wombles when he aimed the loaded shotgun, that Wombles had uttered a verbal threat to kill the Appellant and his family, that no weapon was brandished by Wombles, and that Wagers admitted to being intoxicated. Further, considering the credibility of the testimony, the district court also found by a preponderance of the evidence that the officer had to repeatedly order Wagers to drop the firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Upon review of the record, we find the district court did not err in the application of the sentencing enhancement when considering the uncontroverted evidence, the admissions of the Appellant, and the assertions of the officer on the scene. <em>See Justice, </em>608 S.W.2d at 74-75 (use of force by a defendant upon another person justifiable only when the defendant reasonably believes such force is necessary to protect against the imminent use of unlawful physical force); <em>see also </em>KRS \u00a7 503.120(1), (2) &amp; cmt. (Self-defense not available for wantonness crime when defendant has unreasonable belief or recklessly creates risk of injury to innocent persons). Even conceding the gravity of Wombles\u2019 verbal threats toward the Appellant and his family in the convenience store parking lot, Wagers\u2019 self-protection defense is untenable. The evidence of Wagers\u2019 intoxication, the uncontroverted testimony that Wombles was at a distance and moving away from Wagers, the absence of any weapons brandished by Wombles, and the officer\u2019s need to repeatedly order Wagers to put down his weapon, combine to establish the reasonable basis for the application of the four-point enhancement for wanton endangerment by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Hyler, </em>308 Fed.Appx. 962, 966-67 (6th Cir.2009) (applying Tennessee law to find, by a preponderance, no justification for a claim of self-defense to a sentencing enhancement for reckless endangerment under USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6)).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">We determine, upon review of the record, that the district court properly applied the four-point Guideline enhancement. For the reasons set forth above, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s determination.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b452-17\">.
