Korman, Senior District Judge for the U.S. District Court for Eastern New York, Brooklyn, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b665-9\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b665-10\">Catholic Answers, a 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, and Karl Keating, its president, appeal the district court\u2019s Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) dismissal of their suit seeking a tax refund and declaratory judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-11\">Catholic Answers seeks a refund of money the IRS already had tendered to the organization prior to the filing of this suit, and a declaratory judgment that sections of the tax code and implementing regulations are void for vagueness. The district court dismissed the case on various grounds including mootness.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-16\">This suit is moot. There is no relief that this court could grant. The tax paid has already been abated. The Declaratory Judgment Act grants federal courts jurisdiction to declare the rights and relations of interested parties \u201cexcept with respect to Federal taxes.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201. The doctrine of variance precludes Catholic Answers\u2019 First Amendment claims. <em>See </em>26 C.F.R. \u00a7 301.6402-2(b)(1):</p>\n<p id=\"b665-17\">Moreover, the district court was correct that this case does not fall into the exception to mootness for cases capable of repetition, yet evading review. This set of facts may be capable of repetition, given Catholic Answers\u2019 assertion that it will engage in similar political speech in the future. <em>See FEC v. Wis. Right to Life, Inc., </em>551 U.S. 449, 463-64, 127 S.Ct. 2652, 168 L.Ed.2d 329 (2007). However, should this set of facts recur, the case will not evade review because it will be clear then, while it is not now, that the IRS has intentionally maneuvered to avoid judicial scrutiny and will not be permitted to engage in evasion of this kind.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-18\">For the reasons stated, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b665-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
