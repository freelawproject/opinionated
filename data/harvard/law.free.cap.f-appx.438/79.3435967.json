We will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-19\">As the parties are familiar with the facts of this case, we need not describe the complete procedural history and Contant\u2019s filings in various courts, but will describe only those facts pertinent to this appeal. Contant, a native and citizen of Trinidad and Tobago, was ordered removed to his native country. He filed a motion to reopen his removal proceedings, arguing (for a second time) that he was eligible for relief from removal under the Violence Against Women Act (\u201cVAWA\u201d), because he had been subjected to battery or extreme cruelty by his U.S.-citizen spouse. At issue here is Contant\u2019s mandamus petition, filed soon after his motion to reopen, by which he sought to have the District Court declare that his removal was statutorily stayed pending disposition of his motion to reopen (including all appeals), pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(iv).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b103-20\">The District Court correctly held that it lacked jurisdiction to consider whether Contant had an automatic stay of removal. The Court properly found that there was no practical difference between asking the District Court to grant a stay of removal (which would necessarily require the District Court to consider the propriety of Contant\u2019s removal order), and asking the District Court to declare that a statutory stay existed. A petition for review filed in the proper court of appeals is the sole vehicle for an alien to challenge his remov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>al order. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(5). Further, as the District Court noted, by the time it ruled on his mandamus petition, this Court and the United States Supreme Court had already rejected his motions for a stay of removal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The District Court lacked the authority to overrule the decisions of this Court and the United States Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b103-16\">. Contant has sought review of the BIA's denial of the motion to reopen in this Court. That petition for review has been docketed at 10-4543 and has been consolidated with his petition for review of an earlier BIA decision, docketed at 10-3736. The petitions for review are pending.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b104-14\">. We have since denied two of Contant\u2019s motions for a stay of removal; <em>see Contant v. Attorney General, </em>No. 10-3736 (Order entered June 16, 2011), and <em>Contant v. Attorney General, </em>No. 10-4543 (Order entered January 20, 2011); and have denied his motion to reconsider the order denying an earlier motion for stay of removal; <em>see Contant v. Attorney General, </em>No. 10-3736 (Order entered February 11, 2011). We also hereby deny his motion for a stay of removal filed in this matter on June 9, 2011.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
