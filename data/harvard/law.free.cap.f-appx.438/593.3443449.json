The court-appointed psychiatrist\u2019s testimony that Elam was malingering in the weeks before he entered that plea likewise supported the court\u2019s conclusion. Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Elam\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea on the ground that he had not offered a \u201cfair and just reason\u201d for so doing. Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(d)(2)(B); <em>United States v. Ensminger, </em>567 F.3d 587, 590 (9th Cir.2009). Further, our decision in <em>United States v. Baptist, </em>646 F.3d 1225, 2011 WL 2150993 (9th Cir. June 2, 2011) (per curiam), forecloses Elam\u2019s argument that the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010(FSA) applies retroactively to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-15\">For the first time at oral argument, Elam urged us to remand to the district court to consider whether the FSA might itself constitute a \u201cfair and just\u201d reason for withdrawing his guilty plea. Because we conclude that the district court did not err in denying Elam\u2019s withdrawal motion, there is no basis for such a remand. Moreover, the enactment of non-retroactive legislation a year after the district court imposed Elam\u2019s sentence cannot logically constitute a \u201cfair and just\u201d reason <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>for withdrawing a guilty plea that he entered before that sentence was imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b618-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
