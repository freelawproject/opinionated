Potter, the Postmaster General of the United States Postal Service, on Little\u2019s claim of retaliation in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e-2000e-17 (2006).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-20\">We review de novo an award of summary judgment. <em>PCS Phosphate Co. v. Norfolk S. Corp., </em>559 F.3d 212, 217 (4th Cir.2009). Little contends on appeal that a jury, rather than the district court, should determine whether her dismissal was motivated by retaliation for her assertion of rights protected under Title VII. However, the district court did not err in concluding that Little failed to offer sufficient evidence that Potter\u2019s nondiscriminatory reason for the dismissal \u201cwas false, and that discrimination was the real reason for the challenged action.\u201d <em>Holland v. Washington Homes, Inc., </em>487 F.3d 208, 218 (4th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). Therefore, the district court properly awarded summary judgment on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-21\">Accordingly, we deny Little\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel and affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-22\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b274-17\"> Little's claim of hostile work environment proceeded to trial, and the jury\u2019s verdict in favor of Little on that claim is not before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
