The district court sentenced Carillo-Rivas to a total of 150 months of imprisonment and he now appeals. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-22\">Carillo-Rivas argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence seized as a result of his warrantless arrest and the search of his residence pursuant to a search warrant. Carillo-Rivas first contends that there was no probable cause to support his warrant-less arrest. \u201cIn reviewing a district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress, we review the court\u2019s factual findings for clear error, and its legal conclusions de novo.\u201d <em>United States v. Cain, </em>524 F.3d 477, 481 (4th Cir.2008) (citation omitted). When the district court denies a defendant\u2019s suppression motion, we construe \u201cthe evidence in the light most favorable to the government.\u201d <em>United States v. Grossman, </em>400 F.3d 212, 216 (4th Cir.2005) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">\u201c[A] warrantless arrest by a law officer is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment where there is probable cause to believe that a criminal offense has been or is being committed.\u201d <em>Devenpeck v. Alford, </em>543 U.S. 146, 152, 125 S.Ct. 588, 160 L.Ed.2d 537 (2004) (citations omitted). Probable cause exists when there are \u201cfacts and circumstances within the officer\u2019s knowledge that are sufficient to warrant a prudent person, or one of reasonable caution, in believing, in the circumstances shown, that the suspect has committed, is committing, or is about to commit an offense.\u201d <em>Michigan v. DeFillippo, </em>443 U.S. 31, 37, 99 S.Ct. 2627, 61 L.Ed.2d 343 (1979); <em>see Devenpeck, </em>543 U.S. at 152, 125 S.Ct. 588 (\u201cWhether probable cause exists depends upon the reasonable conclusion to be drawn from the facts known to the arresting officer at the time of the arrest.\u201d) (citation omitted). We have thoroughly reviewed the record and conclude that the district court did not err in finding that probable cause existed to support the warrantless arrest of Carillo-Rivas.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">Carillo-Rivas next argues that the affidavit submitted in support of the search warrant failed to provide probable cause for issuance of the warrant. \u201c[I]n order to establish probable cause for the issuance of a search warrant based in part on an informant\u2019s hearsay, it is necessary to consider all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit ..., including the veracity and basis of knowledge of persons supplying hearsay information.\u201d <em>United States v. Hodge, </em>354 F.3d 305, 309 (4th Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) (noting degree of corroboration of informant\u2019s statements is also important). Moreover, \u201cthe determination of probable cause by the issuing magistrate is entitled to great deference from this court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). Thus, this court\u2019s role \u201cis simply to ensure that the magistrate had a substantial basis for concluding that probable cause existed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Our review of the record leads us to conclude that the district court did not err in determining that there was sufficient probable cause to support issuance of the search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
