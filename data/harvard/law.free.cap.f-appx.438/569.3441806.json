He argues that (1) he was denied his right to testify, (2) he was denied his right to effective assistance of counsel, (3) the indictment was insufficient, and (4) the district court misinterpreted the United States Sentencing Guidelines. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">1. Bendshadler was not denied the right to testify, because the right is limited to <em>relevant </em>testimony and he did not indicate a desire to offer proper, relevant testimony. <em>See United States v. Moreno, </em>102 F.3d 994, 998 (9th Cir.1996). Thus, when Bendshadler remained silent as the defense rested without calling him to testify, he waived his right. <em>See United States v. Nohara, </em>3 F.3d 1239, 1244 (9th Cir.1993). A defendant who wants to take the stand \u201cmay do so \u2018by insisting on testifying, speaking to the court, or discharging his lawyer.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Pino-Noriega, </em>189 F.3d 1089, 1095 (9th Cir.1999) (quoting <em>United States v. Joelson, </em>7 F.3d 174, 177 (9th Cir.1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-10\">2. We decline to rule on Bendshadler\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim because the record is undeveloped. <em>See United States v. Daychild, </em>357 F.3d 1082, 1095 (9th Cir.2004). We express no view on the merits of the claim, which Bendshadler can raise in a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-11\">3. Bendshadler does not contest that his indictment was sufficient under <em>United States v. Caldwell, </em>989 F.2d 1056, 1059 (9th Cir.1993), but rather argues that <em>Caldwell </em>is no longer good law after <em>Skilling v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2896, 177 L.Ed.2d 619 (2010). <em>Skilling, </em>however, dealt with the mail fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346, which is fundamentally different from \u00a7 371. <em>See McNally v. United States, </em>483 U.S. 350, 358 n. 8, 107 S.Ct. 2875, 97 L.Ed.2d 292 (1987) (interpreting \u00a7 1346 in part by distinguishing the Court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 371 in <em>Hammerschmidt v. United States, </em>265 U.S. 182, 188, 44 S.Ct. 511, 68 L.Ed. 968 (1924)). <em>Skilling </em>repeatedly relied on <em>McNally </em>without ever referring to \u00a7 371. Nothing in <em>Skilling\u2019s </em>specific, historical interpretation of \u00a7 1346 undermined <em>Caldwell\u2019s </em>interpretation of \u00a7 371, which was rooted in the very precedent approved by <em>McNally. See Caldwell, </em>989 F.2d at 1059 (citing <em>Hammerschmidt, </em>265 U.S. at 188, 44 S.Ct. 511).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-14\">4. Section 2T1.9 of the Guidelines sets the offense level for Bendshadler\u2019s conviction, a <em>Klein </em>conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2T1.9 cmt. n. 1 (2010) (citing <em>United States v. Klein, </em>247 F.2d 908 (2d Cir.1957)). The guideline assumes there will be an imported offense level, and that the imported offense level will then be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>adopted unless it falls below the minimum offense level set for <em>Klein </em>conspiracies. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2T1.9(a) &amp; cmt. n. 2 (2010) (importing \u201cwhichever guideline <em>most closely </em>addresses\u201d the conspiracy (emphasis added)). Pursuant to \u00a7 2T1.9(a)(l), the district court correctly imported Bendshadler\u2019s offense level from \u00a7 2T1.4 because that section \u201cmost closely addresse[d] the harm that would have resulted had the conspirators succeeded in impeding, impairing, obstructing, or defeating the Internal Revenue Service.\u201d \u00a7 2T1.9 cmt. n. 2 (2010). Section 2T1.4 was most appropriate because it applies to aiding tax fraud, and Bendshadler\u2019s conviction established that he effectively aided tax fraud. His argument that he only aided the filing of tax returns claiming false deductions, as opposed to materially false tax returns, is insufficient to escape his responsibility for aiding tax fraud. <em>Cf. Alexander Shokai, Inc. v. Comm\u2019r, </em>34 F.3d 1480, 1486 (9th Cir.1994) (\u201cFraud means actual, intentional wrongdoing, and the intent required is the specific purpose to evade a tax believed to be owing.\u201d) (quoting <em>Zell v. Comm\u2019r, </em>763 F.2d 1139, 1142 (10th Cir.1985) (emphasis omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b594-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
