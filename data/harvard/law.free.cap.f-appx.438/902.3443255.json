Sharp (\u201cSharp\u201d) appeals from a decision of the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims denying entitlement to attorney fees and expenses under the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d). <em>See Sharp v. Shinseki, </em>No. 07-2481(E), 2011 WL 383935 (Vet.App. Feb. 8, 2011). Sharp\u2019s appeal does not present a constitutional issue or a question of law. Rather, her appeal would require this court to review questions of fact and application of law to fact. Under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2), however, we lack jurisdiction to review such factual determinations. We must therefore dismiss Sharp\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-17\">For the foregoing reasons, we dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-18\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-19\">Costs</p>\n<p id=\"b926-20\">Each party shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
