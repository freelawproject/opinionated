Mann contends that the district court erred in finding that the camper from which he sold the oxycodone was located on his land.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-7\">\u201cWe review the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Kennedy, </em>201 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2000). \u201cIt is the exclusive province of the judge in non-jury trials to assess the credibility of witnesses and to assign weight to their testimony,\u201d <em>Hearn v. McKay, </em>603 F.3d 897, 904 (11th Cir.2010) (alteration omitted), and \u201c[w]e accord great deference to the district court\u2019s credibility determinations,\u201d <em>United States v. Clay, </em>376 F.3d 1296, 1302 (11th Cir.2004). The trier of fact is \u201cfree to choose among alternative reasonable interpretations of the evidence,\u201d <em>United States v. Tampas, </em>493 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.2007), and its \u201cchoice between permissible views cannot be clear error,\u201d <em>United States v. Ndiaye, </em>434 F.3d 1270, 1305 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-8\">Mann testified at the forfeiture hearing that the camper from which he made the oxycodone sales was located on a right of way next to his land. Captain Ron Rice, who participated in the controlled purchases, testified that the camper where the sales took place was on Mann\u2019s land. The district court\u2019s decision to credit Captain Rice\u2019s testimony over Mann\u2019s testimony was not clear error.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
