We review a grant of summary judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>de novo and apply the same standard as the District Court. <em>Stratechuk v. Bd. of Educ., South Orange-Maplewood Sch. Dist., </em>587 F.3d 597, 603 (3d Cir.2009) (citations omitted). We will affirm the District Court\u2019s summary judgment order.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">Policastro challenged the Board\u2019s mailbox policy as unconstitutional in a previous case, and the District Court concluded that the policy was not unconstitutionally over-broad and that his \u201cas applied\u201d challenge was moot. In an attempt to revisit the District Court\u2019s conclusion that his \u201cas applied\u201d challenge was moot\u2014a conclusion which was affirmed by this Court\u2014Policastro deliberately violated the mailbox policy for a second time. Following an official letter of reprimand from the Board, Policastro commenced the underlying suit. After discovery, both parties filed motions for summary judgment and the District Court ruled in favor of the Appellees, reasoning that the mailbox policy is a content-neutral limitation which is \u201cvalid provided that [it is] justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech, that [it is] narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest, and that [it] leavefs] open ample alternative channels for communication of the information.\u201d <em>Policastro v. Tenafly Bd. of Educ., </em>710 F.Supp.2d 495, 509 <em>(D.N.J.2010)(quoting Clark v. Cmty. for Creative Non-Violence, </em>468 U.S. 288, 293, 104 S.Ct. 3065, 82 L.Ed.2d 221 (1984)). In a clear and carefully reasoned opinion, the District Court correctly applied this standard in concluding that the policy did not violate Policastro\u2019s rights. We can add nothing to the District Court\u2019s analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">Accordingly, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s grant of the Appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
