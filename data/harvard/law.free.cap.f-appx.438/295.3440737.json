He was sentenced originally to concurrent terms of 41 months of imprisonment and three years of nonreporting supervised release. On appeal, we granted Payan-Gloria\u2019s unopposed motion to vacate his sentence and to remand for resentencing in light of <em>Carachuri-Rosendo v. Holder, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2577, 177 L.Ed.2d 68 (2010). On resentencing, the district court varied upward from Payan-Gloria\u2019s guidelines range of 30 to 37 months of imprisonment and imposed the same sentences Payan-Gloria received originally.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-23\">Payan-Gloria now appeals the sentences imposed on remand, contending that they were greater than necessary to satisfy the requirements of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a sentence is reviewed for reasonableness. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 46, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We first examine whether the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>committed any significant procedural error. <em>Id. </em>at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. If the district court\u2019s decision is procedurally sound, we will then \u201cconsider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because Payan-Gloria does not contend that the district court committed procedural error, the only issue on appeal is the substantive reasonableness of his sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">In imposing the sentences, the district court noted Payan-Gloria\u2019s gang membership and extensive criminal history, which included four prior convictions for illegal reentry into the United States, and indicated that there was a need to deter Pay-an-Gloria from desiring to return to the United States. Payan-Gloria concedes that the factors considered by the district court were proper but contends that a within-guidelines sentence would have been sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to account for those factors. He contends that immigration offenses generally result in relatively high guidelines ranges for relatively minor conduct; his guidelines imprisonment range was high relative to the seriousness of his offenses; and his guidelines range did not take into account the fact that his benign motivation for attempting to return to the United States was concern for his elderly mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">\u201c[I]n applying abuse-of-discretion review, we \u2018must give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Herrera-Garduno, </em>519 F.3d 526, 530 (5th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586). \u201c[T]he sentencing judge is in a superior position to find facts and judge their import under \u00a7 3553(a) with respect to a particular defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.2008). The district court provided individualized, case-specific reasons for imposing the 41-month sentences, and Pay-an-Gloria has not shown that the sentences constituted an abuse of discretion. <em>See Herrerar-Garduno, </em>519 F.3d at 530-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b319-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
