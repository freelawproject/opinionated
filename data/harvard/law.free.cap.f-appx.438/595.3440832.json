Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). Martinez failed to allege discrimination on the basis of gender: neither the first amended complaint nor the proffered second amended complaint alleged the existence of any direct evidence of gender discrimination (such as a discriminatory comment by an Amtrak decisionmaker), <em>see, e.g., EEOC v. Boeing Co., </em>577 F.3d 1044, 1050 (9th Cir.2009), or circumstantial evidence of such gender discrimination (such as a similarly-situated female employee who was not fired after engaging in consensual sexual conduct on the job), <em>see, e.g., Surrell v. Cal. Water Serv. Co., </em>518 F.3d 1097, 1105-06 (9th Cir.2008). Thus, Martinez\u2019s reliance on <em>Sassaman v. Gamache </em>is misplaced, as Martinez offered no evidence of sex stereotyping comparable to Gamaehe\u2019s justification of Sassaman\u2019s firing: \u201cyou probably did what she said you did because you\u2019re male and nobody would believe you anyway.\u201d 566 F.3d 307, 311 (2d Cir.2009). Because Martinez failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination on the basis of gender, the district court did not err in dismissing Martinez\u2019s California Fair Employment and Housing claim or his state wrongful termination claim. <em>See Stevenson v. Superior Court, </em>16 Cal.4th 880, 66 Cal.Rptr.2d 888, 941 P.2d 1157, 1165 (1997); <em>Loggins v. Kaiser Permanente Int\u2019l, </em>151 Cal.App.4th 1102, 1108-09, 60 Cal.Rptr.3d 45 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>Even assuming Martinez could bring a \u00a7 1988 claim against Amtrak or a <em>Bivens </em>claim against Amtrak officials, both his first amended complaint and his proffered second amended complaint failed to state a claim for any constitutional violation. Because Martinez failed to allege discrimination on the basis of gender, his equal protection claim fails. Moreover, because Martinez did not allege that Amtrak prevented him from speaking or retaliated against him for so doing, his complaint fails to state a claim for a First Amendment violation. Finally, Martinez\u2019s due process claim fails because he received both \u201cnotice and an opportunity to respond\u201d before he was terminated, <em>see Cleveland Bd. of Ed. v. Loudermill, </em>470 U.S. 532, 546, 105 S.Ct. 1487, 84 L.Ed.2d 494 (1985), and his complaint did not allege any facts suggesting that the post-termination officer was biased against him, <em>cf. Clements v. Airport Auth. of Washoe Cnty., </em>69 F.3d 321, 333 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Martinez\u2019s motion for leave to amend his complaint to state a <em>Bivens </em>claim, as amendment would have been futile. <em>See Bonin v. Calderon, </em>59 F.3d 815, 845 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b619-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
