Aladdin filed a complaint alleging that Defendant-Appellee Harumi Aoto Donoyan (\u201cDonoyan\u201d) breached certain post-employment restrictive covenants that she entered into with Aladdin. Aladdin sought declaratory and injunctive relief and filed a motion for a preliminary injunction contemporaneously with its complaint. The district court issued its Ruling and Order denying Aladdin\u2019s motion on June 8, 2011, 2011 WL 2293236. Aladdin timely filed a notice of appeal. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-16\">We must first address whether we have Article III jurisdiction and resolve an issue of mootness. See <em>Moore v. Consol. Edison Co. of N.Y., </em>409 F.3d 506, 509 (2d Cir.2005); see <em>also United States v. Miller, </em>263 F.3d 1, 4 n. 2 (2d Cir.2001) (\u201c[A] federal court may not ... decide a case on the merits before resolving whether the court has Article III jurisdiction.\u201d). We have repeatedly observed that, \u201cin general, an appeal from the denial of a preliminary injunction is mooted by the occurrence of the action sought to be enjoined.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>409 F.3d at 509 (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Knaust v. City of Kingston, </em>157 F.3d 86, 88 (2d Cir.1998). We have further recognized a limited exception to this rule \u201cwhere a court can feasibly <em>restore </em>the status quo\u201d by ordering relief that \u201cnegate[s] or at least substantially mitigate[s] the adverse effects ... of the \u2018irreparable harms\u2019 the plaintiff fears.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>409 F.3d at 509-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-17\">Here, Aladdin sought only to enforce the restrictive covenants during the pendency of this litigation and thus preliminarily to enjoin Donoyan from <em>\u201cfurther </em>violations of those obligations.\u201d J.A. at 20-21, 24-25 (emphasis added). Aladdin asserted that \u201cDonoyan\u2019s <em>continued violations </em>of [the] ... covenants\u201d would cause it to suffer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>\u201cirreparable harm to its business relationships and opportunities with its customers\u201d while this litigation was pending. J.A. at 21 (emphasis added). Those covenants, however, have now expired by their own terms; their restrictions on Donoyan\u2019s activities are now lifted. As a result, the alleged \u201ccontinued violations of [the] ... covenants\u201d are no longer continuing: they have already occurred. <em>See Hodges v. Schlinkert Sports Assocs., Inc., </em>89 F.3d 310, 312 (6th Cir.1996) (\u201cUnder the general rule of mootness, ... [the] claim to enforcement of the noncompete clause is moot since that provision expired by its own terms.\u201d); <em>cf. Am. Tunaboat Ass\u2019n v. Brown, </em>67 F.3d 1404, 1407 (9th Cir.1995) (holding that the \u201cappeal of the district court\u2019s denial of its application for a preliminary injunction is moot\u201d because the regulation sought to be enjoined was no longer in effect).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">Thus, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the district court had the authority to grant injunctive relief as a <em>remedy </em>in this diversity case\u2014a matter the parties dispute\u2014it is no longer possible to grant <em>preliminary </em>relief enjoining the violation of these covenants, which have, by their own terms, expired.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We are not persuaded, moreover, that such preliminary relief would restore or \u201cpreserve the status quo pending the final determination of [this] dispute,\u201d <em>Arthur Guinness &amp; Sons, PLC v. Sterling Publ\u2019g Co., </em>732 F.2d 1095, 1099 (2d Cir.1984). Accordingly, this appeal is hereby DISMISSED AS MOOT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b40-6\">. In so concluding, we only determine whether the <em>preliminary </em>relief sought by Aladdin is available under these circumstances; we do not reach the separate question whether Aladdin might obtain final equitable relief after a trial on the merits.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
