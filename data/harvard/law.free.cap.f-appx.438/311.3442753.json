Garcia argues that the district court erred when it imposed a two-level adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(6) for reckless endangerment. Garcia does not contest the testimony of Daniel Padilla, the lead case agent with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, that she transported 15 to 20 people in a camper behind a pickup truck whose maximum load was 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">Section 2Ll.l(b)(6), in pertinent part, provides for a two-level increase \u201c[i]f the offense involved intentionally or recklessly creating a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another person.\u201d \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(6). Commentary to the Guideline gives as examples of conduct to which the enhancement applies \u201ccarrying substantially more passengers than the rated capacity of a motor vehicle,\u201d and \u201charboring persons in a crowded, dangerous, or inhumane condition.\u201d \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(6), comment. n. 5. To determine the propriety of applying \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(6)\u2019s reekless-endangerment enhancement, this court considers \u201c \u2018the availability of oxygen, exposure to temperature extremes, the aliens\u2019 ability to communicate with the driver of the vehicle, their ability to exit the vehicle quickly, and the danger to them if an accident occurs.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>680 F.3d 377, 381 (5th Cir.2011) (quoting <em>United States v. Zuniga-Amezquita, </em>468 F.3d 886, 889 (5th Cir.2006)).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-13\">This court has recognized that overcrowded conditions similar to those attributed to Garcia\u2019s offense have provided a basis for the enhancement. <em>See United States v. Cuyler, </em>298 F.3d 387, 388-91 (5th Cir.2002). Additionally, Agent Padilla\u2019s testimony that the aliens would have been exposed to temperature extremes and that the alien smuggling operation of which Garcia was a part routinely transported aliens in crowded conditions without safety restraints weighed in favor of the adjustment. <em>See Rodriguez, </em>630 F.3d at 381; <em>United States v. Garza, </em>587 F.3d 304, 311 (5th Cir.2009). Thus, the district court\u2019s finding that the lack of safety restraints, long distances, and overcrowded conditions warranted the enhancement was not clearly erroneous. <em>See Zuniga-Amezquita, </em>468 F.3d at 889.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-14\">Garcia also argues that the district court erred when it increased her base offense level four levels under \u00a7 3Bl.l(a). Section 3Bl.l(a) provides for a four-level increase to the total offense level of a defendant who \u201cwas an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants.\u201d Section \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) specifies two parts to the enhancement: the defendant\u2019s conduct and the number of participants. <em>United States v. Curtis, </em>635 F.3d 704, 720 (5th Cir.2011), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(June 6, 2011) (No. 10-10931).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-15\">Garcia makes no argument regarding the number of participants. By failing to argue that the criminal activity involved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>fewer than five participants, Garcia has waived this issue. <em>See United States v. Stalnaker, </em>571 F.3d 428, 439-40 (5th Cir.2009). As to Garcia\u2019s conduct, Agent Padilla\u2019s testimony established that Garcia exercised decision making authority, participated in the conspiracy, had a high degree of participation and planning or organizing the smuggling, and exercised authority over at least two drivers. The district court\u2019s finding that Garcia was a leader or organizer under \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) is plausible in light of this testimony, and its decision to apply the four-level adjustment was not clearly erroneous. <em>See Curtis, </em>635 F.3d at 720; \u00a7 3B1.1, comment, (n.4).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b336-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
