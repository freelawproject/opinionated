The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion .to suppress. A jury subsequently found defendant guilty of both charges. The court merged defendant\u2019s conviction for possession of cocaine into his conviction for possession with the intent to distribute and sentenced him to an indeterminate term at the Youth Correction Complex. The court also imposed a $2,000 DEDR penalty, a $50 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>lab fee and a $30 VCCB penalty and suspended defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s license for eighteen months.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">On appeal, defendant makes the following arguments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-6\">I. THE TROOPER LACKED A LEGAL BASIS TO ORDER BOTH OCCUPANTS OUT OP THE VEHICLE AND OBTAIN CONSENT TO SEARCH THE VEHICLE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-7\">II. THE TROOPER LACKED A LEGAL BASIS TO SEARCH THE PERSON OF THE DEFENDANT.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-8\">Ill THE PAT DOWN OF THE DEFENDANT EXTENDED BEYOND A CHECK FOR WEAPONS AND WAS THEREFORE ILLEGAL.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">We conclude that the patdown search of defendant which revealed the cocaine on which his conviction is based violated the Fourth Amendment. Therefore, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-10\">Defendant was a passenger in a motor vehicle being operated on the New Jersey Turnpike near Newark Airport in the late afternoon on September 3, 1991. A state trooper stopped the driver for failing to use his directional signal and tailgating another vehicle. According to the trooper, the driver appeared nervous, spoke very quickly, stuttered, and failed to make eye contact. Moreover, in response to the trooper\u2019s inquiry, the driver said that he was coming from Newark Airport. This response increased the trooper\u2019s suspicion because the location of the stop was north of where persons ordinarily would enter the turnpike to travel in a southerly direction. The trooper\u2019s suspicions were increased further when the driver and defendant gave conflicting answers as to the identity of the person they had dropped off at the airport. The trooper then obtained the driver\u2019s consent to search his vehicle, and around the same time he called the Newark station of the State Police to send a back-up trooper to assist him. At this point, the trooper ordered defendant to step out of the car and he conducted a patdown search for weapons. This search revealed a hard object near the ankle of defendant\u2019s right pants leg. The trooper retrieved this object, which turned out to be a piece of tinfoil wrapped around cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-11\">In <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 <em>U.S. </em>1, 27, 88 <em>S.Ct </em>1868, 1883, 20 L.Ed.2d 889, 909 (1968), the Court held that a police officer may conduct a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>reasonable search for weapons upon a person he is investigating \u201cwhere he has reason to believe that he is dealing with an armed and dangerous individual, regardless of whether he has probable cause to arrest the individual for a crime.\u201d \u201cThe officer need not be absolutely certain that the individual is armed; the issue is whether a reasonably prudent man in the circumstances would be warranted in the belief that his safety or that of others was in danger.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>However, \u201c[n]othing in <em>Terry </em>can be understood to allow a generalized \u2018cursory search for weapons.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ybarra v. Illinois, </em>444 <em>U.S. </em>85, 93-94, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>338, 343, 62 L.Ed.2d 238, 247 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Based on <em>Terry </em>and its progeny, our Supreme Court concluded in <em>State v. Thomas, </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>673, 542 A.2d 912 (1988) that a policeman\u2019s reasonable suspicion that a person possesses illegal drugs does not by itself provide a basis for a reasonable suspicion that that person is armed and dangerous. Rather, the record must provide \u201ca specific and particularized basis for an <em>objectively </em>reasonable suspicion that defendant was armed and dangerous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 683, 542 A.2d 912.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">More recently, the Court has held that \u201cthe standard that justifies an order to a passenger to step out of a vehicle does not rise to the <em>Terry </em>standard that must be met for a protective pat-down.\u201d <em>State v. Smith, </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>599, 618, 637 A.2d 158 (1994). \u201c[T]o justify a pat-down of an occupant once alighted from a vehicle, specific, articulable facts must demonstrate that a \u2018reasonably prudent man in the circumstances would be warranted in the belief that his safety or that of others was in danger.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 619, 637 A.2d 158 (quoting <em>Terry v. Ohio, supra, </em>392 <em>U.S. </em>at 27, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1883, 20 L.Ed.2d at 909). \u201cA \u2018hunch\u2019 forms an insufficient basis on which to conduct the uncomfortable and often embarrassing invasion of privacy that occurs in a pat-down of a person\u2019s body.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The Court also indicated that the factors a court should consider in determining the reasonableness of a police officer\u2019s belief that a suspect may be armed and dangerous include the time of day and the amount of traffic on the roadway. <em>Ibid.; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number><em>see also State v. Otero, </em>245 <em>N.J.Super. </em>83, 92-93, 584 A.2d 260 (App.Div.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">We conclude that the police officer who stopped the vehicle in which defendant was riding did not have \u201ca specific and particularized basis for an <em>objectively </em>reasonable suspicion that defendant was armed and dangerous.\u201d <em>State v. Thomas, supra, </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>at 683, 542 A.2d 912. Although the driver\u2019s demeanor and the responses that the driver and defendant gave to the officer\u2019s questions may have created a reasonable suspicion that they were engaged in some form of wrongdoing, such as being in possession of illegal drugs, they did not provide a reasonable basis for a belief that defendant might be armed and dangerous. Compare <em>State v. Dale, </em>271 <em>N.J.Super. </em>334, 339, 638 A.2d 886 (App.Div. 1994). In explaining his reason for conducting a patdown search of defendant, the officer simply stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-7\">[PJor my own safety, being that I was\u2014it was two on one, and also the fact that I felt something was wrong here, the fact that the\u2014it might have been something amiss inside the vehicle and also due to my past experience with searching cars, for my own safety, I patted Mr. Walker down for weapons.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">Similarly, on cross-examination, the officer indicated that he had a \u201cgeneralized suspicion\u201d that \u201csomething was amiss.\u201d Thus, the officer failed to identify any objective basis for a belief that defendant was armed and dangerous that would not exist any time a passenger in a car stopped for a motor vehicle violation is suspected of some form of unspecified unlawful conduct. Such generalized suspicion does not provide a reasonable basis for a belief that an individual is armed and dangerous, especially when the suspect is standing on the shoulder of the Turnpike in daylight during commuting hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">Furthermore, the simple fact that the driver consented to a search of his vehicle did not give the trooper the right to frisk the passenger. Even in connection with the execution of a search warrant, which must be issued by an impartial magistrate upon a showing of probable cause, the Supreme Court has held that the police may not seek to control the site of the search by routinely conducting a patdown frisk for weapons of any person present on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>the scene, because \u201c[t]he \u2018narrow scope\u2019 of the <em>Terry </em>exception does not permit a frisk for weapons on less than reasonable belief or suspicion directed at the person to be frisked.\u201d <em>Ybarra v. Illinois, supra, </em>444 <em>U.S. </em>at 95, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 343, 62 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 247. Similarly, in <em>State v. Dolly, </em>255 <em>N.J.Super. </em>278, 283, 605 A.2d 238 (App.Div.1991), we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-5\">A search or seizure must be supported by probable cause \u201cparticularized\u201d with respect to that individual or vehicle. This requirement cannot be undercut or avoided by simply pointing to the fact that coincidentally there exists probable cause to search or seize another or to search the premises where the person or car may happen to be.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Since the police may obtain consent for a search without probable cause or even reasonable suspicion, <em>State v. Allen, </em>254 <em>N.J.Super. </em>62, 66, 603 A.2d 71 (App.Div.1992), it is even clearer in the present context than in a search warrant case that the authorization to search one person\u2019s property does not provide authorization to frisk another person absent \u201ca specific and particularized basis for an <em>objectively </em>reasonable suspicion [that that person is] armed and dangerous.\u201d <em>State v. Thomas, supra, </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>at 683, 542 A.2d 912; <em>cf. State v. Suazo, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>315, 321, 627 A.2d 1074 (1993) (\u201c[A] driver\u2019s apparent authority to consent to a search of the car does not include the authority to permit a search of the personal belongings of other passengers.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">Accordingly, the order denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress and the judgment of' conviction are reversed and the matter is remanded to the trial court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
