The prosecutor contends that the decision of the Merit System Board was arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable and that the Board erroneously treated the appeal as an application for reconsideration of its January 7, 1992 decision. For the following reasons, we reject the Camden County Prosecutor\u2019s arguments and we affirm the decision of the Merit System Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">The July 28, 1993 decision of the Merit System Board directly affects the employment of three of the Camden County Prosecutor\u2019s provisional employees. One of these employees currently holds the position of chief clerk; the second is the principal clerk typist; and the third holds the position of clerk. The first two are long-time employees of the prosecutor\u2019s office who were provisionally appointed to the positions they now hold when those positions became vacant. The third person was recently hired by the prosecutor\u2019s office as a provisional employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">The Camden County Prosecutor concedes that his office is subject to the provisions of Title 11A and that the positions at issue here are positions in the competitive division of the career civil service. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>llA:3-2.1a (civil service appointments, as far as practicable, shall be competitive). Under the civil service statutes, a \u201cpermanent employee\u201d is \u201can employee in the career service who has acquired the tenure and rights resulting from regular appointment and successful completion of the working test.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>4A:1-1.3; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>11A:1.2.e. A permanent employee in the competitive civil service is afforded substantial protection against dismissal or demotion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-8\">A permanent employee may be laid off for economy, efficiency or other related reason. The employee shall be demoted in lieu of lay off whenever possible____ The Board shall adopt rules regarding the order of lay off and employee rights upon recommendation by the commissioner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-11\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>11A:8-1.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-12\">A provisional appointee does not enjoy the job protection accorded to a permanent employee. Under the civil service regulations and statutes, a provisional appointee holds his or her \u201cemployment in the competitive division of the career service pending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>the appointment of a person from an eligible list.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>4A:1-1.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">The legislature has placed a high priority on safeguarding the employment rights of permanent civil service employees. To safeguard those rights, a permanent employee who suffers the loss of employment enjoys \u201ca special reemployment right\u201d to a position with the same title or to a similar lower or lateral position, provided the positions are vacant or held by provisional appointees. The pertinent regulation provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-6\">A special reemployment right means the right of a permanent employee, based on his or her permanent title at the time of the layoff action, to be certified for reemployment after the lay off to the same, lateral and lower related titles. Special reemployment rights shall be determined by the Department of Personnel in the same manner as lateral and demotional rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-7\"><em>N.J.A.C. </em>4A:8-2.1(c).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">When the Department of Personnel has certified a list of appointees eligible for appointment to a particular position, the appointing authority must hire or promote from that list. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>11A:4-9; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>11A:4-12. The Commissioner of the Division of Civil Service is authorized to establish lists of persons eligible for \u201cspecial reemployment.\u201d The persons on these special reemployment lists \u201cinclude permanent employees laid off or demoted in lieu of lay off from permanent titles.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>11A:4-9(e). Except in limited circumstances, a special reemployment list has the highest priority; that is, vacancies must be filled by appointing eligible persons on the special reemployment list in preference to eligible persons on promotional lists or competitive lists. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>11A:4-12. The implementing regulation, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>4A:8-2.3(b)(1) states in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-9\">Special reemployment lists shall take priority over all other reemployment lists, open competitive lists and lateral title changes pending examination (see <em>N.J.A.C. </em>4A:4-7b(c)), except those resulting from position reclassification, for the entire jurisdiction (see <em>N.J.A.C. </em>4A:8\u20142.1(e)(1)). Special reemployment lists shall also take priority over promotional lists for the State department, autonomous agency or local department where the lay off occurred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-10\">Permanent civil service employees on special reemployment lists because they have been laid off from their positions are entitled to replace employees in comparable positions who have not been permanently appointed in the classified service.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number><em>See Department of Civil Service v. City of Newark, </em>131 <em>N.J.Super. </em>275, 277, 329 A.2d 572 (App.Div.1974); <em>Housing Authority of Jersey City v. Department of Civil Service, </em>87 <em>N.J.Super. </em>146, 147, 208 A.2d 416 (App.Div.1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Our decision of this case is based on one other important piece of the regulatory framework. The entire state government is a single unit for the purpose of determining eligibility for reemployment. However, employees of one local government do not enjoy reemployment rights to positions in another local government. For example, an employee dismissed by the City of Newark has no special right to reemployment in a comparable position in the government of the City of Jersey City. The pertinent Department of Personnel regulation states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-7\">A special reemployment list from one governmental jurisdiction shall not be certified to another jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-8\">i. In local service, for the purposes of this chapter, an autonomous agency shall be considered a separate jurisdiction. <em>An autonomous agency is one which, by statute, is a body corporate and has the powers of an appointing authority. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-9\">ii. In state service the entire state government constitutes a single jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-10\"><em>N.J.A.C. </em>4A:8-2.1(c)1.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-11\">If the Camden County Prosecutor\u2019s office and the other offices of the Camden County governmental structure are \u201cone governmental jurisdiction\u201d for purposes of special reemployment rights, then a strict reading of these statutes and regulations leads to the result which has been reached by the Department of Personnel. That is, eligible persons on a county-wide special reemployment list are entitled to fill the positions at issue in this case and to displace the present incumbents who are merely provisional appointees. The last quoted regulation of the Division of Personnel supports that result because \u201cin local service\u201d only \u201can autonomous agency\u201d is to be considered \u201ca separate jurisdiction\u201d and \u201can autonomous agency\u201d is defined as one which is both \u201can appointing authority\u201d and, \u201cby statute ... a body corporate.\u201d The prosecutor is concededly \u201can appointing authority.\u201d <em>Cetrulo v. Byrne, </em>55 <em>N.J.Super. </em>199, 203, 150 A.2d 287 (Law Div.1959), <em>aff'd, </em>31 <em>N.J. </em>320, 157 A.2d 297 (1960) (county prosecutor possess<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>es power to appoint legal assistants and other personnel required to carry out functions of his office). Just as clearly, however, it is not \u201cby statute \u2014 a body corporate.\u201d Therefore, the decision of the Merit System Board is subject to reversal only if <em>N.J.A.C. </em>4A:8-2.1(e)1 is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">The prosecutor emphasizes that his office demands special integrity and trustworthiness in its employees. However, he has not raised any questions about the personal integrity or trustworthiness of the persons who have been certified as eligible to fill the positions at issue. At oral argument, the Deputy Attorney General representing the Department of Personnel pointed out that civil service clerical positions in the State Attorney General\u2019s Office are subject to being filled from statewide reemployment lists. The Deputy Attorney General also assured us that the Department of Personnel would be particularly sensitive to the special qualifications required for persons working in a law enforcement agency if an issue was appropriately raised about the qualifications of one or more persons certified as eligible.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">The Prosecutor has also stressed that the provisional chief clerk and, perhaps, one of the other provisional appointees have been extensively trained in the use of the special computer system relied on by the prosecutor\u2019s office. He argues that the efficiency of his office should not be sacrificed by compelling him to replace employees who \u00e1re already trained with employees who will require new training. However, the relative weight to be given to efficiency on the one hand and to the reemployment rights of permanent civil service employees on the other is a policy issue which has been decided by the legislature. That decision has been made in favor of reemployment rights and we are bound by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">Our role in reviewing the decision of an administrative agency is limited to assuring that that decision is not arbitrary or unreasonable. <em>Public Service Electric &amp; Gas Co. v. Department of Environmental Protection, </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>95, 103, 501 A.2d 125 (1985); <em>New Jersey Association of Health Care Facilities v. Finley, </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>67, 79, 415 A.2d 1147 (1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 <em>U.S. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>944, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>342, 66 L.Ed.2d 208 (1980). In making that determination, we are to consider whether the agency action violates the enabling act\u2019s legislative policies; whether there is substantial evidence in the record to support the findings upon which the agency based its application of those legislative policies; and whether, in applying the legislative policies to the facts, the agency clearly erred by reaching a conclusion that could not reasonably have been made upon a consideration of the relevant factors. <em>Dennery v. Board of Education, </em>131 <em>N.J. </em>626, 641, 622 A.2d 858 (1993); <em>Public Service Electric &amp; Gas Co., supra, </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>at 103, 501 A.2d 125; <em>Barry v. Arrow Pontiac, Inc., </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>57, 71, 494 A.2d 804 (1985). Furthermore, although we are not bound by the administrative agency\u2019s interpretation of the statute which it administers, the construction which the agency has placed upon the statute is entitled to a presumption of reasonableness. <em>New Jersey Guild of Hearing Aid Dispensers v. Long, </em>75 <em>N.J. </em>544, 561, 384 A.2d 795 (1978); <em>see also Cedar Cove, Inc. v. Stanzione, 122 N.J. </em>202, 212, 584 A.2d 784 (1991) (the meaning ascribed to legislation by the agency responsible for its implementation is persuasive evidence of the legislature\u2019s understanding of its enactment). Similarly, the Supreme Court has stated that an agency\u2019s interpretation of a rule or regulation is presumptively valid. <em>Medical Society of New Jersey v. New Jersey Department of Law And Public Safety, </em>120 <em>N.J. </em>18, 25-26, 575 A.2d 1348 (1990). Judged by these standards, we are unable to conclude that <em>N.J.A.C. </em>4A:8-2.1(c)1 is arbitrary, unreasonable or otherwise invalid as applied to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Whether or not the prosecutor\u2019s appeal from the decision of the Department of Personnel which resulted in the Merit System Board\u2019s decision of July 28, 1993 was an application for reconsideration of its prior decision is immaterial. However the appeal may have been denominated, it is clear to us that the Merit System Board gave the matter thorough consideration on the merits and reached the correct result.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">The judgment appealed from is therefore affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
