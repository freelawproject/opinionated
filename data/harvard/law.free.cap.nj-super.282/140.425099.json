Plaintiff Ideal Dairy Farms, Inc. (Ideal), prevailed at trial and recovered seven-figure damages under both theories against defendant Farmland Dairy Farms, Inc. (Farmland). We conclude that the Law Division judge erred as a matter of law, reverse and order judgment for Farmland.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-14\">The factual framework relevant to this appeal is essentially undisputed. Before 1985 Ideal was a dealer and distributor of Farmland dairy products. In March 1985 Ideal ended this relationship and became a dealer and distributor of Tuscan Dairy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>Farms, Inc.\u2019s (Tuscan) dairy products. This parting was not friendly. In February 1986, eleven months later, Farmland and several of its distributors canvassed Ideal-Tuscan\u2019s customers and offered to sell them milk at prices substantially lower than Ideal\u2019s prices. Forty-eight Ideal accounts agreed to switch to Farmland. In order to recoup these accounts, Ideal was forced to lower its prices to meet Farmland\u2019s offers. Ultimately, Ideal retained forty-three of the forty-eight solicited customers, although at substantially lower prices. This spat of price competition, adverse to Ideal but of benefit to its customers, led to this law suit by Ideal for damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">On March 3, 1986 Ideal filed this complaint in the Chancery Division against Farmland and its officers and principals, Jacob Goldman and Mark Goldman (collectively, Farmland); Lotz Ben-chester Farms, Inc.; Sunnybrook Farms, Inc., a/k/a Hohnecker Dairy; V. Puzino, Abrew Dairy Products; Don\u2019s Dairy Products a/k/a Staal\u2019s (collectively, the. distributors); and unknown individuals, corporations, and partnerships. Ideal\u2019s claims included civil conspiracy, tortious interference with business advantage, common-law unfair competition, and violations of the Milk Control Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>4:12A-1 to -58, and of the New Jersey Antitrust Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:9-3, all stemming from Farmland\u2019s solicitation of the forty-eight Ideal customers in February 1986. Farmland allegedly offered these customers \u201cbelow cost\u201d prices for the purpose of damaging or eliminating Ideal as a competitor. Ideal demanded injunctive relief, compensatory and punitive damages, and attorneys fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">Farmland denied liability and asserted a number of affirmative defenses including (1) the finding by Woodson Moffett, Director of the Division of Dairy Industries (DDI), that Farmland\u2019s pricing was not below cost, was a conclusive and final determination of a New Jersey administrative agency; (2) the Law and Chancery Divisions of the Superior Court were without subject matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>jurisdiction to hear and decide matters within the exclusive realm of the DDI, and (3) in accordance with <em>R. </em>2:2-3(a)(2), any appeal from the DDI\u2019s final determination must be taken to the Appellate Division. In July 1986 Farmland counterclaimed and filed a third-party complaint against Ideal, ten retail customers who allegedly repudiated contracts to purchase milk from Farmland and retained Ideal as their milk supplier, and Tuscan, Ideal\u2019s supplier of milk. The third-party action alleged a breach of contract by the retail customers and that Tuscan and Ideal tortiously interfered with Farmland\u2019s contractual relationship with those ten customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">In April 1987 Farmland moved to dismiss Ideal\u2019s suit pursuant to <em>R. </em>4:69-5 on the ground that Ideal had failed to exhaust its available administrative remedies or, in the alternative, sought an order in accordance with <em>R. </em>2:2-3(a)(2) dismissing the action for failure of Ideal to appeal to the Appellate Division from the final administrative determination of the Director of the DDI rendered by letter of May 2, 1986. The motion was denied. Farmland sought leave for an interlocutory appeal to this court. By order of July 24, 1987 we granted the motion for the sole purpose of ordering the trial court to hold a hearing to decide whether any issues in the action were barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel, and to make appropriate factual findings and conclusions of law with respect to each issue which Farmland claimed was barred by estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">On October 14, 1987 Ideal filed an amended complaint which alleged that DDI Director Moffett entered into a conspiracy with Farmland to deprive Ideal of its civil rights, in violation of 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1983, 1985, and 1986. Moffett was not joined as a defendant. Ideal later filed a third amended complaint, alleging that Farmland violated the civil provisions of the New Jersey and federal RICO statutes <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>2C:41-1 to 6.2; 18 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1961 to 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">The Law Division judge then held a plenary hearing on the collateral estoppel issue. The judge found that the requirements for collateral estoppel had not been met and struck that defense. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>Farmland eventually and voluntarily dismissed its third-party complaint against Ideal\u2019s customers and against Tuscan. Code-fendant Don\u2019s Dairy Products, a/k/a Staal\u2019s, filed a erossclaim against Farmland. The first count sought indemnification, based on Farmland\u2019s \u201cprimary\u201d misconduct, while the second count sought contribution. This erossclaim was dismissed by consent of the parties prior to the start of trial. Codefendant Lotz Benches-ter Farms (Lotz) also filed a erossclaim against Farmland for indemnification or contribution. This crossclaim was dismissed with prejudice by consent of the parties at trial. In October 1990 codefendant Lotz and Ideal entered into an agreement in which Ideal agreed not to seek a judgment against Lotz.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">Trial began on January 2 and ended on March 22, 1991. The trial judge was scheduled to retire on February 1, 1991. However, by order dated January 16, 1991, and pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:6A-13, the Supreme Court recalled him for temporary service without pay, for the specific purpose of completing the trial. On October 10, 1991 the Supreme Court again temporarily recalled the judge for the purpose of writing the opinion and entering judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">On September 30, 1991 the judge issued an opinion with his findings of fact and conclusions of law. The judge found that: 1) there was a campaign by Farmland and its codefendant distributors to attack Ideal in a predatory fashion; 2) Farmland offered to sell milk to Ideal customers below cost; 3) Farmland practiced \u201cpredatory pricing\u201d and solicited Ideal\u2019s customers for the sole purpose of injuring Ideal and intimidating other distributors who were considering dropping Farmland as a supplier of milk; 4) the codefendant distributors conspired with Farmland against Ideal; 5) Moffett, the director of DDI, did not conspire with Farmland against Ideal; and 6) Farmland had a \u201chold\u201d on its co-conspirator distributors due to the fact that these small distributors relied on Farmland for products and were indebted to Farmland through its generous credit policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>The judge concluded that Farmland was liable to Ideal under the New Jersey Antitrust Act and the common-law, for tortious interference with economic advantage. Ideal\u2019s claim for common-law unfair competition was held subsumed in these claims. With respect to the Antitrust Act, the judge determined that there was a \u201cper se\u201d violation based upon the combined efforts of the defendants to damage Ideal. The judge rejected Ideal\u2019s \u201cracketeering\u201d claims under New Jersey and federal RICO statutes and its civil conspiracy claim under 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1983, 1985, and 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">With respect to damages, the judge acknowledged that \u201cthe convoluted method devised to measure plaintiffs losses [was] most troubling.\u201d He also recognized the fact that Ideal lost some of the most important records pertaining to damages while the case was pending, and stated that he found this \u201castonishing\u201d in light of the time, effort, and personal attention given to the case by Ideal\u2019s executives. Although the loss of documents created \u201cdifficulty in corroborating the damage claims,\u201d the judge nonetheless awarded compensatory damages in the full amount requested by Ideal, $1,302,871.99. The damage award was assessed solely against Farmland. The Goldmans and the distributors were found not liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">The judge also awarded punitive damages in the amount of $1,500,000 finding that the actions of Farmland were malicious, and that it was necessary to deter similar conduct in the future. The punitive damages were also assessed solely against Farmland, not against the codefendants and distributors. The judge reasoned that the distributors were not directly culpable but had participated because they were indebted to Farmland which was their only source of supply for milk.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">On October 22, 1991 the judge ruled that pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:9-12, the antitrust judgment would be entered for treble damages plus attorneys fees. On November 1, 1991 he entered a partial judgment in favor of Ideal and against Farmland. On the common-law claim, the sum was $2,840,191.42, which consisted of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>$1,302,871.99 in compensatory damages, $37,319.43 in prejudgment interest, and $1,500,000 in punitive damages. On the antitrust violation, judgment was entered in the sum of $3,945,935.40, plus attorneys fees and expenses to be fixed at a later date. This sum was $1,302,871.99 in compensatory damages which, by operation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:9-12, was automatically trebled to $3,908,615.97, plus $37,319.43 in prejudgment interest, on compensatory damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">On February 14, 1992 Farmland moved to vacate the judge\u2019s opinion and partial money judgment, arguing that he was constitutionally incompetent to exercise the authority of the Superior Court because he was engaged in the practice of law at the time he was recalled for temporary service by the Supreme Court. The motion was denied. We denied Farmland\u2019s request for leave to appeal on this issue on March 13, 1992. The Supreme Court then denied Farmland\u2019s request to certify the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">On February 18, 1992 a newly-assigned judge entered an order certifying the judgment as final for purposes of execution, pursuant to <em>R. </em>4:42-2. On April 1, 1992, there being no outstanding issues, Farmland filed its notice of appeal with this court from the whole of the February 18, 1992 order certifying the judgment as final, and the whole of the November 1, 1991 partial money judgment, except paragraphs six, seven, and eight.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">On June 12, 1992 Farmland and Ideal stipulated to $1,822,576 for attorneys fees and costs under the Antitrust Act, if Farmland\u2019s liability under the Act were upheld. An order reflecting this agreement was entered on June 26, 1992. On June 24,1992 Ideal filed a notice of cross-appeal from the judgment \u201cif interpreted not to allow collection of punitive damages in addition to treble damages.\u201d .Farmland later filed an amended notice of appeal from the order regarding attorneys fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">The dairy products distribution industry is a low-margin, highly competitive business which includes major milk processors, smaller milk processors, dealers and distributors, and retail <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>stores. At the wholesale level, raw milk is bought from farmers by the processors and bottled for sale. Processors sell their milk to retail outlets directly, and also to dealers and distributors who in turn re-sell the milk under their own label to retail stores. There are three general types of wholesale milk customers: supermarket chains, large independent supermarkets, and small retail grocery stores, known in the trade as \u201cmom and pop\u201d stores.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">The dairy industry is heavily regulated by both federal and state agencies. The Federal Milk Marketing Board determines the price which processors of raw milk must pay to dairy farmers. These prices are set monthly based on the class and fat content of the milk. A class is a federally established price per hundredweight to be paid in a specific month to a farmer in a certain geographical area. On the State level, the DDI, as a Division of the New Jersey Department of Agriculture, oversees the licensing of dairy dealers and distributors, monitors compliance with reporting requirements, and ensures that milk is not sold below cost by either the wholesaler or the retailer.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">DDI cost regulations which governed the New Jersey dairy industry in 1986 precluded the sale of milk below the \u201caverage total cost.\u201d <em>See N.J.A.C. </em>2:52-6.2 (repealed 1990). DDI regulations now prohibit the sale of milk below the \u201caverage variable cost.\u201d <em>See N.J.A.C. </em>2:52-7.1. Average total cost is calculated by allocating all costs of doing business to each unit of fluid milk product sold. The DDI also sets the \u201cpresumptive cost price\u201d of milk (PGP), applicable only at the retail level. This is the price at or above which a retailer may sell milk to consumers without being challenged by the DDI for selling \u201cbelow cost.\u201d Throughout 1986, the POP was $1.79 per gallon of whole milk.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">In order for a dealer, distributor, or retail outlet to change the source of its milk supply, a DDI-11 form, also known as a \u201cchange form,\u201d was filed with the DDI. A fourteen-day waiting period was mandated between the time the notice was filed and the time the new supplier could start serving the customer. The customer was required to pay in full all outstanding balances to the old supplier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>before the new supplier could begin service. The DDI-11 form required the new supplier to certify, by signature, that the supplier\u2019s prices were above its costs. A \u201crescind notice\u201d could be sent by the customer in order to void the change notice. Both change and rescind notices were kept in a DDI log book compiled on a monthly basis. After reviewing a request to change a supplier, the DDI director would issue a \u201cpermission to serve\u201d notice authorizing the switch. Permission was granted if the offer to serve was above the dealer\u2019s \u201ccost of milk,\u201d as computed by DDI methodology, and the customer had paid its outstanding balance to the previous supplier.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">Farmland was a major milk processor as well as a dealer-distributor for the New York-New Jersey metropolitan area. In February 1986, Jacob Goldman and his son, Mark Goldman, ran Farmland which sold to all three categories of retail customers under its own label, as well as to other dealers who in turn relabeled and re-sold the milk to their own retail customers. Ideal was owned and operated by Gilbert Levine and Mark Greenberg. Since 1980, Ideal has been a dealer-distributor of dairy and dairy-related products, selling primarily to mom and pop stores in the northern New Jersey area.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">From 1980 to 1985, Ideal sold milk and dairy products supplied by Farmland. Ideal president Levine testified that he became dissatisfied with this arrangement. Ideal\u2019s volume of sales had steadily decreased from six million dollar's in 1980 to four or five million dollars in 1985. Ideal\u2019s complaints included Farmland\u2019s mislabeling of its milk, poor milk quality, high wholesale prices, persistent mistakes in filling orders, and rodent infestation at Farmland\u2019s processing plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">In addition, Farmland and Tuscan, one of Farmland\u2019s principal wholesaling and processing rivals, were involved in a \u201cmilk war\u201d in early 1985. Farmland and Tuscan were actively soliciting each other\u2019s customers. The fight seems to have started when Farmland took the Grand Union supermarket chain from Tuscan. To make up for the loss in sales and volume, Tuscan solicited the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>accounts of Farmland and its dealers. Farmland responded in kind, resulting in the filing of hundreds of DDI-11 change notices over a period of several months. Ideal had received ten DDI-11 change notices in one week as a result of the Farmland-Tuscan war; Levine was afraid of losing even more Ideal business to Tuscan in the future if he remained a Farmland distributor.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">Thus, effective March 15, 1985, Levine terminated Ideal\u2019s relationship with Farmland and became a dealer of Tuscan. When Levine and his partner informed Farmland president, Mark Goldman, he allegedly angrily stated: \u201cYou\u2019re making the biggest mistake of your life. You\u2019re not going to be in business when I\u2019m done with you. You\u2019re going to those Nazis.\u201d At a later date, Goldman allegedly stated: \u201cEvery quart from you I\u2019m going to get. You won\u2019t be in business when I\u2019m done with you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Shortly after Ideal gave Farmland notice that it was switching to Tuscan, Consolidated Dairies, another of Farmland\u2019s dealers, notified Farmland that it also was changing its source of milk supply to Tuscan. Consolidated Dairies and Ideal were two of Farmland\u2019s largest dealers.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">In the summer of 1985, one of Ideal\u2019s larger retail accounts, Seavra Supermarket, switched to Farmland. Seavra did a weekly volume of $850. When Levine spoke with Jacob Goldman about the loss of this account Goldman allegedly stated: \u201cThat was just to teach you a lesson; I told you [you] shouldn\u2019t have gone; you shouldn\u2019t have left; that\u2019s just to teach you a lesson.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">In February 1986, Ideal had a customer base of about 500 to 600 mom and pop accounts. Ideal\u2019s prices to those stores for a gallon of whole milk was in the $2.00 to $2.20 range. In that month, many of Ideal\u2019s accounts were solicited by Farmland. Levine received forty-eight DDI-11 change notices\u2014forty-five of them arriving within four days, and nineteen of them arriving on one day. Consolidated Dairies received about the same number of change notices from Farmland for this period, while Tuscan received one. Of the forty-eight Ideal accounts involved, Levine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>estimated that the weekly volume ranged from $40 per week to $900 a week.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Levine was surprised by the solicitation activity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>since he believed that major processors were not interested in serving the smaller mom and pop stores which comprised Ideal\u2019s customer base. However, DDI investigative reports showed that two of the accounts solicited by Farmland in February 1986 were visited at the specific request of the customer and that several other solicited accounts complained to DDI investigators that they were dissatisfied with Ideal\u2019s pricing and service.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Moffett stayed the change notices pending an investigation of \u201c[tjhis unusual activity in the marketplace.\u201d Levine met with DDI Director Moffett on March 4, 1986 to discuss the Farmland solicitations, which Levine believed were below Farmland\u2019s cost. On March 6, 1986 Moffett interviewed Farmland sales personnel and determined that the lowest offer made by any Farmland representative was $1.79 per gallon of whole milk, with up to \u201cthree free weeks\u201d as an incentive. A DDI auditor updated Farmland\u2019s average total cost according to the agency\u2019s methodology. The auditor calculated Farmland\u2019s average total cost at $1.62 per gallon of whole milk delivered. Since the difference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>between the lowest offer and Farmland\u2019s cost was seventeen cents, Moffett concluded that Farmland\u2019s offers were not in violation of DDI cost regulations. He lifted the temporary stay and issued \u201cpermission to change\u201d notices which officially released the solicited accounts or \u201cstops\u201d to Farmland. Moffett concluded that the cost differential was large enough to cover the lowest offer plus three free weeks. Subsequent to releasing the stops, Moffett reviewed reports from field investigators and verified that the lowest Farmland offer was the same as reported by the sales staff. Ideal did not appeal the DDI determination regarding Farmland\u2019s costs, or its decision to release the stops. Nor did Ideal seek a formal, adjudicative-type hearing before the Office of Administrative Law under the Administrative Procedure Act and the Administrative Rules of Practice, as permitted at the time. <em>See N.J.A.C. </em>2:1-3.4(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">At trial, Moffet acknowledged that he occasionally socialized with Jacob and Mark Goldman: he attended Mark Goldman\u2019s wedding, had dinner once at Jacob Goldman\u2019s home, and attended Jacob Goldman\u2019s thirty-fifth wedding anniversary celebration. Also, Jacob Goldman referred Moffett to a car dealer where Moffett purchased cars. At the time of the Ideal solicitations, Moffett was assisting Farmland in its attempt to enter the New York market. Specifically, Moffett had testified on Farmland\u2019s behalf at a licensing hearing held in New York and had written letters on Farmland\u2019s behalf. According to Levine, Jacob Goldman once told him that \u201cWoody [Moffett] was in his hip pocket.\u201d Levine also testified that in 1984, when he was selling his late father\u2019s car, Goldman asked him to sell it to Moffet for less than the asking price in return for $4000-$5000 off Ideal\u2019s milk bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">In response to this potential erosion of Ideal\u2019s customer base, Levine and his sales staff visited the solicited accounts and offered to meet Farmland\u2019s offers. Levine testified that if Ideal had not attempted to save these accounts, it would have gone out of business. The potential loss of customers \u201cpunched holes\u201d in Ideal\u2019s existing route structure, and made each of its nine routes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>unprofitable. A \u201cmilk route\u201d consists of a number of stops in a particular time period and geographic location served by a truck and driver. A number of factors determine whether a route can be profitable; <em>i.e., </em>the pricing of the milk along the route, geographic location, the number of stops, and the amount of time needed to traverse the route. The average route has about thirty stops.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Of the forty-eight change notices filed by Farmland on Ideal accounts, Ideal retained forty customers by renegotiating its whole milk prices. Ideal also continued to serve three other accounts which it claimed Farmland solicited but did not serve.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">As a result of Farmland\u2019s solicitation campaign, Ideal claimed that its pricing structure and its relationship with customers was ruined. The customers were distrustful because they believed that they had been overcharged in the past by Ideal. Additionally, Levine was forced to expend enormous time and energy in retaining his customer base. Levine believed that Farmland never intended to service any of the solicited stores but instead had intended to \u201ctorch\u201d Ideal\u2019s customers, <em>i.e., </em>offer inducements and pricing so low that it would be unprofitable for any competitor to serve that customer.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">As an example, Jose Marmolejos, owner of Queen Supermarket, testified that a Farmland salesman offered him a price of $1.82 per gallon as opposed to the $2.12 per gallon he was paying to Ideal, and two free weeks of milk and refrigeration as an inducement. He accepted Farmland\u2019s offer and tried to get the same deal for stores owned by his cousins. However, the Farmland salesman was only interested in servicing stores which carried Ideal milk, .stating \u201cwe want to hurt them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">Although Levine had received three DDI-11 change notices from Danny Noto, owner of co-defendant Hohnecker Dairy, Noto informed Levine that he had not personally solicited any of Ideal\u2019s accounts and had not signed any DDI-11 change forms. These accounts were in Plainfield, and Noto operated primarily in Hudson and Bergen Counties. Noto told Levine that he did not know <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>where Plainfield was located, and furthermore knew nothing about the change notices filed in his name.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">When Noto was deposed on May 28, 1986 (he was dead at the time of trial) he explained that he had given Frank Ferrante, a Farmland salesman, a general authorization to canvass for customers on behalf of Hohnecker Dairy. As a result of Farmland\u2019s February 1986 solicitation campaign, Farmland had given Noto two non-ideal stops worth about $700 a week.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Farmland salesman Ferrante was deposed on May 28, 1986. He admitted that he signed DDI-11 change foims on behalf of Noto and other Farmland dealers. However, he did not believe this was improper since he was authorized to do this by the dealers. Ferrante also explained that if a stop was solicited for a particular dealer, and that dealer did not operate within the area of that stop, he would arrange to swap a more suitable Farmland stop in its place.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">At trial, Ferrante stated that it was necessary to placate Farmland dealers who had lost customers to competing dairies by soliciting new business on their behalf. Regarding the February 1986 sales campaign, he explained that he signed the dealers\u2019 names to DDI-11 forms in order to keep track of which solicitations were made on behalf of which dealers. Ferrante stated that he did not intend to deceive anyone, and that Mark Goldman had not approved of his actions in signing dealers names when he discovered this.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">In March 1989, after the commencement of this litigation, Levine moved Ideal documents to a public storage facility. These documents were destroyed by the facility when Levine failed to pay monthly storage fees. Levine stated that he- did not read the rental agreement and was not aware that the storage facility did not send out monthly bills as reminders to its customers to pay rent. Although he did not recall either seeing or paying a bill from March to December 1989, Levine made no inquiry regarding the status of his storage contract. He was shocked when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>storage facility told him in December that his documents had been destroyed in August 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">Levine did not retain a list of all of the documents which he stored off premises; however, they included invoices as well as accounts-receivable ledgers and delivery tickets (documenting the number of deliveries and items purchased by a customer each week), and computerized listings of accounts receivables. At the time of the trial, few records existed of payments by customers for the period 1986-1989, and no delivery tickets existed for that same period. Retailers for which Ideal claimed damage for the years 1986-1996 included stores which had ceased to do business as of the date of trial, stores which had not been Ideal customers in February 1986, and stores which were not Ideal customers at the time of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">On cross-examination Levine verified income statement balance sheets for various years, prepared for Ideal by its accounting firm. The documents showed a steady increase of Ideal\u2019s sales, net profit, and net worth. Levine acknowledged that since Ideal had become a dealer in 1980, its best year in terms of net income was 1986. In 1985, the year before Farmland\u2019s solicitations which sparked this law suit, Ideal\u2019s total sales were about $4,270,000. During 1986 Ideal\u2019s total sales rose to about $5,620,000. By 1989 Ideal\u2019s total sales rose to about $7,460,000. Its net worth also increased substantially from 1985 to 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">Robert Havemeyer testified on behalf of Ideal as an expert in cost-accounting, business planning, and marketing, as those specialties related to the dairy industry. He stated that Ideal\u2019s average price per gallon of whole milk in February 1986 to all its customers was $2.11.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">In calculating Farmland\u2019s costs, Havemeyer utilized a concept called \u201ceconomic cost.\u201d This sum was comprised of Farmland\u2019s average total cost plus a profit margin or return on investment. Havemeyer believed a return on investment was a cost of doing business, like any other traditional cost of doing business.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>Havemeyer calculated Farmland\u2019s average total cost at $1.82 per gallon of whole milk, and its profit margin or economic cost at twenty to twenty-five cents per gallon. Based on these figures, Havemeyer opined that Farmland needed about $2.05 per gallon in order to obtain a profitable price for its milk. On this analysis, he believed that all of Farmland\u2019s offers to Ideal customers in February 1986 were below Farmland\u2019s costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">The figure of $1.82 for average total cost was derived from a document that was part of the DDI\u2019s audit of Farmland for the year 1986. It reflected a breakdown of cost-per-gallon based on delivery by trailer versus delivery by straight truck. The cost for truck delivery was higher. The DDI document listed Farmland\u2019s costs as approximately $1.71 per gallon delivered by trailer, and approximately $1.84 delivered by truck. Havemeyer assumed all deliveries to small stores would be made by truck and relied on the higher figure when computing Farmland\u2019s cost. Havemeyer rejected the DDI average total cost figure of $1.62 for Farmland, which was based on an update of a pre-1986 audit. He said it did not take into consideration increased labor costs and operating costs, or the costs of improvements made by Farmland.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">Havemeyer concluded that taking into account the prices offered and the large number of solicitations over a short period of time, one could infer predatory conduct and intent from an economic point of view on the part of all defendants. He also concluded that Farmland engaged in \u201csimulated competition\u201d when it solicited Ideal\u2019s customers, and was interested only in destroying or \u201ctorching\u201d Ideal\u2019s stops. He based this belief on the lack of preparation by Farmland for its solicitation campaign; the lack of records documenting the offers; the solicitation of stops that would not fit into an existing Farmland route; the bunching of DDI-11 change notices for maximum effect; the refusal to serve some of the solicited stops; the failure to pay a follow-up visit to successfully solicited stops; and the failure to continue solicitation of mom and pop stores after February 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>With respect to the issue of damages, Havemeyer believed that a customer relationship in the dairy industry had an ascertainable value tied to the dairy\u2019s route structure. He calculated total damages through a two-part analysis. With respect to customers that Ideal retained at reduced prices, Havemeyer used a \u201clost income\u201d methodology that accounted for Ideal\u2019s drop in price to each solicited customer. With respect to customers that Ideal lost, Havemeyer calculated the average number of \u201ccans\u201d per delivery for each lost customer and assigned a value to the account based on its \u201ccan value.\u201d The number of quarts divided by forty determined the equivalent number of cans. He noted that can values were commonly used in the milk industry to value a route or a dairy, especially in the New York metropolitan area. Based on Levine\u2019s representation that Ideal kept its customers for an average of sixteen years, Havemeyer took these two damages figures and conservatively carried them forward for ten years. The sum of the two figures comprised the amount of damages. Havemeyer calculated Ideal\u2019s total damages at $1,388,811.69. In arriving at this figure, he converted future losses to present value.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">In defense of the claim, Farmland president Mark Goldman described fiercely competitive conditions in early 1985 when all of Farmland\u2019s customers were heavily solicited by Tuscan, including customers served by Farmland dealers, such as Ideal. In response, Farmland solicited all of Tuscan\u2019s customers, including small mom and pop stores. Goldman testified that due to the loss of distributors such as Ideal and Consolidated in 1985 and early 1986, Farmland was operating at fifty to sixty percent of total plant capacity. Ideal\u2019s departure to Tuscan represented a significant loss in volume to Farmland. Although Goldman acknowledged telling Levine that he was making a mistake by going with Tuscan, he denied telling Levine that Farmland would put Ideal out of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">In the latter part of 1985, Farmland decided to increase its solicitation activity in order to increase volume. Farmland targeted two market areas: Staten Island and northern New Jersey. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>Since Staten Island was a new market for Farmland, Goldman anticipated close scrutiny by the New York regulatory agencies. In order to ensure that he would not be accused of selling milk \u201cbelow cost,\u201d Goldman computed his average total costs in December 1985. Updating the latest DDI audit of Farmland, Goldman determined that Farmland\u2019s \u201caverage total cost\u201d was $1.62 per gallon of \u2019whole milk.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">In February 1986 Farmland began soliciting new business in New Jersey, focusing primarily on mom and pop stores. Because there was additional route capacity due to Farmland\u2019s recent loss of business in New Jersey, the solicited mom and pop stores could be served without incurring extra delivery costs. Farmland salesmen targeted Ideal customers because Ideal\u2019s average price per gallon of whole miilk was vulnerable, twenty-two cents higher than Farmland\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Goldman testified that of the forty-eight Ideal stops which Farmland solicited in February 1986, it retained only two stops which Farmland served continuously up to the time of trial: Little Joe\u2019s at a volume of $50 per week and Town Mini Mart at a volume of $500 per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Farmland salesman Ferrante testified that in February 1986, after Farmland was granted a New York license, the sales force embarked on a new sales campaign in New Jersey. They were instructed to target Tuscan customers in an effort to recover volume lost to Tuscan in the \u201cmilk war\u201d of early 1985. These sales personnel were aware that Ideal, Consolidated, and other distributors were under the Tuscan umbrella. The sales force was given the same pricing brackets in effect in Farmland\u2019s New York market. Three free weeks of milk were included in the bracket prices. Free refrigeration was not factored because the refrigeration unit remained Farmland property and would revert to Farmland if the customer switched suppliers. The lowest bracket price was $1.79 per gallon of whole milk; however, the sales force made higher offers, depending on their perception of what the customer was charged by the current supplier. Farmland sales personnel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>used the same price brackets with non-ideal stops, again basing their offers on what they believed the customer\u2019s current price was.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Ferrante explained that the sales force was instructed to give one price and stick to it, so as not to appear in a bidding war with another supplier. Ferrante also believed that a firm offer made Farmland more credible with the customer. He thought that the solicitation of Ideal stops had produced many change notices because Ideal\u2019s prices were much higher.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">Donald Mion, owner of codefendant Staal\u2019s Dairy, testified that when he solicited on behalf of Staal\u2019s, he usually offered an extremely low price because he knew he could make up the difference in the coming months from the fluctuating price of milk. When there was a decrease in raw milk prices, he would not pass along the entire decrease to his retail customers. He also would make up some of his lost profit on other, non-milk items in the product line, such as juices.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">Mion was asked to attend a meeting held by the DDI in connection with the February 1986 solicitations by Farmland. He was asked about the number of change notices, and explained that because his accounts were heavily solicited, he in turn had to compensate for the business he was losing. Mion also denied asking Moffett to use his office to hurt Ideal.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">Mion described competition as very tough. Although Staal\u2019s had a one-truck operation, his customers had been solicited by Tuscan and Consolidated. In order to compete, Mion matched prices or offered free weeks. In February 1986, when Staal\u2019s stops were heavily solicited by Tuscan and Consolidated, Mion lost a total of $2000 per week in sales, representing half of his weekly sales. Mion requested and received help from Ferrante in soliciting replacement stops. In addition, Farmland dropped its price to Staal\u2019s by fifteen cents per gallon in order to help Mion match competing offers and provided two free weeks for one particular account Mion was trying to retain. Although Staal\u2019s lost profits in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>the short run, it regained them within one year because of periodic fluctuations in the price of milk.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">Vincent Puzino, vice president of eodefendant V. Puzino Dairy, testified that he ran a two-truck operation. In February 1986, a \u201cmilk war\u201d erupted, resulting in Consolidated and Tuscan coming after all his customers. Puzino was forced to visit his accounts and lower his prices in order to meet the competition. He eventually lost two customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">In response to the solicitation of his customers, Puzino solicited any store that carried a label which he knew represented Tuscan milk. Forty stops were solicited over a four or five-month period, including some Ideal stops. Puzino tried to make up any lost profits by selling more non-milk products with higher profit margins.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Puzino personally solicited Central Supermarket, an Ideal customer for which damages were claimed at trial. This customer was dissatisfied with Ideal and agreed to switch based on a reduction of a few pennies per gallon and a new refrigerator case. Puzino also successfully solicited Big Banner Supermarket with an offer of five weeks free milk and a few cents lower than Ideal on gallons of whole milk. Puzino continued to serve both Central Supermarket and Big Banner to the time of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">Puzino did not receive help from Farmland during the period of heavy solicitations, and described Farmland\u2019s attitude as disinterested. He had no relationship with Goldman, whom he disliked, did not discuss his solicitations of Big Banner and Central Supermarket with any Farmland representative, and did not discuss his pricing with Farmland. Puzino denied entering into an agreement with anyone to put Ideal out of business and denied that Farmland threatened to withhold credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">Arthur Thiel, who was employed by the DDI as a supervisor and auditor, testified on behalf of Farmland concerning the methodology utilized by the agency to determine \u201caverage total cost.\u201d The DDI took all expenses for a one-year period and divided that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>figure by all the quarts of milk sold in that same one-year period. The DDI also recognized categories of cost within its analysis. For example, processing dairies may sell to dealers who pick up at the dock, or to customers where delivery is an expense. Thus, the DDI recognizes different \u201ccost centers\u201d and computes separate dock prices and delivery prices.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Free weeks of milk did not enter into the computation; this was considered a revenue item. In computing whether an offer was below average total cost, an offer of free milk was pro-rated over one year, unless there was a contract specifying a longer period of time. When an offer was challenged, the DDI procedure was to update the latest audit by factoring in changes in the cost of raw milk. There was no attempt to update changes in labor or other costs, although the dealer was given an opportunity to submit such data if the DDI determined there was a \u201cbelow cost\u201d pricing problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">Thiel was involved in Farmland\u2019s 1986 audit, during which the DDI prepared a study related to delivery costs: straight truck delivery versus trailer delivery. Thiel acknowledged that this study was done as an experiment, based on only five months of Farmland data (August to December 1986), and was never intended to be conclusive. According to Thiel, the study bore no relationship to Farmland\u2019s actual costs of delivery by truck or trailer. It was undertaken because the DDI director wished to extract data quantifying the savings to the dairies from trailer delivery versus truck delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">Ronald Knutson testified on behalf of Farmland as an expert in agricultural and dairy economics. Knutson testified that sales below average total costs, limited to a segment of customers, did not adversely affect the profit of a dairy processor since other customers, and other products having higher profit margins, would cover the loss. Non-fat milk items, cottage cheese, yogurt, and juices, for example, normally have higher margins than whole milk. Fluid milk sales accounted for only fifty to sixty percent of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>Farmland sales, with the remainder of sales comprised of other dairy-related products.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">Knutson supervised an analysis of Farmland\u2019s customers for the period of February 1986 to determine customer distribution and general pricing trends. He determined that approximately two-thirds or sixty percent of Farmland\u2019s accounts were customers of $600 per week or less. Of that group, fourteen percent were customers purchasing $100 per week or less. Large processors would want such smaller accounts because they were not as informed about changes in the. price of raw milk as supermarket chains, and would not be as resistant to price increases. Additionally, smaller accounts were usually cash customers, and allowed the processor to efficiently utilize existing route structures.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Knutson disagreed with Havemeyer\u2019s theory of damages, premised on the assumption that a wholesale customer in the milk industry had an ascertainable value. The risk that a customer would switch suppliers was very real, making it impossible to attribute any certainty to the relationship and to assign any value to the customer, who was free to switch suppliers at any time. Although milk routes, as opposed to customers, were assigned value and sometimes bought and sold, Knutson noted that sale of a route did not entitle a dealer to the customers on the route. Knutson thought that Havemeyer\u2019s procedure for establishing the value of stores solicited by Farmland had no economic merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">Knutson also conducted a statistical analysis of Farmland\u2019s prices to all customers in February 1986, and determined that the mean was $1.89.3 cents, with a standard deviation of 8.4 cents. Based on this analysis, Knutson concluded that Farmland\u2019s prices generally ranged between $1.80 and $1.90 per gallon.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">Richard Robbins, a partner with the Arthur Anderson accounting firm, testified on behalf of Farmland as a cost-accounting expert. Robbins calculated Farmland\u2019s cost of milk for the period January through March 1986 under two different standards: average total cost as calculated by DDI methodology, and average variable cost using standard cost-accounting methodology. Utiliz<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>ing average total cost, the figure was $1.61.06 per gallon of whole milk; using an average variable cost standard, the figure was $1.51.682 per gallon of whole milk.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">Robbins concluded that Ideal did not have sufficient records for an analysis of damages because it lacked important documents pertaining to billing, accounts receivable, and cash collections. The limited invoices on specific customers were not representative, and did not allow Robbins to compute revenue to any particular customer. Robbins also noted that, from an audit point of view, an invoice is not documentation that a sale has occurred. There should be some evidence that the item was actually shipped and received. Nor did the invoices show returns or rebates to Ideal customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">Robbins believed that Havemeyer did not use generally-accepted accounting methods when he estimated a four-cent increase in the cost of transportation and added that sum to the DDI calculation of Farmland\u2019s average total cost. Since Havemeyer could have obtained historical information from Farmland regarding its delivery costs, Robbins thought that an estimate should not have been used.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">Based on these facts, Ideal claimed that the defendants conspired in restraint of trade to damage or destroy Ideal through a \u201cbelow cost\u201d predatory pricing scheme. Farmland\u2019s motive was to \u201cteach [Ideal] a lesson for switching suppliers and to prevent future defections among the ranks of Farmland distributors.\u201d This conduct was alleged to constitute a \u201cper se\u201d violation of the Antitrust Act. As noted, Ideal also claimed common-law tortious interference with prospective economic advantage. The trial judge found in Ideal\u2019s favor under both the antitrust and tortious interference theories.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">Farmland vigorously disputes the judge\u2019s legal conclusion of a predatory pricing scheme. The key issue on this appeal concerns the conclusion of law, rather than the findings of fact. With respect to the antitrust claim, Farmland contends that the judge erred by (1) evaluating its conduct under a \u201cper se\u201d standard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>rather than a \u201crule of reason\u201d standard; (2) using an incorrect standard in deciding whether Farmland\u2019s pricing was predatory and using an incorrect cost standard to decide whether Farmland\u2019s pricing was \u201cpredatory;\u201d and (3) using an incorrect cost standard to determine whether Farmland\u2019s prices were below its costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">With respect-to the tortious interference claim, Farmland claims that the judge erred in concluding that the evidence was sufficient to support a finding that Farmland acted with legal \u201cmalice,\u201d an essential element of the tort. Farmland contends that the judge mistakenly assumed that ill-will or malevolent intent satisfied the legal malice element.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">The judge concluded that Farmland incited and engaged in a conspiracy in restraint of trade to damage Ideal which constituted a \u201cper se\u201d violation of the Antitrust Act. Farmland asserts legal error in this finding, contending that its conduct must be judged under the \u201crule of reason,\u201d rather than a \u201cper se\u201d standard. Farmland claims that the law is well-settled that only conduct which unreasonably restricts competition violates antitrust law. Ideal contends for the \u201cper se\u201d standard, or at least a modified \u201crule of reason\u201d standard, justified by the judge\u2019s finding that Farmland had an anti-competitive purpose for its conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">The scope of appellate review in a non-jury trial is limited. An appellate court should \u201cnot disturb the factual findings and legal conclusions of the trial judge unless ... convinced that they are so manifestly unsupported by or inconsistent with the competent, relevant and reasonably credible evidence as to offend the interests of justice____\u201d <em>Rova Farms Resort, Inc. v. Investors Ins. Co., </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>474, 483-84, 323 A.2d 495 (1974). We accept the fact-finding of the trial judge. But we find error in the application of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number> The overriding purpose of the New Jersey Antitrust Act is to advance public policy in favor of competition and prevent practices which deprive consumers of the benefit of competitive markets. <em>Boardwalk Properties, Inc. v. BPHC Acquisition, Inc., </em>253 <em>N.J.Super. </em>515, 530, 602 A.2d 733 (App.Div.1991). The Legislature intended the Act as consistent with federal antitrust law, and expressly provided that it \u201cbe construed in harmony with ruling judicial interpretations of comparable Federal antitrust statutes and to effectuate, insofar as practicable, a uniformity in the laws of those states which enact it.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:9-18. <em>See also State v.

As agreed by the parties, two principal methods for evaluation of '\u00a7 1 claims have emerged in federal antitrust law: the rule of reason and the per se rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">The rule of reason originated in the early part of this century. The Supreme Court recognized that a literal approach to \u00a7 1 Sherman Act claims would be unworkable because \u201c[elvery agreement concerning trade, ..., restrains. To bind, to restrain, is of their very essence.\u201d <em>Chicago Bd. of Trade v. United States, </em>246 <em>U.S. </em>231, 238, 38 <em>S.Ct. </em>242, 244, 62 <em>L.Ed. </em>683, 687 (1918). In order to allow commerce to proceed unfettered by the fear of unwarranted legal interference, the Court developed an approach to \u00a7 1 claims rooted in common-law principles of reasonableness; <em>i.e., </em>only restraints of trade which were \u201cunreasonably restrictive of competitive conditions\u201d were deemed illegal. <em>Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey v.

For example, the Court has analyzed such traditional \u201cper se\u201d practices as horizontal price-fixing, group boycotts, and tying arrangements under what some courts have dubbed an abbreviated or \u201cquick look\u201d rule of reason. <em>See United States v. Brown Univ., supra, </em>5 F.3d at 669. In \u201cquick look\u201d cases, a court determines that the challenged restraint, although inherently suspect, should not necessarily be regarded as illegal per se. Although the court presumes anticompetitive effect, it nonetheless will balance this adverse effect against any proeompetitive justification advanced by defendant. <em>NCAA v. Board of Regents of the Univ. of Oklahoma, supra, </em>468 <em>U.S. </em>at 109-110, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2965, 82 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 89.

Federal courts concur in their reasoning on this point. As explained in <em>Mid-West Underground Storage, Inc., supra, </em>through years of experience with antitrust litigation, courts have recognized that certain conduct is always characterized by a \u201cpernicious effect on competition and lack of any redeeming virtue.\u201d 717 F.2d at 496. However, conspiracies to eliminate or harm a competitor by unfair means \u201chave not been shown to be consistently anticompetitive ... and may actually have a beneficial effect on competition by facilitating new entry or otherwise decreasing concentration.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">This rationale is particularly applicable under the facts of the present case, where the specific unfair conduct alleged, offering allegedly below-cost prices which forced Ideal to lower its own prices, resulted in a more competitive market environment. <em>Cf. Brooke Group Ltd. v. Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp., </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>-,-, 113 <em>S.Ct. </em>2578, 2587-89, 125 L.Ed.2d 168, 186-88 (1993) (in antitrust action where plaintiff alleged a predatory pricing scheme, evidence of below-cost pricing was not alone sufficient to permit an inference of injury to competition); <em>George R. Whitten, Jr., Inc. v. Paddock Pool Builders, Inc., supra, </em>508 F.2d at 562 (offensive and unethical behavior which does not adversely affect the market in issue does not exceed the bounds of reason).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">Other states with uniform antitrust statutes similar to New Jersey\u2019s have followed the rationale of the federal decisions. <em>See, e.g., UXB Sand &amp; Gravel, Inc. v. Rosenfeld Concrete Corp., </em>599 A.2d 1033, 1036-37 (R.I.1991) (plaintiffs claim that defendants conspired to eliminate it as a competitor should be judged under \u201crule of reason\u201d); <em>Independent Milk Producers Co-op v.

Our own Supreme Court has acknowledged the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>\u201cjudicial reluctance to extend \u2018per se\u2019 rules under [the Sherman Act.]\u201d <em>State v. Lawn King, supra, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>at 196, 417 A.2d 1025.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Ideal relies on earlier decisions from the First Circuit which held that a conspiracy to eliminate a competitor by unfair means was a per se \u00a7 1 Sherman Act violation. <em>Atlantic Heel Co. v. Allied Heel Co., </em>284 F.2d 879 (1st Cir.1960); <em>Albert Pick-Barth Co. v. Mitchell Woodbury Corp., </em>57 F.2d 96, 102 (1st Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>286 <em>U.S. </em>552, 52 <em>S.Ct. </em>503, 76 <em>L.Ed. </em>1288 (1932). The <em>Pick-Barth </em>doctrine has since been rejected by every federal circuit considering this issue, and is no longer considered authoritative. <em>See </em>cases cited <em>supra </em>at 181. <em>Pick-Barth </em>was ultimately criticized and rejected by the First Circuit, which no longer follows its reasoning. In <em>George R. Whitten, Jr., Inc. v. Paddock Pool Builders, Inc., supra, </em>a panel of the First Circuit explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-7\">Insofar as <em>Pick-Barth </em>and <em>Atlantic Heel </em>may be said to stand for the broad proposition that unfair competitive practices accompanied by an intent to hurt a competitor constitute per se violation of antitrust laws, we do not now accept their teaching. We do not feel it is necessary to criticize their results on the fact situations there presented\u2014an effort by a defendant which was a significant factor in the market to eliminate a competitor. These were instances ... of a sharply focused effort to drain off from a plaintiff its key personnel, confidential information, customer lists, and reputation. In the instant case the focus is not on crippling the organization of a competitor but on beating it in the market place. Perhaps the difference is only that between going to the jugular and going to one of the lesser arteries. But the difference, we feel, is enough. Paddock is leaving Whitten as an organization alone; it is concentrating on winning customers. Each customer is its target. Obviously it has subordinated business morality to its goal of more customers. <em>But we cannot say that such attempts, even though unfair and reprehensible, amount to a per se violation of the antitrust laws.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-8\">[508 F.2d at 561-62 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">We find Ideal\u2019s reliance on <em>Pick-Barth, supra, </em>and its progeny clearly misplaced. We also observe that the conduct in the present case is more in line with the conduct in <em>Whitten, supra, </em>and similarly may be characterized as an attack on lesser arteries, as opposed to an attack on the jugular. <em>See R. Posner, Economic Analysis of Law, </em>\u00a7 10.8 at 285-89, \u00a7 10.11 at 295-96 (3rd ed. 1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-10\">Ideal also argues that where a defendant\u2019s purpose is to destroy or eliminate a competitor, rather than merely to weaken it, a \u201cper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>se\u201d rule applies. Cases cited by Ideal in support of this proposition rely on the discredited reasoning of <em>Pick-Barth, supra, </em>and <em>Atlantic Heel, supra. Compare C. Albert Sauter Co. Inc. v. Richard Sauter Co., Inc., </em>368 <em>F.Supp. </em>501, 512-14 (E.D.Pa.1973); <em>Northeast Airlines Inc. v. Nationwide Charters and Conventions, Inc., </em>262 <em>F.Supp. </em>316, 319 (D.Mass.1966) (cited as courts which have followed the <em>Pick-Barth </em>doctrine), <em>until American Standard Life &amp; Acc. Ins. Co. v. U.R.L., Inc., </em>701 <em>F.Supp. </em>527, 535 (M.D.Pa. 1988) (recognizing that <em>Pick-Barth </em>per se doctrine is not the rule in the Third Circuit); <em>Robinson v.

Sigma Instruments, Inc., </em>481 <em>F.Supp. </em>1297, 1300 (D.Mass.1980) <em>(Pick Barth </em>allegations should be tested under \u201crule of reason\u201d standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">For reasons not clear to us, Ideal also relies on <em>United States v. Addyston Pipe &amp; Steel Co., </em>85 <em>F. </em>271 (6th Cir.1898), <em>aff'd, </em>175 <em>U.S. </em>211, 20 <em>S.Ct. </em>96, 44 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>136 (1899), which established the \u201cancillary restraint\u201d doctrine. This doctrine holds that where a certain restraint is unlawful on its face (\u201cper se\u201d) illegal, but is ancillary to some other lawful and justifiable business purpose, it will be judged under a reasonableness standard. <em>Id. </em>at 282. Since the <em>Addyston </em>doctrine actually expands the rule of reason category, we fail to see how it supports Ideal\u2019s position. Moreover, since the agreement or conduct in the present case is not one which falls within a recognized \u201cper se\u201d classification anyway, the ancillary restraint doctrine is not relevant to Ideal\u2019s presentation. <em>See Aydin Corp. v. Loral Corp., </em>718 F.2d 897, 901 (9th Cir.1983) (\u201cthe proper function of ancillarity in antitrust analysis \u2018is to remove the per se label from restraints otherwise falling within the category\u2019 ... [w]hether a restraint that does not fall within a per se category is ancillary to a valid agreement is relevant only in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>the sense that ancillarity increases the probability that the restraint will be found reasonable\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Ideal also argues that conduct which constitutes common-law unfair competition should constitute a per se violation of the Antitrust Act. Federal courts have overwhelmingly rejected this reasoning based on the conflicting policies of antitrust law and the law of unfair competition. Federal antitrust law is grounded exclusively in economic considerations. As noted in <em>Northwest Power Products, Inc. v. Omark Indus., Inc., supra, </em>the Sherman Act is intended to prevent restraints on all forms of competition, even competition which results from unfair practices. 576 <em>F.</em>2d at 88. On the other hand, state laws of unfair competition are grounded in ethical considerations, without regard to economics. Unfair competition laws are intended to restrain competition deemed ethically unprincipled, even if such competition is ultimately beneficial in the marketplace.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">Courts have reasoned that this fundamental conflict in the policies of federal antitrust law and state unfair-competition law mitigates against linking \u201cper se\u201d illegality under the Sherman Act with violation of unfair competition laws. <em>Ibid. </em>Recently, the Supreme Court reiterated that federal antitrust law does not create a federal law of unfair competition or purport to afford remedies for all business torts. <em>Brooke Group v. Brown &amp; Williamson, supra, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>at -, 113 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2589, 125 L.Ed.2d at 187. Even if Farmland\u2019s conduct constituted unfair competition under state law, this would have no bearing on our standard of review in this antitrust case.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-10\">Citing <em>United States v. United States Gypsum Co., </em>438 <em>U.S. </em>422, 435 n. 13, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>2864, 2872 n. 13, 57 L.Ed.2d 854, 869 n. 13 (1978), Ideal contends that a violation of the antitrust laws may be established by proof of <em>either </em>an unlawful purpose <em>or </em>an anticom-petitive effect. Thus, Ideal argues that since it adduced sufficient evidence that Farmland had an unlawful anticompetitive intent or purpose, it need not show anticompetitive effect. Again, this reasoning misconstrues the relevant decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>Purpose and effect are linked disjunctively in antitrust analysis. In order to establish a \u00a7 1 violation, a plaintiff must prove the existence of a contract or conspiracy in restraint of trade, and prove <em>either </em>an unlawful purpose <em>or </em>an anticompetitive effect. <em>McLain v. Real Estate Bd. of New Orleans, </em>444 <em>U.S. </em>232, 243, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>502, 510, 62 L.Ed.2d 441, 451 (1980). However, which of the two a plaintiff must establish turns on whether the challenged conduct is judged under the \u201cper se\u201d rule or the \u201crule of reason.\u201d The former only requires proof of intent, because anticompetitive effect has been presumed. <em>Northern Pacific Ry Co. v. United States, supra, </em>356 <em>U.S. </em>at 5, 78 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 518, 2 L.Ed.2d at 549-50; <em>Cernuto, Inc. v. United Cabinet Corp., </em>595 F.2d 164, 166 (3d Cir.1979). The latter requires proof of actual anticompetitive effect in order to show that the conduct in issue \u201cunreasonably\u201d restrained competition in the relevant market. <em>Products Liab. Ins. Agency, Inc. v. Crum and Forster Ins. Co., </em>682 F.2d 660, 663 (7th Cir.1982). Since Ideal\u2019s claim involves conduct judged under a rule of reason standard, it is required to show anticompetitive effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Finally, Ideal argues that whether we apply a riile of reason or a \u201cquick look\u201d standard, the evidence was sufficient to support the finding of antitrust liability. For reasons discussed in more detail in Point V, we disagree that the alleged restraint in this case falls within the \u201cquick look\u201d category. Ideal did not present evidence that Farmland\u2019s conduct, though detrimental to Ideal, was detrimental to competition in the relevant product and geographic market, as required under the rule of reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">The overwhelming weight of federal and out-of-state authority holds that a \u201crule of reason\u201d analysis is required for \u00a7 1 Sherman Act claims alleging a conspiracy to damage or eliminate a competitor by unfair means. Although the United States Supreme Court has not directly considered this issue, recent decisions demonstrate that the Court has severely curtailed use of a strict \u201cper se\u201d approach for \u00a7 1 claims, and there is no split among the federal circuits on this issue. Mindful that our antitrust statute should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>construed in consonance with federal law, we conclude that the trial judge clearly erred in using a \u201cper se\u201d approach in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">Farmland contends that when evaluated under the traditional rule of reason standard, the evidence does not support a finding of antitrust liability. Ideal counters that the evidence is sufficient under the modified or \u201cquick look\u201d rule of reason and urges evaluation under that standard, if we reject the per se standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">Under a rule of reason analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-9\">Recovery under ... [\u00a7 1] of the Sherman Act is normally available only to a plaintiff who can prove: (1) that defendants contracted, combined or conspired among each other; (2) that the combination or conspiracy produced adverse anticompetitive effects within the relevant product and geographic markets; (3) that the objects of, and conduct pursuant to, the contract or conspiracy were illegal; and (4) that plaintiff was injured as a primary result of the conspiracy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJ3\"><em>[American Standard Life &amp; Accident, Ins.

Although Havemeyer and Levine testified at length-about the manner and extent to which Ideal\u2019s profits as a business were adversely affected by Farmland\u2019s conduct, this was insufficient as a matter of law. Actual or probable, harm to <em>competition </em>is essential under a reasonableness approach. Cases so holding are legion. <em>See, e.g., Town Sound and Custom Tops, Inc. v.

Neither did Ideal offer proof of Farmland\u2019s market power as an alternative to proof of actual or probable anticompetitive effect. <em>See generally, NCAA v.

To the contrary, the record clearly shows that Farmland competed in the same market as Tuscan, a major processor, and that Farmland was involved in ongoing and heated competition with Tuscan for retail customers at every level. There was nothing in the proofs to indicate that Farmland had the ability to control and manipulate the milk market. In <em>George R. Whitten, Jr., Inc. v.

Affirming the entry of judgment in favor of defendant, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aom\">The dispositive element seems to us to be the effect of ...

In <em>Monmouth Real Estate Inv. Trust v.

Plaintiff offered no current market analysis, and no evidence of adverse effect on competition. The trial judge dismissed plaintiffs claim at the close of its ease, and we affirmed, reasoning that there was no prima facie showing of an unreasonable restraint of trade. <em>Ibid. Accord, Pomanowski v. Monmouth County Bd. of Realtors, </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>306, 315-16, 446 A.2d 83, <em>cert. denied, </em>459 <em>U.S. </em>908, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>213, 74 L.Ed.2d 170 (1982); <em>Finlay &amp; Assocs., Inc. v.

Even assuming for the sake of argument that Ideal satisfied all other requirements for establishing a \u00a7 1 violation under a reasonableness approach, the failure to provide market analysis evidence and proof of injury to competition was fatal to its antitrust claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>As observed by our Supreme Court in a case where the plaintiff challenged an exclusive contract between a hospital and group of anesthesiologists:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-5\">Under the New Jersey Antitrust Act, application of the rule-of-reason requires analysis of the competitive and anti-competitive effect of the challenged practice under all relevant circumstances. <em>Joseph H.

Cipolla, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>199, 218-19, 475 A.2d 533 (1984).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">Ideal contends that even without evidence defining the relevant geographical market, analyzing market conditions, and demonstrating anticompetitive effect, the judgment below must be affirmed. Ideal urges us to follow the rationale of those decisions which utilize the \u201cquick look\u201d standard of review, and which have found antitrust liability without the detailed market analysis ordinarily required under the rule of reason and without a specific finding of anticompetitive effect. <em>United States v. Brown, Univ., supra, </em>5 F.3d at 669. As discussed <em>infra </em>in Point IV, these cases typically involved per se violations, <em>i.e., </em>\u201cplainly anticompetitive\u201d practices and agreements. Where a defendant can make a threshold showing that his \u201cpresumptively\u201d illegal conduct has some legitimate business purpose, a court will take a \u201cquick look\u201d at the economics of the conduct or restraint in order to decide whether plaintiffs claim truly merits a strict per se standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">Ideal\u2019s argument mistakenly applies this rationale in a reverse or backwards fashion, <em>i.e., </em>it contends that conduct traditionally evaluated under the rule of reason may be subjected to a stricter approach. However, precisely the inverse is true; the \u201cquick look\u201d rule was intended to mitigate the harshness of a per se analysis, and offers defendants a way around the strong or virtually conclusive presumption of illegality which accompanies a per se approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>The cases cited by Ideal are consistent with this rationale; all involve restraints traditionally in the per se categories. <em>E.g., F.T.C. v. Indiana Fed\u2019n of Dentists, supra, </em>476 <em>U.S. </em>at 459, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2018, 90 L.Ed.2d at 457 (agreement among dentists not to compete with each other respecting the packaging of services offered to customers); <em>NCAA v. Board of Regents, supra, </em>468 <em>U.S. </em>at 99, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2959, 82 L.Ed.2d at 82-83 (agreement among member institutions not to compete against each other on the basis of price or kind of television rights that can be offered to broadcasters); <em>National Soc\u2019y of Eng\u2019rs v. United States, supra, </em>435 <em>U.S. </em>at 692, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1365-66, 55 L.Ed.2d at 650-51 (agreement to refuse to discuss prices with customers until after selection of member engineer). But the challenged restraint in the case before us has not been traditionally placed in a per se category. This renders the \u201cquick look\u201d rationale inapplicable here. Our research has uncovered no decisions where a \u00a7 1 claim involving a conspiracy to damage or eliminate a competitor has been evaluated under a \u201cquick look\u201d standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">Ideal\u2019s evidence of antitrust liability was insufficient as a matter of law because it failed to establish at least one necessary element: probable or actual injury to competition caused by Farmland\u2019s conduct. Because of Ideal\u2019s failure of proof under the \u201crule of reason\u201d standard, Farmland is entitled to a favorable judgment on the antitrust claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">The trial judge found that Farmland and its distributors conspired to engage in a predatory pricing scheme. Farmland contends that the judge failed to use the proper standard in evaluating the issue of predation and that the evidence was insufficient under the appropriate standard. We agree with Farmland that under the relevant criteria, the evidence was not sufficient to support a finding of \u201cpredation\u201d as defined by federal courts in the context of antitrust law. Since one of the requirements for liability under \u00a7 1 of the Sherman Act (and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:9-3) is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>that the object of, and conduct pursuant to, the conspiracy be illegal, this deficiency in Ideal\u2019s proof provides an additional ground for denial of antitrust liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Predatory pricing schemes are generally analyzed under \u00a7 2 of the Sherman Act (conspiracies to monopolize), or \u00a7 2(a) of the Clayton Act, as amended by the Robinson-Patman Act, 15 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 13(a) (price discrimination). <em>Brooke Group v. Brown &amp; Williamson, supra, -U.S. </em>at-, 113 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2586-87, 125 L.Ed.2d at 184-85. Although New Jersey\u2019s antitrust statute has a provision equivalent to \u00a7 2 of the Sherman Act <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>56:9-4), Ideal did not plead or pursue a \u201csection two\u201d type violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">For purposes of this discussion, however, we assume that a conspiracy to engage in predatory pricing may also be actionable under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:9-3 as a conspiracy in restraint of trade. <em>Cf. State v. Scioscia, </em>200 <em>N.J.Super. </em>28, 40, 490 A.2d 327 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>277, 501 A.2d 942 (1985) (recognizing that conduct violative of restraint of trade prohibition in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:9-3 can also fall within the purview of the monopoly proscriptions contained in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:9-4).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-10\">As the federal Supreme Court has noted, the essence of predation, regardless of how it is characterized, is that \u201c[a] business rival has priced its products in an unfair manner with an object to eliminate or retard competition and thereby gain and exercise control over prices in the relevant market.\u201d <em>Brooke Group v. Brown &amp; Williamson, supra, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>at\u2014, 113 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2587, 125 L.Ed.2d at 185-86. The standard for determining whether pricing is \u201cpredatory\u201d was established by the Supreme Court in <em>Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., </em>475 <em>U.S. </em>574, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986). In that case, American manufacturers brought an antitrust suit alleging that a group of foreign manufacturers conspired to sell televisions in the United States at predatory levels. The Court held that in order to succeed, a plaintiff must satisfy two evidentiary requirements. First, there must be proof of a rational economic motive on the part of the defendant; <em>i.e., </em>there must be evidence that the losses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>incurred by defendant could later be recouped through monopoly profits. Second, there must be some proof that the seller set its prices below some appropriate measure of cost. 475 <em>U.S. </em>at 589-91, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1357, 89 L.Ed.2d at 554-56; <em>see also Brooke Group v. Brown &amp; Williamson, supra, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>at-, 113 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2586-87, 125 L.Ed.2d at 184-86.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">The rationale underlying these requirements recognizes that predatory prices represent an investment in a future monopoly. If the market conditions are such that monopoly pricing is later impossible, one can infer that prices are not predatory. A.A. <em>Poultry Farms, Inc. v. Rose Acre Farms, Inc., </em>881 F.2d 1396, 1401 (7th Cir.1989), <em>cert. denied, </em>494 <em>U.S. </em>1019, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>1326, 108 L.Ed.2d 501 (1990). <em>See, Regency Oldsmobile, Inc. v. General Motors Corp., </em>723 <em>F.Supp. </em>250, 267-68 (D.N.J.1989) (where defendant automobile manufacturer was not shown to have created a dangerous probability of successfully monopolizing warranty market, plaintiffs antitrust claim could not be sustained).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">The requirement for \u201crecoupment\u201d was explained by Justice Powell in the majority opinion in <em>Matsushita, supra:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-8\">A predatory pricing conspiracy is by nature speculative. Any agreement to price below the competitive level requires the conspirators to forgo profits that free competition would offer them. The forgone profits may be considered an invest ment in the future. For the investment to be rational, the conspirators must have a reasonable expectation of recovering, in the form of later monopoly profits, more than the losses suffered____ Moreover, it is not enough simply to achieve monopoly power, as monopoly pricing may breed quick entry by new competitors eager to share in the excess profits. The success of any predatory scheme depends on maintaining monopoly power for long enough to both recoup the predator\u2019s losses and to harvest some additional gain.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-11\">[475 <em>U.S. </em>at 588-89, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1357, 89 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 553-54.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-12\">The fact that a defendant acts with ill-will is not relevant. As noted by the Supreme Court, \u201c[e]ven an act of pure malice by one business competitor against another does not, without more, state a claim under the federal antitrust laws.\u201d <em>Brooke Group v. Brown &amp; Williamson, </em>-\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>at-, 113 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2589, 125 L.Ed.2d at 187.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>In addition to demonstrating an ability to recoup losses, plaintiff must also present some proof that the seller set its prices below \u201csome appropriate measure of cost.\u201d <em>Matsushita, </em>475 <em>U.S. </em>at 584, n. 8, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1355, n. 8, 89 L.Ed.2d at 551, n. 8. <em>Accord Cargill Inc. v.

The Court, however, declined to identify what constituted an \u201cappropriate\u201d measure. Above-cost prices which are below the general market level or the costs of a firm\u2019s competitor do not inflict injury to competition cognizable under antitrust law. <em>Atlantic Richfield Co. v. USA Petroleum Co., </em>495 <em>U.S. </em>328, 340, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>1884, 1892, 109 L.Ed.2d 333, 347-48 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">In the present case, the judge evaluated the evidence with respect to whether Farmland\u2019s prices were below a certain measure of cost. However, the judge failed to consider whether the market\u2019s conditions or structure made recoupment of Farmland\u2019s losses feasible. Ideal offered no proof in this regard. In <em>Matsush i.ta, </em>the Supreme Court made clear that without such evidence, there can be no finding of predatory pricing, regardless of the ratio between price and cost. 475 <em>U.S. </em>at 589, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1357, 89 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 554. <em>See Cargill, Inc. v. Monfort of Colorado, Inc., supra, </em>479 <em>U.S. </em>at 116, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 492, 93 L.Ed.2d at 439 (\u201cantitrust laws do not require the courts to protect small businesses from loss of profits due to continued competition, but only against the loss of profits from practices forbidden by antitrust laws\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">Moreover, the judge mistakenly linked the concept of predation with an intent to eliminate a competitor (rather than the requisite intent to eliminate or injure competition generally through later monopoly) and mistakenly reasoned that proof of such intent was sufficient to render Farmland\u2019s below-cost pricing \u201cpredatory\u201d in character. In pertinent part, the trial judge here stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-8\">I find by clear and convincing evidence that there was a campaign by defendant Farmland and the other distributors to attack Ideal in a predatory fashion for the purpose of \u201cteaching Ideal a lesson.\u201d At the time of the intense sales effort by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>Farmland they offered the retail stores prices for their product which made no economic sense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-4\">I accept the testimony of plaintiffs expert ... that a legitimate competitor would try to entice the customer to its company by offering a price sufficiently attractive to get the customers to change suppliers, yet sufficiently high enough [sic] to yield a profit. In the solicitations by Farmland, they made no effort to do anything other than go in with an extremely low price which was well below Ideal\u2019s price ... The testimony disclosed that ... [the prices] were obviously below cost.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-5\">No effort was made by Farmland to solicit at a lower cost the retailers recaptured by Ideal. This indicates without any question that the true purpose of the solicitation was to injure Ideal and in addition to warn any other distributor not to leave their relationship with Farmland. Thus the pricing may be characterized as predatory.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">This reasoning is not consistent with the federal Supreme Court\u2019s recent antitrust decisions. Low-cost or below-cost pricing, even when coupled with anticompetitive intent, is not sufficient for a finding of predation. For example, in <em>Brooke Group v. Brown &amp; Williamson, supra, </em>the Supreme Court considered a claim by a tobacco company that its rival engaged in \u201ca predatory pricing scheme designed to purge competition from the economy segment of the cigarette market.\u201d \u2014 <em>U.S. </em>at-, 113 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2586, 125 L.Ed.2d at 184. Specifically, the plaintiff alleged that by flooding the market with below-cost, unbranded cigarettes, the defendant not only injured plaintiff, but also discouraged other competitors from creating their own unbranded cigarettes, thereby slowing the growth of the generic cigarette market, and adversely affecting competition in that segment of the market. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">Although the Court in <em>Brooke Group </em>found that there was evidence from which a jury could conclude that the defendant envisioned or intended such a clearly anticompetitive course of events, that defendant\u2019s prices were indeed below a measure of its costs for eighteen months, and that plaintiff suffered economic losses as a result, plaintiffs claim of predation was nonetheless inadequate as a matter of law. Plaintiff failed to show that the defendant manufacturer had a reasonable prospect of recouping its losses by obtaining the market power to later raise prices above a competitive level. <em>Brooke Group, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>at-, 113 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number><em>S.Ct. </em>at 2592, 125 L.Ed.2d at 191-92; <em>Accord Matsushita, supra, </em>475 <em>U.S. </em>at 589, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1357, 89 L.Ed.2d at 554; <em>Exxon Corp. v. Wagner, </em>154 <em>N.J.Super. </em>538, 548-49, 382 A.2d 45 (App.Div. 1977); <em>Caller-Times Publishing Co., Inc. v. Triad Communications, Inc., </em>826 S.W.2d 576, 582 (Tex.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Likewise, in the present case, assuming that Farmland solicited retail customers with prices which were below some rational measure of its cost, and that it did so with anticompetitive intent, there was no evidence that Farmland had the market power to recoup its losses from this below-cost pricing by raising prices to noncompetitive monopolistic levels in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">Ideal urges that due to Farmland\u2019s dominant position with respect to distributors, and its dominant position as one of two major processors in the area, it is \u201cobvious\u201d that Farmland could have later recouped its losses by charging monopoly prices either through its distributors or on its own. This argument is unpersuasive for several reasons. One reason is that Farmland competed in the same marketplace with Tuscan, a major dairy processor, under what are best described as volatile market conditions. Another reason is that \u201cmilk wars\u201d were apparently common, retail stores frequently switched suppliers to maximize their profits, and competition among all dairies was keen. We see nothing in the record to support the view that Farmland could reasonably have hoped to monopolize the relevant market in light of these conditions and then force its retail customers to pay noncompetitive or monopolistic prices for a sustained period of time. Such a scenario was particularly improbable in an industry as heavily regulated at the state (and federal) level as the milk industry. The DDI exists to prevent such a market debacle from occurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">Finally, the judge\u2019s opinion suggests that because Farmland offered \u201cextremely low prices,\u201d which prices were lower than necessary to gain the customer\u2019s business, its pricing thus must be properly characterized as predatory, rather than competitive. This is an unfounded conclusion in the legal sense. The Supreme Court made clear in <em>Atlantic Richfield Co. v. USA Petroleum Co., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number><em>supra, </em>that low prices alone are not indicative of predation and do not give rise to an antitrust injury. 495 <em>U.S. </em>at 387, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1891, 109 L.Ed.2d at 345. Such aggressive pricing policies may in fact stimulate competition and ultimately benefit consumers. As Justice Brennan for the Court there noted,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-4\">\u201cCutting prices in order to increase business often is the very essence of competi-tion____ [t]o hold that the antitrust laws protect competitors from the loss of profits due to [nonpredatory] price competition would, in effect, render illegal any decision by a firm to cut prices in order to increase market share.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-6\"><em>[Atlantic Richfield Co., </em>495 <em>U.S. </em>at 338, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1891, 109 L.Ed.2d at 346.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-7\"><em>See also A.A. Poultry Farms, supra, </em>881 F.2d at 1401-02 (\u201c[i]f courts use vigorous, nasty, pursuit of sales as evidence of forbidden \u2018intent,\u2019 they run the risk of penalizing the motivation forces of competition\u201d); <em>Barry Wright Corp. v.

Farmland\u2019s competitive pricing, on this record, may not be characterized as \u201cpredatory\u201d and illegal, in the context of antitrust law.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">Turning to Ideal\u2019s common-law claim, Farmland contends that the record does not support a finding that it tortiously interfered with Ideal\u2019s prospective economic advantage. \u201cAn action for tortious interference with a prospective business relation protects the right to \u2018pursue one\u2019s business, calling or occupation free from undue influence or molestation.\u2019\u201d <em>Printing Mart-Morristown v.

In order to succeed on this claim, Ideal was required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>to show that it had a reasonable expectation of economic advantage, which was lost as a direct result of Farmland\u2019s malicious interference, and that it suffered losses thereby. <em>Baldasarre v. Butler, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>278, 293, 625 A.2d 458 (1993). Causation is shown where there is \u201cproof that if there had been no interference there was a reasonable probability that the victim of the interference would have received the anticipated economic benefits.\u201d <em>Leslie Blau Co. v.

The term \u201cmalicious\u201d in this context is not used in the literal sense, meaning ill-will toward the plaintiff. Rather, it means that \u201cthe harm was inflicted intentionally and without justification or excuse.\u201d <em>Printing </em>Mart-Morris<em>town, supra, </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>at 751, 563 A.2d 31; <em>Ranier\u2019s Dairies v.

Conversely, where a plaintiffs loss of business is merely the incident of healthy competition, there is no compensable tort injury. <em>Louis Kamm, Inc. v.

Slatina, </em>48 <em>N.J.Super. </em>134, 144, 137 A.2d 54 (App.Div.1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">Assuming that Ideal had a protectable interest in its customer base, that it established a reasonable probability of continued economic benefit had there been no interference, and that it suffered loss due to the interference, we are still not persuaded that the evidence established the element of \u201cmalice.\u201d .The judge premised his finding of tort liability on his belief that Farmland and the codefendant distributors conspired to intentionally and maliciously interfere with and damage Ideal\u2019s relationship with its customers by targeting them, and offering them prices which were unprofitable, in the hopes of driving Ideal out of business.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> With respect to the \u201cmalice\u201d issue, the judge focused exclusively on the existence of ill-will, specifically citing to a remark attributed to Farmland\u2019s president Goldman that he would get \u201cevery quart back\u201d from Ideal. There was also evidence that Goldman threatened Ideal\u2019s president that \u201cyou won\u2019t be in business when I\u2019m through with you,\u201d and that the solicitation of a specific account was \u201cjust to teach you a lesson.\u201d Though demonstrating fierce rivalry and rank animosity, we do not find that this and other evidence of Farmland\u2019s enmity toward Ideal meets the legal standard for malice in tortious interference cases\u2014unjustified conduct which transgresses the \u201crules of the game.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Challenged conduct must be viewed in the context of the specific circumstances of each case. Here, although the record shows that there was ill-will, there was also a valid business justification supporting Farmland\u2019s conduct. Farmland had lost a significant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>amount in sales after Ideal switched suppliers to Tuscan. Faced with excess plant capacity, and a decline in sales, there was a legitimate business reason to \u201ctarget\u201d Ideal customers and attempt to regain what Farmland lost the previous year (1985) regardless of any other motivation.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">There is no legal prohibition against targeting a specific competitor in the marketplace. Courts have held that this is, in fact, the very essence of competition. <em>See, e.g., Energex Lighting Indus., Inc. v. North American Philips Lighting Corp., </em>765 <em>F.Supp. </em>93, 109-10 (S.D.N.Y.1991) (applying New Jersey law, court held that defendant\u2019s targeting of plaintiffs customers and offering prices lower than plaintiff could offer did not state a claim for tortious interference); <em>C.R. Bard, Inc. v. Wordtronics Corp., </em>235 <em>N.J.Super. </em>168, 174, 561 A.2d 694 (Law Div.1989) (a competitor has an absolute right to take away as much of his rival\u2019s business as he can take lawfully).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">Despite Ideal\u2019s characterization of Farmland\u2019s conduct as the \u201ccampaign of destruction,\u201d the \u201cblitz,\u201d and the \u201cnear lethal attack,\u201d the targeting of a particular competitor has generally not been held to be either tortious or illegal. Neither have threats and angry exchanges between business competitors been held legally significant for purposes of determining the existence of a viable legal claim. <em>See, e.g., </em>A.A. <em>Poultry Farms, Inc. v. Rose Acre Farms, Inc., supra, 881 </em>F.2d at 1402 (\u201cdesire to extinguish one\u2019s rivals is entirely consistent with, [and] often is the motive behind, competition\u201d); <em>Dahl, Inc. v. Roy Cooper Co., Inc., </em>448 F.2d 17, 19 (9th Cir.1971) (defendant\u2019s statement that he would drive plaintiff out of business if defendant chose to compete in the same market, in the absence of illegal predatory conduct, was not sufficient to state a Sherman Act claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">Ideal repeatedly asserts that Farmland and the other major processors did not have any interest in the small mom and pop stores and normally did not compete for mom and pop customers with distributors such as Ideal. Thus, Ideal appears to be arguing that Farmland transgressed the bounds of fair play and the \u201crules <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>of the game\u201d by targeting Ideal\u2019s mom and pop customers. However, the record is undisputed, and Ideal agrees, that in 1986 over two-thirds of Farmland\u2019s customers were indeed small mom and pop stores. Farmland\u2019s interest in this segment of the market cannot be reasonably disputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">Moreover, Ideal\u2019s own president testified that in early 1985, while Ideal was still a Farmland dealer, Ideal\u2019s mom and pop stops also were solicited by Tuscan, a competing major milk processor, resulting in a significant number of DDI-11 change notices filed adversely to Ideal in a very short time period. In response, Farmland targeted Tuscan distributors and solicited their customers at prices in the $1.79 per gallon range. Several co-defendant distributors also testified about their experiences in these so-called \u201cmilk wars,\u201d which were a sporadic but not uncommon occurrence in the industry. Thus, based on this record, we cannot agree that Farmland\u2019s targeting of Ideal customers by solicitation with lower prices had no legitimate business justification, or violated any specific \u201crules of the game.\u201d <em>Cf., Monmouth Real Estate Inv. Trust v. Manville Foodland, Inc., supra, </em>196 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 271, 482 A.2d 186 (the purchase of a competitor\u2019s business premises in order to shut down its business and eliminate competitor, while not admirable, was not unreasonable and unjustified conduct actionable either as a tortious interference with economic advantage or antitrust law). The relevant question, in our view, is whether the means as well as the purpose of Farmland\u2019s conduct was justified. Assuming that Farmland\u2019s offers were below its cost, or lower than necessary to close the sale, did this constitute wrongful, unjustified or illegal conduct actionable as tortious interference?</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Our research has uncovered no cases which have squarely held that a claim for tortious interference may, or may not, be premised on the allegation that a competitor solicited plaintiffs customers with extremely low, or unprofitable prices but which did not qualify as \u201cpredatory\u201d within the legal definition of that term. Recently, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals certified this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>precise question to the Supreme Court of Georgia. <em>See, U.S. Anchor Mfg., Inc. v. Rule Industries, Inc., </em>7 <em>F.</em>3d 986, 1003, 1009 (11th Cir.1993) (\u201cnovel questions presented are whether below-cost pricing can satisfy the improper action element of the tort and whether low prices, standing alone, can constitute a prohibited inducement of the plaintiffs customers.... We regard it as unclear whether tortious interference with business relations under Georgia law may be established by a showing of predatory pricing and, if so, what sort of pricing would be deemed predatory\u201d). The Georgia Supreme Court responded to the certified question, stating \u201cthat below-cost pricing by a single-defendant is not improper in the absence of some other unlawful element and, thus, is not encompassed by the tort of intentional interference with business relations.\u201d <em>U.S. Anchor Manufacturing, Inc. v. Rule Industries, Inc., </em>264 Ga. 295, 443 <em>S.E.</em>2d 833, 836 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">In <em>Ashkanazy v. I. Rokeach &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>757 <em>F.Supp. </em>1527, 1556 (N.D.Ill.1991), a somewhat similar issue was presented on a summary judgment motion. Plaintiff in that case alleged that defendant\u2019s efforts to solicit his nursing home customer involved wrongful acts such as fraud and intimidation, and also that defendant violated the Robinson-Patman Act\u2019s prohibition against price discrimination by charging lower prices to the solicited nursing home than to others. The court acknowledged the general rule that a claim for tortious interference with prospective economic advantage is not actionable without wrongful conduct. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">Nonetheless, because the Robinson-Patman Act claim survived the motion for summary judgment, the court refused to strike the state-law tortious interference claim, stating \u201c[t]he continued viability of that claim breathes life into [plaintiffs] claim of interference with prospective advantage, for [defendant\u2019s] illegally low prices to [the nursing home] may have prevented [defendant] from enjoying the patronage of customers that it would otherwise have obtained.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In linking the viability of the tortious interference claim to the viability of the antitrust claim, the court implicit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>ly held that pricing which is not illegal cannot be wrongful, and hence cannot be the basis of a tortious interference claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">This reasoning has common sense appeal and is consistent with our own law of tortious interference. Under New Jersey law, the gravamen of a claim for tortious interference with prospective advantage likewise is that the defendant\u2019s conduct was somehow legally wrongful, rather than merely mean or spiteful. <em>Louis Schlesinger Co. v. Rice, </em>4 <em>N.J. </em>169, 180-81 (1950). However, unlike <em>Ashkanazy, swpra, </em>Ideal\u2019s antitrust claim in the instant case is not viable. As discussed in IV and V, there is no evidence that Farmland\u2019s pricing, even if below cost, was \u201cpredatory\u201d or otherwise illegal under antitrust principles. Accordingly, the evidence was insufficient to allow an inference of wrongful, unjustified conduct which transgresses the rules of the game and satisfies the \u201cmalice\u201d requirement of the tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Where a competitor is willing to target another competitor and aggressively cut costs below what may be necessary or profitable in order to increase market share, and there is no demonstrated restraint of trade, and no possibility of a later \u201cmonopoly situation,\u201d the courts have recognized that such conduct is not illegal, and is indeed justified by the beneficial effect on the marketplace. <em>See Brooke Group v. Brown &amp; Williamson, supra, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>at -, 113 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2588-89, 125 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 187 (non-predatory below-cost pricing is a boon to consumers; that it may impose painful losses on its targets is of no moment so long as competition is not injured). \u201cEven an act of pure malice by one business competitor against another does not, without more, state a claim under the federal antitrust laws; ...\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">Although the laws of antitrust and tortious interference are based on competing interests and policies, they share a common purpose; <em>i.e., </em>the prevention of conduct which <em>unjustifiably </em>imposes injury or loss, either to competition (as in antitrust law), or to a competitor (as in the law of tortious interference). In keeping with this common purpose, we conclude that it is both reasonable and sound, as a matter of policy, to recognize that low-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>cost pricing which is neither predatory nor restrictive of competition is justified by the forces of competition and does not provide a basis for a claim of tortious interference.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">To hold otherwise would countenance an unnecessarily broad rule which could potentially interfere with legitimate competition. Aggressive pricing policies, though seemingly unfair to businesses unable to compete, may nonetheless be beneficial to the marketplace as a whole. This point is well-illustrated in the Second Circuit case involving Farmland\u2019s attempt to gain entry into the markets of New York, Bronx, Kings, and Queens counties. <em>Farmland Dairies v. Comm\u2019r of New York State Dep\u2019t of Agriculture and Markets, </em>650 <em>F.Supp. </em>939 (E.D.N.Y.1987), <em>appeal by proposed interveners dismissed, </em>847 F.2d 1038 (2d Cir.1988). The federal court granted summary judgment in favor of Farmland and rejected the finding of the New York Commissioner of Agriculture that Farmland\u2019s entry into those markets at significantly lower prices would be harmful or unfair to the New York dairies. <em>Id. </em>at 943. In so doing, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-7\">The record indicates that Farmland is able to process and sell milk more cheaply than the present New York dairy companies. Hearing Officer\u2019s Report, State of New York Department of Agriculture and Markets 38 (Sept. 10, 1986). The hearing officer who presided over Farmland\u2019s hearings cited the significant reduction in the price of milk in Richmond County [Staten Island] since Farmland\u2019s entry into that market as a basis on which he predicted a drop in the price of milk in New York, Bronx, Kings and Queens Counties if Farmland\u2019s license extension were granted. The hearing officer concluded that if Farmland were permitted to participate in the milk market in those four counties, milk prices there would be comparable to the now lower Richmond County [Staten Island] price. The hearing officer did indicate that less efficient companies, unable to compete, might be driven out of the market. This, he concluded, would leave the market open to competition among the most efficient dealers, keep the price of milk down, and be in the public\u2019s best interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-8\"><em>[Id. </em>at 946.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">Consistent with prior New Jersey decisions, we conclude that in tortious interference cases involving parties in direct competition in the same market, the line must be drawn where one competitor interferes with another\u2019s economic advantage through conduct which is fraudulent, dishonest, or illegal. <em>See, e.g., Printing Mart, supra, </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>at 746-49, 563 A.2d 31 (defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>competitor committed fraud in the bidding process thereby causing plaintiff competitor to lose the job); <em>Shebar v. Sanyo Business Sys. Corp., </em>218 <em>N.J.Super. </em>111, 115-16, 526 A.2d 1144 (App.Div. 1987) (employer by deceit induced employee to revoke acceptance of employment until he could find a replacement and fire him); <em>McCue v. Deppert, </em>21 <em>N.J.Super. </em>591, 595-96, 91 A.2d 503 (App. Div.1952) (if a competitor uses violence, fraud, intimidation, misrepresentation, or threatens civil or criminal actions or violates the law, competition is considered outside permissible limits and liability will ensue).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">The record here does not establish that Farmland acted unjustifiably, wrongfully, and outside the \u201crules of the game\u201d when it solicited Ideal\u2019s customers with low pricing. The record shows vigorous,, short-term price competition consistent with the interest of consumers. There is no suggestion possible that Farmland\u2019s conduct threatened competitive market conditions. The judge erred in concluding that Farmland \u201cmaliciously\u201d interfered with Ideal\u2019s prospective economic advantage based solely on evidence of its subjective ill-will and animosity. We reverse and enter judgment for Farmland on the malicious interference claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Because we conclude that Ideal did not establish either an antitrust claim or a common-law claim, we need not consider the remaining issues raised by Farmland or the damage issue raised on the cross-appeal by Ideal.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Reversed for entry of judgment for the defendant.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b188-5\">The weekly volume for the accounts involved were:</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">1) City Produce: $40</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">2) ^Central Supermarket: $300</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">3) *LittIe Joe's: $30-40</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">4) Queen's supermarket: $275</p>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">5) West Third Supermarket: $150</p>\n<p id=\"b188-11\">6) *Mendez: $250</p>\n<p id=\"b188-12\">7) Merit Market: $400</p>\n<p id=\"b188-13\">8) New Leaf Market: $600</p>\n<p id=\"b188-14\">9) Crestmont Deli: $60</p>\n<p id=\"b188-15\">10) *Bodega One: $60</p>\n<p id=\"b188-16\">11) Mendez on Central: $350</p>\n<p id=\"b188-17\">12) *Chris &amp; Cookies: $40</p>\n<p id=\"b188-18\">13) Barones: $300;</p>\n<p id=\"b188-19\">14) Vaccaro's Bakery: $400</p>\n<p id=\"b188-20\">15) *Town Mini Market: $600</p>\n<p id=\"b188-21\">16) *Chann Lunch: $80</p>\n<p id=\"b188-22\">17) *Pat\u2019s Market: $250</p>\n<p id=\"b188-23\">18) Savoy Liquor: $150</p>\n<p id=\"b188-24\">19) K &amp; J Grocery: $120</p>\n<p id=\"b188-25\">20) *Teixeira Bakery Union: $125</p>\n<p id=\"b188-26\">21) Teixeira Newark: $470</p>\n<p id=\"b188-27\">22) *Teixeira Newark: $350</p>\n<p id=\"b188-28\">23) Teixeira Newark: $600</p>\n<p id=\"b188-29\">24) *Teixeria Kearny: $450</p>\n<p id=\"b188-30\">25) *Teixeria Harris: $175</p>\n<p id=\"b188-31\">26) *Teixeria Ferry: $1400</p>\n<p id=\"b188-32\">27) *Teixeria Eliz.: $200</p>\n<p id=\"b188-33\">28) Mirtha's Mini: $600</p>\n<p id=\"b188-34\">29) Herb's Super: $250</p>\n<p id=\"b188-35\">30) Carlsen's: $300</p>\n<p id=\"b188-36\">31) Willie's: $600</p>\n<p id=\"b188-37\">32) Carolina: $150</p>\n<p id=\"b188-38\">33) Leaty Foods: $250</p>\n<p id=\"b188-39\">34) South Wood: $225</p>\n<p id=\"Aiq\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>35) Broughton: $350</p>\n<p id=\"A1O\">36) Hickory: $500</p>\n<p id=\"A4z\">37) Oak Ridge: $200</p>\n<p id=\"ap-dedup-0\">38) American: $200</p>\n<p id=\"A7\">39) Donet Food: $400</p>\n<p id=\"A69\">40) International: $600</p>\n<p id=\"AR\">41) State Prize: $250</p>\n<p id=\"AWL\">42) J &amp; J: $300</p>\n<p id=\"A4l\">43) Minhotinha: $600</p>\n<p id=\"A2_\">44) La Clarita: $500</p>\n<p id=\"AqA6\">45) Jones: $900</p>\n<p id=\"A85\">46) Vega Linda: SI20</p>\n<p id=\"Ahz\">47) West 4th: $250</p>\n<p id=\"ASY\">48) *Big Banner: $500-600</p>\n<p id=\"b189-20\">Accounts marked with an asterisk denote those that Ideal was unable to keep through re-negotiation.

United States, </em>370 <em>U.S. </em>294, 334, 82 <em>S.Ct. </em>1502, 1529, 8 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>510, 541 (1962). In this case Ideal does not allege that defendants agreed to fix a minimum or maximum price applicable to all customers or engaged in some other concerted action that could be characterized as a horizontal market restraint. Rather, the claim was that defendants agreed to charge preferential prices to Ideal's customers in order to damage Ideal. This generally comes under the rubric of \"price discrimination\" or \"primary line injury\" and is prohibited under federal law as a violation of the Robinson-Patman Act. <em>E.g. Brooke Group Ltd. v. Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp.,-U.S. </em>-, -, 113 <em>S.Ct. </em>2578, 2586, 125 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>168, 184 (1993); <em>Ashkanazy v. I. Rokeach &amp; Sons, Inc., 151 F.Supp. </em>1527, 1556 (N.D.Ill.1991). In <em>Brooke Group, </em>the Supreme Court acknowledged that primary-line competitive injury under the Robinson-Pactman Act is of the \"same general character as the injury inflicted by predatory pricing schemes actionable under \u00a7 2 of the Sherman Act\" (prohibiting conspiracies to monopolize) and may also be analyzed as a \u00a7 2 claim. Ideal did not plead or pursue a Sherman Act \u00a7 2 violation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b215-11\"> Although Farmland generally denies there was a conspiracy, it does not argue this point at length in its brief. However, Ideal\u2019s deficiency of proof on this issue is both noteworthy and significant since \"[ujnilateral action, no matter what its motivation, cannot violate [section] 1\u201d of the Sherman Act. <em>Edward J. Sweeney &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Texaco, Inc., </em>637 <em>F.2d 105, 110 (3d </em>Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-12\">We question whether there was sufficient evidence from which to infer that Farmland and the co-defendant distributors agreed to enter into a conspiracy the intent o\u00ed which was to restrain competition. The judge relied upon the fact that \"no one ultimately complained about Ferrante signing their names\" to DDI-11 change forms. Evidence of specific acts may provide a basis from which to infer agreement among alleged conspirators. <em>Interstate Circuit, Inc. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>306 <em>U.S. </em>208, 226-27, 59 <em>S.Ct. </em>467, 473-74, 83 <em>L.Ed. </em>610, 620 (1939); <em>State </em>v. <em>New Jersey Trade Waste Ass'n, 96 N.J. 8, 19, </em>472 <em>A.2d </em>1050 (1984). However, the evidence here is tenuous at best.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-13\">The fact that there was a joint solicitation effort among entities selling a common product, and that the co-deiendant distributors acquiesced in Farm<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>land's acquisition of customers on their behalf, does not necessarily imply that the distributors acquiesced in a predatory pricing scheme. Neither does the evidence necessarily imply that they knowingly entered into an agreement to restrain competition, or intended that their actions would have that effect. In light of the evidence that the distributors were themselves often the object of solicitation campaigns by competing dairies, the distributors agreement to \u201cjoin forces\" with Farmland for solicitation purposes appears more reasonably motivated by a desire to compete effectively for new business.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b228-6\"> Conduct evincing such malice included: 1) making threats to damage Ideal; 2) failing to counter-offer after Ideal met Farmland\u2019s offers to its customers; 3) offering prices which were lower than necessary to close the sale; and 4) signing dealers\u2019 names on change notices. The judge believed that this evidence established that Farmland\u2019s true motive was not to engage in \"real\u201d competition, but solely to damage Ideal. Whether intending to take away Ideal's customers, or to damage Ideal, Farmland was attempting to gain a competitive edge. The only issue was whether the competitive means chosen by Farmland were prohibited by the doctrine of tortious interference.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
