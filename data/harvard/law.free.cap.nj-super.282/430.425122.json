RODR\u00cdGUEZ, J.A.D.</author>\n<p id=\"b460-15\">The Law Division dismissed consumer fraud claims brought by the Housing Authority of the City of Newark (Authority), concluding that the Authority is not a \u201cperson\u201d as defined by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-1(d). We reverse and hold that the Authority is a person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>entitled to pursue a claim under the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-1 to -20.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">The Authority, a defendant in a multi-party case, filed a third party claim against three suppliers<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to recover the costs of repairing or replacing defective wood-framed asphalt-shingled roofs at three housing complexes. The claims were based on the Act. The Law Division dismissed the claims, concluding that \u201c[h]ad the Legislature intended to include organizations such as the Authority under the definition of person it would have so provided.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">By leave granted, the Authority appeals and contends that (1) the statutory language demonstrates that the Legislature intended the term \u201cperson\u201d to be expansively construed, (2) governing law declares that the Act should be liberally construed and (3) the judge relied on case law which is distinguishable in fact and law.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">The Act was intended to be \u201cone of the strongest consumer protection laws in the nation.\u201d <em>Cox v. Sears Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>2, 15, 647 A.2d 454 (1994) (quoting <em>Governor\u2019s Press Release for Assembly Bill No. 2402, </em>at 1 (Apr. 19, 1971)). It provides, among other things, that a person who suffers a loss due to an unlawful practice under the Act may sue and recover treble damages, attorney\u2019s fees and costs of suit. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-19; <em>Daaleman v. Elizabethtown Gas Co., 77 N.J. </em>267, 271, 390 A.2d 566 (1978). The Authority asserts that it is a person entitled to sue under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-10\">We begin our analysis by examining the statutory language. The Act provides,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-11\">The term \u201cperson\u201d as used in this act shall include any natural person or his legal representative, partnership, corporation, company, trust, business entity or associa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>tion, and any agent, employee, salesman, partner, officer, director, member, stockholder, associate, trustee or cestuis que trustent thereof; ____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-4\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-1(d)]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">It is settled that a term whose statutory definition declares what it \u201cincludes\u201d is more susceptible to an extension of meaning by construction than a term whose definition declares what a term \u201cmeans.\u201d That is so because \u201cincludes\u201d is usually a term of enlargement, not of limitation. It conveys the conclusion that there are other items includable, though not specifically enumerated. 2A Norman J. Singer, <em>Sutherland Statutory Construction, </em>\u00a7 47.07 (5th ed. 1992); <em>see also Fraser v. Robin Dee Day Camp, </em>44 <em>N.J. </em>480, 210 A.2d 208 (1965); <em>Cuna v. Board of Fire Comm\u2019rs, Avenel, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>292, 200 A.2d 313 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">The Authority is a body corporate and politic organized under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:12A-17. It has the power to sue and be sued; make and execute contracts; make, amend and repeal by-laws, rules and regulations; invest in property and securities; borrow money; pay or compromise claims; and acquire real or personal property. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:12A-22. In many respects the Authority has powers similar to those of a \u201ccorporation,\u201d \u201ccompany,\u201d \u201cbusiness entity\u201d or \u201cassociation.\u201d These entities are expressly included in the Act\u2019s definition of \u201cperson.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">Next we examine the purpose of the Act, which is to discourage unlawful sales and advertising practices designed to induce consumers to purchase merchandise. In <em>Hundred East Credit Corp. v. Eric Schuster, </em>212 <em>N.J.Super. </em>350, 355, 515 A.2d 246 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>60-61, 526 A.2d 146 (1986) we observed that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-8\">The Act unquestionably was designed to protect consumers. Although \u201cthe strongest case for relief\u2019 is presented by \u201cthe poor, the naive and the uneducated,\u201d others can qualify as \u201cconsumers\u201d as well. The term \u201cconsumer\u201d is only occasionally used, and is not defined, in the Act; its generally recognized meaning is \u201cone who uses (economic) goods, and so diminishes or destroys their utilities.\u201d That definition has been frequently used by courts in statutory interpretation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-9\">(citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>The Authority is unquestionably a consumer, purchasing merchandise with public funds for the benefit of a segment of the population. As remedial legislation, the Act must be interpreted expansively rather than narrowly, and liberally construed in favor of protecting consumers. <em>Cox, supra, </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>at 15, 647 A.2d 454. Thus, in order to effectuate the purposes of the Act, we expansively construe its definition of the term \u201cperson\u201d to include a public authority when acting as a consumer. The Authority is therefore not precluded from prosecuting a consumer fraud claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">We agree with the Authority\u2019s contention that this construction is not contrary to existing case law. <em>Garden State Parkway Employee\u2019s Union v. N.J. Highway Auth., </em>105 <em>N.J.Super. </em>168, 251 A.2d 463 (App.Div.1969) and <em>Barry v. N.J. State Highway Auth., </em>245 <em>N.J.Super. </em>302, 585 A.2d 420 (Ch.Div.1990) hold that the Highway Authority is not subject to the Act. Similarly, <em>Daaleman, supra, </em>77 <em>N.J. </em>at 273, 390 A.2d 566 holds that a claim under the Act is not cognizable against a public utility. In these instances, however, the claims were made against the authority or public utility. Here, the Authority is invoking the Act as a plaintiff thus there is no danger of interference in the Authority\u2019s affairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">The Law Division\u2019s order dismissing the Authority\u2019s consumer fraud claims is reversed and the matter is remanded for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b461-13\"> Osmose Wood Preserving, Inc., Wood Treating Corp. of Philadelphia and Georgia Pacific Corp.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
