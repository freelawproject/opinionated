Anear appeals the dismissal of his unfair business practice claims against three blood plasma centers. Finding that dismissal of Ancar\u2019s antitrust claims was an abuse of discretion but agreeing that the remaining claims are not actionable, we vacate in part, affirm in part, and remand for proceedings consistent herewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">Anear filed a <em>pro se </em>petition against Sara Plasma, Inc., American Plasma Services, Inc., and Delta Biological Plasma Center alleging multiple claims of wrongful business practices associated with the purchase and sale of human plasma. He pleads that he is a homeless person dependent on the sale of plasma for his livelihood and that the defendants\u2019 illegal practices deprive him of income. He alleges that the plasma centers commit common-law fraud by characterizing plasma sellers as donors and by forcing adhesion contracts upon them. He asserts that this fraud is perpetrated in advertising violative of the Lanham TradeMark Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He also contends that plasma donors are not paid an equitable price due to uneven bargaining power, that the plasma centers have conspired to fix prices and have employed unfair business practices in violation of federal antitrust laws,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> unfairly manipulating the incentive plans and discriminating against all plasma donors. The district court denied Ancar\u2019s motion to certify a class of all plasma donors and dismissed the action as frivolous. Anear timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-18\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b536-19\">A section 1915(d) dismissal is reviewed for abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A complaint maybe dismissed as frivolous if it lacks an arguable basis in fact and law. The <em>in forma pauperis </em>statute, in contrast to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), empowers the court to pierce the veil of the complaint\u2019s factual allegations if they \u00e1re clearly baseless.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In <em>Denton v. Hernandez, </em>the Supreme Court \u201cdecline[d] the invitation to reduce the \u2018clearly baseless\u2019 inquiry to a monolithic standard.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Examples of complaints within the clearly baseless category are those which describe fanciful, fantastic, or delusional scenarios. A complaint is factually frivolous if the facts alleged rise to the level of the irrational or wholly incredible. Pleaded facts which are merely improbable or strange, however, are not frivolous for section 1915(d) purposes.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In addition, as a general rule, antitrust allegations are liberally construed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b536-20\">To bring a private right of action to enforce the Sherman Act, a plaintiff must demonstrate standing under section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 15.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The private claimant must show injury to \u201cbusiness or property\u201d of a type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent. Pleadings need not explain how the injury occurred; that the claimant sustained injury to business or property is a sufficient allegation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>Anear pleads that he depends for his livelihood on the regular sale of his plasma and that the defendants\u2019 illegal practices have prevented him from receiving fair consideration. Anear has alleged sufficient personal pecuniary loss to sustain his antitrust claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">Section 1 of the Sherman Act declares illegal \u201c[e]very contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States____\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The elements required to state a section 1 claim are: (1) the existence of a conspiracy (2) affecting interstate commerce (3) that imposes an unreasonable restraint of trade.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">To satisfy the first element, pleadings must contain charges of the defendants\u2019 conspiracy and factual allegations that would support such a claim.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Ancar\u2019s complaint repeatedly charges that the defendants have conspired with each other and with national pharmaceutical companies in horizontal and vertical price-fixing schemes designed to keep the purchase price of plasma artificially low. He alleges that the defendants have succeeded in depressing the price by agreeing not to set the price based on market demand. The pleadings include examples of the standardized price range scale and the standard consent form language which have resulted from the alleged illegal trade practices. The pleadings also name a Louisiana pharmaceutical company allegedly involved in the vertical price-fixing conspiracy. According to Anear, this company and other national pharmaceutical companies insure an artificially low price of plasma by investing in and controlling local plasma centers, including the defendants. The end result is that both the purchase and sale prices of plasma are kept artificially low. The <em>pro se </em>pleadings are legally sufficient and factually plausible as to the first requisite.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-14\">Regarding the second element, the district court found that Anear had not set forth federal jurisdiction. As an antitrust claimant, Anear has the burden of establishing that the alleged proscribed practices affect interstate commerce.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> An interstate impact need not be intentional but, rather, may be indirect or fortuitous. The interstate effect need not have occurred if the planned conspiracy would have harmed interstate commerce.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In cases involving agreements to fix prices, a showing that the alleged conspiracy would impede a specified measure of interstate commerce is not necessary; one need only show that an impediment to competition would occur in an interstate marketplace.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b537-15\">Anear pleads that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-16\">The Defendants herein are and have conspired in a \u201cloose-association\u201d to maintain and perpetuate such violations as \u201chorizontal price fixing,\u201d \u201cvertical] price fixing,\u201d \u201cactionable fraud\u201d and a number of other inequitable business practices unlawfully impacting trade and commerce affecting intra-state and interstate commercial aspects of the Defendants\u2019 plasmapheresis business activities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AWg\">The complaint contains names, corporate addresses, and annual sales revenue estimates of California, Nebraska, and Tennessee pharmaceutical companies allegedly involved in the unlawful price-fixing. The vertical price-fixing allegation names a Louisiana corporation as a conspirator. Anear cites Food and Drug Administration regulations and reports demonstrating that plasma centers are located among the several states. He provides the name and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>address of the federal Food and Drug Administration office which licensed the defendants and the name of the applicable national trade association. Anear also pleads that he sells his blood in interstate commerce. We find that Ancar\u2019s specific' description of the national market affected by the alleged proscribed practices constitutes sufficient pleadings of antitrust jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">Finally, section 1 of the Sherman Act proscribes only unreasonable restraints of trade.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Although most restraints are analyzed pursuant to a \u201crule of reason,\u201d some trade agreements are so egregiously anti-competitive that they are conclusively presumed illegal without further examination.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Price-fixing agreements among competitors fall within the <em>per se </em>unreasonable category.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Ancar\u2019s detailed explanation of the defendants\u2019 price-fixing sufficiently alleges this element.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">Section 2 of the Sherman Act forbids the attempt, conspiracy, or act of monopolizing \u201cany part of the trade or commerce among the several States[.]\u201d <footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The offense of monopoly has two elements: (1) possession of monopoly power in the relevant market, and (2) the willful acquisition or maintenance of that power as distinguished from growth or development as a consequence of a superior product, business acumen, or historic accident.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Anear alleges that Sara Plasma, Inc. and American Plasma Services, Inc. have approximately one-third and two-thirds, respectively, of the metropolitan Houston, Texas area market, and that Delta Biological Plasma Center and American Plasma Services, Inc. share the Pasadena, Texas market area equally. The complaint states that this <em>monopoly </em>power was not based on \u201chistorical accident,\u201d \u201csuperior technical skills,\u201d or \u201chighly advanced business acumen,\u201d but rather is the product of \u201cextensive exercise of anti-competitive conduct to exploit [blood donors] and unduly restrict competition by manipulating the \u2018free market forces\u2019 to insure the Defendants economically superi- or market positions and bargaining power.\u201d Ancar\u2019s pleadings adequately state a section 2 antitrust violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-10\">All of the elements of sections 1 and 2 Sherman Act claims are pleaded and the factual allegations are within the reasonable bounds of credulity. The dismissal of the claims as frivolous constituted an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-11\">We agree that Ancar\u2019s remaining claims are frivolous as a matter of law. The common-law fraud and Lanham TradeMark Act violation claims allege illegality in the defendants\u2019 use of the word \u201cdonor\u201d to describe plasma sellers. As a seller, Anear could not possibly be misled by this description. His complaints that the defendants have greater bargaining power and that the sales agreements are adhesion contracts have no legal relevance as Anear does not bring a contract action for breach or rescission. Anear\u2019s allegations that the defendants have discriminated against or treated blood donors poorly are not actionable complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-12\">A ruling on class certification is to be affirmed absent an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We find no abuse, as Anear has not made a credible showing that his representation of all blood donors could \u201cfairly and adequately protect [their] interests.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b539-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>We AFFIRM dismissal of Anear\u2019s claims, other than the antitrust claim, and AFFIRM the court\u2019s refusal to certify a class of all area plasma donors. As to the antitrust claims we VACATE AND REMAND for further proceedings consistent herewith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b536-7\">. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AXJ\">.
