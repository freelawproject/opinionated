Minot, </em>114 Mass. 546. <em>Ward v. Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co., </em>231 Mass. 90, 92. <em>Frati v. Jannini, </em>226 Mass. 430. <em>D\u2019Olimpio </em>v. <em>Jancaterino, </em>304 Mass. 200, 202.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>Under Massachusetts Gen. Laws, chap. 231, sec. 126, a general finding made by a trial judge upon an agreed statement of facts will not ordinarily be disturbed unless it is unwarranted by all the evidence, including both the facts stated and the reasonable inferences that may be drawn from them. <em>Boston Lodge v. Boston, </em>217 Mass. 176.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-3\">It is impracticable <em>to </em>render an opinion upon a statement of facts which present merely a speculative question; <em>Capen v. Washington Insurance Co., </em>66 Mass. (12 Cush) 517; or which is imperfect for failure to state a vital fact, the proof of which is manifestly within the reach of the parties. <em>Old Colony R. R. Co. v. Wilder, </em>137 Mass. 536.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">The \u201cCase Stated\u201d was imperfect in that the facts failed either specifically to state or to warrant any inference to be drawn therefrom that the defendants had ordered the electric service or had knowledge that it was being supplied to the various premises. The service could well have been ordered\" by a tenant or some other person without authority, and knowledge could not have been inferred as contended by plaintiff counsel from the fact that the plaintiff claimed a monopoly on the furnishing of the service in the area in question, since no such monopoly is shown to exist by law, and the defendants might well have supplied their own electric current by motors installed by them in the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">We see no reason for disturbing the decision of the trial judge under these conjectural facts. Report dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
