Padgett, in an action brought by the appellant, the Shawmut Mining Company, against William J. Llewellyn and Eobert J. Padgett, co-partners trading as William J. Llewellyn &amp; Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">The suit or action was brought upon the common money counts; but an account was filed with the declaration showing that the claim sued on was for bricks sold by the plaintiff to William J. Llewellyn &amp; Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">The defendant, Padgett, filed three pleas, (1) that he never was indebted as alleged; (2) that he did not promise as alleged; (3) that he was not co-partner of William J. Llewellyn, trading as William J. Llewellyn &amp; Company, as alleged in the declaration. The defendant, William J. Llewellyn, declined to plead, and later, in open court, confessed judgment in favor of the plaintiff upon the claim filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-9\">In the course of the trial there were thirty-five' exceptions taken to the rulings of the Court upon the evidence, and one upon the prayers.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-10\">William J. Llewellyn, being produced by the plaintiff, testified as to the co-partnership agreement. In the course of his testimony he was asked: \u201cWas there any writing between you?\u201d and he answered: \u201cNone whatever; Padgett did not want any writing.\u201d The defendant asked the Court to strike cut this answer unless \u201cthe witness means to say that Mr. Padgett said so.\u201d There was no explanation given as to&gt; his meaning, and the answer was stricken out. This forms the first exception. In this ruling of the Court we discover no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>error. The Court\u2019s ruling on the second exception was also proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">The third exception was to Llewellyn\u2019s statement that it was the common talk of Baltimore that Boh Padgett was his partner. This general, indefinite statement, not shown to have been brought to the knowledge of the defendant, was properly excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">The fourth exception is to the admissibility of a ledger of William J. Llewellyn &amp; Company offered in evidence by the defendant. This evidence may not have been material, hut in its admission we find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">The witness Llewellyn was, at the time he testified, a manufacturer\u2019s agent, with his offices in the City of New York. He had the agency for the sale of the goods of the St. Mary\u2019s Sewer Pipe Company and the Shawmut Mining Company. These agencies he had held since he left Baltimore, in 1914. In his examination in chief he testified, as we have said, to the existence of an oral co-partnership agreement between him and Robert J. Padgett, by which the firm of W. J. Llewellyn &amp; Company, consisting of Robert J. Padgett and himself, was created. He further testified that the affairs of the firm were managed by the witness, and the profits were equally divided between him and Padgett; that Padgett\u2019s share of the profits was paid to him in cash. The firm was engaged in the sale of bricks, cement, etc., and was agent for the Shawmut Mining Company and for the sale of the Alpha Portland Cement. The co-partnership agreement was made, as he stated, in May, 1908, and shipment of goods to the firm started September, 1909, and ceased September, 1911. Thereafter, in January, 1912, a corporation was formed, known as the Contractors\u2019 Supply Company, with W. J. Llewellyn as president and general manager. The books of the company did not show Padgett\u2019s connection with the firm, or that he shared in the profits of the company. This, as witness said, was in accord with the wishes of Padgett.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>Upon cross-examinatoin, Llewellyn testified that Padgett would never receive a check for his profits. He always took to him the cash. There was no regular time at which these settlements were made. \u201cThe account would he on a piece of paper, so much cement sold to this party, so much hrick sold to this party; that Padgett would look at the account, and, after receiving the money, would tear it up; that he took no receipts from Padgett and made no' entries on the firm\u2019s books.\u201d The money for goods sold by the firm was collected by Llewellyn, and the deposits in the bank were made subject to withdrawal by him only.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">The witness was then asked: \u201cCan you explain how you were so much behind?\u201d He replied that the money was used to further the political interest of Robert J. Padgett; that he himself gave to* Padgett, in addition to his share of the profits, large sums of money for such purposes. The witness was then asked: \u201cWhen did you leave Baltimore ?\u201d \u201cI went in 1913. * * * I have been living in New York now a little over two years.\u201d \u201cWhen did you leave for good ?\u201d \u201cI left in 1914, in the month of March.\u201d Question. \u201cDid you leave Baltimore in December, 1913 ?\u201d. Answer. \u201cWhy, sure. I left several times. I left in December, 1913, with a $4,000.00 check in my pocket, certified h&gt; the order of the St. Mary\u2019s Sewer Pipe Company, to pay a debt for which I was obligated.\u201d Question. \u201cDid you leave rather suddenly ?\u201d Answer. \u201cHo.\u201d \u201cYou did not say good-bye to any of your friends, did you?\u201d \u201cI told William Oorey.\u201d Question. \u201cAnybody else?\u201d '\u201cI told my wife.\u201d Question. \u201cYou got another check cashed just before you left?\u201d To this question the plaintiff\u2019s counsel objected, saying: \u201cWhat has that to do with the case?\u201d As the record disclosed, the witness voluntarily said: \u201cIt has to do with the Llewellyn case'\u2014that is, the Contractors\u2019 Supply Company. I will \u2022acknowledge taking money there. I will acknowledge that.\u201d Then followed a discussion as to the question asked, participated in by the Court, as well as the counsel for the respective parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>At its conclusion the Court said, addressing the defendant\u2019s counsel: \u201cIf any of your questions broach upon his private affairs not connected with this matter, he has the right to refuse to answer.\u201d The counsel for the defendant, dropping the question to which objection had been made, asked the witness: \u201cWhat do you mean by that acknowledgment?\u201d This question was objected to by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel and, the objections being overruled, the fifth exception was taken thereto1.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">It will he observed that this question was directed to the answer of the witness, voluntarily made, in which he said: \u201cI will acknowledge taking money there. I will acknowledge that.\u201d The witness answered the question objected to1, saying that \u201con the same day that I had this $4,000.00 check certified I also drew the payroll of the Contractors\u2019 Supply Company, and also drew a check to my order, W. J. Llewellyn, for thirteen hundred dollars.\u201d This answer\", given in explanation of the earlier answer of the witness, which was uncertain in its meaning, was not objected to, and the witness was permitted, without objections, to1 state further that he put the money in his pocket and went to his home, and that night he went to New York, from which place he returned to Baltimore on the 20th of December, and after remaining in Baltimore for about two days, again went to Now York, and in the latter part of the year 1914 ceased to make his home in Baltimore. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel proceeding with the examination asked: \u201cThis $1300.00 you took\u201d\u2014here the witness interrupted him, saying: \u201cWas. the stock\u2014I will finish that for you\u2014was the stock of the Contractors\u2019 Supply Company which I was entitled to.\u201d Question. \u201cDid you tell anybody you were going to take it ?\u201d Answer.-\u201cI resigned on that date.\u201d Question. \u201cThen you took the money and went off with it ?\u201d Answer: \u201cI took it and got the money, cash.\u201d \u201cWell, now, Mr. Llewellyn, isn\u2019t it a fact, for a long time afterward you were afraid to come to Baltimore for fear you would he arrested?\u201d \u201cNo; I was here <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>all the time.\u201d He was back in the office the following Wednesday. He did not feai* arrest. The witness was then asked: \u201cIsn\u2019t it fact, with regard to the $1300.00 check, that yon got that check signed in Baltimore by Mr. Corey, as secretary of the company, representing to* him that it was to be used for payroll, and that you then, instead of using it for payroll, used it for your own personal benefit?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">This question was objected to, and the Court thereupon struck from the question the words, \u201cand that .you then, instead of using it for the payroll, used it for your own personal benefit\u201d; and the question, as amended, was propounded to the witness. The plaintiff again objected and the Court overruled his objection. This forms the sixth exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">He replied, in substance, saying there were two' or three checks, drawn in blank, signed by William H. Corey, an officer of the corporation authorized to sign checks. He \u2022could not recall whether he had demanded his check of $1300.00 or not; that he asked Miss Thompson, an employee in the office, to fill in a check to the St. Mary\u2019s Sewer Pipe 'Company, but she refused, saying, \u201cThey\u201d (meaning others interested in the company) \u201cdid not want her to.\u201d He then filled in the check himself, for the sum of $4,000.00 to St. Mary\u2019s Sewer Pipe Company, and also filled in another to himself, W. J. Llewellyn, for $1300.00; that the representations made to.Corey to have him sign the checks were those ordinarily made\u2014that is, that he wanted so many checks. He was not told for what he wanted them.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">We have gone very fully into the evidence leading up to the fifth and sixth exceptions, in order that it may be seen whether the answers to the questions objected to, when considered in connection with the evidence admitted without objections, injuriously affected the plaintiff, even though it should be held that the defendant pursued this line of questioning beyond what he should have done. In view of the evidence preceding the question involved in the fifth exception, and the doubtful character of the answer of the wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>ness, voluntarily given, to which the question was directed to ascertain its meaning, and the statement of the Court that the witness was not required to answer the question if it involved his private affairs, not connected with the matter in controversy, the Court, in our opinion, committed no reversible error in permitting the question to he asked.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">As we have already said, no objection was made to the answer, involved in the fifth exception, and the witness was permitted thereafter to state facts that, without explanation, were more harmful to the character of the witness, as affecting his credibility, and more injurious to the plaintiff\u2019s case, by reason thereof, than the answer to the question objected to in the sixth exception; and consequently, we can find no reversible error in the Court\u2019s ruling upon the sixth exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">The ruling of the Court upon the seventh exception was entirely proper upon cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">The eighth exception was to the admissibility of a letter from Hecht to the witness, Yates. It was offered and admitted to refresh the memory of Yates as to a meeting with Hecht at the Caswell Hotel on January 14, 1917. We find nothing in its contents to injure the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">The ninth exception is to the admissibility of another letter of March 21, 1914, from Yates, manager of the Shawmut Mining Company, to Hecht^ in which he denied having employed Hecht as his attorney. He had prevoiusly stated in his testimony that Hecht was not his attorney, and consequently this admission of the letter could not have injured the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">We discover no error in the Court\u2019s rulings in the tenth, eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">The fourteenth, fifteenth, sixteenth, seventeenth, eighteenth, nineteenth, twentieth, twenty-first and twenty-second exceptions are to conversations had by the witness, Hecht, with Yates, which are claimed by the plaintiff to be privileged communications, because of the alleged relation of at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>torney and client existing between Hecht and Tates. Tates was the agent of the Shawmut Mining Company, and it was with him that Llewellyn did all of his dealings in connection with the purchase of the goods mentioned in the account,, filed with the declaration, upon which this suit is instituted. Tates, produced on the part of the plaintiff, had already testified as to the existence of a co-partnership between Padgett and Llewellyn, and had been asked concerning conversations with Hecht, which, as claimed by the defendant, were inconsistent with any knowledge, on his part, of any such co-partnership. There were no objections interposed thereto,, or any claim made at the time, that said conversations were privileged communications, because of the relation of attorney and client, existing between them; but Tates, on the contrary, denied that Hecht was, at the time of such conversations, his attorney. He said of Hecht that he never regarded him as of any consequence whatever, beyond that of an office boy for Mr. Padgett, that he did not place any great stock in Mr. Hecht, and concluded by saying that Plecht \u201cnever was. a recognized attorney of mine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">The privilege resulting, from communications between attorney and client is designed to secure the client\u2019s confidence in the secrecy of his communication, but it assumes, of course, that the communications are made with the intention of confidentiality. The moment confidence ceases, privilege ceases. <em>Wigmore on Evidence, </em>sec. 2311. If Tates did not recognizeHecht as his attorney the communications were not made to him as his attorney, and consequently such circumstances were without that confidentiality that is requisite, under the rule, to make it a privileged communication. It may also be-said that while the privilege is for the protection of the client, he may waive the privilege, and this may be done by implication, for instance, he can not be allowed, after disclosing as much as he pleases, to withhold the remainder. In view of the testimony of Tates, the evidence admitted under these exceptions was properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>We find no error in the Court\u2019s ruling in the exclusion of evidence offered in the twenty-third, twenty-fourth and twenty-fifth exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">The Court\u2019s rulings in admitting the evidence in the twenty-sixth, twenty-seventh, twenty-eighth and\" twenty-ninth, and its excluding the evidence offered under the thirtieth and thirty-first exceptions wore proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">The thirty-second and thirty-third exceptions were to the exclusion of evidence offered in rebuttal, which evidence was properly excluded, and the same may be said of the thirty-fourth and thirty-fifth exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">The thirty-sixth exception goes to the ruling of the Court upon the defendant\u2019s first and second prayers that were granted, and the plaintiff\u2019s second prayer that was refused. The defendant\u2019s first prayer relates to the burden of proof, and we are. unable to find any error committed by the Court in granting that instruction; nor do we find any defect in the defendant\u2019s second prayer to which the appellant, in its brief, makes no allusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">Both the granted and rejected prayers of the plaintiff appear to have been drawn upon the theory that there was a plea of limitations in the case, but there was none. It is, however, only, to the second or rejected prayer that our attention need be given; and this prayer was properly rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">There is a motion in this case to dismiss the appeal, involving not only the construction of Chapter 625 of the Acts of 1916, hut th\u2019e validity of that Act. These questions will he disposed of in an opinion hereafter to be delivered in a case now pending before us, -and as it is our opinion that the judgment below in this case should he affirmed regardless of our views of the questions raised by the motion to dismiss, it is not necessary to discuss the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">Having found no error in the rulings of the Court below the judgment of that Court will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-10\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed, with costs to the appellees.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
