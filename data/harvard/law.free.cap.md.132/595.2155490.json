And upon his failure to return said bills of exceptions within said time, the hills of exceptions shall be signed by the Court, as originally prepared by the appellant, or his counsel. If the said appellee, or his counsel, shall return the said hills of exceptions to the appellant, or his counsel, with his amendments or additions, as hereinabove provided, the said bills of exceptions, with such amendments or additions shall forthwith be presented to the judge before whom the said case was tried, who shall settle the same within five days thereafter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">According to the terms of this Act, the bills of exceptions may be signed at any time during the .period within which the parties have a right to appeal from the \u201crendition of the verdict of the jury or the findings, of the Court upon the issue of fact in said cause,\u201d and upon the filing of an order i'or an appeal, the time for signing the bills of exceptions is further extended until ten days before the expiration of the period within, which the Record is required to, he transmitted to the Court of <em>Appeals; </em>provided the appellant submits the bills of exceptions to the appellee, or his counsel, for such amendments or additions, as he may desire, not less, than thirty days .before the expiration of the time within which the Record must he transmitted to the' Court, of Appeals, and the appellee, or his counsel, shall within fifteen days from the time he receives them return the bills of exceptions^ with the amendments and additions he desires, to the appellant, or his counsel. The1 Act then provides that upon the failure of the appellee to return the bills of exceptions,, etc., within the time mentioned, they \u201cshall be signed by the Court, as originally prepared by the appellant, or his counsel,\u201d and that if the bills- of exceptions, with the additions and amendments desired by the appellee, shall he returned to- the appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>lant as therein provided, they shall be forthwith presented to the judge, \u201cwho shall settle the same within five days thereafter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">The Record shows that the verdict in the case in favor of the defendants was rendered under the instructions of the Court on the 28th of June, 1917, and that the final judgment was entered on the 2nd of July, 1917. On the 20th of July the Court extended the time for signing the bills of exceptions until the 1st of September, 1917, and by subsequent orders, each one of which was passed by the Court before the expiration of the time allowed in the last previous order, the time was further extended \u201cuntil and including\u201d the 15th of November, 1917. The order for the appeal was filed on the 16th of August, but the bills of exceptions were not submitted to the appellees until the first of November, 1917, and on that day counsel for the appellees notified counsel for the appellant that the bills of exceptions had been submitted to- them too late, and that, without waiving the provisions of the Act, they would examine same and return them with, such amendments as they desired \u201cas expeditiously as possible within the time allowed by law.\u201d The bills of exceptions, with a long list of the additions and amendments desired by the appellees, were returned to the appellant on the 12th of November, and on the 15th of November, 1917, they were signed by Judge- Heuisleb, who certified that he did so- \u201cover the objections of the defendants-that the said bills of exceptions were submitted too late to the appellees or their counsel, and too late to the Court,\u201d and that no objections were made to their contents.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">- The appellees insist that the provisions of the Act \u201cas to time\u201d are mandatory, while the appellant contends that the Act does- not deprive the trial Court of the power1 to extend the time for signing bills, of exceptions; that it does not apply to appeals from judgments, and that the appellees by accepting, i*eviewing and suggesting amendments and addi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>ticns to the hills, of exceptions, waived their right to object that they were not given the exact time allowed by the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">That part of the Act which provides that the hills of exceptions may he <em>signed at any time </em>within the period that the parties have the right to file an appeal \u201cfrom the rendition of the verdict by tbe jury or tbe findings of the Court upon the issue of fact in said cause,\u201d when applied to ordinary suits at law, must be construed to mean that the hills of exceptions may be signed within the. period an appeal can be taken from the judgment. -The Act was obviously intended to cover all cases in which bills of exceptions are required, while the language employed would suggest that the. framer of the Act had in mind cases, such as the trial of issues from the Orphans\u2019 Court or courts of equity, in which no judgr ment is entered in the. Court of law, and the appeal is taken, on. exceptions, from a, ruling or \u201cdetermination\u201d of the Court. In ordinary suits, at law there can be no. appeal from the verdict <em>(New &amp; Sons </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>82 Md. 40; <em>Mass. Bond. Co. </em>v. <em>Casualty Ins. Co., </em>129 Md. 192), and the right to appeal does not arise until a final judgment has been entered. <em>Hayman </em>v. <em>Lambden, </em>97 Md. 33. In cases where the appeal is from the judgment of the Court, this provision of the Act must be held to authorize the signing of the bills of exceptions at any time within thei period an appeal may he entered from the judgment, and in the eases where no judgment is entered in the Court of law, the bills of exceptions may be signed witbin the time the appeal may be taken from a ruling or determination of the Court. Code, Article 5, Sections 5 and 6; <em>Hoppe </em>v. <em>Byers, </em>60 Md. 381.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">The order for the appeal having been filed on the 16th of August, the time for signing the bills, of exceptions wa,s thereby extended to ten days before tbe1 expiration of the three months within which the Record should have been sent to the Court of Appeals (Code, Article 5, Section 6), and the Act required the appellant to submit, tbe bills of exceptions to tbe appellees, not less than thirty days before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>expiration of said three months. The bills of exceptions were hot presented to the appellees until the first of November, 1917, and were not signed by the Court until the 15th of November, but, as w\u00a9 have said, the Court had, by its several orders, extended the time for1 the signing of the bills of exceptions \u201cuntil and including\u201d the latter date, and the question is&gt; Did the Court below have the authority to extend the time and to sign the exceptions under the circumstances stated ?</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">Section 316 of the Charter of Baltimore City, which was repealed by.the Act of 1916, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AaS\">\u201cBills of exception may be signed in any cause pending in any of said courts at any time within thirty days from the rendition of the verdict of the jury or the findings of the court upon the issue of fact in said cause, but not thereafter, unless the time for signing said bill of exception shall have been previously extended by order of court or by consent of the parties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">Under that section of the Charter, this Court repeatedly held that the trial Court had the authority to extend the time for signing bills of exceptions, provided the order to that effect was passed within the thirty days, or within the time allowed by the last previous order. <em>Gottlieb </em>v. <em>Fred. W. Wolf </em>Co., 75 Md. 126; <em>Edelhoff </em>v. <em>Horner-Miller Mfg. Co., </em>86 Md. 595. But where the time for signing the bills of exceptions was not extended by consent of the parties, or by an. order passed within the thirty days from the rendition of the verdict, and the exceptions were not signed within the thirty days, this Court held in <em>Am. Tobacco Co. </em>v. <em>Strickling, </em>88 Md. 500, the appeal should be dismissed. In 2 <em>Poe\u2019s P. &amp; P., </em>see. 319, it is said: \u201cThe subject is usually regulated by the rules of Court, which almost universally provide that bills of exceptions shall be prepared and tendered to the Court during the term at which the case is tried, unless otherwise specially ordered by the Court. If an extension of time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>is applied for during the term, and granted, or if the parties consent, they may he prepared and signed after the expiration of the term; hut in the absence of such extension or consent, the Court has no power to sign them, and in the appellate Court they will, if objected, to, be disregarded, and not be considered as part of the record.\u201d In the case of <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Md. &amp; Pa. R. Co., </em>112 Md. 599, the Court said: \u201cEach of these orders was signed before the expiration of the last previous one so that there was no break or gap in the total period of the extension of the time. We do not think that the Court below exceeded its power in granting these extensions of time. As no rule of that Court regulating this subject appears in the record we assume that none exists. Under the ordinary practice, although the exception to a ruling of the Court must he taken at the time the ruling is made, it is neither usual nor necessary to prepare the bills of exceptions or have them signed until after trial at some convenient time during the term at which the case is tried; unless otherwise specially ordered by the Court, which may by an order passed during the term extend the time beyond its expiration. * * * Although this Court has repeatedly emphasized the importance of having bills of exception prepared and signed promptly while the recollection of the facts involved in them is fresh in the minds of the Court and counsel, it has in several eases recognized the power of the Court below to grant successive extensions of time for that purpose where the first extension is made before tbe expiration of the term and each subsequent one is granted before tbe expiration of the preceding one.\u201d These decisions are to the effect that where there is a statute or rule of Court fixing the time in which bills of exceptions may be signed, the Court, in the absence of some provision to the contrary, may, by an order passed within the time specified, extend the time for the signing of the bills of exceptions, and. where there is no rule of Court or statute upon the subject, the hills of exceptions must be signed during the term unless the Court, by an order passed during the term, extends the time beyond the expiration of the term</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>Eow the Act of 1916-, Chapter 625, does in effect provide that, where an order for an appeal has been filed, the bills of exceptions must be signed ten days before the record must be transmitted to the Court of Appeals, but it does not in terms prohibit the judge from signing them at a later date, nor is 'there anything in the Act to indicate that the Legislature intended to deprive the Court of its power to extend the time in a proper case. It requires the appellant to submit the bills of exceptions to the appellee or his counsel not less than thirty days prior to the expiration of the time within which the record must be filed in the Court of Appeals, but it does not provide that upon his neglect to do so he shall be deprived of the benefit -of his exceptions, although such neglect on his part may result in his failure to have the exceptions signed within the time provided by the Act, and his losing the benefit of his appeal, unless the Court extends the time for the signing of the same. It is clear that that part of the Act which provides that upon the failure of the appellee to return the bills of exceptions within the fifteen days mentioned they shall be signed by the Court as originally prepared by the appellant, and the further provision of the Act that upon the return of the bills of exceptions by the appellee, with his amendments and additions, the same shall forthwith be presented to the judge, \u201cwho shall settle the same within five days thereafter,\u201d can not be said to be mandatory. To hold that they are mandatory would require the Court to sign the bills of exceptions notwithstanding they were not properly prepared by the appellant, or might deprive the appellant of the benefit of his exceptions, or of his right of appeal, because of his inability to present the bills of exceptions to the jndge, who may be sick or absent, or because of the inability of the jndge, by reason of sickness or pressing engagements, to sign them within the five days.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">The judgment in this case was rendered on the.2nd of July, and section 302 of the Charter provides that the stated terms of the Baltimore City Court shall commence on the \u2022 second Monday of January, second Monday of May and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>second Monday of September. The first order for an extension of the time for signing the hills of exceptions was therefore passed during the time allowed hy the statute, and during the term of Court at which the judgment was rendered, and each of the subsequent orders extending the time was passed before the expiration of the time allowed in the next preceding order. Under these circumstances, and upon the authorities cited, we can not hold that the Court below exceeded its authority in extending the time for signing the bills of exceptions, or that the same were signed too late.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Under section 316 of the Charter hills, of exceptions had to bo signed within, thirty days from the. rendition of the verdict unless the time was. extended by the Court or hy consent of the parties, and the evident, purpose of the Act of 1916, Chapter 625, was to. allow the appellant ample time for the preparation and signing of the hill of exceptions, and to do away with the necessity of repeated order's for an extension of the time. Under the terms of the Act, the bills of exceptions may ho signed at any time during the time within which the appeal may be taken, and .upon the filing of the order for appeal, the appellant is allowed two. months longer within which to prepare them. Ordinarily the time allowed by the statute would seem to he amply sufficient for the preparation of the hills of exceptions, and the time for1 signing them should not be extended hy the trial Court, except upon a petition setting forth good and sufficient reasons therefor, and where the judge is satisfied that, the reasons are well-founded.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">The appellees did not waive their right to. object to the signing of the hills of exceptions. On the contrary, they notified counsel for the appellant when the hills, of exceptions were submitted to. them that they did not waive their right to rely upon the provisions of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">It is suggested in the brief of the appellant that the action of the trial judge in signing hills of exceptions, cannot be reviewed by this Court, but of course this is, not so. if the judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>had no jurisdiction to sign them, for instance, where they were not signed during the time fixed by statute or rule of Court, or during the term of Court at which the judgment was entered, in a case where there was no rule of Court or statute on the subject; or by consent of the parties, or during the life of an order passed during the time fixed by rule of Court or statute, or during the term of Court in a c\u00e1se where there was no rule of Court or statute. <em>Am. Tobacco Co. </em>v. <em>Strickling, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">It follows from what has been said that the motion to dismiss the appeal must he overruled. While no opinion can be filed dealing with tbe case on its merits because tbe Court is divided as to the proper disposition to be made of it, we bave concluded to dispose of tbe motion to dismiss tbe appeal because the Act of 1916 has never been construed by this Court, and because several motions based upon its provisions bave been filed in this Court to dismiss the appeals in other cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">\n<em>Motion to dismiss the appeal overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">A motion for a reargument of this case was granted on the 10th of July, 1918.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
