An answer was filed to this demand by the plaintiff, stating that the declaration was a sufficient bill of particulars.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-9\">The Court below sustained the defendant\u2019s exception to the plaintiff\u2019s answer', and directed the plaintiff to file a bill of particulars in accordance with the1 demand on or before tbe 28th of \"November, 1917. Tbe plaintiff refused to comply with the order, requiring'him to. file a hill of particulars, and the Court entered a judgment! of <em>non pros </em>and a judgment for the defendant for costs. Erom this judgment the plaintiff has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-10\">A motion is made to dismiss the appeal upon the ground that the action of the Conrt, in granting or refusing a demand for a bill of particulars, is within the sound discretion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>of tho Court, and is not reviewable on appeal to tbis Court until final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">The rule upon this subject is not only well settled in this and other jurisdictions., but has been applied, and enforced by a number of recent, cases, in this Court, and it need not be discussed on this appeal. <em>Warfield v. State, </em>116 Md. 599; <em>Burk </em>v. <em>Tinsley, </em>80 Md. 100; <em>Freud </em>v. <em>State, </em>129 Md. 636.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">The appeal in this ease, however, is. taken from a judgment of <em>non pros </em>and a judgment for the defendant, for costs. Erom such a judgment an appeal will lie. <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Md. Home Insurance Co., </em>90 Md. 52; <em>Rutledge </em>v. <em>McAfee, 12 </em>Md. 32; <em>State </em>v. <em>Gitlings, </em>33 Md. 461.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">In the recent case of <em>Emersonian Apts. </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>132 Md. 209, this Court said: \u201cWhen there is a ruling on a demurrer to the declaration in favor of tho defendant and the plaintiff declines to amend, of course, then the judgment is properly a judgment for costs and is final, as the judgment is that the plaintiff %o without day.\u2019 (1 <em>Poe, </em>She. 710.) Such a judgment determines that the plaintiff is not entitled to recover on what is stated in the declaration.\u201d (1 <em>Poe, </em>See. 591.)</p>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">In this ease, we find nothing upon tho Record to show that the Court below transcended its power in granting tbo order for a bill of particulars., as defined by the cases referred to herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-10\">On the contrary, we think, it was a proper case for a bill of particulars.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-11\">In 31 <em>Cyc. </em>568, it is stated, \u201cAt the present time the right to a bill of particulars, is generally held to extend to all descriptions of actions, at law, when, justice demands that a party shall be apprised of the matter for which he is to be put to trial with more particularity tiran is required by the rules of pleading.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b601-12\">In <em>Warfield </em>v. <em>State, </em>116 Md., <em>supra, </em>tho general rule was stated to.\u2019be, that \u201cThere is no restriction upon, the power; it extends to all descriptions of actions, where justice demands <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>that a party, whether plaintiff or defendant, should be apprised of the particulars of the facts his adversary expects to prove; and the scope of the order must ordinarily be a question of discretion to be governed by the circumstances.\u201d 3 <em>Enc. Pl. and Pr. </em>523; <em>Cunard </em>v. <em>Francklyn, </em>111 N. Y. 511.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">In <em>Breslauer Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>115 N. Y., Appellate Division, 360, a somewhat similar case, the rule was applied, and the Oourt said: \u201cThe contract for the completion of these houses contains many clauses in relation to the buildings to be erected upon the premises. It would be impossible for the defendants to prepare for trial without knowledge of the particulars in which the plaintiff claims that the houses were not completed as required by the contract. The action is to recover the damages sustained because defendants did not complete the work in accordance with their contract. The plaintiff must know in what respect it justified its refusal to accept the work when tendered by the defendants, and in what respect the buildings were not then completed as provided for in the contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">For the reasons stated; the motion to dismiss the appeal, must be overruled, and the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
