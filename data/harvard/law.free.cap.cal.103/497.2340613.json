Adultery is not made a crime by any statute of California. It is the living together in open and notorious cohabitation and adultery that is made criminal by the statute (Stats. 1871-72, p. 380), and it has been rightly held that mere adultery without the notorious cohabitation does not constitute the offense. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gates, </em>46 Cal. 52.)</p>\n<p id=\"b529-13\">The judgment being void the imprisonment is necessarily unlawful, and the prisoner must be discharged. It is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
