Before the nonsuit was granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>appellants made a dem\u00e1nd for findings which wag refused, and afterwards they took an exception, which perhaps included both the failure of the court to make findings and the nonsuit. But the order of the court granting a nonsuit is nowhere assigned as error, and therefore it cannot be assailed. \u201cWhen a nonsuit is granted and the plaintiff makes a statement-for a new trial, in the specifications of errors, why a new trial should- be granted, he m\u00fast insert -the alleged error of granting- a nonsuit-.\u201d <em>(McCreery </em>v. <em>Everding, </em>44 Cal. 284.) \u201c The question presented on a motion for a nonsuit is a question of law, and in the statement on new trial the decision of the motion should be specifically an error of law.\u201d <em>(Donahue </em>v. <em>Gallavan, </em>43 Cal. 573.)</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">As the order, granting the nonsuit is not assigned as error, no action of the court prior to the nonsuit need b\u00e9 feiamined. We may say, however, that a nonsuit can be properly granted after the evidence on both sides is closed <em>(Geary </em>v. <em>Simmons, </em>39 Cal. ,224; <em>Vanderford </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>64 Cal. 49), and that findings are not required in a case of nonsuit. <em>(Reynolds </em>v. <em>Brumagim, </em>54 Cal. 254; <em>Gilson etc. Co. </em>v. <em>Gilson, </em>47 Cal. 601.)</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">- Judgment and order affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">De Haven, J., and Fitzgerald, J., concurred..</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
