S. gold coin, the purchase price of the property this day sold to him, situated in the city and county of San Francisco, state of California, and described as follows, to wit:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-8\">\u201c Lot and improvements situated on the northeast corner of Van Ness and Ash avenues, 58 feet on Van Ness avenue, by 100 feet on Ash avenue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-9\">\u201c Terms of sale: 21 days are allowed to examine title and consummate sale. At the termination of said time the balance of said purchase money is due and payable upon tender of the deed of the property sold.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-10\">\u201c Title to he examined and accepted or rejected by J. De Witt Allen\u2019s attorney. Abstract to be run down to date; $150 to be allowed for attorney\u2019s fees. Mortgage to be released and to be free and clear from all encumbrances. Taxes to be paid to July 1, 1889.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-11\">\u201cIf the sale is not consummated in accordance with the foregoing conditions the deposit to be forfeited.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-12\">\u201c David Stern and Son, Agents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-13\">\u201cAgreed to: John De W. Allen.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-14\">The plaintiff submitted the abstract of the record title to his attorney, Sidney V. Smith, who was a reputable attorney at law, and practicing as such in San Francisco, for examination, and to be accepted or rejected by him according to the above agreement. He rejected the title as to an undivided one-third part of the lot, for reasons stated by him in writing, and duly com muni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>cated to defendant and to David Stern and Son. Thereupon plaintiff demanded a return of the one thousand dollars deposited, which in the mean time had been delivered to defendant. The defendant refused to return the deposit, tendered to plaintiff a deed for the lot, and demanded the balance of the purchase money, claiming that the title was perfect notwithstanding it had been rejected by plaintiff\u2019s attorney. Thereupon plaintiff brought this action to recover the deposit of one thousand dollars with interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">The judgment was in favor of the plaintiff; but, on motion of the defendant, a new trial was granted, and this appeal by plaintiff is from the order granting anew trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">It is not .claimed that the written agreement was for an unconditional sale, but the parties disagree as to what were intended to be the conditions upon which plaintiff would be bound to \u201c consummate the sale,\u201d by payment of the balance of the purchase money. The appellant contends that one of the conditions of his obligation to consummate the sale was that his attorney should accept, and not reject, the record title, while the respondent contends that the only conditions intended were that the title should appear to be a good, marketable title, and that defendant should tender a sufficient deed-to convey such title. They also disagree as to whether or not defendant\u2019s title was in fact a good, marketable title, but, in our view of the case, this question becomes immaterial, and upon it we express no opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">Our understanding and construction of the agreement is that unless plaintiff\u2019s attorney accepted and did not reject the title, the plaintiff was not bound to consummate the sale. This, if not fully expressed, is fairly inferable from the language of the contract, otherwise no meaning or purpose whatever can be attributed to a considerable portion of that language. For what purpose were twenty-one days allowed for examination of title and consummation of sale? Of what importance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>was an <em>\u201c </em>abstract of title run down to date? \u201d Why was the \u201ctitle to he examined\u201d by plaintiff\u2019s attorney rather than by defendant\u2019s attorney? Was neither the acceptance nor rejection of the title by plaintiff\u2019s attorney to be of any consequence whatever? The language of the contract relating to the examination, acceptance, and rejection of the title, considered in connection with the subject matter, will reasonably and justly bear the construction we have given it; and, since no other rational meaning, purpose, or consequence of that language can be imagined, that construction should be accepted. It was but a reasonable and prudent precaution on the part of the plaintiff to insist upon the condition that the title should be passed and accepted by his own attorney, contrary to whose opinion and advice he was .unwilling to invest thirty-five thousand dollars in a city lot. Had the condition been simply that the title should be good and marketable, the plaintiff might have been compelled to accept it and to pay for the lot, as the result of a tedious and expensive lawsuit, the judgment in which, as to the title, would not have been conclusive against any adverse claimant who was not a party to the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">Neither of the three cases cited by the counsel for respondent is in point. In <em>Winter </em>v. <em>Stock, </em>29 Cal. 407, 89 Am. Dec. 57, the vendor warranted \u201c an indisputable and satisfactory title, or no sale.\u201d In <em>Montgomery </em>v. <em>Pacific C. L. Bureau, </em>94 Cal. 284, 28 Am. St. Rep. 122, the title was warranted to be \u201c perfect.\u201d The case of <em>Vought </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>120 N. Y. 253, 17 Am. St. Rep. 634, was an action for specific performance of a contract of sale which provided that the title was to be \u201c first class.\u201d In each of these cases the title was rejected by the attorney for the vendee; but in each the court held that the material question was whether or not the title was good and marketable; and not whether it was acceptable to the vendee\u2019s attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">But in the case at bar, according to our construction of the contract, the only warranty or representation as to the quality of the title was that it should be accept<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>able to plaintiff\u2019s attorney. Therefore, the question whether or not the title was, in fabt, a good marketable title, is not involved, as it was in the cases cited by counsel for respondent. And, since it appears that plaintiff\u2019s attorney rejected the title, and it is not even suggested that the rejection was not the result of a sufficient examination and an honest opinion, the order granting a new trial should be reversed, and it is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">Hearing in Bank denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
