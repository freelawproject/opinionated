width=\"668\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b108-10\">The court overruled the objection, and defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>excepted. After reading these documents the plaintiff rested, and the defendant offered no evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">The judgment was in favor of plaintiff, enforcing his lien for forty-nine dollars and thirty cents, with interest and costs. From this judgment, and from an order denying his motion for a new trial, the defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">1. It is not distinctly claimed here, however, that the court erred in admitting these documents in evidence, but it is contended by appellant that, being admitted, their effect as evidence was to show that the attempted assessment was entirely void, for the reasons above stated as grounds of objection to the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">While I;think it must be admitted that defendant\u2019s lot was assessable for work done on the crossing of main streets only in proportion to its frontage on such main streets, within one of the quarter blocks cornering on the crossing (Act of March 14, 1889, section 5, subdivision 3, Statutes 1889, 163), and that the assessment of it for a greater proportion was error, I do not think the assessment in question was void. It appears that, in making the assessment in this case, Sheridan street (thirty-five feet in width) was regarded as a lot fronting on Tenth street; that its frontage (thirty-five feet) on Tenth street was distributed among, and assessed to, all the lots fronting on Sheridan street, in proportion to their frontage thereon; and, as defendant\u2019s lot had a frontage of eighty feet on Sheridan street, six dollars and fifty cents was added to the assessment thereon on this account. It seems that this mode of apportioning the assessm\u00e9nt was supposed to be required by the \u201cseventh subdivision\u201d of section 5 of the act above cited; but this, I have no doubt, was a mistake, which added to the assessment on defendant\u2019s lot about five dollars and sixty cents more than its proper proportion of the whole assessment. Yet, since defendant\u2019s lot had a frontage of forty-five feet on Tenth street within a quarter block cornering on the crossing improved, it was lawfully assessable for the work on that crossing; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>and, inasmuch as an assessment of it for such work was fully authorized, the mistake of the superintendent of streets in assessing it for a sum exceeding its proper proportion was merely an error in the exercise of unquestionable power, which error might have been corrected by an appeal to the board of supervisors; and the failure to take such appeal operated as a waiver of the error. (Act of March 18, 1885, sec. 11; Stat. 1885, p. 147; <em>Himmelmann </em>v. <em>Hoadley, </em>44 Cal. 276; <em>Frick </em>v. <em>Morford, </em>87 Cal. 576; <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Conniff, </em>99 Cal. 386; <em>Perine </em>v. <em>Erzgraber, </em>102 Cal. 234.)</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">2. Appellant further contends that section 8 of the amendatory act of March 14, 1889, Statutes of 1889, page 138, providing that the warrant, assessment, etc., \u201c shall be held <em>prima facie </em>evidence of the regularity and correctness of the assessment, .... and like evidence of the right of plaintiff to recover in the action,\u201d is in violation of section 24 of article IV of the constitution. But this point is fully answered in the cases of <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Conniff, </em>99 Cal. 386, and <em>Perine </em>v. <em>Erzgraber, </em>102 Cal. 234. The plaintiff properly recovered on such <em>prima facie </em>evidence, as the defendant introduced no evidence whatever.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">3. The constitutional question raised by appellant in his reply brief, as to whether or not, in case of an appeal to the board of supervisors, the judgment of the board is final, is not involved, since there was no such appeal in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">I think the judgment and order should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">Belcher, C., and Temple, C., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">For the reasons given in the foregoing opinion, the judgment and order appealed from are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-10\">De Haven, J., McFarland, J., Fitzgerald, J.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-11\">Hearing in Bank denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
