The judgment was in favor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>of the plaintiffs, from which an appeal was taken by the irrigation district.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b644-5\"><em>C. H. Rippey, </em>and <em>David L. Withington, </em>for Appellants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b644-6\">The directors had express power to create a debt without a vote of the electors. (See Wright Act, secs. 11, 14, 15, 35.) There is certainly no express prohibition of the power of taxation in the Wright act, and therefore the district had implied power to create debts, and consequently to levy a tax to pay such debts. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors, </em>21 Cal. 669; <em>Security Sav. Bank </em>v. <em>Hinton, </em>97 Cal. 219; <em>Citizens\u2019 Sav. and Loan Association </em>v. <em>Topeka, </em>20 Wall. 655; <em>Wolff </em>v. <em>New Orleans, </em>103 U. S. 358; <em>Quincy </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>113 U. S. 332\u201438; <em>Albuquerque Bank </em>v. <em>Perea, </em>147 U. S. 87; Cooley on Taxation, 475-79.) It will not do to say that a minority of the electors, by refusing to act, can relieve the taxpayers of the obligation, and the legislature has recognized this by providing in the act to disincorporate, that no district shall be dissolved until all indebtedness is paid. (Laws of 1893, pp. 520, 521. And see <em>People </em>v. <em>Selma Irrigation District, </em>98 Cal. 206.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b644-7\"><em>D. L. Murdock, </em>for Respondents.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b644-8\">The assessment is illegal, as it was levied without a vote of the electors. <em>(Tregea </em>v. <em>Owens, </em>94 Cal. 317.) As under section 30 of the Wright law the deed given to a purchaser under sale for delinquent taxes is <em>prima facie </em>evidence of the proceedings, it casts a cloud upon the title. <em>(Palmer </em>v. <em>Rich, </em>12 Mich. 420; <em>Scofield </em>v. <em>Lansing, </em>17 Mich. 447; <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors, </em>15 Wis. 12; High on Injunctions, sec. 595; Blackwell on Tax Titles, sec. 1066.) A deed good on its face is a cloud. (Blackwell on Tax Titles, sec. 1066; Pligh on Injunctions, sec. 375; <em>Burr </em>v. <em>Hunt, </em>18 Cal. 307; <em>Holt </em>v. <em>Weld, </em>140 Mass. 578; <em>Arrington </em>v. <em>Liscom. </em>34 Cal. 371; 94 Am. Dec. 722.) Injunction will lie to restrain a tax sale that will cast a cloud upon the title when the invalidity will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>not appear upon the face of the deed. (High on Injunctions, secs. 494, 525, 526, 538; Blackwell on Tax Titles, 5th ed., secs. 1053, 1056-58; <em>Burnet </em>v. <em>Cincinnati, </em>3 Ohio, 75; 17 Am. Dec. 582; <em>Greedup </em>v. <em>Franklin, </em>30 Ark. 101; <em>Burr </em>v. <em>Hunt, </em>18 Cal. 307; <em>Axtell </em>v. <em>Gerlach, </em>67 Cal. 483; <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors, </em>15 Wis. 12; <em>Scofield </em>v. <em>Lansing, </em>17 Mich. 447; Pomeroy\u2019s Equity Jurisprudence, sec. 1345; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Hahn, </em>4 Neb. 149; <em>South Platte Land Co. </em>v. <em>Buffalo Co., </em>7 Neb. 253.) A deed regular upon its face, which by statute is made evidence of title, casts a cloud, and the court will enjoin raising of the cloud where it would remove the cloud if cast. <em>(Pixley </em>v. <em>Huggins, </em>15 Cal. 132; Blackwell on Tax Titles, sec. 1066; High on Injunctions, sec. 372; <em>Pettit </em>v. <em>Shepherd, </em>5 Paige, 493; 28 Am.
