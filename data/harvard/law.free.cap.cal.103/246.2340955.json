Section 26 of article IV of the constitution is not self-executing, and until legislation is enacted to aid it, remains inoperative. <em>(Hyatt </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>54 Cal. 353; <em>French </em>v. <em>Teschemaker, </em>24 Cal. 538; <em>People </em>v. <em>Board of Education of Oakland, </em>55 Cal. 334; <em>People </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors, </em>33 Cal. 487; <em>Ex parte Wall, </em>48 Cal. 318; 17 Am.

The assessments on the stocks paid by the defendants at the request of the plaintiff should have been allowed by the court, as the agreement to pay the assessment was an independent contract, and is not prohibited by the constitutional provision relied on by the plaintiff making the contract for the sale of stocks void.

IV, sec. 26.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b279-6\"><em>Roger Johnson, </em>for Respondent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b279-7\">The moneys sought to be recovered herein were received by appellants on contracts for the sale of shares of the capital stock of mining corporations on margin, and to be delivered at a future day, in violation of article IV, section 26, of the constitution of California. <em>(Cashman </em>v. <em>Root, </em>89 Cal. 373; 23 Am.

The defendants are not entitled to the assessments paid, as the contract was an entire contract, and part of it being void, it is void <em>in tolo.

Nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>will the pleadings in this case. permit a credit of .\u2018the assessments, for if appellants had an independent contract for assessments paid out, they must have urged it by way of counterclaim', and their answer contains no counterclaim. <em>(Brannan </em>v. <em>Paty, </em>58 Cal. 330; <em>Carpenter </em>v. <em>Hewel, </em>67 Cal. 589.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b280-4\">The Court.</author>\n<p id=\"AOi\">This action was brought to recover moneys paid to brokers in consideration of purchases .of mining stock on margins. Most of the points raised are precisely those which were considered in <em>Cashman </em>v. <em>Root, </em>89 Cal. 373; 23 Am. St. .Rep. 482; As.we are entirely satisfied with the conclusion there reached, it is not necessary to go over the matter again. Defendants had printed the ternas and conditions upon which they were doing business, and required plaintiff\u2019s agent to agree to them. Those printed terms show that the transactions upon which the money was paid w'ere purchases of stock on margins, within <em>Cashman </em>v. <em>Root, </em>89 Cal. 373; 23 Am. St. Rep. 482.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">During the time defendants held the stock as security they paid certain assessments, which they now insist should be deducted from the amount recovered. The answer contains no claim for a setoff, nor is there a plea of payment or counterclaim. No such credit seems to have been asked for in the trial court. Had there been such a plea, however, the contention could not have been sustained. There was no request made by plaintiff for the payment; and, as the transaction was void, defendants did not hold the stocks, upon which the'assessments were paid, for plaintiff, or as security for a debt due from him. The law will not, therefore, imply a request to pay nor a promise to repay.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">go far as the statement shows any indebtedness arising more than two years before the action was commenced, it also shows that such indebtedness was based upon similar transactions to those after that period. We cannot presume that any part of the-moneys recov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>ered were paid upon any such transactions. - No specification as to the insufficiency of the evidence suggests such point.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">The judgment and order are affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
