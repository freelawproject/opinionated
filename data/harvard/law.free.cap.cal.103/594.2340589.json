The demurrer was overruled, and the defendant then answered, and among other defenses set up pleaded in bar of the action the same provisions of the code.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">The case was tried, and the court found, among other things, that the action was not barred, and that the plaintiff was entitled to judgment for the sum of $1,251.63, with costs. Judgment was accordingly so entered, from which the defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">The demurrer should have been sustained. The action was commenced more than three years and five months after the date of the note set out. The cause of action appeared, therefore, on the face of the complaint to be barred by the statute.of limitations. .</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">It must now be regarded as settled law in this state that the liability of a stockholder of a corporation to pay his proportion of its corporate debts is one created by statute, and an action to enforce that liability must be brought within three years after the cause of action accrues. <em>(Moore </em>v. <em>Boyd, </em>74 Cal. 167; <em>Hyman </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>82 Cal. 650; 16 Am. St. Rep. 178; <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>99 Cal. 612; 37 Am. St. Rep. 87.) In the case last named it was held that the liability of a stockholder of a corporation upon a note given by the corporation is <em>created, </em>within the meaning of section 359 of the Code of Civil Procedure, at least as early as the date of the note, and the statute of limitations commences to run in favor of the stockholder from the date of its execution, and not from its maturity, regardless of how long the liability of the corporation to actions may be postponed by agreement of the creditor.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">The judgment should be reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>Temple, C., and Searls, C., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">For the reasons given in the foregoing opinion the judgment appealed from is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">Harrison, J., Garoutte, J., Van Fleet, J.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
