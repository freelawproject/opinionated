The business seems to have been profitable for a while, but after-wards ended in a loss. The court found that all of the allegations of the complaint were untrue, and all the allegations of the answer true, and rendered judgment for the defendants; and plaintiff appeals from the judgment and an order denying her motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">We think that the judgment and order should be affirmed. Waiving the question*of the alleged illegality of the transactions about wheat\u2014upon which illegality appellant rests her claim to a recovery\u2014it appears that the appellant was not an innocent party to such transactions, but took part in and ratified them. Being therefore a party <em>in pari delicto, </em>the law leaves her where it finds her.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">The judgment and order are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">De Haven, J., and Fitzgerald, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">Hearing in Bank denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
