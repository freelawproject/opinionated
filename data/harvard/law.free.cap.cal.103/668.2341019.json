The promise of Ross and Bush to \u201cvouch\u201d that the city of Woodland would furnish a lot for such school purposes provided the appellant would erect thereon a \u201cfirst-class\u201d high school, the \u201cproperty to revert to the owners when it ceases to be used for high school purposes,\u201d is entirely too vague to be considered as furnishing any sort of title to the lot mentioned. It is quite clear from the statute that the board of supervisors must own the lot upon which the building is erected and must convey it, after the completion of the building, to the board of education, who must \u201chold\u201d it in trust for the county. And the acquisition of the lot is the first thing to be done. It is needless to inquire whether the title must be in absolute fee simple; for here the board has no title at all. The fact that the board at one time inadvertently accepted the offer of Ross and Bush was not of such force as to necessarily drive it onward to the commission of other unwarranted acts. Moreover, what did it accept? A mere promise made by two persons, without consideration, that another person would, upon the happening of certain contingencies, \u201cfurnish\u201d to the board a conditional estate in a certain piece of land.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-3\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">Fitzgerald, J., and De Haven, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
