LEMONS\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In this appeal, we consider whether the Court of Appeals erred in concluding that a defendant's due process rights were not violated by a jury instruction concerning willful concealment of goods or merchandise while on the premises of a store.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. Facts and Proceedings\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   James Lindsey (\"Lindsey\") was tried by a jury in the Circuit Court of Arlington County (\"trial court\") upon an indictment charging petit larceny, third or subsequent offense. He was found guilty and sentenced to seven days in jail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Bryan Knott (\"Knott\"), an employee at a retail store dealing in clothing for hiking and outdoor wear in Arlington, testified at trial that he observed Lindsey conceal at least two hats under his jacket while in the store. Knott notified his manager and another employee regarding what he had witnessed. The manager, Brad Dana, contacted police while the other employee, Steve Lappat (\"Lappat\") confronted Lindsey. When confronted by Lappat, Lindsey denied concealing the hats and demanded to speak to the manager. After the police arrived, an altercation occurred between Lindsey and Lappat. Lindsey was subsequently arrested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Over Lindsey's objection, the trial court gave Instruction 16 to the jury, which read:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Willful concealment of goods or merchandise while still on the premises of a store is evidence of an intent to convert and defraud the owner of the value of the goods or merchandise, unless there is believable evidence to the contrary.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This instruction came from the Virginia Model Jury Instructions. 2 Virginia Model Jury Instructions-Criminal, No. 36.840 (2011 repl. ed.). Lindsey had proposed an alternate instruction, Instruction O, which the trial court rejected. Instruction O read:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   You may infer that willful concealment of goods or merchandise while still on the premises of a store is evidence of an intent to convert and defraud the owner of the value of the goods or merchandise.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Lindsey appealed his conviction to the Court of Appeals and contended, among other things\n   <footnotemark>\n    *\n   </footnotemark>\n   , that he suffered a denial of due process resulting from the challenged jury instruction. The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's judgment in an unpublished per curiam order.\n   <em>\n    Lindsey v. Commonwealth,\n   </em>\n   Record No. 1558-14-4 (April 16, 2015). The Court of Appeals determined that Instruction 16 merely suggested to the jury a possible conclusion it could draw from predicate facts. Accordingly, the Court of Appeals held that the challenged instruction did not violate Lindsey's due process rights because it informed the jury only about a permissive inference, not a mandatory presumption. Lindsey appealed to this Court, and we granted his appeal on the following assignment of error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   The Court of Appeals erred in upholding the trial court's giving of Jury Instruction 16, and denying proffered Instruction O, because Instruction 16 impermissibly shifted the burden of proof to the defense, in violation of the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   II.

Relying on\n   <em>\n    Francis v.

Lindsey argues that the language in Instruction 16, \"willful concealment ... is evidence of an intent to convert and defraud,\" is also \"cast in the language of command\" and directs the jury to find intent to defraud if the jury finds willful concealment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   We find that Instruction 16 is not similar to the instructions at issue in\n   <em>\n    Francis\n   </em>\n   ; rather, it is like the language of the jury instruction that was challenged in\n   <em>\n    Dobson.\n   </em>\n   Dobson was charged with grand larceny of an automobile, and the jury was instructed that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Proof of the exclusive personal possession by the defendant of recently stolen goods is a circumstance from which you may reasonably infer that the defendant was the thief unless the defendant offers a reasonable account of possession consistent with innocence which the Commonwealth has failed to prove untrue.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"516215\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/260/71/#p75\">\n    260 Va. at 74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=531%20S.E.2d%20569\">\n    531 S.E.2d at 571\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

We rejected his argument and held that this instruction merely informed the jury that it could draw an inference from certain facts, if proved, provided the defendant did not reasonably explain his possession of the recently stolen property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 76,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=531%20S.E.2d%20569\">\n    531 S.E.2d at 572\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The jury was not required to draw any conclusion from the facts proved by the Commonwealth in the absence of such contrary evidence from the defendant.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=531%20S.E.2d%20569\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   We further held that the challenged instruction actually benefitted the defendant because it effectively informed the jury that it could\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   infer that the defendant was a thief if he offered a reasonable explanation of his possession consistent with his innocence.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=531%20S.E.2d%20569\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In this case, the Commonwealth was required to prove that Lindsey willfully concealed the merchandise, and did so with the intent to convert the merchandise to his use without having paid for the merchandise. The relevant portion of Code \u00a7 18.2-103 provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Whoever, without authority, with the intention of converting goods or merchandise to his own or another's use without having paid the full purchase price thereof, or of defrauding the owner of the value of the goods or merchandise, (i) willfully conceals or takes possession of the goods or merchandise of any store or other mercantile establishment... when the value of the goods or merchandise involved in the offense is less than $ 200, shall be guilty of petit larceny... The willful concealment of goods or merchandise of any store or other mercantile establishment, while still on the premises thereof, shall be prima facie evidence of an intent to convert and defraud the owner thereof out of the value of the goods or merchandise.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The language of Instruction 16 merely instructed the jury that willful concealment of goods while on the premises of a store\n   <em>\n    is evidence of\n   </em>\n   intent to convert and defraud. It provided that the jury could consider the concealment of merchandise as evidence of criminal intent, along with any other evidence that was presented to it. Under Code \u00a7 18.2-103, willful concealment is prima facie evidence of intent to convert or defraud. This instruction was a proper statement of the law. Moreover, this instruction did not relieve the Commonwealth of its burden of proving each element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. The remaining language of the instruction, \"unless there is believable evidence to the contrary,\" reinforced that the Commonwealth had the burden of proving each element beyond a reasonable doubt. The instruction did not state that willful concealment alone satisfies the Commonwealth's burden of proof as to the element of intent. Like the instruction in\n   <em>\n    Dobson\n   </em>\n   , this instruction merely created a permissible inference that the jury was free to reject. Significantly, the instruction did not indicate or suggest that the jury was required to draw any conclusion from the facts proved by the Commonwealth. Accordingly, because Instruction 16 contained a permissive inference and not a mandatory presumption, the trial court did not err in giving it to the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In addition to Instruction 16, the trial court also instructed the jury that the Commonwealth had the burden of proving each element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant was presumed innocent until proven guilty, that the presumption of innocence remained with him throughout trial, and that he had no burden to produce any evidence. (App. 4-7). In particular, the jury was given Instruction M, the \"finding instruction.\" (App. 7). This instruction provided that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Mr. Lindsey is charged with the crime of petit larceny by willful concealment of goods or merchandise third or subsequent offense. The Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt each of the following elements of that crime:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   1. That Mr. Lindsey willfully concealed the merchandise of Hudson Trail Outfitters; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   2. That Mr. Lindsey intended to convert the merchandise to his own or another's use without having paid the full purchase price thereof; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   3. That Mr. Lindsey had no authority to do so; and\n   4. That the merchandise was of some value; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   5. That Mr. Lindsey has at least two (2) prior larceny convictions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   If you find from the evidence that the Commonwealth has proved beyond a reasonable doubt each of the above elements of the crime charged, then you shall find Mr. Lindsey guilty, but not fix the punishment until further evidence is heard by you.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   If you find from the evidence that the Commonwealth has proved beyond a reasonable doubt each of the first four elements of the crime charged but has proved only one prior conviction, then you shall find Mr. Lindsey guilty of the crime of petit larceny second offense, but you shall not fix the punishment until your verdict has been returned and further evidence has been heard by you.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   If you find from the evidence that the Commonwealth has proved beyond a reasonable doubt each of the first four elements but has failed to prove any prior convictions, then you shall find Mr. Lindsey guilty of the crime of petit larceny first offense, but you shall not fix punishment until your verdict has been returned and further evidence has been heard by you.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   If you find that the Commonwealth has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt any of the first four elements of the crime, then you shall find Mr. Lindsey not guilty.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   (App. 7). The finding instruction made perfectly clear that the jury was instructed that, notwithstanding the permissive inference set forth in Instruction 16, the Commonwealth was still required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt each element of the offense, including the element of intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \"When granted instructions fully and fairly cover a principle of law, a trial court does not abuse its discretion in refusing another instruction relating to the same legal principle.\"\n   <em>\n    Daniels v.

In this instance, as in\n   <em>\n    Francis\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ,\n   </em>\n   the fact that the Instruction did not facially state that it was relieving the Commonwealth of its burden of proving each element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt is not helpful in making the determination of whether the instruction contains a mandatory presumption that might mislead a jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   As regards the dependent clause included in Instruction 16, the majority opinion claims, \"[t]he remaining language of the instruction, 'unless there is believable evidence to the contrary,' reinforced that the Commonwealth had the burden of proving each element beyond a reasonable doubt.\" I disagree. Because the independent clause in Instruction 16 included language in the nature of a command that required the jury to draw the conclusion that concealment was evidence of an intent to convert or defraud, unless the jury was presented with evidence to the contrary, the \"remaining language,\" rather than reinforcing the Commonwealth's burden of proof, indicates that rebuttal evidence was necessary to overcome the stated presumption regarding intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   \"The believable evidence to the contrary\" referenced in Instruction 16, if indeed such evidence could have been presented, logically would have been presented by the defendant.

Thus, I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case to the circuit court for a new trial, if the Commonwealth be so advised.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"*\">\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    Lindsey also challenged the sufficiency of the evidence, but that question is not at issue in this appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"*\">\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    The relevant portion of Code \u00a7 18.2-103 provides:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n    Whoever, without authority, with the intention of converting goods or merchandise to his own or another's use without having paid the full purchase price thereof, or of defrauding the owner of the value of the goods or merchandise, (i) willfully conceals ... the goods or merchandise of any store or other mercantile establishment ... when the value of the goods or merchandise involved in the offense is less than $200, shall be guilty of petit larceny.\n   </blockquote>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
