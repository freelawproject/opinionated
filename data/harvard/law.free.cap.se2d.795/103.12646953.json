Petitioner-appellee Swain County Department of Social Services (\"DSS\") and the guardian\n   <em>\n    ad litem\n   </em>\n   (\"GAL\") concede that the court erred by failing to make findings of fact regarding a potential placement for the two boys with their paternal grandmother, as required by N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7B-903(a)(2)(c) (repealed effective Oct. 1, 2015) and N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7B-903(a1) (effective Oct. 1, 2015).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.C. Sess.

Respondent-mother has a third son I.L. (\"Ivan\") by another father. Ivan is an enrolled member of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians (\"EBCI\"). Elvin and Ervin are eligible for tribal membership but remained unenrolled at the time of these proceedings. Accordingly, the trial court has determined \"[t]hat the Indian Child Welfare Act [ ('ICWA') ] applies in this matter.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201903\">\n    25 U.S.C.S. \u00a7 1903\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4) (2016) (defining \"Indian child\" for purposes of the ICWA as \"any unmarried person who is under age eighteen and is either (a) a member of an Indian tribe or (b) is eligible for membership in an Indian tribe and is the biological child of a member of an Indian tribe\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On 13 June 2014, DSS filed petitions alleging that Elvin, Ervin, and Ivan were neglected juveniles, in that they did not receive proper care, supervision, or discipline and lived in an environment injurious to their\n   welfare.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The petitions described,\n   <em>\n    inter\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    alia\n   </em>\n   , a history of domestic violence and drug use by respondents in the presence of the children, and noted that Ivan's father was incarcerated. Although respondent-mother had agreed to place the children in kinship care with Ivan's paternal cousin (\"Mrs. B.\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and her husband (\"Mr. B.\") on 4 April 2014, DSS alleged that she and respondent-father subsequently failed to cooperate with in-home services offered by the department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The trial court adjudicated the three children to be neglected juveniles on 2 March 2015. In its dispositional order entered 16 July 2015, the court continued the children's kinship placement with Mrs. B. and ordered respondents to submit to drug screens, work on their case plans, and cooperate with DSS in completing the application for Elvin and Ervin to enroll as members of the EBCI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After a hearing on 28 September 2015, the trial court entered a \"Review and Permanency Planning Review Order\" on 12 November 2015, finding that respondent-mother and both fathers had failed to address their substance abuse issues or maintain regular contact with DSS. The court further found that respondent-father was incarcerated for failure to register as a sex offender, and Ivan's father was incarcerated for violating his parole. Citing the success of the kinship placement, the court determined that it was in the best interests of Elvin, Ervin, and Ivan to change their permanent plan from reunification to guardianship with Mr. and Mrs. B. The court relieved DSS of further reunification efforts and appointed Mr. and Mrs. B. as guardians of the three children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Respondent-father filed timely notice of appeal from the order. He now contends that the trial court violated N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7B-903(a1) by awarding guardianship of Elvin and Ervin to non-relatives without properly considering a proposed relative placement with their paternal grandmother. DSS and the guardian\n   <em>\n    ad litem\n   </em>\n   have communicated to this Court their concession to the error assigned by respondent-father.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Section 7B-903 of the Juvenile Code prescribes the dispositional alternatives available to the trial court following an adjudication of juvenile abuse, neglect, or dependency. N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7B-903 (2015). Subsection (a1) of this statute provides,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   In placing a juvenile in out-of-home care under this section, the court shall first consider whether a relative of the juvenile is willing and able to provide proper care and supervision of the juvenile in a safe home. If the court finds that the relative is willing and able to provide proper care and supervision in a safe home, then the court shall order placement of the juvenile with the relative unless the court finds that the placement is contrary to the best interests of the juvenile....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7B-903(a1). This Court has held that the priority accorded to an available relative placement under N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7B-903(a1) applies to all subsequent review and permanency planning hearings, not just the initial dispositional hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re L.L.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8321258\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/172/689/#p700\">\n    172 N.C.App. 689\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 700-03,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12633568\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/616/392/#p399\">\n    616 S.E.2d 392\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 399-401 (2005) (construing earlier version of N.C.

We have further held that the trial court's \"[f]ailure to make specific findings of fact explaining the placement with the relative is not in the juvenile's best interest will result in remand.\"\n   <em>\n    In re A.S.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4176520\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/203/140/#p141\">\n    203 N.C.App. 140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 141-42,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=693%20S.E.2d%20659\">\n    693 S.E.2d 659\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 660 (2010) (citing\n   <em>\n    In re L.L.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8321258\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/172/689/#p700\">\n    172 N.C.App. at 704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12633568\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/616/392/#p399\">\n    616 S.E.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   401 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The parties agree that Mr. and Mrs. B. are non-relatives of Elvin and Ervin.

Finding its contents \"uncontroverted,\" the court adopted the entirety of the GAL report \"by direct reference\" as findings of fact in its written order.\n   <em>\n    Inter alia\n   </em>\n   , the GAL reported having met with the paternal grandmother on 24 July 2015 while she visited with Elvin and Ervin at their great-grandmother's house. The paternal grandmother informed the GAL \"that she would like custody of the two ... boys and felt it would be best for [Ivan] and [Elvin] not to be living together and competing all the time.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mrs. B. testified that Elvin and Ervin's paternal grandmother assists her by babysitting the boys and speaks with Mrs. B. about them \"[a] lot.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The DSS report admitted into evidence at the hearing further states that respondent-father \"stated that he would like his children to go to his\n   mother\" during a meeting with the social worker on 7 August 2015. The social worker confirmed when cross-examined by respondent-father's counsel at the 28 September 2015 hearing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Q.

Stat. \u00a7 7B-600(c) (2015) make the ICPC inapplicable to an award of guardianship to an out-of-state relative in a permanency planning review order).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   James Burch Sanders, ICWA coordinator for the EBCI, testified as an expert in Indian culture and child rearing. Mr. Sanders affirmed that the existing placement with Mr. and Mrs. B. met the requirements of\n   the ICWA and that he believed awarding guardianship to Mr. and Mrs. B. was in the children's best interests. On cross-examination, however, Mr. Sanders acknowledged that he had lacked sufficient information to assess Elvin and Ervin's potential placement with their paternal grandmother.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Elvin and Ervin's paternal grandmother attended the hearing but did not testify. At the conclusion of the hearing, counsel for respondent-father explicitly argued that \"[m]y client's children are entitled to have my client's mother considered for guardianship of [Ervin] and [Elvin].\" After hearing from all parties' counsel, the trial court rebuffed an offer by respondent-father's counsel to present the paternal grandmother as a witness:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   MR.

That the [B.] family provides a safe, stable home for the minor children.

That it is in the best interest of the minor children that the permanent plan be changed to guardianship with [Mr. and Mrs. B.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The order's only reference to Elvin and Ervin's paternal grandmother appears in the following decretal provision: \"the paternal grandmother of [Elvin and Ervin] may continue to be used as a resource for childcare of those minor children.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   We now join the parties in concluding that the trial court's \"[f]ailure to make specific findings of fact explaining [why] the placement with the [paternal grandmother] is not in [Elvin and Ervin's] best interest\" requires this Court to reverse the order as to respondent-father's children and remand for a new hearing.\n   <em>\n    In re A.S.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4176520\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/203/140/#p141\">\n    203 N.C.App. at 141-42, 144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=693%20S.E.2d%20659\">\n    693 S.E.2d at 660, 662\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Indeed, because the court ended a voluntary kinship placement arranged by respondent-mother and DSS and placed the children in guardianship, \"the proceeding qualifies as a 'foster care placement' and thus, a 'child custody proceeding' \" subject to the ICWA.\n   <em>\n    In re E.G.M.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4278577\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/230/196/#p199\">\n    230 N.C.App. 196\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 199,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=750%20S.E.2d%20857\">\n    750 S.E.2d 857\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 860 (2013). Such concerns, however, do not obviate the need for findings of fact under N.C. Gen.
