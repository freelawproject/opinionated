ARTHUR KELSEY\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In the circuit court, two property owners' associations (\"POAs\") sued various owners and developers of parcels in the Hollymead Town Center (\"HTC\"), a shopping center, claiming that HTC's sediment basins discharged sediment into a creek that flowed into a lake owned by the POAs. The POAs sought damages and injunctive relief. Holding that the incursion of sediment had been occurring for more than five years prior to the suit being filed, the circuit court sustained pleas in bar brought by the HTC defendants asserting the five-year statute of limitations.

The subdivision developer originally dug a sediment basin to support the construction effort. The basin accumulated sediment from the residential construction site as well as from Powell Creek, which flowed through the watershed west of Route 29 and underneath it through a culvert to the sediment basin. The developer ultimately turned the sediment basin into a lake, known as Lake Hollymead, and encircled it with residential lots.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 2003, commercial developers started construction of HTC on property situated west of Route 29 in the watershed area that included Powell Creek, the waterway that flowed into Lake Hollymead. The County's planning staff recommended, and the County Board approved, the HTC development plan that authorized the construction of three sediment basins. All three were permanently in place by fall 2004. The sediment basins complied with local and state regulations, which require the sediment basins to retain a maximum of 60% of sediment flowing into them and allow approximately 40% of sediment to discharge into surrounding waterways.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Forest Lakes Community Association, Inc., and Hollymead Citizens Association, Inc., (collectively, the \"POAs\") are property owners' associations that jointly own Lake Hollymead. Shortly after the HTC development began in 2003, the POAs and their members complained that excessive sedimentation was flowing from the denuded areas of the new HTC site, into Powell Creek, through a culvert, and ultimately into Lake Hollymead. The County considered, but ultimately rejected, suggestions for more robust sediment and erosion controls on the HTC site including, for example, water-filtration and purification systems to reduce sediment entering Powell Creek.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In late 2004 and early 2005, members of the POAs discussed the need to take legal action. The POAs, however, waited until 2011 to file their suit seeking damages and injunctive relief against the developers, contractors, and owners of the HTC site (the \"HTC defendants\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the time of filing, eight years had passed from the start of the HTC project, and seven years had passed since the construction of the three HTC sediment basins. The POAs' amended complaint alleged that sediment from the HTC site began to enter Lake Hollymead as soon as the topography of the HTC site was denuded and destabilized in 2003 and 2004. \"After such land clearance, the resultant runoff of sediments and silt entered Powell Creek, and thence flowed into Lake Hollymead.\" J.A. at 59. \"[A]s early as 2005,\" the POAs alleged, \"sediment pollution, including visible soil banks, were already starting to form in Powell Creek and at the headwaters of Lake Hollymead.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 63. \"The runoff and subsequent deposits of silt, sediments and pollution continue to this day, in varying amounts depending upon site conditions, weather and the effectiveness of erosion controls at the site, with each new release of silt and sediments constituting a new and independent trespass to the [POAs'] properties,\" the POAs alleged.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 59. \"Such sediment releases and discharges are continuing.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 60.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The POAs asserted two common-law rights of action, trespass and nuisance. They sought an award of compensatory and punitive damages along with an injunction abating the ongoing sediment incursion into Lake Hollymead. The HTC defendants responded with demurrers and pleas in bar. Each of the pleas in bar asserted that the POAs' trespass and nuisance claims accrued as early as 2003 and no later than 2005 and thus were barred by Code \u00a7 8.01-243(B), which provides that \"[e]very action for injury to property ... shall be brought within five years after the cause of action accrues.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The circuit court conducted an ore tenus hearing on the pleas in bar.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   After hearing evidence for a full day, the court stated that it would take the matter under advisement and issue a ruling after receiving briefs from the parties. Approximately seven months after the hearing, however, counsel learned that the case had been referred to another judge. Shortly thereafter, a recusal order informed counsel that the second judge\n   assigned to the case had recused herself from the case, and a subsequent order reflected that it would be reassigned to yet another judge. A retired judge sitting by designation then presided over \"a new evidentiary hearing\" and required that the exhibits presented at the earlier hearing be \"moved into evidence\" in the new hearing, J.A. at 414,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   which suggested that the court was limiting itself to the record developed at the new hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At the new evidentiary hearing, the parties offered witnesses and exhibits seeking to identify the timing, manner, quantum, and consistency of sediment discharge into Hollymead Lake allegedly caused by the HTC sediment basins. The HTC defendants asserted that the major sediment flow occurred during the construction process from 2003 to 2004. The discharge flow continued, they argued, on a regular basis thereafter. By fall 2004, each of the three sediment basins were permanently in place.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 533-35, 550-51, 554-55. The County engineer responsible for administering the water-protection ordinance testified that \"there's always some silt and sediment that flows through the basin.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 514;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 524.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The County engineer, testifying as an expert on erosion and sediment control and watershed protection on behalf of the HTC defendants, also stated that multiple other sites west of Route 29 (including a mobile home park, an airport construction site, a post office, and a church) were connected to the same watershed and \"continue to contribute to the sediment load\" that ultimately made its way into Lake Hollymead.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 503-04. Even so, the expert opined, all of the discharge \"was in keeping with the County's regulations as well as the Virginia erosion and sediment control regulations,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 499, and in \"full compliance\" with the regulators' expectations of the efficacy of the sediment basins,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 507. These \"sediment basins\" were \"working as they are designed to perform.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 525-26. Under these facts, the HTC defendants contended that the cause of action for property damage first accrued no later than 2004, resulting in an expired statute of limitations in 2009.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The POAs sought to present a slightly different factual scenario with significantly different legal consequences. They acknowledged the early incursion of sediment into Lake Hollymead during the construction time-frame, but they claimed that separate and distinct sediment incursions occurred later, each triggering the accrual of new causes of action that began anew the five-year statute of limitations. This thesis, however, was not supported by any detailed evidentiary showing. The POAs' counsel took the position that it was unnecessary \"to separate out how much silt came from who and when and where\" because that \"has nothing to do with a Plea in Bar on the statute of limitations against these defendants.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 486.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The POAs' expert witness, moreover, appeared to concede the difficulty of measuring distinct, free-standing episodes of sediment flows when asked, \"isn't it true that there is always silt and sediment flowing through the Hollymead Town Center sediment basin, through Powell Creek into Lake Hollymead?\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 703. The expert answered: \"Sure. There's always sediment in every body of water.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He later characterized the continuous sediment flow as \"insignificant,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   but he never testified that there was ever any period of time in which the sediment flow was not continuous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In his motion to strike and closing arguments, the POAs' counsel admitted that \"from the beginning, there's no dispute by anybody that in 2005 and earlier Lake Hollymead received a lot of sediment. It was muddy, discolored. Sediment was coming from HTC. That's all been agreed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 723-24. Various storm events, he nonetheless argued, created an \"intermittent continuous sequence.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 599. Counsel asked rhetorically, \"How much erosion will run off from the bare soil at HTC and actually make it to the basin?\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 727. \"Those are all things we don't know. But what they do attribute to is a highly variable mix of discharges from these basins.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The POAs' counsel added that any \"continuous discharge\" of sediment into Lake Hollymead was not a \"significant contribution\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   to the total amount of sediment deposited in the Lake.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 598.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In the alternative, the POAs' counsel argued that the sediment discharges, even if continuous, constituted a \"continuing trespass,\" and thus, \"the statute of limitations does not run because it's a continuing trespass.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 603-04;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 725, 734. \"So those sediments, whatever amount they are, they are in Lake Hollymead, and they are still there. They came from HTC, at least in part, and until they are removed, it is a continuing trespass.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 605;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 734. No statute of limitations ever runs, counsel contended, until after the HTC defendants dredge their sediment out of Lake Hollymead.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 604, 607.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Sitting as factfinder, the court ruled against the POAs on the first issue, whether discharge was continuous or intermittent. \"I really studied closely and listened carefully to the Plea in Bar on the continuing flow versus intermittent flow,\" the judge stated, \"and I find that the defendants have sustained their burden, and I'm going to sustain the Plea in Bar.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 739. As for the POAs' alternative continuing-trespass argument, the court held as a matter of law: \"I'm going to sustain the Plea in Bar in terms of there's no continuing trespass with no statute of limitations. I do not accept that.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Upon these grounds, the circuit court entered final judgment dismissing the POAs' case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   A. ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On appeal, the POAs frame their disagreement with the circuit court's decision in two very specific ways. The first assignment of error states that the court erred in \"holding that all trespass damages\" from the sediment discharges into Lake Hollymead and \"all claims for further damages\" from later discharges were barred by the five-year statute of limitations. Appellants' Br. at 7. The second assignment of error faults the court for \"refusing to rule\" on the POAs' motion for summary judgment on the grounds that the continuing-trespass theory had not been adopted yet in Virginia and \"thus would not be considered by the trial court.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   We highlight the specific wording of the assignments of error to emphasize the importance they play in our appellate review. An assignment of error is not a mere procedural hurdle an appellant must clear in order to proceed with the merits of an appeal. Assignments of error are the\n   <em>\n    core\n   </em>\n   of the appeal. With the assignment of error, an appellant should \"lay his finger\" on the alleged misjudgment of the court below. Martin P. Burks, Common Law and Statutory Pleading and Practice \u00a7 425, at 827 (T. Munford Boyd ed., 4th ed. 1952). A properly aimed assignment of error must \"point out\" the targeted error and not simply take \"a shot into the flock\" of issues that cluster around the litigation.\n   <em>\n    Plant Lipford, Inc. v. E.W. Gates &amp; Son Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4928274\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/141/325/#p332\">\n    141 Va. 325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 332,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=127%20S.E.%20183\">\n    127 S.E. 183\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 185 (1925) (citations omitted). \"An assignment of errors is in the nature of a pleading, and in the court of last resort it performs the same office as a declaration or complaint in a court of original jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    Puckett v. Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1860991\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/134/574/#p579\">\n    134 Va. 574\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 579,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=113%20S.E.%20853\">\n    113 S.E. 853\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 854 (1922) (citation omitted).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Like a well-crafted pleading, assignments of error set analytical boundaries for the arguments on appeal, provide a contextual backdrop for our ultimate ruling, and demark the stare decisis border between holdings and dicta.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   B. THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS &amp; TRESPASS DAMAGES\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The POAs' first assignment of error asserts that the circuit court erred by applying the five-year statute of limitations in Code \u00a7 8.01-243(B) to bar their claim for trespass damages. The assignment of error makes no mention of the injunctive relief they sought in their amended complaint or the equitable doctrine of laches. We thus limit our analysis to the question of whether Code \u00a7 8.01-243(B) barred the POAs' claim for trespass damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \"Every action for injury to property ... shall be brought within five years after the cause of action accrues.\" Code \u00a7 8.01-243(B). The POAs' trespass claim asserts an injury to property, and thus, the only question is when these claims accrued for purposes of running the five-year limitation period. The general principle, well recognized in Virginia law, deems the accrual of a cause of action for \"injury to property,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=113%20S.E.%20853\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , to take place when the first measurable damage occurs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Code \u00a7 8.01-230 (providing that \"the right of action shall be deemed to accrue and the prescribed limitation period shall begin to run from the date the injury is sustained in the case of ... damage to property\");\n   <em>\n    Southern Ry. v.

Subsequent, compounding or aggravating damage-if attributable to the original instrumentality or human agency-does not restart a new limitation period for each increment of additional damage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Kent Sinclair, Sinclair on Virginia Remedies \u00a7 65-4[C], at 65-21 (5th ed. 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   That conclusion remains true even if the damage is expected to continue beyond the end of any remedial litigation. In such cases, the claimant should forecast and claim a damage award for past, present,\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   future damages.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=56%20S.E.%20216\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (noting that, when the consequent damages \"in the normal course of things will continue indefinitely, there can be but a single action therefor and the entire damage suffered, both past and future, must be recovered in the action\" (emphasis omitted));\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Southern Ry. v.

It is possible for a new cause of action to accrue that looks remarkably like an earlier one but is nonetheless a stand-alone claim in its own right. When this occurs, the damage accompanying the new cause of action sets new accrual starting blocks for a separate limitation period.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   1 James H. Backman et al., A Practical Guide to Disputes Between Adjoining Landowners-Easements \u00a7 9.04[3][a], at 9-64 to -67 (2016) (discussing \"temporary or recurring nuisances\"). In this situation, Code \u00a7 8.01-243(B) relies upon the traditional definition of \"cause of action\" to police the distinction between an existing cause of action with continuing damages and a series of separate causes of action, each with its own set of damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Though easy to restate, these concepts defy any attempts at formulaic applications. Because the underlying issue-determining the boundaries of a cause of action-depends so heavily on the factual context of each case, our jurisprudence has tailored these principles to analogous fact patterns and rights of action.

That conceded fact serves as the baseline for the main question presented at the plea-in-bar hearing: Were later sediment discharges merely a continuation of the same injury or were they so temporary and episodic as to imply the accrual of\n   <em>\n    new causes of action\n   </em>\n   triggering new five-year limitation periods?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Sitting as factfinder, the circuit court received detailed testimony and exhibits on the specific operation of the sediment basins, their physical functions, and their design efficacies. The court also considered whether any of the ongoing sediment discharge could be separated reasonably into discrete episodes. The totality of the evidence convinced the court that the permanent sediment basins discharged into Lake Hollymead on a continuous basis and that the five-year statute of limitations was not revived for any particular discharge episode. Necessarily implicit in the court's findings is its rejection of the POAs' factual claim that this continuous discharge should be treated as factually insignificant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The court had ample grounds to come to the conclusions that it did. All three of the HTC sediment basins were permanently in place by fall 2004. The structural features of the basins automatically controlled their day-to-day operations. No HTC defendant exercised any operational control over the basins or modified them in any way. Nor were any bypass valves turned on or off on specific occasions over the years. The witnesses, including the POAs' own expert, recognized that sediment discharge, at least to some degree, continuously flowed from the basins into Lake Hollymead because of the functional design of the basins.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Absent \"any cause but human labor,\"\n   <em>\n    Virginia Hot Springs Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2029185\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/106/461/#p470\">\n    106 Va. at 464-65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=56%20S.E.%20216\">\n    56 S.E. at 218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted), sediment discharge from the HTC basins will likely continue indefinitely. No evidence persuaded the trial court that the continuity of this sediment flow was punctuated by stand-alone, temporary episodes of\n   discharge that were materially different from the continuous sediment discharges that began as early as 2004.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The POAs' argument to the contrary appears to rest on the assumption that it matters, for accrual purposes, that the continuing nature of the damage might fluctuate or even get worse over time. Under Virginia law, however, the limitation period \"will\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   be extended simply because the damage is much larger in later years than it was when the structures were first erected.\" Sinclair,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 65-4[C], at 65-21 (emphasis in original).

DENIAL OF THE POAS' MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The POAs' second assignment of error asserts that the circuit court erred by \"refusing to rule\" on their motion for summary judgment, which asserted that Virginia courts should adopt the approach of the Restatement (Second) of Torts to their claim concerning the \"continuing nature of damage\" caused by the \"unremoved deposits of silt and sediment.\" Appellants' Br. at 8. If we embrace this approach, the POAs reason, \"the applicable statute of limitations should run continuously until such time as the trespassing materials are physically removed\" from Lake Hollymead, and thus, they should be allowed a \"recovery of damages\" based upon common-law trespass \"for the entire period of trespassing events.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18. Under the POAs' understanding of the Restatement approach, a statute of limitations for a trespass claim seeking damages begins to run only when the continuing trespass ceases. In this case, they conclude, the five-year limitation period in Code \u00a7 8.01-243(B)\"should not begin until such deposits stop.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   We find this argument tangled with several conceptual knots. To begin, the circuit court did not refuse to rule on the POAs' motion for summary judgment. That motion was never scheduled for a hearing, and thus, the court understandably addressed the only issue before it, which was limited to the HTC defendants' pleas in bar. This fact alone ordinarily would be sufficient for us to decline to address the arguments asserted in the motion for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rule 5:25;\n   <em>\n    Scialdone v.

In this case, however, the POAs asserted the underlying argument during the plea-in-bar hearing while simultaneously acknowledging that they understood their motion for summary judgment was not yet before the court for a ruling.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. at 591. We thus address the legal issue only in that context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   So viewed, the POAs' continuing-trespass argument misses the point of the circuit court's ruling. Whether a common-law tort has occurred and, if so, how long it lasts, is\n   not the same thing as when, if ever, a statute of limitations bars the assertion of that tort claim in court. A dismissal based on a statute-of-limitations defense presupposes, at least arguendo, that an otherwise viable cause of action exists. And on this issue, the Restatement merely repeats an incontestable general proposition:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   An unprivileged remaining on land in another's possession is a continuing trespass for the entire time during which the actor wrongfully remains.

Our earlier discussion has already answered that question.
