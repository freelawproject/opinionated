Grennan (\"Husband\") appeals a final equitable distribution judgment and order granting a distributive award of $11,452.63 in favor of Christine M. Grennan (\"Wife\"). Husband contends the trial court erred in classifying and calculating the joint and survivor annuity from his plumber's pension as Wife's separate property, and denying his claim for credits from payments he made from his separate funds for taxes, homeowners dues, and insurance on real property owned by the couple after the date of separation. After careful review, we vacate the trial court's order and remand this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Wife and Husband were married on 8 September 1984 and separated on 22 January 2014. The parties were divorced in a companion case filed in New Hanover County, North Carolina. The parties' two children are emancipated. At the time they separated, the parties jointly owned real estate including a residence located on Mariners Cove in Belville, North Carolina (\"the Mariners Cove Property\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On 1 March 1972, Husband began working as a plumber and received a plumbers union pension as part of his compensation. On 22 February 1994, Husband began drawing a disability retirement pension (the \"Pension\") out of his plumbers union benefits. Husband has remained unemployed ever since. At trial, Husband asserted the Pension was his separate property because it qualified as a disability pension. Husband does not raise this issue on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The trial court found that 43.02% of the Pension was marital property, and that Husband had elected a 50% joint and survivor annuity for Wife when he began drawing disability retirement. The trial court found that at the date of separation, the value of the marital portion of the Pension was $89,704.90 and the value of Wife's survivor benefit from this marital portion was $9,397.48. The trial court classified Wife's survivor benefit as her separate property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The trial court additionally found that Husband used $2,530.00 of his separate earnings to pay homeowners association dues, taxes, and insurance on,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , the Mariners Cove Property following the date of separation. The trial court declined to allocate credit to Husband for these payments. The trial court made no additional findings of fact regarding the payments and made no conclusions determining whether these payments constituted marital, divisible, or separate property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Each party sought an unequal distribution pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2050-20\">\n    N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 50-20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). After reviewing the evidence, the trial court found that an equal distribution of the marital and divisible property was equitable. The trial court found the value of the marital estate to be $273,696.28, Husband's in-kind distribution to be valued at $148,300.77, and Wife's in-kind distribution to be valued at $136,848.14. To achieve an equal distribution of the marital estate, the trial court ordered Husband to pay a distributive award of $11,452.63 to Wife. Husband timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    A.
