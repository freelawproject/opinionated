McCULLOUGH\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The surgeon in this case mistakenly fused the wrong level on Mr. Osborne's spine. Instead of operating on level C5-C6, the surgeon operated on level C6-C7. The issue we\n   must resolve is whether a plaintiff in such a situation can proceed on a theory of battery or whether the law confines a plaintiff to recovery under a negligence theory.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   We conclude that the surgeon's actions did not constitute a battery. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In an effort to relieve back pain, Dr. Matthew T. Mayr performed a posterior cervical foraminotomy and fusion on Michael J. Osborne. The surgery targeted the C5-C6 level of Mr. Osborne's spine. The procedure called for the stabilization of level C5-6 by using bars connected to the spine with screws, as well as the insertion of a bone graft. Dr. Mayr performed the operation, and his operative report shows that he believed that he had operated on the C5-C6 level.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   X-rays taken after the surgery revealed that Dr. Mayr had fused the wrong level. He had fused level C6-C7 instead of C5-C6. Dr. Mayr informed his patient of that fact. Dr. Mayr later performed a corrective surgery, removing the screws and bars at level C6-C7 and performing the surgery at the correct level.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Catherine Osborne, the wife of Michael Osborne and the administrator of his estate,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   filed a complaint alleging Dr. Mayr was negligent and that he committed a battery. She later nonsuited her claim for negligence and proceeded to trial exclusively on her battery claim. Her theory at trial was that the surgery on the wrong level \"went beyond the scope of the consent that he was given\" and, therefore, constituted a battery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At trial, Dr. Mayr testified that when he spoke with Mr. Osborne, he informed him that, among other risks of this surgery, there is a risk that the \"hardware can be misplaced and that that may have to be revised down the road.\" Mrs. Osborne denied that she or her husband had received such information from Dr. Mayr. Dr. Mayr also presented expert testimony that operating at the wrong level is \"a recognized complication\" of this type of surgery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Dr. Mayr twice moved to strike, first at the close of the plaintiff's case, and then again at the close of all the evidence, arguing both times that while the facts revealed possible negligence, they did not establish a battery. He also argued that the plaintiff had failed, as required, to produce an expert to testify concerning the standard of care. At the conclusion of the bench trial, the court indicated it would take the motion to strike under advisement. The court received a memorandum in support of the motion to strike and made it part of the record. After a short recess, the court stated from the bench that it was entering judgment for the plaintiff and later entered a final order to that effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Dr. Mayr argues that to permit a claim for battery in circumstances like this one would impermissibly extend the scope of what constitutes a battery. He notes that he did not intentionally operate on the wrong level of his patient's spine, and contends that our cases recognizing a tort of battery in the medical setting are distinguishable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   For her\n   part, the plaintiff argues that consent was given for surgery at the C5-C6 level, there was no consent for a surgery on the C6-C7 level, and, because the surgery exceeded the scope of consent, it constituted a battery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   I. OUR PRECEDENT HAS NOT ANSWERED THE QUESTION AT ISSUE IN THIS CASE .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The plaintiff argues that this case is controlled by our prior decisions. We disagree.

In the present case, the physician set about performing the exact procedure the patient consented to, on the intended structure of the body (here, the spine), but unintentionally, either by negligence or as an unforeseen complication, performed the procedure in a location on that structure different from the one that was targeted (here, an adjacent level of the spine). Our precedent does not address a situation like this one. We therefore must resolve whether a technical battery extends to this scenario.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   II. BATTERY AND NEGLIGENCE CONSTITUTE DISTINCT THEORIES OF RECOVERY, WITH DISTINCT ELEMENTS OF PROOF .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The tort of battery and the tort of negligence both provide avenues of recovery\n   to compensate persons who have been wronged by the actions of a health care provider. The interests protected by the tort of battery and the tort of negligence, however, are different. Battery protects two personal interests: \"first, the interest in the physical integrity of the body, that it be free from harmful contacts; second, the purely dignitary interest in the body that it be free from offensive contact.\" 1 Fowler V. Harper et al.,\n   <em>\n    Gray on Torts\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 3.2 (3rd ed. 2006). \"The central core of battery is relatively straightforward: the defendant must respect the plaintiff's wishes to avoid intentional bodily contact.\" 13 Peter N. Swisher et al., Virginia Practice: Tort and Personal Injury Law \u00a7 2.7 (2016). A physician may perform an operation with great skill and nevertheless be liable for a battery if the patient did not consent.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Pedesky v.

A battery in the medical\n   context is the unauthorized or unconsented to touching of the person of another. Swisher et al., \u00a7 2.7. To be liable for battery, the defendant health care provider must have done two things. First, the health care provider must have intentionally made physical contact with the patient and, second, that physical contact must have been deliberately against the patient's will or substantially at variance with the consent given. The question of authorization or consent is further broken down into two related issues, consent for the procedure and the related question of informed consent, that is, whether the health care provider disclosed the risks associated with a particular procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   A. The patient consented to the surgery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Mr. Osborne consented to a foraminotomy and fusion on level C5-C6. Dr. Mayr performed a foraminotomy and fusion and intended to perform that operation on level C5-C6. However, Dr. Mayr instead performed the procedure on the adjoining level of Mr. Osborne's spine. The plaintiff argues that there was no consent for the surgery that Dr. Mayr performed, and therefore, the surgery constituted a battery. There are several difficulties with this contention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   First, such an expansive conception of a technical battery would effectively jettison the required showing of intent. Battery is an intentional tort. The justification for holding a physician liable is that the physician has acted in \"conscious disregard of the patient's interest in his physical integrity.\"\n   <em>\n    Woolley v. Henderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7967523\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/418/1123/#p1133\">\n    418 A.2d 1123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1133 (Me. 1980).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Second, the plaintiff's position would have the effect of displacing the ordinary requirement of expert testimony in a broad range of cases. Surgeries and other procedures commonly involve the disturbance of, or even damage to, neighboring tissues. A surgery can yield tragic results or complications even with the utmost care by the surgeon. The requirement of expert testimony to establish the standard of care ensures that the factfinder makes an informed decision concerning whether the physician's actions fell within or violated the standard of care.\n   <em>\n    Beverly Enterprises-Virginia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2089562\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/247/264/#p267\">\n    247 Va. at 267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=441%20S.E.2d%201\">\n    441 S.E.2d at 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
