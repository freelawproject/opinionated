ARTHUR KELSEY\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case involves only one underlying dispute: The Funny Guy, LLC contends that it was not paid for work it did for Lecego, LLC.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   That dispute, however, generated three cascading theories of recovery against Lecego. Funny Guy first claimed that, after the dispute arose, Lecego agreed to pay almost all (about 97%) of the money that it allegedly owed as part of a settlement agreement (the settlement theory). Funny Guy filed suit on that theory and lost because the trial court found that no such settlement ever existed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After that theory proved unsuccessful, Funny Guy filed a second suit claiming that the initial promise to pay constituted a binding contract (the oral-contract theory) and argued alternatively that Lecego should pay anyway even if no binding contract existed (the quantum-meruit theory). The trial court dismissed the second suit because these two\n   alternative theories of recovery could have been, and thus should have been, asserted in the first suit. On appeal, Funny Guy contends that the trial court erred in dismissing this second suit on the basis of res judicata. We disagree and affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2014, Funny Guy sued Lecego and claimed that, from 2012 to 2013, Funny Guy had \"provided certain information technology and related services\" pursuant to a contract with Lecego. J.A. at 312.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   When the parties terminated their agreement, a dispute arose over payment for Funny Guy's services and other issues. Funny Guy alleged that Lecego had agreed to pay approximately 97% of the fees claimed (amounting to $73,290) in an \"attempt to resolve\" the dispute but later refused to do so.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 312-14. Finding there was \"no meeting of the minds as a matter of law\" on the alleged compromise of the payment dispute, the trial court sustained Lecego's demurrer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 406.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Less than a year later, Funny Guy again sued Lecego asserting two alternative theories of recovery, breach of contract and quantum meruit. This second complaint, like the first, alleged that Funny Guy had performed work for Lecego but was never paid for it.\n   <em>\n    Compare id.\n   </em>\n   at 6,\n   <em>\n    with id.\n   </em>\n   at 312, 314. Seeking $75,790,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Funny Guy alleged that Lecego breached its oral agreement to pay for the services and that, even if there were no oral agreement, Lecego should still make the requested payment under quantum-meruit principles. Lecego filed a plea in bar and contended that res judicata precluded Funny Guy's second suit because these alternative theories of recovery could have been, and thus should have been, asserted in the first suit. The trial court agreed and dismissed the second suit with prejudice.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 245, 300-01.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The trial court correctly reasoned that Rule 1:6 prohibited Funny Guy from filing two separate lawsuits when one would have been perfectly sufficient. Drafted to have a pragmatically broad reach, Rule 1:6 revived the historic principles of res judicata and applied them to modern litigation.\n   <em>\n    See infra\n   </em>\n   Part II.B. Both the text and historical context of Rule 1:6 calibrate its scope to Virginia's statutes governing pleading and joinder of claims. Because Funny Guy could have joined all three of its claims in a single suit and no disqualifying principle of res judicata applies, Rule 1:6 prohibited Funny Guy from filing a second suit after losing its first suit on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Funny Guy's argument to the contrary treats this case as two wholly separate disputes: Lecego's initial promise to pay, on one hand, and Lecego's promise to pay what it had earlier promised to pay, on the other. We find this distinction artificial and overly formalistic. This analysis comes uncomfortably close to reconstituting the \"same evidence\" test applied in\n   <em>\n    Davis v.

To accomplish that goal, the Conference recommended that the statute parallel the \"same transaction or occurrence\" formulation in Code \u00a7\u00a7 8.01-272 and 8.01-281 and the second Restatement of Judgments. In accordance with this recommendation, the Rules Advisory Committee of the Judicial Council proposed Rule 1:6, which states, in relevant part,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   A party whose claim for relief arising from identified conduct, a transaction, or an occurrence, is decided on the merits by a final judgment, shall be forever barred from prosecuting any second or subsequent civil action against the same opposing party or parties on any claim or cause of action that arises from that same conduct, transaction or occurrence, whether or not the legal theory or rights asserted in the second or subsequent action were raised in the prior lawsuit, and regardless\n   of the legal elements or the evidence upon which any claims in the prior proceeding depended, or the particular remedies sought.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Rule 1:6(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Court adopted Rule 1:6 in 2006. Under Rule 1:6, it does not matter that the second suit includes alternative legal theories or would require evidence not present in the first suit. Instead, Rule 1:6 parallels the \"same transaction or occurrence\" scope of Code \u00a7\u00a7 8.01-272 and 8.01-281. Thus, if the underlying dispute produces different legal claims that can be joined in a single suit under the joinder statutes, Rule 1:6 provides that they should be joined unless a judicially-recognized exception to res judicata exists.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Applying these principles, the trial court held that the litigation between these parties arose out of a single underlying dispute: Funny Guy wants to be paid for work it did for Lecego. The trial court declined to view this contest-Lecego's initial promise to pay and its later promise to pay what it had earlier promised to pay-as two wholly separate litigable disputes. We agree. The symmetry between Rule 1:6 and the joinder statutes, coupled with the absence of any disqualifying principle of traditional res judicata law, demonstrates the correctness of the trial court's conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Code \u00a7 8.01-272 specifically addresses the joinder of claims in a single lawsuit. Under this statute, a plaintiff may join multiple claims in the same proceeding (including those, like tort and contract claims, which he previously could not join) so long as they \"arise out of the same transaction or occurrence.\" Code \u00a7 8.01-272.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rule 1:4(k) further confirms that a party \"may plead alternative facts and theories of recovery ... provided that such claims ... arise out of the same transaction or occurrence.\" If this condition is satisfied, a party \"may also state as many separate claims or defenses as he has regardless of consistency and whether based on legal or equitable grounds.\" Rule 1.4(k).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Code \u00a7 8.01-281(A) reinforces the broad scope of joinder in Virginia: \"A party ... may plead alternative facts and theories of recovery ... provided that such claims ... arise of out of the same transaction or occurrence.\" Subsection B acknowledges the trial court's discretion to conduct separate evidentiary hearings if doing so is more prudent or efficient.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Code \u00a7 8.01-281(B) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   note 20. The authority to sever recognizes that, particularly with alternative claims, resolving one claim might moot all the others. Equally so, the different evidentiary requirements of each claim that could potentially prejudice a party regarding another claim could provide a sound basis for a trial court to exercise its authority to sever the claims under Code \u00a7 8.01-281(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Code \u00a7\u00a7 8.01-272 and 8.01-281, along with Rule 1:4(k), permit joinder of claims on the precondition that they arise out of the \"same transaction or occurrence\"-the exact phrase used in Rule 1:6(A) to define the scope of res judicata (but for the addition of the word\n   \"conduct\" in Rule 1:6).\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   By their very terms, \"[b]oth enactments are conditioned ... upon the requirement that the claims joined must 'arise out of the same transaction or occurrence.' \"\n   <em>\n    Powers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2092399\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/249/33/#p37\">\n    249 Va. at 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=452%20S.E.2d%20666\">\n    452 S.E.2d at 669\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In other words, absent agreement of the parties, claims can\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   be joined\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   they arise out of the same transaction or occurrence. If claims can truly be joined under Code \u00a7\u00a7 8.01-272 and 8.01-281, then it necessarily follows that the very same claims would be prima facie within the scope of Rule 1:6. That is the symmetry intended when the phrase \"conduct, transaction or occurrence\" was repeated essentially verbatim in Rule 1:6. Rule 1:6 thus \"effectuates Code \u00a7\u00a7 8.01-272 and 8.01-281\" and \"applies the\n   <em>\n    same test\n   </em>\n   in res judicata issues.\" Sinclair &amp; Middleditch,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 14.11[B][5], at 1220 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   We applied the \"transaction or occurrence\" standard in\n   <em>\n    Fox v.

Joinder is permissive, of course, but that statement merely means that a trial court cannot compel a claimant, at his opponent's insistence, to assert an additional claim if he chooses not to, even though the claim arises out of the same transaction or occurrence as the claims he has actually asserted. If the claimant chooses not to assert a joinable claim-which, under Code \u00a7\u00a7 8.01-272 and 8.01-281 and Rule 1:4(k), can only be one arising out of the same transaction or occurrence-it is Rule 1:6, not the permissive-joinder statutes, that attaches the penalty for intentionally segmenting the litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   A trial court has authority to sever joinable claims and order separate evidentiary hearings in the same case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   . That power to sever, however, presupposes the claims are joinable, and the claims are joinable only if they arise out of the same transaction or occurrence. The power to sever under Code \u00a7 8.01-281(B), therefore, does not support the assumption that the phrase \"same transaction or occurrence\" in the joinder statutes and Rule is somehow different from\n   the nearly identical phrase in Rule 1:6.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   As noted earlier, res judicata has historically calibrated the scope of its merger-and-bar effects to the ever-evolving rules governing pleading and joinder of claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sinclair,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 11.2, at 247. \"Determining which claims\n   <em>\n    should\n   </em>\n   have been brought in earlier litigation largely depends on which claims\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   have been brought.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphases in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   For purposes of res judicata, deciding what constitutes a single transaction or occurrence under Rule 1:6 should be a practical analysis. The proper approach asks \"whether the facts are related in time, space, origin, or motivation, whether they form a convenient trial unit, and whether their treatment as a unit conforms to the parties' expectations or business understanding or usage.\" Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 24(2). No \"single factor\" is indispensable or determinative.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 24 cmt. b. The factors should instead be considered \"pragmatically\" with a view toward uncovering the true underlying dispute between the parties.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 24(2). Under this approach, it does not matter that the claimant \"is prepared in the second action (1) [t]o present evidence or grounds or theories of the case not presented in the first action, or (2) [t]o seek remedies or forms of relief not demanded in the first action.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Every one of these pragmatic factors supports the trial court's application of res judicata in this case. The \"origin\" and \"motivation,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 24(2), for the claims are perfectly obvious: Funny Guy wants to get paid for its work. Evaluating the \"time\" and \"space\" factors,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , reveals a single payment dispute-concerning the same money for the same work-that was ongoing and uninterrupted. The three alternative theories of recovery that Funny Guy has asserted throughout this litigation (settlement, oral contract, and quantum meruit) all fit within a single factual narrative that easily forms \"a convenient trial unit.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   And the last factor, the \"parties' expectations or business understanding or usage,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , is the most obvious. Reasonable commercial parties would not expect, much less want, a mere payment dispute to disintegrate into multiple lawsuits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   If there is one\n   payment dispute, reasonable commercial parties would expect there to be one court case to resolve it. Most litigants, we believe, would view all three of Funny Guy's alternative claims as arising out of \"a natural grouping or common nucleus of operative facts,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 24 cmt. b, thus requiring Funny Guy to \"include in an action all separate instruments growing out of the same original transaction then due and held by that plaintiff,\" 18 Wright et al.,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   note 8, \u00a7 4409, at 233.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Other aspects of Funny Guy's reasoning fail to persuade us. Consider the correct observation that the putative settlement agreement (which the trial court held never existed) involved a slightly different amount than the alleged (but never adjudicated) oral-contract claim. The 3% difference between the two ad damnum clauses-$75,790 vs. $73,290-apparently suggests to Funny Guy that there really were two underlying disputes, but this is not so. The difference did not reflect a dispute over how much was owed. Instead, Funny Guy and its principal offered the lesser amount \"as a showing of good faith\" during negotiations over the alleged settlement agreement. J.A. at 368. The only dispute between Funny Guy and Lecego was, and is, Funny Guy wanting to get paid for its work. The trifling difference between these two figures has little relevance to the res judicata analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Nor does it matter, as Funny Guy contends, that the nonexistent settlement agreement included a few provisions arguably unrelated to the specific money Funny Guy claimed it was owed. These provisions merely required the parties to refrain from disparaging one another,\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   required Funny Guy to sign a close-out agreement, and required both parties to release their claims against one another under the oral contract and keep the agreement confidential.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 342-44. Many of these non-monetary provisions, however, arose out of the underlying oral contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 343 (including a requirement to release claims \"under or arising from the said Verbal Agreement,\" a non-disparagement provision pertaining to the parties' \"performance and/or conduct under\n   the Verbal Agreement,\" and a non-disparagement provision requiring Funny Guy to provide proof that it had withdrawn negative comments \"regarding any matter pertaining to work performed on the ... Contract\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   More importantly, none of these non-monetary provisions changed the essential character of the purported settlement agreement. As its provisions confirm:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   IN WITNESS WHEREOF, by signing and fulfilling the requirements of this Settlement Agreement, the Parties agree that this Settlement Agreement is\n   <em>\n    full accord and satisfaction\n   </em>\n   for any and all claims now know[n] or known in the future against any party\n   <em>\n    for the work performed by [Funny Guy] on the Contract\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 345 (emphases added).\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   Upon receipt of the\n   <em>\n    final payment\n   </em>\n   amount of $73,290.00, the undersigned fully releases and agrees that this is a\n   <em>\n    full accord and satisfaction\n   </em>\n   for any and all claims now known or that become[ ] known in the future\n   <em>\n    related to the work performed by [Funny Guy] under the Contract.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 330 (emphases added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 342 (incorporating \"Exhibit 1\" by reference).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Seeking compensation for the \"work performed\" under the prior oral agreement,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 345, Funny Guy had \"billed a total of $374,967.40, of which $299,177.40 [had] been paid.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 342. The reference to \"final payment,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 330, represents the final payment (discounted by $2,500 \"as a showing of good faith,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 368, during negotiations) that Funny Guy claimed it was owed for services performed under the prior oral contract. The claim barred by res judicata-and the only issue before us on appeal-is the claim for money for services already rendered, not some later ancillary dispute over Funny Guy's alleged disparagement of Lecego in the marketplace.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   For these reasons, neither the difference in the ad damnum clauses nor the non-monetary provisions in the alleged settlement agreement reveal two separate transactions or occurrences for purposes of res judicata.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   We acknowledge and respect the views of our dissenting colleagues. We cannot, however, agree with them on several key points.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   To begin, the dissent reads the settlement agreement (which, once again, the circuit court held never legally existed) to bar \"an administrative claim [that Funny Guy] submitted to the Department of Homeland Security ('DHS') contracting officer under the Prompt Payment Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203901\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3901\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -3907 (2012) and other federal law.\"\n   <em>\n    Post\n   </em>\n   at 901 n.1. This DHS claim implicated, the dissent suggests, \"possible consequences\" under \"section 1334 of the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, codified at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20637\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 637\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(13)(C).\"\n   <em>\n    Post\n   </em>\n   at 902 n.1. From there, the dissent concludes that these concerns \"undoubtedly were worth more\" than the $75,790 that Funny Guy claimed it was owed-thus demonstrating the \"difference in consideration\" between the oral contract and the purported settlement agreement.\n   <em>\n    Post\n   </em>\n   at 902 n.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Our problem with the dissent's argument is that Funny Guy, the appellant, has never once asserted it. We find no mention of the DHS administrative claim, the Prompt Payment Act, or the Small Business Jobs Act in any of Funny Guy's motions, briefs, or oral argument in the circuit court. Nor did the court address this contention, much less rule upon it. On appeal, Funny Guy filed a petition for appeal and two briefs on the merits, and participated in oral argument before us. Even so, not once did Funny Guy make the specific argument that the dissent finds so persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   We respectfully decline to address the merits or demerits of the dissent's assertion. We limit our analysis and holding to the arguments asserted by Funny Guy on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Nolte v. MT Tech. Enters., LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=284%20Va.%2080\">\n    284 Va. 80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 94 n.3,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=726%20S.E.2d%20339\">\n    726 S.E.2d 339\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 347 n.3 (2012). Absent a showing of extraordinary circumstances, we will only overturn a decision of a circuit court based on arguments the appellant asserted in the lower court and reasserted on appeal,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Rule 5:25;\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Nolte\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=284%20Va.%2080\">\n    284 Va. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   94 n.3,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=726%20S.E.2d%20339\">\n    726 S.E.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   347 n.3, neither of which occurred here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   We must also disclaim the dissent's characterization of our holding. \"The majority holds,\" the dissent states, \"that\n   <em>\n    because\n   </em>\n   both causes of action had\n   <em>\n    accrued before\n   </em>\n   Funny Guy filed its October 2014 complaint, they could both have been brought together and,\n   <em>\n    therefore\n   </em>\n   , they should have been.\"\n   <em>\n    Post\n   </em>\n   at 902 n.2 (emphases added). It would be a mistake for our holding to be pressed into such a reductionist formula. True, res judicata does not bar a claim that does not accrue prior to the litigation triggering the bar.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   note 19. But that statement does not mean, of course, that all unrelated claims of whatever nature accruing beforehand must be joined or be forever barred.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Part II.C.2 (applying the several factors of the second Restatement's transactional approach). Prior accrual is a necessary, but not an independently sufficient, condition for the application of res judicata merger-and-bar principles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Finally, as for the consequences of our holding, the dissent declares: \"\n   <em>\n    Every time\n   </em>\n   parties settle and\n   <em>\n    one of them breaches\n   </em>\n   the settlement agreement, the other party will have to prepare not only to litigate that breach but also the underlying claim, with all of its evidentiary burdens and litigation expenses.\"\n   <em>\n    Post\n   </em>\n   at 903 (emphases added). For two reasons, we believe that this prediction overstates the effect of Rule 1:6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   First, Funny Guy asserted three cascading, alternative theories of recovery, the purported settlement claim being just one of them. All of them sought to recover the same money-unpaid compensation that Lecego twice allegedly promised to pay to Funny Guy. Our holding, as our reasoning underscores, focuses on this unique factual context. Not every settlement of every conceivable underlying claim (such as common-law tort claims, statutory rights of action, or constitutional claims) will involve such direct commonality. We are addressing only the case before us. Though said many times, it bears repeating that \"all statements of law are to be read in connection with the facts of the case to which they are to be applied.\"\n   <em>\n    Ellerson Floral Co. v. Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Ry.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2416194\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/149/809/#p812\">\n    149 Va. 809\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 812,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=141%20S.E.%20834\">\n    141 S.E. 834\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 835 (1928).\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   We thus eschew the dissent's projection of our holding to all possible settlements involving every imaginable set of underlying claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Second, even in cases where (as here) the underlying contract and settlement claims share the requisite commonality, the only time a party suing on the settlement agreement would need to assert the underlying contract claim as an alternative theory is where (as here) the defendant disputes the very existence of the settlement agreement. If the parties accept the settlement agreement as a legally enforceable meeting of the minds, but merely dicker among themselves over whether it was breached, there would be no reason to assert an alternative claim that presupposed the settlement agreement did not legally exist because neither party would be making that assertion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   In sum, Rule 1:6 was meant to echo and implement the joinder principles of Code \u00a7\u00a7 8.01-272 and 8.01-281, and their companion, Rule 1:4(k). If alternative claims qualify for joinder under the \"same transaction or occurrence\" standard in these joinder statutes and this Rule, they likewise constitute res judicata under the same standard in Rule 1:6 unless a disqualifying principle of res judicata applies. This symmetry secures res judicata to its historic moorings and prohibits litigants from gaming the litigation system with multiple lawsuits involving the same underlying dispute. Because the trial court correctly applied Rule 1:6, we affirm.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <em>\n    Affirmed.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   JUSTICE MIMS, with whom JUSTICE GOODWYN and JUSTICE McCULLOUGH join, dissenting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The majority holds that Funny Guy's claims for breach of the putative settlement agreement and breach of the oral agreement for services arose from the same conduct, transaction, or occurrence for the purposes of Rule 1:6. My disagreement with the majority can be reduced to one issue: the majority's position is that there is only one dispute here, involving Funny Guy's expectation to be paid for the work that it did under the oral agreement, so it can arise from only one conduct, transaction, or occurrence. I agree with Funny Guy that it has alleged two wholly separate, though sequential, disputes, and they arise from different conduct, transactions, or occurrences. I therefore respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Res judicata under Rule 1:6(a) means that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   [a] party whose claim for relief arising from identified conduct, a transaction, or an occurrence, is decided on the merits by a final judgment, shall be forever barred from prosecuting any second or subsequent civil action against the same opposing party or parties on any claim or cause of action that arises from that same conduct, transaction or occurrence, whether or not the legal theory or rights asserted in the second or subsequent action were raised in the prior lawsuit, and regardless of the legal elements or the evidence upon which any claims in the prior proceeding depended, or the particular remedies sought.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   As we recently noted in\n   <em>\n    Lee v. Spoden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12643694\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/776/798/#p245\">\n    290 Va. 235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 246-48,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12643694\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/776/798/#p245\">\n    776 S.E.2d 798\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 804-05 (2015), there are three issues to resolve when deciding whether res judicata applies: (1) whether there has been a final judgment on the merits, (2) whether the parties are the same, and (3) whether the later lawsuit arises from the same conduct, transaction, or occurrence as the earlier lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The first two prongs are clearly satisfied in this case. First, Funny Guy's suit under the settlement agreement was dismissed with prejudice on demurrer. Such a ruling is a judgment on the merits.\n   <em>\n    Griffin v. Griffin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1971121\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/183/443/#p449\">\n    183 Va. 443\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 449-50,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=32%20S.E.2d%20700\">\n    32 S.E.2d 700\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 702-03 (1945). Second, all the parties in this case are identical to those named in Funny Guy's complaint under the settlement agreement. Accordingly, only the third prong is at issue here: whether Funny Guy's suit in this action on the oral agreement arises from the same conduct, transaction, or occurrence as its suit in the action on the settlement agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The settlement agreement is not part of the same transaction as the oral agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Montagna v. Holiday Inns, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2138762\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/221/336/#p346\">\n    221 Va. 336\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 346,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=269%20S.E.2d%20838\">\n    269 S.E.2d 838\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 844 (1980) (noting that \"[t]he essential elements of a valid contract must exist to support a binding compromise settlement,\" because it is a new agreement, separate and apart from the settled underlying claim). In fact, as the majority notes, the circuit court found the settlement agreement did not exist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The parties negotiated for a settlement agreement only after the defendants allegedly breached the oral agreement. Without the defendants' alleged breach of the oral agreement, the settlement agreement would never have been contemplated, and the parties would not have negotiated for it. Further, the consideration for the two agreements is different. The consideration for the defendants from the oral agreement was the work Funny Guy promised to perform; the consideration for the defendants from the settlement agreement was Funny Guy's release of its claim that they breached the oral agreement, its promise not to disparage them, and its withdrawal of the critical correspondence sent to third parties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Similarly, the two actions do not arise out of the same occurrence. Funny Guy's cause of action for breach of the oral agreement accrued immediately upon the defendants' alleged breach of that agreement; its cause of action for breach of the settlement agreement did not accrue until both (a) the parties allegedly negotiated the settlement agreement and (b) the defendants allegedly breached it. The first occurrence (i.e., the defendants' alleged breach of the oral agreement) is not the same as the second occurrence (i.e., their alleged breach of the settlement agreement).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Likewise, the two actions do not arise out of the same conduct. The conduct giving rise to the breach of the oral agreement was the defendants' alleged failure to pay Funny Guy $75,790 after Funny Guy performed the work allegedly bargained for in the oral agreement. The conduct giving rise to the breach of the settlement agreement was their alleged failure to pay Funny Guy $73,290 after Funny Guy released its claims under the oral agreement, withdrew its critical correspondence to third parties, and agreed not to disparage the defendants. The acts by the defendants constituting the conduct were different, and they were committed at different times. Further, the acts the defendants induced Funny Guy to perform through their alleged promises to pay were different as well. Because the two alleged promises did not arise from the same conduct, transaction, or occurrence, res judicata is not applicable in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   While the majority emphasizes, and I agree, that whether claims arise from the same conduct, transaction, or occurrence should be determined pragmatically, I believe this analysis conforms to that description. According to the Restatement of Judgments (Second) \u00a7 24, this \"pragmatic\" determination considers \"whether the facts are related in time, space, origin, or motivation, whether they form a convenient trial unit, and whether their treatment as a unit conforms to the parties' expectations or\n   business understanding or usage.\" As noted above, the facts giving rise to the settlement agreement did not occur at the same time as those giving rise to the oral agreement. To the contrary, the settlement agreement necessarily arose from facts arising subsequent to the oral agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Nor were the parties' motivations the same. The defendants' motivations when entering into the oral agreement were to procure from Funny Guy the work that contract induced it to perform for them. Their motivation when they proposed the settlement agreement was not to procure work, but to induce Funny Guy to relinquish its claim for payment under that contract, as well as to induce it to withdraw its critical correspondence to third parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Nor do the two claims form a convenient trial unit. The evidence that a settlement agreement exists is necessary to prevail on a claim that it was breached, while such evidence is simultaneously inadmissible in a proceeding to recover under the underlying, purportedly-settled claim. Va. R. Evid. 2:408(a). The majority contends that this conflict in the evidentiary burden for the one claim and the evidentiary exclusion for the other can be resolved with separate evidentiary hearings, or limiting jury instructions. But these arrangements are hardly reflective of a \"convenient trial unit\" when they amount to two trials of the separate claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Nor am I persuaded that treating a settlement agreement as a single unit with the underlying claim purportedly settled by that agreement conforms to the expectation of parties who enter into a settlement agreement. To the contrary, parties who believe that they have executed a valid settlement agreement are likely to believe that they have released the underlying claim, so that the only action they can bring is for breach of the settlement agreement. When the plaintiff to the underlying claim bargains for a written settlement agreement, he or she is exchanging a claim based on, for example, an oral contract or a claim of negligence. One of the benefits he or she receives is that he or she no longer has to prove the defendant's culpability for that underlying claim-i.e., the existence or terms of the oral contract, or the duty or standard of care breached to cause negligence. Rather, he or she must only prove the terms of the written settlement agreement and that the other party breached them, resulting in damages. Conversely, the defendant to the underlying claim exchanges all defenses to that claim in exchange for, presumably, a reduced quantum of damages. One of the benefits he or she receives is a reduction in maximum liability. And what\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   parties receive is a reciprocal benefit of avoiding the costs of litigating the underlying claim, and the risk that a jury might decide it adversely to him or her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The majority's holding in this case deprives parties who agree to settle of all those benefits of their bargain. Every time parties settle and one of them breaches the settlement agreement, the other party will have to prepare not only to litigate that breach but also the underlying claim, with all of its evidentiary burdens and litigation expenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The majority also opines that the best understanding of whether claims arise from the same conduct, transaction, or occurrence can be gleaned from\n   <em>\n    Fox v. Deese\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2098052\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/234/412/#p422\">\n    234 Va. 412\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 422-23,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=362%20S.E.2d%20699\">\n    362 S.E.2d 699\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 705 (1987). However, as the Court's opinion in that case succinctly states, all of the claims there arose from a series of events with a single purpose: the plaintiff's efforts to promote a concert at the Richmond City Stadium on July 4-5, 1980.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 416,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=362%20S.E.2d%20699\">\n    362 S.E.2d at 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The claims in Funny Guy's October 2014 and June 2015 complaints do not arise from a series of events with the same purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Funny Guy's June 2015 complaint pled a cause of action that accrued in 2013, after the defendants allegedly stopped paying it. This complaint alleged that the defendants broke a promise to pay Funny Guy for the work it performed. Funny Guy's October 2014 complaint pled a cause of action that accrued in 2014, after the defendants allegedly breached\n   the settlement agreement that Funny Guy (incorrectly) believed had been executed. This complaint alleged that the defendants broke a promise to pay Funny Guy for abandoning its 2013 cause of action and withdrawing its critical correspondence to third parties, including its administrative claim to DHS-which might damage the defendants' prospects for future government contracts. I see these as two alleged broken promises, made at different times, under different circumstances, and to achieve different ends. They did not arise from the same conduct, transaction, or occurrence. The majority sees only one, principally by trivializing the benefits the defendants received from the second.

We thus express no opinion on it.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-130\">\n    Although the majority describes these provisions of the settlement agreement as \"ancillary,\" they required Funny Guy to withdraw an administrative claim it submitted to the Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") contracting officer under the Prompt Payment Act,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203901\">\n     31 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3901\n    </extracted-citation>\n    -3907 (2012) and other federal law. In this administrative claim, Funny Guy asserted that Lecego and Vision-IT's prime contractor (which Funny Guy did not name as a party in either the October 2014 or June 2015 complaints) was liable for the defendants' failure to pay. The settlement agreement therefore required Funny Guy to abandon this federal law claim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-131\">\n    While this may seem to some as simply another attempt by Funny Guy to recover the $75,790 allegedly unpaid under the oral contract, the value to the defendants of Funny Guy's agreement to withdraw this administrative claim was undoubtedly worth more. Under section 1334 of the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, codified at\n    <extracted-citation index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20637\">\n     15 U.S.C. \u00a7 637\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (d)(13)(C) (2012), contracting officers are required to consider a prime contractor's failure to ensure timely payment to subcontractors when evaluating the performance of the prime contractor. Thus, whether Funny Guy's claim was valid or not, two possible consequences flowed from it, and the defendants would have been right to worry about either of them. First, the claim may have led DHS to exclude the prime contractor from further contracts. Second, regardless of DHS's action, the prime contractor's embarrassment from Funny Guy's claim to DHS, or concerns about the defendants' competence raised by Funny Guy's allegations, may have led it to exclude them from further subcontracts. In either event, Funny Guy's administrative claim threatened the defendants' access to future government contract opportunities, which undoubtedly were worth more than $75,790 to them.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-132\">\n    The difference in consideration between the oral agreement and the settlement agreement therefore is clear. So too is the additional injury Funny Guy suffered as a result of the defendants' alleged failure to perform under the settlement agreement after it had already complied with those terms.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-133\">\n    The majority says that Funny Guy never raised this argument so we should not consider it. But Funny Guy\n    <em>\n     has\n    </em>\n    raised the argument. Its opening brief is replete with statements asserting, for example, that \"[t]he ruling in Lawsuit I does not preclude Lawsuit II because Lawsuit I and Lawsuit II involve separate and distinct transactions in the form of separate and distinct\n    <em>\n     contracts\n    </em>\n    .\" (Emphasis in original.) The majority wants to require Funny Guy not only to say\n    <em>\n     that\n    </em>\n    the contracts are different, but specifically enumerate\n    <em>\n     how\n    </em>\n    they are different. But the differences between the contracts are manifestly apparent from the evidence in the record. And of course Funny Guy does not cite the Prompt Payment Act or Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 in its brief: it does not seek a state court adjudication on the merits of those federal law claims, which it withdrew while allegedly relying on the defendants' representations. Yet the requirement that Funny Guy withdraw those claims is one of the manifest differences between the two contracts.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-134\">\n    The majority holds that because both causes of action had accrued before Funny Guy filed its October 2014 complaint, they could both have been brought together and, therefore, they should have been. However, Rule 1:6 does not require two claims to be brought together if an action is filed after two separate occurrences from which they arise have occurred; rather, the Rule requires two claims to be brought together only if they arise from a single occurrence.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-135\">\n    The majority protests that this unfairly characterizes its holding but the difference of opinion is the consequence of our differing views over whether Funny Guy's claims in this appeal arise from the same conduct, transaction, or occurrence.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-136\">\n    The majority opines that its holding will not affect all settlement agreements, only those where the defendant alleges that there was no settlement agreement. Even if true, the plaintiff bringing an action for breach of a settlement agreement will not know when he or she files the complaint whether the defendant will raise that defense in his or her responsive pleadings.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
