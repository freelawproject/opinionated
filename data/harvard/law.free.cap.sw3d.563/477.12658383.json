Jarreau moved to quash the indictment alleging, among other things, that it failed to allege which of the two statutory definitions of \"dangerous drug\" the State intended to rely on, i.e., \"device\" or \"drug.\" The trial court granted the motion to quash on that ground as well as three others. On original submission to this court, we held the trial court did not err in granting the motion to quash because the State was required to specify which definition of \"dangerous drug\" it intended to rely upon at trial.\n   <em>\n    State v.

We held that because the indictment \"did not 'elect[ ] among the alternate statutory manner or means' of committing the offense of deliver or offer to deliver a dangerous drug - by device or by drug that is unsafe for\n   self-medication\" - it failed to provide sufficient notice to inform Jarreau of the specific acts for which he was charged.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12373296\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/512/352/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at *6-*7. The State filed a petition for discretionary review. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals granted the State's petition and reversed our judgment, holding \"[t]he nature of 25B-NBOMe as a device or drug is not a manner or means of delivery of a dangerous drug and does not describe, concern, involve or go to the act of delivery; thus, the charging instrument did not have to specify 'device' or 'drug.' \"\n   <em>\n    Jarreau\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12373296\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/512/352/\">\n    512 S.W.3d at 356\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

On remand, we reverse the trial court's order granting the motion to quash and remand this matter to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with our opinion. In addition, we grant the State's motion to dismiss Jarreau's cross-appeal and order the cross-appeal dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The State indicted Jarreau for delivery or offer of delivery of a dangerous drug. The indictment alleged Jarreau \"did then and there intentionally or knowingly deliver or offer to deliver to [M.J.] a dangerous drug, specifically 25B-NBOMe.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Jarreau filed two motions to quash the indictment. In thE first motion, he alleged the indictment fails to provide adequate notice or define the term \"dangerous drug.\" Approximately a month later, Jarreau filed a second motion to quash. In his second motion, which is the motion ruled upon by the trial court, Jarreau complained the indictment is defective because it: (1) fails to allege why 25B-NBOMe is a dangerous drug under section 483.001(a) of the Texas Health and Safety Code (\"the Code\"); (2) fails to state an offense because 25B-NBOMe did not bear and was not required to bear the legends required by subsections (A) and (B) of section 483.001(2) of the Code; (3) fails to allege which of the various statutory definitions of \"dangerous drug\" under section 483.001(2) of the Code - drug or device - the State intends to rely on in its prosecution, thereby failing to provide adequate notice; (4) fails to allege which of the various statutory definitions of \"dangerous drug\" under section 481.002(16) of the Code the State intends to rely on in its prosecution, thereby failing to provide adequate notice; (5) alleges a delivery or offer to deliver, but does not state whether the delivery in question was by actual or constructive transfer; (6) alleges Jarreau delivered or offered to deliver a dangerous drug, but does not allege the manner and means of the purported delivery or offer to deliver; (7) the statute underlying the indictment - section 483.042(a) of the Code, which makes delivery or an offer of delivery of a dangerous drug a criminal offense - is unconstitutionally vague, facially and as applied; and (8) alleges Jarreau delivered or offered to deliver a dangerous drug, but does not allege he knew the thing delivered was a dangerous drug or any kind of contraband.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After a hearing, the trial court took the matter under advisement. A subsequent hearing was scheduled. On the day of the hearing, but before the trial court ruled on the motion to quash, the State filed a motion to amend the indictment, seeking to include more specificity regarding the manner and means of delivery. At the hearing, the trial court verbally denied the\n   State's motion to amend and thereafter, granted Jarreau's second motion to quash. At the State's request, the trial court stated on the record it was granting Jarreau's motion because the indictment failed to allege:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   \u2022 why 25B-NBOMe is a dangerous drug under section 483.001(a) of the Code;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \u2022 which of the various statutory definitions of \"dangerous drug\" the State intended to rely on;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \u2022 whether the delivery in question was by actual or constructive transfer; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \u2022 the manner and means of the purported delivery or offer to deliver.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Thereafter, the trial court signed the order granting Jarreau's motion to quash. The State filed a notice of appeal. After the State filed its notice of appeal, Jarreau filed a cross-notice of appeal, seeking to affirm the trial court's order on the grounds the trial court denied, expressly or by implication. In response, the State filed a motion to strike Jarreau's cross-appellant's brief and the points therein - which we interpreted as a motion to dismiss for want of jurisdiction. Jarreau filed a response. After reviewing the motion and the response, we ordered the motion and response carried with the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As set out above, we held the trial court did not err in granting the motion to quash because the State was required to specify which definition of \"dangerous drug\" it intended to rely upon at trial, thereby failing to provide Jarreau with sufficient notice of the specific acts with which he was charged.\n   <em>\n    Jarreau\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%203440481\">\n    2016 WL 3440481\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4-*7. Based on our decision, we denied as moot the State's motion to dismiss Jarreau's cross-appeal. However, the court of criminal appeals reversed our judgment, holding that because the type of drug involved is not a manner or means of delivery of a dangerous drug and does not describe, concern, involve, or go to the act of delivery, the State is not required to specify the specific type of drug involved.\n   <em>\n    Jarreau\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12373296\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/512/352/\">\n    512 S.W.3d at 356\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court remanded the matter back to this court.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12373296\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/512/352/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12373296\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/512/352/\">\n    at 356-57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On remand, we permitted the parties to file supplemental briefs. In addition to filing a supplemental brief, the State also filed a motion reurging its prior motion to dismiss for want of jurisdiction. We once again ordered the motion taken with the case. Based on the court of criminal appeals' decision, we now address: (1) the State's contention that the trial court erred in granting the motion to quash - specifically, the remaining grounds upon which the trial court based its decision to quash; (2) the State's issue challenging the denial of its motion to amend; and (3) the State's motion to dismiss Jarreau's cross-appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   As noted above, the State contends the trial court erred in granting Jarreau's motion to quash and denying its motion to amend. We begin with the propriety of the trial court's order granting the motion to quash, specifically with regard to the three remaining grounds upon which the trial court based its decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Motion to Quash\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As noted above, the trial court granted the motion to quash because the indictment failed to state: (1) why 25B-NBOMe is a dangerous drug under section 483.001(a) of the Code; (2) which of the various statutory definitions of \"dangerous drug\" the State intended to rely on; (3) whether the delivery in question was by actual or constructive transfer; and (4) the manner and means of the purported delivery\n   or offer to deliver. The second basis relied upon by the trial court, and upon which we based our prior opinion, is no longer viable given the decision of the court of criminal appeals.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12373296\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/512/352/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12373296\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/512/352/\">\n    at 356\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In his motion to quash, Jarreau asserted the indictment is defective because it alleged a delivery or offer to deliver, but failed to inform him whether the delivery in question was by actual or constructive transfer. In support of his contention, Jarreau relied upon\n   <em>\n    Ferguson v.

In other words, because the statutory definition of delivery provided for more than one manner or means to commit the act, then upon timely request, the State had to allege the particular manner or means it intended to establish - actual transfer, constructive transfer, or an offer to sell.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9985604\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/622/846/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Based on\n   <em>\n    Ferguson\n   </em>\n   , Jarreau argued the State was required to allege whether the delivery or offer to deliver was by actual or constructive transfer. Although we agree with the reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Ferguson\n   </em>\n   - particularly in light of the court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Jarreau\n   </em>\n   , we hold Ferguson\n   is distinguishable as it relies upon a definition of delivery not applicable here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The definition of delivery applicable in this case is not the one found in section 481.002(8), and relied upon by the\n   <em>\n    Ferguson\n   </em>\n   court, which defines delivery as an actual or constructive transfer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. HEALTH &amp; SAFETY CODE ANN. \u00a7 481.002(8). The definition of delivery in section 481.002(8) is applicable to offenses under the Texas Controlled Substances Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9985604\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/622/846/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 481.001-354. Jarreau was not charged under the Texas Controlled Substances Act; rather, he was charged with delivery or offer to deliver a dangerous drug under the Texas Dangerous Drug Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9985604\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/622/846/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 483.001-.107. The Texas Dangerous Drug Act defines delivery as selling, dispensing, giving away, or supplying a dangerous drug.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9985604\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/622/846/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 483.001(3) ). The definition of delivery relevant to the offense for which Jarreau was indicted does not include the terms \"actual transfer\" or \"constructive transfer.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9985604\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/622/846/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9985604\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/622/846/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 483.042(a). Accordingly, we hold that because the definition of delivery applicable in this case does not include an actual or constructive transfer, the State was not required to allege whether the delivery it intended to prove was by actual or constructive transfer. We therefore hold the trial court erred in granting the motion to quash based on the indictment's failure to allege whether the delivery was by actual or constructive transfer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <em>\n    b. Manner and Means of Delivery or Offer to Deliver\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The trial court also granted the motion to quash because the indictment failed to allege the manner and means of the delivery or offer to deliver. The State seemingly concedes that because the term \"deliver\" provides alternate manner or means of committing the delivery, it was required to amend the indictment to allege the manner and means of delivery upon which it would rely upon a proper motion to quash. Moreover, in\n   <em>\n    Jarreau\n   </em>\n   , the court of criminal appeals specifically noted, with regard to the second part of its\n   <em>\n    Barbernell\n   </em>\n   analysis, the term \"deliver\" has four statutory definitions: \"sell, dispense, give away, or supply.\"\n   <em>\n    Jarreau\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12373296\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/512/352/\">\n    512 S.W.3d at 355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting TEX. HEALTH &amp; SAFETY CODE ANN. \u00a7 483.001(3) ). Thus, the court held \"the State was required to specify which of the statutorily-defined methods of delivery it would seek to prove.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12373296\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/512/352/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Therefore, based on the court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Jarreau\n   </em>\n   , we hold the trial court did not err in granting Jarreau's motion to quash on the ground that the State failed to sufficiently allege the element of delivery.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12373296\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/512/352/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, the State filed a motion to amend the indictment and its proposed amendment sought to cure this deficiency. The trial court denied the motion to amend, and the State contends this was error.

The State argues it was entitled to amend the indictment because the proposed amendment charged neither a different nor an additional offense, nor did the proposed amendment prejudice Jarreau's substantial rights. Jarreau contends the State has no right to appellate review of this issue because it is not authorized by statute.

On review, the court of criminal appeals held the State was not required to file its own notice of appeal because when the defendant filed a notice of appeal, the court of appeals' jurisdiction was properly invoked, imbuing the court with a broad scope of review, limited only by its own discretion or a restrictive statute.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7316472\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/363/594/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7316472\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/363/594/\">\n    at 599\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Jarreau relies on this broad language regarding the invocation of jurisdiction and scope of review to argue that by filing his own notice of appeal, this court has jurisdiction to review the complaints raised in his cross-appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   However, it is clear from the court's analysis in\n   <em>\n    Pfeiffer\n   </em>\n   , that it was making a distinction between invoking appellate jurisdiction by the filing of a notice of appeal, and a statutory conferral of jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7316472\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/363/594/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7316472\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/363/594/\">\n    at 599-604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court's analysis focused on the fact that the State had been granted a statutory right of appeal pursuant to article 44.01(c), which permits the State to appeal a ruling on a question of law if the defendant has been convicted and appeals the judgment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7316472\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/363/594/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN. art. 44.01(c) ; TEX. R. APP. P. 25.2 ). The court reasoned that because the State had a statutory right to appeal under the circumstances presented in\n   <em>\n    Pfeiffer\n   </em>\n   , and the defendant filed a notice of appeal invoking the appellate court's jurisdiction, the State was not required to file its own notice of appeal to raise a cross complaint authorized by statute.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7316472\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/363/594/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   In this case, unlike\n   <em>\n    Pfeiffer\n   </em>\n   , there is no statutory provision that confers jurisdiction on this court with regard to Jarreau's cross-appeal. Thus, although the State\n   <em>\n    invoked\n   </em>\n   our jurisdiction when it filed its notice of appeal, this did not\n   <em>\n    confer\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction on this court with regard to Jarreau's cross-appeal. We find the court's more recent decision in\n   <em>\n    Ragston\n   </em>\n   instructive. In\n   <em>\n    Ragston\n   </em>\n   , the defendant filed a notice of appeal from a trial court's interlocutory, pretrial order denying his request for a bond reduction.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6951717\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/424/49/#p52\">\n    424 S.W.3d at 50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

On petition for discretionary review, the court of criminal appeals affirmed the dismissal.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6951717\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/424/49/#p52\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6951717\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/424/49/#p52\">\n    at 52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Thus, because there was no constitutional or statutory authority granting appellate jurisdiction to hear interlocutory appeals regarding the denial of bail or excessive bail, the court of appeals lacked jurisdiction over the appeal.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6951717\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/424/49/#p52\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   In this case, Jarreau has not cited, nor have we found, any statutory or constitutional authority that would confer on this court jurisdiction over his cross-appeal and\n   the points raised therein.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6951717\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/424/49/#p52\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Article 44.02 permits a defendant to appeal from a final conviction, and Rule 25.2 does not confer jurisdiction on this court.\n   <em>\n    Rabbani\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6785167\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/494/778/#p780\">\n    494 S.W.3d at 780\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

But, the trial court did not err in granting the motion to quash on the ground that the State failed to provide sufficient notice of the manner and means of delivery or offer to deliver. However, with regard to manner and means, we further hold the trial court erred in denying the State's motion to amend the indictment to provide sufficient notice of the manner and means of delivery or offer to deliver. Accordingly, we reverse this matter and remand to the trial court for further proceedings with regard to the indictment.
