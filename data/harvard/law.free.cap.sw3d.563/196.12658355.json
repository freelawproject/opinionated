Such a conclusion is not unreasonable, given the lack of clarity within the statute that could cause the subsections in question to be read as contradictory to each other. Indeed, the Tennessee Attorney General opined as much in a 1997 opinion when responding to a question about how to calculate the term of confinement for a defendant convicted of a first-degree murder committed on or after July 1, 1995.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tenn. Att'y Gen. Op. 97-098,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1997%20WL%20449672\">\n    1997 WL 449672\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (July 1, 1997). While the Attorney General correctly opined that a defendant sentenced to life imprisonment for a first-degree murder committed on or after July 1, 1995, is eligible for release, at the earliest, after service of fifty-one years, the Attorney General incorrectly concluded that a conflict exists between sections (h) and (i). Further, to the extent our opinion in\n   <em>\n    Vaughn v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8461409\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/202/106/\">\n    202 S.W.3d 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Tenn. 2006), endorsed the Attorney General's opinion that a conflict exists between these two provisions, that part of the opinion is abrogated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Tennessee does not have indeterminate sentences for criminal offenses. Tennessee Code Annotated section 40-35-211 requires the imposition of a determinate sentence in all felony and misdemeanor cases.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   Specific sentences for a felony shall be for a term of years or months or life, if the defendant is sentenced to the department of correction ... There are no indeterminate sentences. Sentences for all felonies and misdemeanors are determinate in nature, and the defendant is responsible for the entire sentence undiminished by sentence credits of any sort, except for credits authorized by ... \u00a7 41-21-236.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2040-35-211\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-35-211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1). The determinate sentence for a life sentence is sixty years, as set forth in Tennessee Code Annotated section 40-35-501(h)(1). For a defendant convicted of a first-degree murder committed\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   July 1, 1995, the release eligibility occurs after service of sixty percent of sixty years less any sentence credits earned, but those sentence credits cannot operate to enable a defendant to become eligible for release until a minimum of twenty-five calendar years have been served.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2040-35-501\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-35-501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   When the General Assembly added subsection (i) in 1995, the minimum sentence a defendant must serve prior to becoming eligible for release was increased from sixty percent to one-hundred percent not only for those convicted of first-degree murder and given a life sentence but also for convictions of the other enumerated offenses listed in subsection (i)(2). The addition of subsection (i) to 40-35-501 did not alter the provision in section 40-35-501 setting forth the length of the determinate sentence. It merely altered the release eligibility for the sentence. Thus, first-degree murders committed either before or after July 1, 1995, carry the same determinate sentence length of sixty years. However, for first-degree murders committed\n   <em>\n    on or after\n   </em>\n   July 1, 1995, a defendant must serve one hundred percent of sixty years less any sentence credits received, but the sentence credits cannot operate to reduce the sentence imposed by more than fifteen percent.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2040-35-501\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-35-501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (i). Fifteen\n   percent of sixty years is nine years, thus resulting in service of a minimum fifty-one-years. As such, a defendant who commits a first-degree murder on or after July 1, 1995, may be released, at the earliest, after service of fifty-one years.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Attorney General opined in 1997 that retention of subsection (h) created a conflict when subsection (i) was added because subsection (h) provides a twenty-five-year floor before a defendant sentenced to life for first-degree murder becomes eligible for release and subsection (i) raises that floor. Finding no way to reconcile the two provisions, the Attorney General opined that Tennessee Code Annotated section 40-35-501(h)(1) was repealed by implication by the enactment of Public Chapter 492, to the extent the two provisions conflict. As noted by the Attorney General, the legislative history indicates that the intent of subsection (i) was to increase the floor from sixty percent (as provided in subsection (h) ) to one-hundred percent but to retain the sixty-year sentence for first-degree murder.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tenn. Att'y Gen. Op. 97-098,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1997%20WL%20449672\">\n    1997 WL 449672\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (citing Special Report to the House Judiciary Comm., Tape # 1, May 3, 1995, at 672). The petitioner contends that the Attorney General's reasoning is flawed because under a proper statutory construction, the only possible way to read these two provisions together is to find that under the rule of specificity, subsection (h) controls as it applies to first-degree murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   However, both interpretations are flawed. Subsection (h) was retained for two reasons. First, as noted in the Attorney General's opinion, subsection (h) sets forth the determinate sentence of sixty years for a life sentence, which was not changed by the addition of subsection (i). Second, because subsection (h) applies only to first-degree murders, for which there is no statute of limitation, the sentencing laws pertaining to release eligibility for a life sentence for a first-degree murder committed prior to July 1, 1995, by necessity, must remain in effect. Therefore, the release eligibility provisions of subsection (h) do not conflict with the release eligibility provisions of subsection (i)(1) but instead provide for a different release eligibility for first-degree murders (among other offenses) occurring on or after July 1, 1995. This interpretation gives effect to the legislative intent without broadening the statute beyond its intended scope and allows all provisions to be given fair import to their terms in a way that promotes justice and effectuates the objectives of the criminal code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Indeed, we indicated as much in\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   . In that case, the Court considered whether defense counsel were ineffective for failing to object to erroneous jury instructions regarding their clients' change in release eligibility under Tennessee Code Annotated section 40-35-501(i).\n   <em>\n    Vaughn,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8461409\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/202/106/\">\n    202 S.W.3d at 116-20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Court referenced the Attorney General's 1997 opinion and the potential conflict between subsections (h) and (i) and seemed to agree that a conflict existed between the two in that \"it was not expressly stated that section (h) would no longer apply to a person committing an offense on or after July 1, 1995.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8461409\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/202/106/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8461409\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/202/106/\">\n    at 118-19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Relevant to the question at issue here, the Court observed that \"[t]he passage of section 40-35-501(i) did not repeal section (h), as (h) still applies to a person committing an offense before July 1, 1995.\"\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8461409\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/202/106/\">\n    202 S.W.3d at 118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   To the extent\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   affirms the Attorney General's opinion that an irreconcilable conflict exists between subsections (h) and (i), that portion of the opinion is abrogated. As we have determined, no conflict exists between these statutory provisions. Both subsections remain in full effect and are not irreconcilable; therefore, no part of subsection (h) is repealed by implication.\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   , however, correctly held that a defendant convicted of first-degree murder committed on or after July 1, 1995, may be released after serving at least fifty-one years in confinement.\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8461409\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/202/106/\">\n    202 S.W.3d at 117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

The Clerk shall transmit this opinion to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit and to the parties in accordance with Rule 23, section 8 of the Rules of the Tennessee Supreme Court.
