Finding that Movant has failed to demonstrate that\n   the motion court clearly erred in denying his post-conviction relief motion, we affirm the judgment of the motion court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   No jurisprudential purpose would be served by a written opinion. However, we have provided the parties a memorandum setting forth the reasons for our decision. The judgment of the motion court is affirmed under Rule 84.16(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
