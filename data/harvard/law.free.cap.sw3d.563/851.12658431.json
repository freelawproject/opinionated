She contends that the arresting officer failed to comply with the twenty minute rule in section 577.041, RSMo Noncum. Supp. 2014. Because a published opinion would have no precedential value, a memorandum has been provided to the parties. The judgment is affirmed. Rule 84.16(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
