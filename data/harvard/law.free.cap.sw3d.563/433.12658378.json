DISH also challenges the trial court's refusal to rule on its motion to compel arbitration as ordered by this Court in a prior mandamus proceeding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re DISH Network, LLC and Echosphere, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12385797\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/528/177/\">\n    528 S.W.3d 177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Tex.App.--El Paso 2017, orig. proceeding) (\n   <em>\n    In re DISH Network I\n   </em>\n   )(holding that trial court abused its discretion in deferring a ruling on former employer's motion to compel arbitration until after completion of discovery on a disqualification issue\n   raised by former employee who claimed discrimination and retaliation, where employee failed to offer any evidence that she had an express or implied relationship with law firm in issue; ordering trial court to rule on motion to compel arbitration within thirty days).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   We conditionally grant mandamus relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL SUMMARY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Yvette Delgado was employed by DISH on December 17, 2007, and she worked as the Human Resources Manager until her termination on August 25, 2015. Delgado filed suit against DISH asserting claims for discrimination and retaliation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   DISH filed a motion to compel arbitration and it attached a copy of the signed arbitration agreement in support of its motion. DISH authenticated the arbitration agreement with the affidavit of Katherine Leyba, the Senior Human Resources Manager for DISH Network, LLC. Leyba's affidavit provided as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   1. My name is Katherine Leyba. The facts stated in this affidavit are within my personal knowledge and are true and correct and if called to testify concerning them under oath, I could and would testify completely thereto. I am over 18 years of age, have never been convicted of a felony, and I am competent in all respects to make this affidavit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   2. I am currently a Senior Human Resources Manager for DISH Network L.L.C. ('DISH'). I oversee matters related to human resources for various DISH customer service centers and was previously the direct manager over Plaintiff Yvette Delgado. As such, I am duly authorized to make this affidavit which is submitted in support of Defendants' Motion to Compel Arbitration and Stay Proceedings ('Motion').\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   3. DISH's corporate headquarters are located in Englewood, Colorado. DISH and Echosphere L.L.C. are controlled by or under common control with DISH Network Corporation (f/k/a Echostar Communications Corporation), and both entities are considered to be affiliates of DISH Network Corporation. DISH provides satellite television services to millions of customers throughout the United States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands via a Direct Broadcast Satellite ('DBS') system.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   4. Newly hired employees at DISH are presented with a copy of, among other things, an arbitration agreement. Employees are required to sign the arbitration agreement as a condition of their employment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   5. As a Senior Human Resources Manager who previously oversaw the DISH customer service center in El Paso, Texas, I am familiar with the employment and personnel file of Ms. Delgado. As a condition of her employment with DISH, Ms. Delgado was required to sign the Arbitration Agreement entitled 'Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes - Waiver of Rights Agreement' ('Arbitration Agreement') when she was hired on or about December 17, 2007.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   6. The Arbitration Agreement signed by Ms. Delgado was part of her personnel file. Attached to Defendant's Motion as Exhibit 1 is a true and correct copy of the Arbitration Agreement signed by\n   Ms. Delgado. This document was made and kept in the ordinary course of business. It was the regular course of business at DISH for an employee to place the Arbitration Agreement in an employee's personnel file at or near the time it was signed. The Arbitration Agreement is an exact duplicate of the original.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Further, the arbitration agreement requires the parties to arbitrate \"any claim, controversy, and/or dispute between them, arising out of and/or in any way related to [Delgado's] application for employment, employment and/or termination of employment....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On the same day that DISH filed its motion to compel arbitration, Delgado served DISH with notice of intent to take Leyba's deposition, and DISH responded by filing a motion to quash on August 31, 2016. On September 2, 2016, Delgado filed an objection to the hearing on the motion to compel arbitration and asked the trial court to continue the hearing and permit discovery related to her assertion that Hagan Noll and Boyle, the law firm representing DISH, should be disqualified. In addition to raising the disqualification issues addressed in the prior mandamus proceeding (\n   <em>\n    In re DISH Network I\n   </em>\n   ), Delgado asserted that she was \"entitled to discovery regarding the validity of the alleged arbitration agreement before the motion to compel arbitration is heard.\" Delgado cited\n   <em>\n    In re Houston Pipe Line Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7324141\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/311/449/#p451\">\n    311 S.W.3d 449\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 451 (Tex. 2009) in support of her argument. Delgado did not file a written response to the motion to compel arbitration either denying the existence of the arbitration agreement or raising any defense to its enforcement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The trial court granted Delgado's objection to hearing the motion to compel arbitration prior to the completion of discovery regarding disqualification of Hagan Noll and Boyle, and DISH sought mandamus relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re DISH Network I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12385797\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/528/177/\">\n    528 S.W.3d at 180\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On June 30, 2017, the Court issued its opinion and judgment conditionally granting mandamus relief and holding that the trial court abused its discretion by delaying its ruling on the motion to compel arbitration until after discovery on the disqualification issue had been completed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re DISH Network I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12385797\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/528/177/\">\n    528 S.W.3d at 187\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The opinion and judgment required the trial court to rule on the motion to compel arbitration within thirty days.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12385797\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/528/177/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Delgado set a hearing in the trial court for July 13, 2017 on DISH's motion to quash the deposition of Katherine Leyba whose affidavit was submitted as an exhibit in support of DISH's motion to compel arbitration. Following the hearing, the trial court denied DISH's motion to quash the deposition. Despite the opinion's requirement that the motion to compel arbitration be ruled on within thirty days, the trial court set DISH's motion to compel arbitration for hearing on August 24, 2017. Delgado filed a motion to modify the judgment in cause number 08-16-00300-CV to extend the deadline for the trial court to comply with our judgment to August 31, 2017 and DISH filed a response in opposition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   DISH filed a new mandamus petition and emergency motion to stay trial court proceedings. The Court granted the emergency motion and stayed all proceedings in the underlying case pending resolution of this mandamus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    PRE-ARBITRATION DISCOVERY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In its sole issue, DISH argues that the trial court clearly abused its discretion by\n   denying DISH's motion to quash the deposition of Katherine Leyba and allowing Delgado to conduct pre-arbitration discovery before ruling on the motion to compel arbitration. DISH contends that Delgado is not entitled to pre-arbitration discovery under Texas law and our opinion and judgment issued in cause number 08-16-00300-CV did not authorize the trial court to order pre-arbitration discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   To be entitled to mandamus relief, a relator must generally meet two requirements. First, the relator must show that the trial court clearly abused its discretion.\n   <em>\n    In re Prudential Insurance Company of America\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9146465\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/148/124/#p135\">\n    148 S.W.3d 124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 135 (Tex. 2004).

The issue before the Court is whether counsel's statement during the hearing and Delgado's assertion that she is entitled to discovery regarding the validity of the arbitration agreement are sufficient to authorize the trial court to defer ruling on an otherwise uncontested motion to compel arbitration until after pre-arbitration discovery is completed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Consistent with the statement made by counsel at the hearing on DISH's motion to quash the deposition notice, Delgado indicates in her mandamus responses that she is contesting the existence of the arbitration agreement. Whether an arbitration agreement exists is an issue of arbitrability.\n   <em>\n    G.T.

Delgado argues that she has a right to engage in discovery before being required to even file a response to the motion to compel arbitration. She also maintains that she is not required to file a response because DISH has the burden to first prove the existence of an arbitration agreement. The mandamus record shows that DISH presented\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   evidence that an arbitration agreement exists and that the claims presented by Delgado fall within the scope of the agreement. Consequently, the burden shifted to Delgado to raise a fact issue regarding the existence of the arbitration agreement or to present a defense to its enforcement. Delgado did not submit any evidence which raises a fact issue necessitating an evidentiary hearing. Counsel's bare assertion at the motion to quash hearing that \"we don't believe a valid arbitration agreement exists\" and Delgado's written assertion that she is entitled to pre-arbitration discovery are not evidence and are insufficient to create an issue of material fact regarding the existence or validity of the agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   That is not to say that Delgado does not have a right to limited discovery related to the existence of the arbitration agreement. Delgado relies on\n   <em>\n    In re Houston Pipe Line Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7324141\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/311/449/#p451\">\n    311 S.W.3d 449\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 451 (Tex. 2009) (orig. proceeding) in support of her argument that she is permitted to engage in pre-arbitration discovery.

Further, Delgado did not submit evidence contesting any aspect of Leyba's affidavit. In her mandamus response, Delgado argues that she should be allowed to challenge the veracity of Leyba's affidavit, but she does not show there is a reason to believe that Leyba's deposition is material to proving the arbitration agreement does not exist or that the arbitration agreement is invalid. Thus, the trial court's order denying DISH's motion to quash the deposition notice is not supported by Section 171.086(a) or\n   <em>\n    In re Houston Pipe Line\n   </em>\n   . We conclude that the trial court clearly abused its discretion by denying DISH's motion to quash the deposition of Leyba.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX.CIV.PRAC.&amp;REM.CODE ANN. \u00a7 171.021(b) (West 2011);\n   <em>\n    In re VNA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7092621\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/403/483/#p488\">\n    403 S.W.3d at 488\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (granting mandamus relief from pre-arbitration discovery order where party opposing arbitration failed to provide a colorable basis or reason to believe that pre-arbitration discovery was necessary);\n   <em>\n    In re ReadyOne Industries\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7264446\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/420/179/#p186\">\n    420 S.W.3d at 186-87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that plaintiff's affidavit testimony did not constitute evidence of fraud in connection with existence of arbitration agreement and did not establish a colorable basis or reason to believe pre-arbitration discovery would be material to showing she was fraudulently induced into signing the arbitration agreement).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Even though we have determined that the trial court abused its discretion by permitting the pre-arbitration discovery, we find it necessary to address DISH's additional argument that our opinion and judgment issued in cause number 08-16-00300-CV did not authorize the trial court to order pre-arbitration discovery. As the Supreme Court observed in\n   <em>\n    Houston Pipe Line\n   </em>\n   , the trial court retains discretion to order limited discovery upon proper application filed pursuant to Section 171.086(a)(4) and (6) if that discovery is shown to be necessary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Houston Pipe Line\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7324141\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/311/449/#p451\">\n    311 S.W.3d at 452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Opn. on reh'g). While we have determined that Delgado failed to properly invoke the trial court's jurisdiction under the statute to order the deposition of Leyba, the trial court nevertheless retained discretion to order pre-arbitration discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Having found that the trial court clearly abused its discretion by denying DISH's motion to quash the deposition notice and permitting pre-arbitration discovery, we sustain Issue One and conditionally grant the petition for writ of mandamus. The trial court is directed to withdraw its order denying DISH's motion to quash the deposition notice for Leyba and to enter an order granting the motion to quash. If Delgado fails to file within thirty days from the date of this opinion a motion establishing she is entitled to pre-arbitration discovery pursuant to Section 171.086(a)(4) and (6) or fails to present evidence sufficient to entitle her to a\n   <em>\n    Tipps\n   </em>\n   evidentiary hearing, the trial court is ordered to summarily rule on the motion to compel arbitration. The motion to compel arbitration and any reasonable discovery must be resolved without delay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Houston Pipe Line\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7324141\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/311/449/#p451\">\n    311 S.W.3d at 452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Opn. on reh'g).
