(referred to collectively as Copart) have filed a mandamus petition against the Honorable Luis Aguilar, Judge of the 243rd District Court of El Paso County, Texas, to challenge the trial court's order permitting the real party in interest, Maria Ordaz, to engage in pre-arbitration discovery. We conditionally grant mandamus relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL SUMMARY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The real party in interest, Maria Ordaz, filed suit against Copart alleging employment discrimination and retaliation causes of action under the Texas Labor Code.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Copart's counsel emailed a motion to compel arbitration to counsel for Ordaz prior to filing the motion. The motion was supported by the affidavit of Kallie Sirles, a Human Resource Generalist at Copart, Inc. Attached to Sirles' affidavit are several exhibits, including the arbitration agreement electronically signed by Ordaz. Sirles' affidavit addressed the existence of its arbitration agreement, the receipt of the arbitration agreement by Ordaz, Ordaz's acknowledgement and signature of the arbitration agreement, and that the records attached to her affidavit are business records kept in the ordinary course of business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After receiving the motion to compel arbitration, Ordaz's counsel called opposing counsel and unsuccessfully attempted to confer regarding dates for the deposition of Sirles. Copart's counsel unsuccessfully attempt to obtain opposing counsel's agreement to submit a joint motion to compel arbitration. Ordaz subsequently noticed Sirles for deposition. Copart filed its motion to compel arbitration and a motion to quash the deposition notice. Ordaz responded by filing a motion to compel discovery in which she sought pre-arbitration discovery pursuant to Section 171.086(a) of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code. Following a hearing, the trial court granted Ordaz's motion to compel discovery and denied Copart's motion to quash the deposition notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    PRE-ARBITRATION DISCOVERY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In Issue One, Copart argues that the trial court clearly abused its discretion by granting Ordaz's motion to compel discovery and denying Copart's motion to quash the deposition notice for Kallie Sirles. Ordaz did not file a response to the motion to compel arbitration, but she argued in her motion to compel discovery that she is entitled to pre-arbitration discovery under Section 171.086(a) of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   To be entitled to mandamus relief, a relator must generally meet two requirements.

Ordaz argues that we should overrule the\n   <em>\n    In re VNA\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    In re ReadyOne\n   </em>\n   cases, but we decline to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In her motion to compel discovery, Ordaz stated that she \"denies any enforceable arbitration agreement.\" She also asserted that she is not required to accept Sirles' testimony as true and is entitled to cross-examine Sirles and conduct other reasonable discovery on the question of whether an enforceable arbitration agreement exists. Additionally, Ordaz stated her intent to notice Copart's corporate representative for deposition. Ordaz asked the trial court to order that she be permitted to conduct this discovery pursuant to Section 171.086(a)(4) and (6). As illustrated by\n   <em>\n    In re Houston Pipe Line\n   </em>\n   , Section 171.086(a)(4) and (6) does not give the trial court unlimited discretion to order pre-arbitration discovery. The trial court's discretion in this regard is limited to situations where the trial court cannot fairly and properly make its decision on the motion to compel arbitration because it lacks sufficient information related to the specific issues identified by the party resisting arbitration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Houston Pipe Line\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7324141\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/311/449/#p451\">\n    311 S.W.3d at 451\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The burden is on the party seeking pre-arbitration discovery under Section 171.086(a) to show that the discovery is necessary and related to the issues raised by the party's motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7324141\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/311/449/#p451\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Ordaz's motion to compel discovery generally contests whether an arbitration agreement exists. This is an issue of arbitrability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    G.T. Leach Builders\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6875733\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/458/502/#p508\">\n    458 S.W.3d at 520\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The motion does not, however, provide any basis for the trial court to conclude that it lacks sufficient information to determine whether an arbitration agreement exists. Consequently, the trial court abused its discretion by compelling the deposition under these facts. In her mandamus response, Ordaz contests the validity of her electronic signature on the arbitration agreement, but she did not raise this argument in her motion or at the hearing as a basis for obtaining pre-arbitration discovery under Section 171.086(a)(4) and (6). Even if Ordaz had raised this issue in the trial court, the discovery order is overbroad because it did not limit the deposition of Sirles to this issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Houston Pipe Line\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7324141\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/311/449/#p451\">\n    311 S.W.3d at 451\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Issue One is sustained. It is unnecessary to address Issue Two.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   We conditionally grant the writ of mandamus and direct the trial court to vacate the orders compelling the deposition of Sirles and denying Copart's motion to quash the deposition notice. As the Supreme Court observed in\n   <em>\n    Houston Pipe Line\n   </em>\n   , the trial court retains discretion to order limited discovery pursuant to a properly filed Section 171.086(a) motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Houston Pipe Line\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7324141\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/311/449/#p451\">\n    311 S.W.3d at 452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Opn. on reh'g). The trial court's order must limit discovery to the specific issues identified by the Section 171.086(a) motion. If Ordaz fails to file within thirty days from the date of this opinion a motion establishing she is entitled to pre-arbitration discovery pursuant to Section 171.086(a)(4) and (6) or fails to present evidence sufficient to entitle her to a\n   <em>\n    Tipps\n   </em>\n   evidentiary hearing, the trial court is ordered to summarily rule on the motion to compel arbitration. The motion to compel arbitration and any reasonable discovery should be resolved without delay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Houston Pipe Line\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7324141\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/311/449/#p451\">\n    311 S.W.3d at 452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Opn. on reh'g). The writ of mandamus will issue only if the trial court fails to comply.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    The suit is styled\n    <em>\n     Maria R. Ordaz v.
