The trial court found that Father had impermissibly modified his child support obligation based,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , on the fact that Father failed to follow the Child Support Guidelines. Discerning no error, we affirm the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The facts in this case are largely undisputed. Randall Nelson Songstad (\"Father\") and Jana Ruth Alford Nichols (\"Mother\") were divorced in the Chancery Court of Shelby County (\"chancery court\") on January 30, 2006. A Permanent Parenting Plan (\"the plan\") was entered on May 17, 2006, which required Father to pay child support for the parties' two minor children in the amount of $1,154.00 per month. The plan included the language \"[t]he parents acknowledge that court approval must be obtained before child support can be reduced or modified.\" Father and Mother both signed the plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2011, the eldest of the parties' two children emancipated after she graduated high school. After her emancipation, Father unilaterally prorated his child support payments by approximately fifty percent without filing a petition to modify or bringing his modification request before the court in any way. Mother, however, accepted Father's reduced child support payments for the next four years, until the parties' youngest child also emancipated in 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Mother, who became a Texas resident after the parties' divorce, applied for Title IV-D assistance\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   in Texas in 2014. After receiving little to no assistance in Texas, Mother filed for contempt in the chancery court. The State of Tennessee (\"the state\") then filed a notice of Title IV-D services and a notice to transfer to the Shelby County Juvenile Court (\"juvenile court\") in the chancery court on July 7, 2015. The matter was administratively transferred to the juvenile court pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated section 36-5-402.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The state then filed a petition to establish arrears and/or to modify order on September 30, 2015, in the juvenile court. The matter was continued several times and was finally heard on June 9, 2016, by Magistrate Debra Sanders. The juvenile magistrate entered her findings and recommendations on June 21, 2016, in which the magistrate granted, in part, the petition to establish arrears and modify child support, as to the establishment of arrears only. The Magistrate additionally established arrears in the amount of $29,994.00 to be paid monthly by Father in the amount of $1,154.00 beginning July 1, 2016. Father filed a timely motion to rehear requesting a rehearing before the Presiding Judge.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On July 27, 2016, Special Judge Nancy Percer Kessler heard the case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court\n   entered an order on the same day finding that Father's request for rehearing was granted and taken under advisement. The juvenile court entered its final order on August 25, 2016, in which it found that Father was in arrears in the amount of $29,994.00. Father timely appealed this order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   ISSUE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Father presents one issue on appeal, which we have slightly restated: Whether the trial court erred in not allowing Father to prorate his child support upon his oldest child's emancipation without a court order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   This Court reviews questions of the law de novo with no presumption of correctness.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Kelly v.

Wunder\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , M2014-00008-COA-R3-CV,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%207332857\">\n    2014 WL 7332857\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Tenn. Ct. App. 2014) to his 2011 proration of child support. We are cognizant that the trial court heavily relied on\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Wunder\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , a memorandum opinion, in its order. Indeed, in its conclusions of law, the trial court specifically states that it \"adopts the findings in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Wunder v. Wunder\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%207332857\">\n    2014 WL 7332857\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\" We also recognize the factual similarities between\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Wunder\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   and the case at bar; however, \"[w]hen a case is decided by memorandum opinion it shall be designated 'MEMORANDUM OPINION,' shall not be published, and\n   <em>\n    shall not be cited or relied on for any reason in any unrelated case\n   </em>\n   .\" Tenn. R. Ct. App 10 (emphasis added). Accordingly, we will not rely on\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Wunder\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   as the trial court did in this case, and Father's argument regarding a violation of his constitutional rights and the retroactive application of\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Wunder\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   is pretermitted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Father next asserts that a parent may unilaterally prorate child support without requesting a modification from the court upon emancipation of the child because (1) a parent has no duty to support a child once he or she has reached the age of majority and (2) proration of child support is not considered a \"modification\" of a child support award. Respectfully, we disagree. The Child Support Guidelines control this case, and they require Father to seek a modification from the court and\n   establish a significant variance prior to modifying his child support obligation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \"[S]ince 1984, the process and criteria for ascertaining a parent's child support obligation has been governed by Child Support Guidelines promulgated by the Tennessee Department of Human Services in accordance with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2035-5-101\">\n    Tenn.

Rather, the Child Support Guidelines applicable in this case provide that even where a reduction in child support is based upon the emancipation of a child, i.e., \"a change in the number of children for whom a parent is legally responsible,\" two requirements must be met: (1) the parent seeking the modification must file a petition and provide notice to the opposing parent; and (2) the party seeking the reduction must show that a significant variance exists to warrant modification. Here, Father never requested permission from the court to modify his child support obligation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Comp.%20R.%20%26%20Regs.%201240\">\n    Tenn.

In fact, Father failed to present any evidence that his child support as calculated under the income shares model would have been reduced in any fashion due to the change in number of children for whom Father was legally responsible. As a result, Father was not in compliance with the controlling income shares guidelines and acted without authority in prorating his child support obligation upon emancipation of his oldest child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   As a final point, Father argued at oral argument that regardless of whether he could unilaterally modify his child support obligation without filing a modification petition, this Court should remand this issue to the trial court to calculate his child support payment in light of his oldest child emancipating. \"Judgments awarded outside of the scope of the requested relief are typically void.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Long v.

Because Father has failed to comply with the Child Support Guidelines, which are mandatory in order to receive a modification, he has failed to properly request any relief that could result in a court's modification of his child support obligation. Accordingly, this Court lacks the authority to remand for a determination of Father's child support arrearage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Comp.%20R.%20%26%20Regs.%201240\">\n    Tenn.
