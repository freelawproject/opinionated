Martin, Judge\n   Roger Kitchen (\"Kitchen\") appeals from the trial court's declaratory judgment finding that under Illinois law, the underinsured motorist and medical expense coverages in his insurance policies do not stack and allow the underinsured motorist coverage to be reduced by the full amount of the liability payment by a tortfeasor's insurer. American Family Mutual Insurance Company (\"American Family\") and American Standard Insurance Company of Wisconsin (\"American Standard\"), each of whom are a member of the American Family Insurance Group Madison, WI (collectively \"the Insurers\"), have filed a cross appeal from the same declaratory judgment, challenging the trial court's findings that under Missouri law, the underinsured motorist and medical expense coverages in Lori Kissinger's (\"Kissinger\") insurance policies do stack and do not allow for a reduction by the amount of the liability payment by a tortfeasor's insurer. We affirm the judgment in favor of the Insurers and against Kitchen. We affirm in part, and reverse and modify in part, the judgment in favor of Kissinger and against the Insurers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Kitchen and Kissinger (collectively \"Plaintiffs\"), who are divorced, are the natural parents of Megan Kitchen (\"Megan\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On December 12, 2008, Megan suffered fatal injuries in a car accident while riding as a passenger in a vehicle operated by Chad Roberts (\"Roberts\") and owned by Roberts's parents. The vehicle Roberts was driving at the time of the accident was covered by an automobile insurance policy issued by American Family (\"Roberts's policy\") that provided $25,000 liability coverage and $2,000 in medical expense coverage. In December 2009, American Family paid the liability coverage of $25,000 and $2,000 medical expense coverage under Roberts's policy into court, and the court divided the policy proceeds equally between Kitchen and Kissinger. In addition to the liability and medical expense coverage provided by Roberts's policy, both Kitchen and Kissinger owned automobile insurance policies at the time of the accident that included underinsured motorist (\"UIM\") coverage and medical expense coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Kitchen's Automobile Insurance Policies\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At the time of the accident, Kitchen resided in Illinois and held four insurance policies issued by American Family and American Standard, as members of the American Family Insurance Group Madison, WI.

All of Kitchen's policies were issued in Illinois.

In January 2010, the Plaintiffs filed an amended petition, titled Plaintiffs' Amended Petition for Wrongful Death and for Breach of Contract Damages and Declaratory Judgment (\"Amended Petition\"). In addition to adding Megan's estate and Kissinger in her capacity as personal representative for Megan's estate as plaintiffs, the Amended Petition added American Family as a defendant. The Amended Petition alleged wrongful death against Roberts, and alleged breach of contract and vexatious refusal to pay against American Family. In addition, the Amended Petition asked the trial court to declare the Plaintiffs' and American Family's respective duties, rights, obligations, status, and legal relations under Kitchen's policies and Kissinger's policies.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    American Family filed an answer and counterclaim for declaratory relief which asked the trial court to determine whether the UIM coverage and medical expense coverage in Kissinger's policies stack, whether the UIM coverage and medical expense coverage in Kitchen's policies stack, and whether American Family is allowed to reduce its payment for UIM coverage to both Kissinger and Kitchen by the $25,000 paid from Roberts's American Family policy.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    The Plaintiffs thereafter sought and secured leave to file another amended petition, which they titled Plaintiffs' First Amended Petition for Wrongful Death and for Breach of Contract Damages and Declaratory Judgment (\"First Amended Petition\").

The court entered an order permitting the Insurers to deposit and interplead $165,000 into the registry of the court. The amount interpleaded represented $75,000 in UIM motorist coverage under Kitchen's policies (the greatest UIM coverage set forth in Kitchen's policies less $25,000 paid to the Plaintiffs from Roberts's policy); $10,000 in medical expense coverage under Kitchen's policies (the greatest medical expense coverage set forth in Kitchen's policies); $75,000 in UIM coverage under Kissinger's policies (the greatest UIM coverage set forth in Kissinger's policies less $25,000 paid to the Plaintiffs from Roberts's policy); and $5,000 in medical expense coverage under Kissinger's policies (the greatest medical expense coverage set forth in Kissinger's policies). The Plaintiffs filed a motion to dismiss the federal court interpleader. The United States District Court granted the motion and ordered the clerk of the court to transfer the interpleaded fund, plus accumulated interested, to the registry of the Clay County Circuit Court. Upon motion by the Plaintiffs, the Clay\n    County trial court ordered the interpleaded funds to be distributed to the Plaintiffs.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    The Insurers filed two motions for summary judgment in November 2011. The first motion addressed the Kitchen policies and argued that the Insurers were entitled to summary judgment in their favor because (1) the UIM coverage in Kitchen's policies does not stack under Illinois law; (2) the Insurers were authorized by Illinois statute to reduce the UIM coverage paid to Kitchen by $25,000, the amount paid by Roberts's liability insurer; and (3) the Insurers are not liable for vexatious refusal or breach of contract because Missouri's vexatious refusal statute does not apply to Kitchen's policies or claims, and because Kitchen has been paid all that he is owed under his policies. The second motion addressed the Kissinger policies and argued that the Insurers\n    <footnotemark>\n     6\n    </footnotemark>\n    were entitled to summary judgment in their favor because (1) the UIM coverage in Kissinger's policies does not stack under Missouri law; (2) American Family was entitled to reduce the UIM coverage paid to Kissinger by $25,000, the amount paid by Roberts's liability insurer; and (3) American Family is not liable for vexatious refusal or breach of contract because Kissinger has been paid all that she is owed under her policies.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    Both Kitchen and Kissinger filed responses to the Insurers' motions for summary judgment. Kitchen's response argued that Missouri law, and not Illinois law, should apply to determine coverage under his policies because the UIM coverage and medical expense coverage provisions in Kitchen's policies insured against the risk of bodily injury to Megan, a Missouri resident. Kitchen's response further asserted that, under Missouri law, the other insurance provision in Kitchen's policies when read with the anti-stacking provision renders the policies ambiguous. Kitchen's response thus argued that under Missouri law, stacking of the UIM coverage and medical expense coverage in Kitchen's policies is allowed, and that the Insurers are not entitled to reduce the UIM coverage by the $25,000 liability payment from Roberts's policy. Kitchen's response also asserted that, even if Illinois law applies to construe his policies, the result would be the same as if Missouri law applied. Finally, Kitchen's response argued that the Insurers were not entitled to summary judgment on the Plaintiffs' breach of contract and vexatious refusal to pay claims because the Insurers have not paid all that is owed to Plaintiffs and because questions of fact exist as to whether the Insurers vexatiously refused to pay.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    Kissinger's response to the Insurer's motions for summary judgment was nearly identical to Kitchen's response, though Kissinger's response did not address the choice of law issue raised in Kitchen's response, as it is uncontested that construction of the Kissinger policies is controlled by Missouri law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    While the Insurers' motions for summary judgment were pending, the trial court severed and tried Plaintiffs' claims against Roberts. The trial court found Roberts 100 percent at fault for the December\n    12, 2008 motor vehicle accident and liable for Megan's injuries and death.

In the first, Kitchen argues that the trial court erred in finding that the UIM coverage in Kitchen's policies does not stack because, under either Illinois or Missouri law, Kitchen's policies do not unambiguously preclude Kitchen from collecting the UIM coverage provided by each policy because the other insurance provision in the policies conflicts with the anti-stacking provision, rendering the policies ambiguous. Kitchen's second point on appeal contends that the trial court erred in concluding that Illinois law applies to Kitchen's policies because Missouri has more significant contacts with the issues in this case. Kitchen's third point on appeal asserts that the trial court erred in finding that the medical expense coverage in Kitchen's policies does not stack because the policies did not unambiguously preclude Kitchen from collecting the medical expense coverage provided by each policy because the other insurance provision in the policies conflicts with the anti-stacking provision, rendering the policies ambiguous. Kitchen's fourth and final point on appeal argues that the trial court erred in reducing the UIM coverage in Kitchen's policies by the full amount paid by Roberts's liability insurer. We address Kitchen's points on\n    appeal out of order, as the logical starting point is to determine whether Illinois or Missouri law applies to the interpretation of Kitchen's policies.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      Kitchen's Point Two: Choice of Law\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    Kitchen's second point on appeal contends that, contrary to the trial court's conclusion, Illinois law does not apply to the interpretation of Kitchen's policies. Kitchen claims that Missouri has more significant contacts with the issues in this case because the insured risk, Megan, resided in Missouri; the car accident and the acts triggering coverage occurred in Missouri; the underinsured driver resided in Missouri; the underinsured vehicle was registered and garaged in Missouri; and the underlying litigation was filed in Missouri. Kitchen claims that applying Missouri law to the interpretation of Kitchen's policies would allow stacking of the UIM coverage and the medical expense coverage and would preclude any offset for the amount paid by Roberts's liability policy.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    \"Missouri has adopted sections 188 and 193 of the Restatement (Second) Conflict of Laws (1971) for determining choice of law issues as they relate to insurance contracts.\"\n    <em>\n     Accurso v.

App. W.D. 2009). Section 188(1) provides that \"[t]he rights and duties of the parties with respect to an issue in contract are determined by the local law of the state which, with respect to that issue, has the most significant relationship to the transaction and the parties.\" In determining which state has the most significant relationship to the contract, we consider \"(a) the place of contracting, (b) the place of negotiation of the contract, (c) the place of performance, (d) the location of the subject matter of the contract, and (e) the domicil[e], residence, nationality, place of incorporation and place of business of the parties.\" However, when determining the validity of an insurance contract and the rights created thereby, section 193 commands that the most important factor to consider is \"the local law of the state which the parties understood was to be the principal location of the insured risk during the term of the policy.\" Comment b to section 193 explains that the principal location of the insured risk is \"in the state where it will be during at least the major portion of the insurance period\" so that in the case of an automobile liability policy, the principal location of the insured risk is \"where the automobile will be garaged at least during most of the period in question.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    The Insurers and Kitchen agree that the principal location of the insured risk is the most important factor in determining whether Missouri law or Illinois should apply to the interpretation of Kitchen's policies. The Insurers and Kitchen also agree that, at the time of the accident, Kitchen's vehicles were garaged in Illinois and Megan lived in Missouri. The point of disagreement between the parties is where the principal place of the insured risk lies. The Insurers assert that because Kitchen's four vehicles were garaged in Illinois, Illinois law applies to the interpretation of Kitchen's policies in their entirety. Kitchen disagrees, contending that UIM coverage and medical expense coverage are qualitatively different than liability coverage in that the former insure persons and the latter insures a vehicle. Thus, Kitchen asserts that, with respect to UIM coverage and medical expense coverage, the insured risk was Megan so that the principal location of the insured risk was Missouri.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Accurso v.

As for the [excess insurance] policy, the principal address was changed to a Missouri address before the accident occurred in this case. Moreover, before Accurso's accident, the vehicles were registered and licensed in Missouri. The final factor is the domicile, residence, nationality, place of incorporation, and place of business of the parties. Accurso was residing in Kansas at the time of the accident, and her husband was residing in Missouri at the time of the accident. Thus, applying the factors of section 188, the evidence established that the factors were either inapplicable or they weighed in favor of applying Missouri law.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7300324\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/295/548/#p551\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7300324\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/295/548/#p551\">\n     at 553\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Thus, we rejected the insurers' contention on appeal that the residence of the wife-the beneficiary of the uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage-controlled where the automobile liability insurance policy and the excess insurance policy would be interpreted.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    As we concluded in\n    <em>\n     Accurso\n    </em>\n    , under section 193 of the Restatement (Second) Conflicts of Law, the location of the insured risk-where Kitchen's cars were garaged-is given greater weight than any other single contact so that Illinois law governs the interpretation of Kitchen's\n    policies. However, even if the location of the insured risk is not dispositive, an examination of the factors set forth in section 188 of the Restatement reveals that Illinois has the most significant relationship to the transaction and the parties so that Illinois law applies.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    Kitchen was in Illinois at the time he negotiated and contracted for the insurance policies at issue in this case, and while American Family and American Standard had an agent in Illinois, neither American Family nor American Standard were located in either Missouri or Illinois. Thus, the place of negotiation is not important to the choice-of-law analysis required by section 188. Further, as was the case in\n    <em>\n     Accurso\n    </em>\n    , the place of performance of the contract was unknown at the time the parties entered into the contract because Kitchen and the Insurers did not know where future lawsuits would be brought. Also like\n    <em>\n     Accurso\n    </em>\n    , the location of the subject matter of Kitchen's policies is less than certain because the underinsured motorist and medical expense coverage does not insure a specific physical thing or afford protection against a localized risk even though Kitchen's policies indicated that the vehicles insured were garaged in Illinois. The final factor, the domicile, residence, nationality, place of incorporation, and place of business of the parties, weighs toward Illinois because Kitchen resided in Illinois at the time of the accident. As such, application of the factors set forth in section 188 to the evidence in this case demonstrates that the factors were either inapplicable or weighed in favor of applying Illinois law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    Kitchen recognizes in his brief that if we apply the traditional choice-of-law framework set forth in\n    <em>\n     Accurso\n    </em>\n    , Illinois law will apply to the interpretation of his policies. Nonetheless, Kitchen asks us to abandon the traditional choice-of-law framework in favor of applying the location of the insured person's residence when UIM or medical expense coverage is at issue. We decline to do so. \"[T]he location of the risk is a matter of intense concern to the parties to the insurance contract\" because the \"location has an intimate bearing upon the risk's nature and extent and is a factor upon which the terms and conditions of the policy will frequently depend.\" Section 193, comment c. \"It is common knowledge that premiums for an insurance policy are determined, in large part, according to where the vehicle is garaged.\"\n    <em>\n     Hartzler v.

App. W.D. 1994). Where, as here, a policy provides for UIM coverage and medical expense coverage to a class of persons greater than the named insureds, it would be difficult to calculate premiums properly without knowing which state's law would apply to the interpretation of the policy. Thus, \"it can ... be assumed that the parties, to the extent that they thought about the matter at all, would expect that the local law of the state where the risk is to be principally located would be applied to determine many of the issues arising under the contract.\" Section 193, comment c. As such, Kitchen and the Insurers, as parties to Kitchen's policies, would have expected Illinois law, the place where Kitchen's vehicles were garaged, to apply to the interpretation of Kitchen's policies and the coverage provided thereby.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    Kitchen's second point on appeal is denied.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      Kitchen's Points One and Three: Interpreting the UIM Coverage and Medical Expense Coverage Provisions\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    Kitchen's first and third points on appeal assert that the trial court erred in concluding that Kitchen's policies unambiguously precluded stacking the UIM coverage and medical expense coverage.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    Kitchen asserts that, if the other insurance provisions found in the UIM coverage endorsement and the medical expense coverage provision are construed with the anti-stacking provision, an ordinary insured with an average understanding would conclude that, if an injured insured is occupying a non-owned automobile when the injury occurs, the UIM coverage and medical expense coverage stack. In other words, Kitchen asserts that, while Kitchen's policies have unambiguous anti-stacking language, the \"other insurance\" provisions in the Kitchen policies render the policies ambiguous, entitling Kitchen to stack the UIM and medical expense coverages.

In December 2009, American Family paid into court Roberts's liability coverage of $25,000 under the automobile insurance policy for the vehicle that was involved in the accident that resulted in Megan's death, and the court divided the policy proceeds equally between Kitchen and Kissinger. While the policy proceeds were not entirely distributed to Kitchen, Illinois courts have construed \"amounts actually recovered,\" as used in that 215 ILL. COMP. STAT. 5/143a-2(4), to mean all amounts recovered under the bodily injury insurance policy, regardless of whether part of that amount was paid to someone other than the insured. Thus, it is of no consequence that the proceeds from Roberts's policy were divided equally between Kitchen and Kissinger so that Kitchen only received $12,500.

The Insurers' second point on appeal asserts that the trial court erred in concluding that Kissinger's policies are ambiguous and do not permit reduction of the limits of the UIM coverage paid to Kissinger by the payment made by Roberts's liability insurer. In their third point on appeal, the Insurers contend that the trial court erred in concluding that Kissinger's policies are ambiguous and thus allow medical expense coverage to stack.

The Insurers argue that\n    <em>\n     Ritchie\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Manner\n    </em>\n    are not controlling, because the \"other similar insurance\" language at issue in the second sentence of the other insurance provisions in those cases does not appear in Kissinger's policies.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-149\">\n    In Kissinger's policies, the second sentence of the other insurance provision in the UIM coverage endorsement is indeed different from the second sentence of the same provision in the\n    <em>\n     Ritchie\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Manner\n    </em>\n    policies. The second sentence of the other insurance provision in the UIM coverage endorsement in Kissinger's policies provides that \"any remaining limits of insurance provided under this endorsement for an\n    <strong>\n     insured person\n    </strong>\n    while occupying a vehicle\n    <strong>\n     you\n    </strong>\n    do not own is excess over all other underinsured motorist insurance provided\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      by all other insurance companies\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    .\" (Final emphasis added.) The Insurers argue that the phrase \"by all other insurance companies\" is materially different from the phrase \"any other collectible underinsured motorist coverage\" (\n    <em>\n     Ritchie\n    </em>\n    ) and the phrase \"any other similar insurance\" (\n    <em>\n     Manner\n    </em>\n    ). The Insurers argue that the phrase \"by all other insurance companies\" unambiguously means insurance companies other than the Insurers, and could not be read by an ordinary person of average understanding to include other policies issued by the same insurer.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-150\">\n    The trial court concluded to the contrary and found that \"[t]he ambiguity identified in [\n    <em>\n     Ritchie\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Manner\n    </em>\n    and other cases] is not cured by American Family's\n    change in the 12/04\n    <footnotemark>\n     18\n    </footnotemark>\n    UIM endorsement language....\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     19\n    </footnotemark>\n    This was legally erroneous. The phrases \"other collectible underinsured motorist coverage\" and \"other similar insurance\" at issue in\n    <em>\n     Ritchie\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Manner\n    </em>\n    did not differentiate between, or refer in any manner to, the company issuing the \"other coverage or insurance,\" permitting an ordinary person of average understanding to conclude that \"other coverage or insurance\" meant just that-other coverage or insurance\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      by whomever issued\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    . In contrast, the phrase \"by all other insurance companies\" plainly and unambiguously comments on\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      who\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    has issued the other UIM coverage or insurance, and has no reasonable meaning except to differentiate between the Insurers and all other companies issuing policies affording similar coverage. We conclude, therefore, that the other insurance provision in the UIM endorsement in Kissinger's policies does not conflict with the anti-stacking provisions in Kissinger's policies as to render Kissinger's policies ambiguous. The UIM coverage afforded by Kissinger's policies cannot be stacked. The trial court erred in concluding to the contrary.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-151\">\n    We do not reach the same conclusion, however, with respect to the medical expense coverage in Kissinger's policies. The other insurance provision in the medical expense coverage provision provides, in relevant part, \"[a]ny insurance provided under this Part for an\n    <strong>\n     insured person\n    </strong>\n    as a pedestrian or while\n    <strong>\n     occupying\n    </strong>\n    a vehicle\n    <strong>\n     you\n    </strong>\n    do not own is excess over any other auto medical expense insurance.\" This other insurance provision suffers from the same ambiguity at issue in\n    <em>\n     Ritchie\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Manner\n    </em>\n    . The phrase, \"any other auto medical expense insurance,\" could be read by an ordinary person of average understanding to mean medical expense coverage in other insurance policies issued by American Family. Thus, the trial court did not err in concluding that the other insurance provision in the medical expense coverage provision in Kissinger's policies, when read with the anti-stacking provision, rendered the policies ambiguous so that medical expense coverage stacks.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-152\">\n    The Insurers' first point on appeal is granted, and the Insurers' third point on appeal is denied.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-153\">\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      The Insurers' Point Two: Reducing UIM Coverage by Roberts's Insurance Payment\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-154\">\n    The Insurers' second point on appeal asserts that the trial court erred in concluding that the UIM coverage they paid Kissinger could not be reduced by the\n    $25,000 payment from Roberts's liability insurer. The Insurers argue that because Kissinger's policies do not promise to pay the limits of liability set forth on the declarations page, and instead define the UIM liability limit by what American Family will\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      not\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    pay, an ordinary person of average understanding would not reasonably expect American Family to pay the entire amount of the UIM limit of liability.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-155\">\n    Once again, the Insurers' second point on appeal requires us to determine whether Kissinger's policies are ambiguous. As noted\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , an insurance policy is ambiguous if \"there is duplicity, indistinctness, or uncertainty in the meaning of the language used in the policy\" so that it is reasonably open to different constructions.\n    <em>\n     Chamness\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8373150\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/226/199/#p202\">\n     226 S.W.3d at 202\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

However, that decision has been vacated, and has no precedential value. Appellant's Brief was filed before the Appellate Court of Illinois granted its petition for rehearing and its 2018 opinion reversing the trial court.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"14\">\n    <p id=\"p-218\">\n     <em>\n      See supra\n     </em>\n     note 12.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"15\">\n    <p id=\"p-219\">\n     As we explain,\n     <em>\n      infra\n     </em>\n     , in connection with our discussion of Kissinger's policies, under Missouri law, policy provisions purporting to permit reduction of available UIM coverage by amounts paid from other liability insurance have been found to be ambiguous, and thus limited in their effect to permitting amounts paid from other liability insurance to reduce the total damages incurred to determine the net amount against which available UIM coverage can be recovered.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"16\">\n    <p id=\"p-220\">\n     Consistent with that requirement, the underinsured motorist endorsement to Kitchen's policies provides:\n    </p>\n    <blockquote id=\"p-221\">\n     The limits of liability of this coverage will be reduced by ... [a] payment made or amount payable by or on behalf of any person or organization which may be legally liable, or under any collectible auto liability insurance, for loss caused by an accident with an underinsured motor vehicle.\n    </blockquote>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"17\">\n    <p id=\"p-222\">\n     <em>\n      See supra\n     </em>\n     note 6.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"18\">\n    <p id=\"p-223\">\n     As noted,\n     <em>\n      supra\n     </em>\n     , when Kissinger's policies were first issued, the UIM coverage endorsement was on policy form \"7/91.\" However, at some point, the UIM coverage endorsement to Kissinger's polices was changed to a \"12/04\" policy form.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"19\">\n    <p id=\"p-224\">\n     The trial court supported this conclusion by noting that American Family's later modification of its UIM coverage endorsement policy form in \"8/09\" constituted evidence that American Family recognized that the other insurance provision in the \"12/04\" UIM coverage endorsement policy form remained ambiguous. This rationale is flawed for two reasons. First, there is no authority for the proposition that an insurer's change in a standard policy form supports the inference that the insurer believed its earlier form to be ambiguous. In addition, the \"8/09\" UIM endorsement policy form added a new subsection to the other insurance provision that simply restates the \"two or more policies\" anti-stacking language found in the general provisions of the base policy form. The second subsection in the other insurance provision of the \"8/09\" UIM coverage endorsement policy form is\n     <strong>\n      <em>\n       identical\n      </em>\n     </strong>\n     the other insurance provision in the \"12/04\" UIM endorsement policy form. In other words, the key language at issue in determining whether Kissinger's policies are ambiguous did not change when the Insurers modified the UIM coverage endorsement policy form in \"8/09.\"\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
