Pinkerton had raised one specific claim against the delegation provision - that it was unconscionable to delegate threshold determinations to an arbitrator. The Court found that argument to be without merit. Though Pinkerton claimed he had raised other challenges specific to the delegation provision, the Court found his arguments, in effect, were challenges to the Agreement as a whole, regardless of how he had worded them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Just as the relator did in\n   <em>\n    Pinkerton\n   </em>\n   , Soars has attempted to circumvent this Court's and the United State Supreme Court's holding that a party must specifically challenge a delegation provision to avoid its application.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Soars asserted in the circuit court that both the delegation provision and the Agreement lack mutual obligations due to their questionable application to claims by other employees against him. This was not a specific challenge to the delegation provision, nor does the argument have any merit. The Agreement as a whole prescribes arbitration for \"any such claims against Easter-Seals Midwest and/or its current or former employees.\" ESM notes in its brief that all ESM employees are required to sign arbitration agreements before working - meaning every employee is required to bring its claims against the company and/or current or former employees in arbitration. Therefore, both the delegation provision and the Agreement would apply to any claims brought by other employees or the company itself against Soars regarding employment disputes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   He also contended in the circuit court that both the delegation provision and the Agreement lack mutual obligations because ESM reserves for itself the right to bring its most likely claims in Court against Soars. Not only was this challenge not specific to the delegation provision, it also does not apply to it. The delegation clause is clear it applies to \"any dispute\" regarding \"the interpretation, applicability, enforceability[,] or formation\" of the Agreement, and the wording does not indicate any party- or claim-specific application of the delegation provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Lastly, and most notably, Soars contended in the circuit court there was no consideration for either the Agreement or the delegation provision. Whether this could be construed as a challenge specific to the delegation clause is for another day. Assuming,\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   , it was a specific challenge, the argument fails. The delegation provision is supported by adequate consideration because the provision, severed from the rest of the Agreement and considered by itself, is a bilateral contract supported by consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   A contract consisting of mutual promises to undertake some legal duty or liability between parties is a bilateral contract.\n   <em>\n    Baker v.
