In his sole point on appeal, he contends that the trial court abused its discretion in sustaining the State's objection to a witness's testimony regarding prior inconsistent statements of another witness. Because a published opinion would have no precedential value, a memorandum has been provided to the parties. The judgment of convictions is affirmed. Rule 30.25(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
