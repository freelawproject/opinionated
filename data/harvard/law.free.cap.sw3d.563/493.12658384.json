Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On June 13, 2016, after Appellant Latricia Tyler's spouse called 911 to report a domestic disturbance involving complainant Pauletta Petitt, Fort Worth Police Officer Douglas Bengal and another officer were dispatched at around 3:07 p.m. They arrived separately at the scene at around 3:21 p.m. and spoke with Petitt, Petitt's spouse, and Tyler's spouse and son. Tyler had already left the scene. Upon concluding his domestic disturbance investigation, Officer Bengal moved his vehicle into a vacant school parking lot around 450 feet away to put his notes into the vehicle's computer. While inputting his notes, he saw a Buick, which he had been told Tyler drove, arrive, and a woman he identified at trial as Tyler run toward Petitt and body slam her. Officer Bengal testified that he saw the encounter through the chain-link fence that surrounded the school parking lot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A jury convicted Tyler of misdemeanor assault causing bodily injury. After assessing a 180-day sentence and fine, the trial court suspended Tyler's sentence, reduced the fine, and placed her on 24 months' probation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2012.21\">\n    Tex.

The trial court also assessed $260 in court costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In three points, Tyler complains that the evidence is insufficient to support her conviction, that the trial court abused its discretion when it admitted inadmissible evidence, and that code of criminal procedure article 102.008(a) is unconstitutional with regard to $25 assessed as part of her court costs for a district attorney's fee.

The court further explained,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Without concrete examples, it can be difficult to differentiate between inferences and speculation, and between drawing multiple reasonable inferences versus drawing a series of factually unsupported speculations. This hypothetical might help clarify the difference. A woman is seen standing in an office holding a smoking gun. There is a body with a gunshot wound on the floor near her. Based on these two facts, it is reasonable to infer that the woman shot the gun (she is holding the gun, and it is still smoking). Is it also reasonable to infer that she shot the person on the floor? To\n   make that determination, other factors must be taken into consideration. If she is the only person in the room with a smoking gun, then it is reasonable to infer that she shot the person on the floor. But, if there are other people with smoking guns in the room, absent other evidence of her guilt, it is not reasonable to infer that she was the shooter. No rational juror should find beyond a reasonable doubt that she was the shooter, rather than any of the other people with smoking guns. To do so would require impermissible speculation. But, what if there is also evidence that the other guns in the room are toy guns and cannot shoot bullets? Then, it would be reasonable to infer that no one with a toy gun was the shooter. It would also be reasonable to infer that the woman holding the smoking gun was the shooter. This would require multiple inferences based upon the same set of facts, but they are reasonable inferences when looking at the evidence. We first have to infer that she shot the gun. This is a reasonable inference because she is holding the gun, and it is still smoking. Next, we have to infer that she shot the person on the floor. This inference is based in part on the original inference that she shot the gun, but is also a reasonable inference drawn from the circumstances.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8329935\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/214/9/#p15\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8329935\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/214/9/#p15\">\n    at 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Officer Bengal had previously testified that he watched Tyler run toward Petitt, bodily slam into her, and knock her about before a fight ensued.
