House Bill No. 1631 repealed the text of section 115.427 of the Missouri Revised Statutes, and replaced it with new text. Under the newly effective provisions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   Persons seeking to vote in a public election shall establish their identity and eligibility to vote at the polling place by presenting a form of personal identification to election officials. No form of personal identification other than the forms listed in this section shall be accepted to establish a voter's qualifications to vote. Forms of personal identification that satisfy the requirements of this section are any one of the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   (1) Nonexpired Missouri driver's license;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (2) Nonexpired or nonexpiring Missouri nondriver's license;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (3) A document that satisfies all of the following requirements:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (a) The document contains the name of the individual to whom the document was issued, and the name substantially conforms to the most recent signature in the individual's voter registration record;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (b) The document shows a photograph of the individual;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (c) The document includes an expiration date, and the document is not expired, or, if expired, the document expired after the date of the most recent general election; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (d) The document was issued by the United States or the state of Missouri;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (4) Any identification containing a photograph of the individual which is issued by the Missouri National Guard, the United States armed forces, or the United States Department of Veteran Affairs to a member or former member of the Missouri National Guard or the United States armed forces and that is not expired or does not have an expiration date.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00a7 115.427.1. The statute permits persons without the listed forms of identification to cast regular or provisional ballots in certain circumstances, described in sections 115.427.2 through .4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In addition to requiring a voter to establish his or her qualifications to vote by presenting a satisfactory form of personal identification prior to voting in person, section 115.427 imposes obligations upon the Secretary of State, the Department of Revenue, and other government agencies and entities. Section 115.427.5 requires the Secretary of State to:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   provide advance notice of the personal identification requirements of subsection 1 of this section in a manner calculated\n   to inform the public generally of the requirement for forms of personal identification as provided in this section. Such advance notice shall include, at a minimum, the use of advertisements and public service announcements in print, broadcast television, radio, and cable television media, as well as the posting of information on the opening pages of the official state internet websites of the secretary of state and governor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Section 115.427.6(1) requires the State and all fee offices to \"provide one nondriver's license at no cost to any otherwise qualified voter who does not already possess such identification and who desires the identification in order to vote.\" The State and its agencies are further required to:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   provide one copy of each of the following, free of charge, if needed by an individual seeking to obtain a form of personal identification described in subsection 1 of this section in order to vote:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (a) A birth certificate;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (b) A marriage license or certificate;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (c) A divorce decree;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (d) A certificate of decree of adoption;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (e) A court order changing the person's name;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   (f) A social security card reflecting an updated name; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   (g) Naturalization papers or other documents from the United States Department of State proving citizenship.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Any individual seeking one of the above documents in order to obtain a form of personal identification described in subsection 1 of this section in order to vote may request the secretary of state to facilitate the acquisition of such documents. The secretary of state shall pay any fee or fees charged by another state or its agencies, or any court of competent jurisdiction in this state or any other state, or the federal government or its agencies, in order to obtain any of the above documents from such state or the federal government.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00a7 115.427.6(2). Furthermore:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Any applicant who requests a nondriver's license for the purpose of voting shall not be required to pay a fee if the applicant executes a statement, under penalty of perjury, averring that the applicant does not have any other form of personal identification that meets the requirements of this section. The [S]tate of Missouri shall pay the legally required fees for any such applicant. The director of the department of revenue shall design a statement to be used for this purpose. The total cost associated with nondriver's license photo identification under this subsection shall be borne by the [S]tate of Missouri from funds appropriated to the department of revenue for that specific purpose. The department of revenue and a local election authority may enter into a contract that allows the local election authority to assist the department in issuing nondriver's license photo identifications.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00a7 115.427.6(4). Section 115.427.6(3) provides that \"[a]ll costs associated with the implementation of this section shall be reimbursed from the general revenue of this state by an appropriation for that purpose. If there is not a\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     sufficient appropriation\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   of state funds,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     then the personal identification requirements\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   of subsection 1 of this section\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     shall not be enforced\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On June 8, 2017, MoNAACP and MoLWV filed a petition for injunctive and declaratory relief against the State, the Secretary of State, and the Board of Election Commissioners for the City of St. Louis. Count I alleged that section 115.427 was unenforceable because the General\n   Assembly did not appropriate sufficient state funds from the general revenue for the purpose of paying the costs associated with the statute's implementation. Count II alleged that section 115.427 violated article X, sections 16 and 21 of the Missouri Constitution (the Hancock Amendment) by requiring new or expanded activities by local election authorities without full state financing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On June 30, 2017, MoNAACP and MoLWV filed a first amended petition, adding Christine Dragonette, a resident of St. Louis and director of the state-issued-personal-identification acquisition program at St. Francis Xavier College Church, as a plaintiff, and naming as defendants the State, the Secretary of State, and the Director of the Department of Revenue. Appellants added a third count for specific performance, alleging that Respondents \"have not carried out necessary activities to ensure that the statute is implemented as intended.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On August 29, 2017, the Secretary of State moved to dismiss the first amended petition, and the State and the Director of the Department of Revenue moved for judgment on the pleadings. On October 10, 2017, Appellants dismissed Counts II (Hancock Amendment) and III (specific performance) of their amended petition. On November 9, 2017, the trial court held a hearing on the remaining count of the amended petition (the allegation that section 115.427 cannot be enforced because there were insufficient appropriations to comply with the statute), heard the arguments of counsel, and took the matter under advisement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   On November 22, 2017, Appellants moved for leave to file a second amended petition. On December 6, 2017, the trial court entered judgment, granting the Secretary of State's motion to dismiss, granting the State's motion for judgment on the pleadings, granting the Director of Revenue's motion for judgment on the pleadings, dismissing the first amended petition without prejudice, and granting Appellants leave to file their second amended petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In the second amended petition, Appellants more specifically alleged\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   that the legislature had not provided a sufficient appropriation of state funds from the general revenue for the purpose of paying the costs associated with the implementation of section 115.427 relating to state and federal 2018 elections. Appellants requested that the trial court enter a declaratory judgment that the identification requirements of section 115.427.1 may not be enforced and issue a permanent injunction prohibiting the State from enforcing section 115.427.1. They alleged that for implementation of section 115.427 in Fiscal Year 2017, $80,000 of general revenue funds were appropriated to the Department of Revenue, and no funds were appropriated to the Secretary of State. Furthermore, they alleged that for implementation of section 115.427 for Fiscal Year 2018, $1.5 million had been appropriated to the Secretary of State, and $100,000 had been appropriated to the Department of Revenue. They alleged that no funds were appropriated to any other agency of the State, to the courts, or to any political subdivision to implement section 115.427 in\n   Fiscal Year 2018-from general revenue or any other source-and there had been no supplemental appropriations related to the implementation of section 115.427 for Fiscal Year 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Appellants asserted that the legislature failed to provide a sufficient appropriation of state funds from the general revenue for the purpose of paying the costs associated with the implementation of section 115.427, resulting in an inadequate implementation of the statute. Specifically, Appellants contended that the Secretary of State failed to provide advance notice under the specific terms set forth under section 115.427.5, resulting in the general public not receiving adequate advance notice of the Voter ID Law. Further, Appellants alleged that, based on the stated appropriation of state funds, the Secretary of State would be unable to pay for the cost of the documents necessary for individuals to obtain nondriver's licenses in the State of Missouri.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   According to Appellants, the Secretary of State and Department of Revenue's combined expressly mandated and reasonably necessary implementation costs would total nearly $6 million, which is more than 350% of the actual appropriation. Appellants alleged that they have been and will be required to shift their resources to do for their members and the public what section 115.427 mandates that the State do. Appellants asserted that because the appropriation to implement section 115.427 was insufficient, under section 115.427.6(3), \"then the personal identification requirements of subsection 1 of this section shall not be enforced.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Secretary of State and the State each filed answers and moved for judgment on the pleadings. The Secretary of State asserted that the trial court should dismiss the second amended petition because it failed to state a claim and was not ripe for adjudication. The Secretary of State argued that \"plaintiffs have failed to allege actual costs of implementation,\" and the claim that appropriations for Voter ID implementation were insufficient to reimburse costs was not ripe until either: (1) actual costs exceeded current appropriations for Fiscal Year 2018; or (2) actual costs for Fiscal Year 2018 were not reimbursed by appropriations for Fiscal Year 2018, which runs from July 1, 2017, to June 30, 2018. The Secretary of State further asserted that local election authorities (\"LEAs\"), none of which were named as a defendant, were necessary and indispensable parties if injunctive relief was sought to prohibit enforcement of the Voter ID Law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The State also asserted that the trial court should dismiss the second amended petition because it failed to state a claim and was not ripe for adjudication. The State argued that the Voter ID Law does not require the State to pay for anticipated costs of implementation up front; instead, according to the State, section 115.427.6(3) bars enforcement of the voter identification requirements only if there was not a sufficient appropriation of state funds to reimburse costs associated with implementation of the Voter ID Law, and Appellants failed to allege facts showing that the General Assembly made an insufficient appropriation of state funds to reimburse costs associated with implementation. The State further asserted that sovereign immunity precluded claims against it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Thereafter, on January 2, 2018, the trial court entered judgment, finding that \"the Second Amended Petition fails to state a claim for which relief can be granted and Defendants are entitled to judgment as a matter of law,\" granting Respondents' motions for judgment on the\n   pleadings, and dismissing Appellants' second amended petition without prejudice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Appellants timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The appellate court conducts a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review of a trial court's grant of a motion for judgment on the pleadings based on the failure to state a claim.\n   <em>\n    Lake v.

Appellants further alleged that the Secretary of State is the State's chief elections official and is responsible for the implementation across the State of laws related to voting, including section 115.427, and for enforcing the photo ID requirements of section 115.427.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In 1977, the Missouri Supreme Court prospectively abrogated the common law doctrine of sovereign immunity for tort actions in\n   <em>\n    Jones v.

Missouri voters must take action, but incur no costs, in order to secure their ability to vote. The statute provides that, if there is not \"a sufficient appropriation of state funds\" to pay \"[a]ll costs associated with the implementation of this section,\" then the personal identification requirements \"shall not be enforced.\" Notably, section 115.427.6(3) makes the enforceability of the identification requirements contingent on \"a sufficient appropriation,\"\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   on \"sufficient\n   <em>\n    implementation\n   </em>\n   \" of the statute by the Secretary of State or other agencies. We conclude that the sufficiency of appropriations to cover the costs of implementing the Voter ID Law presents a ripe controversy without awaiting the Respondents' actual incurrence of costs to implement the statute, or the conclusion of the fiscal year to which the appropriations apply. As we explain below in our discussion of whether the petition adequately states a claim for relief, appropriations are\n   <em>\n    forward-looking\n   </em>\n   authorizations for the expenditure of funds by state agencies; we fail to see why the sufficiency of all or any appropriations could only be addressed after all appropriated funds have actually been expended. The possibility of additional appropriations not yet enacted does not affect the ripeness of a challenge to earlier appropriations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Respondents cite the Missouri Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Schweich v.

In\n   <em>\n    Schweich\n   </em>\n   , the State Auditor challenged the Governor's withholding of certain funds from the legislative appropriation to the Auditor's office. The Supreme Court held that the challenge to the Governor's withholding decision was not ripe until the end of the fiscal year.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7091348\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/408/769/#p778\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7091348\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/408/769/#p778\">\n    at 779\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

This case is distinguishable: here, it is undeniable that the General Assembly has actually made its appropriations to the Secretary of State's office, and the enforcement of the Voter ID Law's identification requirements is expressly made contingent on the sufficiency of those appropriations. Awaiting the end of a fiscal year before assessing the adequacy of a particular appropriation would potentially permit the identification requirements to be enforced in elections where funding was insufficient to adequately implement the law, contrary to the evident intent of section 115.427.6(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Thus, Appellants' claims are not precluded based on the ground that Appellants' suit is not ripe for adjudication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    Necessary and Indispensable Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The final threshold issue we address concerns whether Appellants failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted on the ground raised by the Secretary of State that LEAs were necessary and indispensable parties for purposes of enjoining the identification provisions of the Voter ID Law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In the second amended petition, Appellants alleged that the State is the entity responsible for the implementation and enforcement of section 115.427, including the statute's restriction on the ways that registered voters must identify themselves in order to exercise their right to vote in person, and the statute's provision of free nondriver's licenses and underlying documents for voters who lack them.

The relief was\n   not directed to the LEAs. In neither the motion for judgment on the pleadings nor the motion to dismiss did the Secretary of State explain why injunctive relief could not be granted without the LEAs as parties or why a declaratory judgment that the identification requirements of the statute were unenforceable would not be binding on the LEAs.
