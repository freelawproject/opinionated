App.-Amarillo 2004, no pet.) (op. on reh'g).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Relying on this exception-the breadth of which goes well beyond offering harmless amusement at Chuck E. Cheese's\u00ae-Stephannie Lynn Rylie, Texas C&amp;D Amusements, Inc., and Brian and Lisa Scott d/b/a TSCA and d/b/a River Bottom Pub (collectively, the Operators) own, buy, sell, lease, maintain, transport, store, and exhibit electronic gaming machines commonly known as \"eight-liners\" at various Fort Worth locations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Unhappy about the less-than-wholesome clientele attracted to playing eight-liners, the Fort Worth City Council passed two ordinances in late 2014 aimed at regulating these machines and the businesses that house them. In response, the Operators sued the City of Fort Worth and its city manager, seeking to have the ordinances declared invalid because (1) they are preempted by, or are in conflict with, state law-in particular, the Texas Occupations Code and the Alcoholic Beverage Code-and (2) they violate the Texas constitution's substantive-due-course-of-law provisions. The City counterclaimed seeking to have the fuzzy-animal exception declared unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After both sides moved for summary judgment, the trial court declared portions of the ordinances invalid because they conflict with state law, but denied the remaining requested relief. Both the City and the Operators have appealed. We will affirm in part and reverse and render in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Operators' eight-liner machines resemble slot machines and operate solely or at least predominately by chance. To start things off, a player inserts cash into the machine, and the machine records the corresponding number of credits. After the player chooses the number of credits he wants to play, the machine reduces the credits accordingly. The player then starts a random \"spin\" by pushing a button. Depending on the machine, either the spinning automatically stops or the player can stop the spinning by pressing a button. The player wins by matching electronic symbols in one of eight (or more) lines on the screen-three horizontal, three vertical, or two diagonal. For each win, the\n   machine records the number of credits won.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   When a player has had enough, the machine dispenses tickets or coupons corresponding to the number of credits the player has won, if any. Depending on the location, a player can redeem his tickets or coupons for a prize from a redemption book,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   a prize from a redemption counter,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   or the right of replay.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   According to the City, businesses that operate eight-liner machines \"can have a deleterious effect on both the existing businesses around them and the surrounding residential areas adjacent to them, causing increased crime,\" and \"have objectionable operational characteristics ... contributing to urban blight and downgrading the quality of life in the adjacent area.\" In an effort to \"minimize and to control these adverse effects and thereby protect the health, safety, and welfare of the citizenry,\" to \"protect citizens from increased crime,\" to \"deter the spread of urban blight,\" and to preserve \"quality of life,\" property values, and the \"character of surrounding neighborhoods,\" the Fort Worth City Council passed two ordinances in October 2014: Ordinance No. 21499-10-2014 (the Zoning Ordinance) and Ordinance No. 21500-10-2014 (the Licensing Ordinance).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Both ordinances regulate \"amusement redemption machines\" and \"game rooms\" within the City's limits. A \"game room,\" as the ordinances define one, is \"a building, facility or other place where one or more amusement redemption machines are present.\" With carve-outs not relevant here except to note that Chuck E. Cheese's- and Main Event-type businesses are unaffected, the ordinances define an \"amusement redemption machine\" as\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   any electronic, electromechanical, or mechanical contrivance, including sweepstakes machines, designed, made, and adapted solely for bona fide amusement purposes, and that by operation of chance or a combination of skill affords the user, in addition[ ] to any right of replay, an opportunity to receive exclusively non-cash merchandise prizes, toys, or novelties, or a representation of a value redeemable for those items and is in compliance with Section 47.01(4)(b) of the Texas Penal Code [the fuzzy-animal exception].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The parties agree that the Operators' machines are \"amusement redemption machines.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Among other things, both ordinances place zoning restrictions on game rooms that confine them to industrial-zoned areas; prohibit them from operating within 1,000 feet of a residential district, church, school, hospital, or another game room; and limit the number of game rooms allowed on any lot or in any single building, structure, or strip center. And unless a game room is already licensed under the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Code for the sale, purchase, possession, or consumption of \"alcoholic beverages\" (as the code defines that term) the ordinances prohibit the sale, etc. of alcoholic beverages in such a location. Particular to the Licensing Ordinance, operators of game rooms and amusement-redemption machines must obtain\n   a license from the City. That ordinance also imposes an inspection and license fee on game-room operators; levies an occupation tax on each amusement-redemption machine; allows the City to seal any amusement-redemption machine for which the occupation tax or license fee has not been paid; and authorizes the City to charge a fee to unseal the machine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Soon after the City Council passed the ordinances, the Operators sued the City seeking a declaration that the Zoning and Licensing Ordinances (along with an associated fee schedule, Ordinance No. 21631-02-2015, which was passed several months later) are void because Texas Occupations Code chapter 2153-a statute governing the licensing, taxing, and regulation of (among other things) skill or pleasure coin-operated machines-preempts the ordinances completely or, alternatively, preempts them to the extent that chapter 2153 and the ordinances conflict.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202153.001\">\n    Tex. Occ. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 2153.001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -.453 (West 2012) (\"Coin-Operated Machines\"). The Operators also sought a declaration that the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Code preempts the ordinances' restrictions on the sale, purchase, possession, and consumption of alcohol.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%201.06\">\n    Tex.

The City counterclaimed seeking to have penal code section 47.01(4)(B) -the fuzzy-animal exception-declared unconstitutional, arguing that it violates article III, section 47 of the Texas constitution by allowing forbidden \"lotteries.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex. Const. art. III, \u00a7 47 ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2047.01\">\n    Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 47.01\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Both sides moved for summary judgment as a matter of law on their respective declaratory-relief requests. The trial court granted the Operators' motion in part and denied it in part. In particular, the trial court determined that some of the ordinances' zoning and sealing-fee provisions conflicted with and were preempted by occupations code chapter 2153. But the trial court denied the balance of the Operators' motion, including their claims that chapter 2153\n   <em>\n    completely\n   </em>\n   preempts the ordinances, and that the alcoholic-beverage code preempts the ordinances' alcohol restrictions. The trial court also denied the City's summary-judgment motion on its counterclaim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   While the case was pending in the trial court, the Texas Supreme Court issued\n   <em>\n    Patel v. Texas Department of Licensing &amp; Regulation\n   </em>\n   , in which the court set out the elements for an as-applied challenge to an economic-regulation statute under the Texas constitution's substantive-due-course-of-law requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6839420\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/469/69/#p87\">\n    469 S.W.3d 69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 87 (Tex. 2015) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Tex. Const. art. I, \u00a7 19. Relying on\n   <em>\n    Patel\n   </em>\n   , the Operators supplemented their petition to include an as-applied challenge to the ordinances, alleging that they violate the Texas constitution's substantive-due-course-of-law provision and requesting a declaration that the ordinances are therefore invalid.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex. Const. art. I, \u00a7 19. After the Operators filed that supplement, the City successfully moved for summary judgment on no-evidence grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The parties tried their competing claims for attorney's fees and costs to the bench. The trial court denied all attorney's-fees claims,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   rendered a final judgment incorporating\n   its summary-judgment rulings, and denied relief on the City's counterclaim. In this latter regard, the trial court also found \"as a matter of law\" that penal code section 47.01(4)(B) is constitutional. Both sides have appealed from this judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    The Operators' Preemption Claims and the City's Counterclaim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   As noted, the trial court partially granted and partially denied the Operators' summary-judgment motion on their preemption claims and denied the City's counterclaim seeking to have the fuzzy-animal exception declared unconstitutional. In its posture as appellant, in two issues the City complains that the trial court erred by partially granting the Operators' motion and declaring that the occupation code's chapter 2153 partially preempts the ordinances. In their own first two issues, as cross-appellants, the Operators contend that the trial court erred by declaring that chapter 2153 does not\n   <em>\n    completely\n   </em>\n   preempt the ordinances and by determining that the alcoholic-beverage code does not in any way preempt the ordinances' alcohol restrictions. The Operators also argue that the trial court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over the City's counterclaim because it did not present a justiciable controversy and thus that the trial court erred by entering any substantive holding related to that counterclaim rather than dismissing it for want of jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

As they did below, the Operators claim in their first issue that this language evinces the Legislature's intent to exclusively regulate such machines, and that based on complete-preemption principles, the City's ordinances thus overstepped what a municipality may do.
