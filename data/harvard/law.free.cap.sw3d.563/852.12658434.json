Edwards appeals the denial of her amended Rule 24.035 motion which alleged ineffective assistance of counsel because\n   trial counsel told her that if she went to trial she would likely be convicted and receive a sentence of 15 to 25 years, causing her to plead guilty in exchange for a 10 year sentence out of fear that she would receive a higher sentence if she went to trial. The motion court found that Edwards's guilty plea was not coerced. Finding no error, we affirm. Rule 84.16(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
