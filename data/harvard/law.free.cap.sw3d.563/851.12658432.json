He contends that the trial court erred in (1) overruling his\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   challenge to the prosecutor's peremptory strike of a venireperson and (2) overruling his motion to dismiss the felony murder charge under the merger doctrine. Because a published opinion would have no precedential value, a memorandum has been provided to the parties. The judgment of convictions is affirmed. Rule 30.25(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
