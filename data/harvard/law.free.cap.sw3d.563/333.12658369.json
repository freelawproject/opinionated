Alvarez, Justice\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This is a personal injury case arising out of an automobile accident involving a bull that escaped its enclosure and wandered onto the highway where appellant Joshua Garcia was driving. Garcia sued Pruski, alleging he was responsible for the bull wandering onto the highway. After the trial court granted appellee Shary Pruski's traditional and no-evidence motion for summary judgment and rendered a final judgment, Garcia timely appealed. We affirm the judgment in part, reverse the judgment in part, and remand the case for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Garcia was injured when the vehicle he was driving collided with a bull on State Highway 123 in Wilson County. Garcia filed suit against Pruski, who owned the bull and the land from which the bull escaped, alleging he was negligent in various ways. Pruski filed a traditional and no-evidence motion for summary judgment. Both the no-evidence grounds and the traditional grounds challenged the elements of Garcia's negligence claims: the existence of a legal duty, breach, and proximate cause. Pruski filed a supplement to his summary judgment motion, and produced additional evidence in support thereof. After Garcia filed a response, the trial court signed an order granting Pruski's motion for summary judgment. The trial court's order stated it was a final judgment as to all claims and parties. Garcia timely perfected this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"We review the grant of [a] summary judgment de novo.\"\n   <em>\n    Katy Venture, Ltd. v.

For clarity, the \"stock law provisions\" refer to the provisions of chapter 143, subchapter D, that authorize a county to adopt a stock law and opt into additional statutory regulations regarding certain classes of animals roaming at large.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX.

Under Pruski's construction, a person in a county that has adopted a stock law would violate section 143.072 by negligently permitting a bull to roam at large anywhere in the county. But if the roaming bull were to step onto the right-of-way of any highway in the county, the person would be relieved of his statutory duty under section 143.072. According to Pruski's position, the statutory duty that such a bull-owner owes would change based on where the bull was standing at the time of the accident. We do not find Pruski's position persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    9.\n   </em>\n   Harlow v.

Conclusion Regarding a Duty Under the Stock Law Provisions\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Based on the foregoing, we conclude that section 143.102 does not conflict with chapter 143's stock law provisions and hold that Garcia produced some evidence showing Pruski owed a duty under the stock law provisions of chapter 143, in addition to the duty imposed by section 143.102. We must next determine whether Garcia produced any evidence showing Pruski breached his statutory duty under section 143.102 and the stock law provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Breach of Duty\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   To show that Pruski violated both section 143.102 and the stock law provisions, Garcia relies on the same evidence. In addition to the 2010 Proclamation, the relevant evidence that Garcia attached to his summary judgment response included Pruski's sworn responses to Garcia's interrogatories and excerpts from the depositions of Pruski; responding officer, State Trooper Jack Johnson, II; Pruski's nephew Clint Garza; and Pruski's brothers-in-law Lloyd Pruski and Rick Scheffler.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <em>\n    1. Summary of the Relevant Summary Judgment Evidence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Pruski swore in his verified responses to Garcia's interrogatories that he kept the bull in question on his property located along State Highway 123. Pruski swore his property is 37 acres, and that he has a six-strand barbed wire fence around the property. He stated that he received a call informing him that his bull might have been hit on the road. Pruski further swore the bull was killed in the accident, and that he found the bull \"in the bar ditch\" south of a gate on his property. Pruski stated he \"th[ought] the bull got spooked and broke the latch,\" and that the distance between the field/pasture where the bull in question had escaped from and State Highway 123 was approximately \"30 feet to the highway and about 30 yards south of the gate.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Pruski testified during his deposition that he owned the bull involved in the collision. He stated the bull was five years old and weighed about 2,000 pounds. Pruski further stated the bull had escaped by breaking the latch on the gate. He stated he had a lock on the gate, but the gate was not locked when the bull broke the latch. He also testified he did not have a cattle guard on his property, and the purpose of the cattle guard is to prevent cattle from escaping. Pruski stated that if the bull would not have escaped, Garcia would not have been injured. Pruski also testified he never had a head of cattle escape from the property except for once, eight years prior, when the gate was left open. Pruski testified that, on that occasion, a head of cattle wandered onto State Highway 123 and was struck and killed by a truck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Garza testified during his deposition that he went with Pruski to look at the gate after the accident. Garza testified Pruski \"always keeps it locks [sic] because he's paranoid about cows getting on the roadway.\" According to Garza, Pruski told him that instead of keeping the gate locked on the date of the accident and giving his contractor a key, Pruski used a latch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Pruski's brother-in-law Lloyd testified during his deposition that Pruski usually left the gate locked, but on the day of the accident, Pruski had left the gate unlocked to allow a contractor onto the property. Lloyd also testified that Pruski had left a latch on the gate on the day of the accident. He stated he went back to Pruski's property possibly two or three days after the accident and the gate was locked. Lloyd explained that there is a chain on the gate, and the chain can be held together with either a lock or a latch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Another one of Pruski's brothers-in-law, Rick Scheffler, testified the bull involved in the collision was Pruski's bull, and that he went to the scene of the accident. He stated he saw Garcia sitting upright on a gurney and standing, and he was glad Garcia was not seriously injured. He further stated the damage to Garcia's car was severe. Scheffler testified Pruski disposed of the bull by dragging it somewhere away from the scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Trooper Johnson testified during his deposition that the damage to Garcia's car was a seven on a scale of one to seven, with seven being the most severe. He further testified that when a car accident involves such a degree of damage to the vehicle, there is more often than not some injury involved. Trooper Johnson's crash report contained a brief description of a car hitting a bull on State Highway 123.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <em>\n    2.

The issue on appeal was not whether the trial court misconstrued \"knowingly\" under section 143.102, but whether the evidence supported the finding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9974701\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/613/581/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9974701\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/613/581/\">\n    at 582-83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the courts of appeals in\n   <em>\n    Goode\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Weaver\n   </em>\n   did not address the propriety of construing \"knowingly\" in section 143.102 as \"knew or should have known.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9974701\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/613/581/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <em>\n    3.

Garcia relies on the following evidence: (1) Pruski knew a head of cattle had escaped on a previous occasion when the gate was left open; (2) Pruski always kept the gate locked because he believed cattle would get out if the gate was not locked; and (3) Pruski used a latch, and did not use the lock, on the date of the accident.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   This evidence does not support a reasonable inference that Pruski was aware his bull had broken the latch and wandered onto the highway. We hold Garcia failed to produce summary judgment evidence sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact that Pruski knowingly permitted the bull to traverse or roam at large, unattended on a highway. We therefore affirm the trial court's judgment as it relates to Garcia's allegation that Pruski was negligent by violating section 143.102.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <em>\n    4.

Garcia's evidence also shows the bull escaped after Pruski left the gate latched but unlocked in order for his contractor to enter the property without a key. This evidence shows that it was a natural and continuous sequence of events from Pruski permitting the bull to roam outside of his property to the bull wandering onto State Highway 123 where Garcia's car collided with the bull.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9976149\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/819/470/#p471\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <em>\n    2.

We hold that Garcia produced some evidence showing a person of ordinary intelligence would have anticipated the danger to drivers on State Highway 123 that was created by Pruski negligently\n   permitting his bull to roam outside of the gate.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11417765\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/81/269/#p274\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   We conclude that Garcia produced evidence sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to all of the challenged, essential elements of his negligence claim based on Pruski's violation of the stock law provisions of chapter 143 of the Texas Agriculture Code. Because Garcia does not challenge on appeal the trial court's summary judgment as to any alleged breach of a common law duty and there is no evidence Pruski violated section 143.102, we must affirm the trial court's judgment to the extent it disposes of Garcia's claims based on a common law duty and a violation of section 143.102. We reverse the remainder of the trial court's judgment and remand this case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    With regard to the duty element of Garcia's negligence claims based on chapter 143, Pruski's position on appeal is that \"the only duty owed by ... Pruski to ... Garcia was the duty statutorily imposed by [section] 143.102.\" In other words, it is undisputed that Pruski owed Garcia a duty under section 143.102.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    Garcia also relies on Pruski's sworn interrogatory answer that identified Garza and Scheffler as individuals who helped Pruski search for escaped cattle before the accident in this case. We question whether the response was intended to be an admission that Pruski knew about his cattle escaping at any time before the accident. Even if it could be construed as such, it is unclear whether the reference to cattle escaping is to the prior incident years before the accident in this case or on the date of the accident. To the extent the interrogatory could raise a reasonable inference that Pruski knew his bull had escaped, the response is not evidence showing Pruski knowingly permitted the bull to roam at large on the highway's right of way and discovered those facts with sufficient time for Pruski's breach to have been the proximate cause of the accident.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    Pruski cites to conclusory summary judgment evidence which consisted of opinions, without explanation, that a cattle guard was unnecessary and using merely a latch was sufficient to keep cattle from escaping. We hold this does not conclusively negate the breach element of Garcia's claim.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    None of the evidence Pruski produced conclusively established the absence of vital facts that Garcia's evidence would support if the evidence is taken as true and if all favorable inferences are drawn in Garcia's favor.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Katy Venture\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6839482\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/469/160/#p163\">\n     469 S.W.3d at 163\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    We note that Pruski never expressly challenged that Garcia suffered no damages as a result of the collision with Pruski's bull. To the extent Pruski's motion could be construed as presenting such a ground for summary judgment, we note Garcia produced evidence that he was transported by EMS to an emergency room and that there was damage to Garcia's vehicle.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
