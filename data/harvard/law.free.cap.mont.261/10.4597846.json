We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">The following issues are raised on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">1. Did the District Court err in distributing the marital property?</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">2. Did the District Court err by declining to award attorney\u2019s fees and costs?</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">Dorothy Stout (Dorothy) and Thomas Gollehon (Thomas) were married on December 30, 1987. At Dorothy\u2019s request, they signed a premarital agreement on that date expressing their desire to \u201ckeep separate and apart\u201d their respective assets and obligations acquired either before or during the marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">Prior to the marriage, Dorothy resided on leased property referred to as the \u201cKreger Place\u201d near Fairfield, Montana, where she raised Tarentaise cattle. Dorothy characterized the Kreger lease as a \u201csweetheart deal,\u201d asserting that she was charged only one-third the cost of leasing comparable property and was also able to sublease a portion of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-9\">Dorothy moved her cattle onto Thomas\u2019 ranch, located eighteen miles from the Kreger Place, shortly after the marriage. She intended the cattle to remain there only for the winter and calving season, after which she would return them to the Kreger Place. However, Thomas insisted that she terminate the lease. Dorothy claims that Thomas made the forfeiture of the lease a condition for remaining married; Thomas asserts that she had agreed prior to the marriage to terminate the lease. In any event, Dorothy relinquished the lease in early 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-10\">Thomas informed Dorothy that he wanted a divorce in April of 1989. Two months later, Dorothy filed a petition to dissolve the marriage, asserting that it was irretrievably broken and requesting an equitable division of the marital assets and obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-11\">Dorothy subsequently determined that continuing to raise cattle was not feasible given the loss of the Kreger lease and the additional expense that would be involved in re-establishing her ranching operation. As a result, Dorothy sold her cattle at an auction sale held in October of 1989. Dorothy and Thomas formally separated later that month.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-12\">The District Court held a dissolution hearing on March 22, 1990. On September 25, 1991, the parties stipulated to allow the court to order the marriage dissolved pending later entry of the decree of dissolution. The court entered an order dissolving the marriage on November 1,1991 and filed its findings of fact, conclusions of law and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>dissolution decree on April 17, 1992. The court concluded that the parties were entitled to their individual assets and liabilities as of the termination of the marriage. The court also ordered that Dorothy and Thomas pay their own attorney\u2019s fees and costs. Dorothy appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">Did the District Court err in distributing the marital property?</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">The District Court found that Dorothy and Thomas had executed a premarital agreement at Dorothy\u2019s suggestion and concluded that the agreement was valid and enforceable. The court also made extensive findings concerning the factors set forth in \u00a7 40-4-202, MCA. Based on those findings, the court concluded that it was equitable for Dorothy and Thomas each to retain their own assets and liabilities as of the termination of the marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact relating to the division of marital property to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. <em>Marriage of Danelson </em>(1992), 253 Mont. 310, 317, 833 P.2d 215, 219. A district court, however, has no discretion in determining a question of law; thus, we review a court\u2019s conclusion of law to determine whether it is correct. <em>Danelson, </em>833 P.2d at 219-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">The bulk of Dorothy\u2019s asserted errors relate to the District Court\u2019s findings under \u00a7 40-4-202, MCA. She contends that a number of the findings were clearly erroneous because they were not supported by substantial evidence or reflect the court\u2019s misapprehension of the effect of the evidence. However, because the District Court\u2019s conclusion regarding the enforceability of the premarital agreement is dispositive if correct, we focus initially on that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">Dorothy challenges the enforcement of the premarital agreement on two grounds. First, she contends that she did not enter the agreement voluntarily because she did not know that Thomas would insist on the relinquishment of the Kreger lease. Second, Dorothy asserts that she did not know Thomas\u2019 financial situation when the agreement was executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-9\">Thomas and Dorothy executed their premarital agreement on December 30,1987. The Uniform Premarital Agreement Act(the Act), codified at \u00a7\u00a7 40-2-601 through -610, MCA, applies to premarital agreements executed on or after October 1,1987. 1987 Mont. Laws, Ch. 189, Sec. 17. Thus, the Act applies to the agreement before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-10\">Section 40-2-608, MCA, of the Act specifically governs the enforceability of premarital agreements. A premarital agreement may be set aside under subsection (1) of that statute if the party seeking to avoid the agreement proves that it was not executed voluntarily. The sole basis for Dorothy\u2019s claim regarding voluntary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>execution is her assertion that she did not know Thomas would insist on termination of the Kreger lease when she signed the agreement. Even if her assertion is true, Dorothy cites no authority to support her contention that a lack of knowledge concerning Thomas\u2019 future conduct renders her execution of the agreement involuntary. Furthermore, the record reflects that the premarital agreement was executed at her suggestion and drafted by her attorney. Thus, there is no merit to her contention that she did not enter into the agreement voluntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">Dorothy\u2019s assertion that she did not know the extent of Thomas\u2019 assets also provides no basis to preclude enforcement of the agreement under \u00a7 40-2-608, MCA. Aparty must prove that a premarital agreement was unconscionable when executed and that there was no fair and reasonable disclosure of the other party\u2019s property and financial obligations before the agreement can be set aside under \u00a7 40-2-608(2), MCA. Dorothy has not contended that the premarital agreement was unconscionable at the time of execution. Indeed, such a position would be untenable considering that the agreement was executed at her suggestion and drafted by her attorney. Thus, her assertion that she did not know the extent of Thomas\u2019 property is not a sufficient basis to set aside the agreement under \u00a7 40-2-608(2), MCA. We conclude that the District Court correctly concluded that Dorothy and Thomas\u2019 premarital agreement was valid and enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">We next turn to the terms of the agreement to ascertain the distribution of the marital property. The premarital agreement reflects Dorothy and Thomas\u2019 intent \u201cto keep separate and apart\u201d the assets and liabilities they individually acquired either prior to or after the marriage. The agreement expressly governs \u201cany rights that either might or could have as to the other or the property owned by the other by reason of said marriage.\u201d Furthermore, the premarital agreement contains Dorothy and Thomas\u2019 mutual waiver of all rights and interests in the other\u2019s property that they might acquire as a consequence of the marriage. Thus, according to the terms of the premarital agreement, Dorothy was not entitled to any share of Thomas\u2019 assets upon the dissolution of the marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">Dorothy contends that, even if the premarital agreement precludes her from obtaining an interest in Thomas\u2019 assets that might have arisen as a consequence of their marriage, it should not be construed to prevent her from obtaining damages resulting from the termination of the Kreger lease. Relying on 66 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Release </em>\u00a7 14 (1973), she asserts that a person cannot release another from liability arising out of the other\u2019s future acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>The obvious flaw in Dorothy\u2019s position is that the termination of the Kreger lease is not relevant to the distribution of property upon dissolution of the marriage. As discussed above, the distribution of the marital property is governed by the premarital agreement in which Dorothy waived all her rights and interest to Thomas\u2019 individually-owned assets acquired either before or during the marriage. Any appropriate action Dorothy may have for damages resulting from Thomas\u2019 insistence that she relinquish the lease is separate and apart from the dissolution proceeding and the distribution of the marital estate therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">Finally, we turn to Dorothy\u2019s alleged errors concerning the District Court\u2019s findings under \u00a7 40-4-202, MCA. She asserts that the findings did not take into account the financial detriment, including additional expenses and loss of future income, that she incurred as a result of Thomas\u2019 insistence that she terminate the Kreger lease. On that basis, she contends that an equitable distribution of the marital property requires that she be awarded, at a minimum, $36,837 from Thomas\u2019 assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">Prior to enactment of the Act, a premarital agreement was but one factor a district court was required to consider when distributing marital property under \u00a7 40-4-202, MCA (1985). <em>In re the Marriage of Johnston/Turrin </em>(1992), 255 Mont. 421, 425, 843 P.2d 760, 762. However, the legislature added subsection (5) to \u00a7 40-4-202, MCA, when it passed the Act; that subsection requires premarital agreements to be enforced as provided by the Act. Thus, where a premarital agreement is enforceable under the Act, the property distribution is governed by the agreement and not the factors set forth in \u00a7 40-4-202, MCA. Therefore, we do not address Dorothy\u2019s asserted errors relating to the court\u2019s findings regarding those factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">While the District Court erred in applying the \u00a7 40-4-202, MCA, factors rather than relying solely on the valid and enforceable premarital agreement, its distribution of the marital property was in accord with that premarital agreement. We hold that the District Court did not err in distributing the marital property.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">Did the District Court err by declining to award attorney\u2019s fees and costs?</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">Section 40-4-110, MCA, allows the district court to award attorney\u2019s fees and costs to either party in a dissolution action after considering the parties\u2019 respective financial resources. The district court has considerable discretion in making such an award. <em>In re the Marriage of Peetz </em>(1992), 252 Mont. 448, 453, 830 P.2d 543, 549. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>will not overturn a court\u2019s denial of attorney\u2019s fees absent an abuse of discretion. <em>In re the Marriage of Wackler </em>(1993), [258 Mont. 12], 850 P.2d 963, 966, 50 St.Rep. 406, 408.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">Dorothy asserts that the District Court\u2019s only finding concerning this issue was that she did not include a specific request in her pleadings. She also contends that her requests for \u201csuch other and further relief\u2019 in her petition and for attorney\u2019s fees in her proposed findings of fact, conclusions of law and decree were a sufficient basis for the court to award attorney\u2019s fees and costs. Finally, relying <em>on In re the Marriage of Johnsrud </em>(1978), 181 Mont. 544, 572 P.2d 902, Dorothy contends that the District Court has jurisdiction to make such an award even absent a specific request.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">Dorothy\u2019s assertion that the District Court limited its findings on attorney\u2019s fees to her failure to make a request is not supported by the record. In addition to that finding, the court found that she had not demonstrated an inability to pay her own attorney\u2019s fees and costs. According to the court\u2019s findings, Dorothy had sufficient income and assets from which to pay her own attorney\u2019s fees, including the proceeds of her cattle sale, \u2018loans\u201d or gifts from her father, jewelry and other personal property. The court also found that she had not established the amount and reasonableness of her attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">We conclude that the District Court did not err or abuse its discretion in declining to award attorney\u2019s fees and costs to Dorothy.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b40-8\">JUSTICES HARRISON, TRIEWEILER, NELSON and WEBER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
