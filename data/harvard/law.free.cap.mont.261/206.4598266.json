(Ford New Holland), appeals from ajudgment entered by the District Court for the Eighth Judicial District, Cascade County.

Ford New Holland appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">The issues are:</p>\n<p id=\"b232-10\">1. Did the District Court err by applying \u00a7\u00a7 30-11-802 and -803, MCA, to the Versatile Agreement?</p>\n<p id=\"b232-11\">2.

Did Ford New Holland breach the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing?</p>\n<p id=\"b232-13\">4. Did the District Court err in awarding damages?</p>\n<p id=\"b232-14\">5. Did the District Court err in awarding attorney fees?</p>\n<p id=\"b232-15\">Robert and Jean Van Riper (the Van Ripers), owned and operated Van\u2019s Tractor, Inc. (Van\u2019s Tractor), in Havre, Montana. Van\u2019s Tractor sold new and used tractors and other farm equipment. Van\u2019s Tractor entered a dealership agreement with Versatile Farm Equipment (Versatile) on November 2, 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-17\">In 1987, Versatile, then in bankruptcy, sold certain of its assets, including the Van\u2019s Tractor Versatile franchise, to Ford New Holland, a subsidiary of Ford Motor Company. Versatile sold other of its assets, including a Noble plow line, to Vicon Farm Equipment, Inc., a corporation unrelated to Ford New Holland. Van\u2019s Tractor decided not to continue selling Noble products and returned its supply of Noble parts to Vicon.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-18\">Corporate mergers resulted in Ford New Holland then having two outlets in Havre, Van\u2019s Tractor and an existing \u201ccompany store.\u201d The goal of Ford New Holland was to have one dealer in Havre. It sought a dealer who would buy out its interest in the company store. Van\u2019s Tractor was a prospective purchaser. However, Ford New Holland <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>determined that Van\u2019s Tractor would not be its full-line dealer in Havre. Ford New Holland did not notify Van\u2019s Tractor of this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">In the fall of 1987, Ford New Holland designated Van\u2019s Tractor for attrition as a Versatile dealer. The designation meant Van\u2019s Tractor could not transfer its Ford New Holland dealership and had no future as a Ford New Holland dealer. Ford New Holland did not notify Van\u2019s Tractor of this designation.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">From 1987 to 1988, the net worth of Van\u2019s Tractor declined. In the year ending April 1988, Van\u2019s Tractor sold only one piece of Versatile equipment. The Van Ripers attempted to sell Van\u2019s Tractor and received an offer in April of 1988, but Ford New Holland refused to approve transfer of the dealership. Ford New Holland then asked that Van\u2019s Tractor resign its dealership because it had attempted to sell the franchise. Van\u2019s Tractor refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">In April 1988, Ford New Holland decided to terminate the Van\u2019s Tractor dealership based on the refusal by Van\u2019s Tractor to pay an $11,000 disputed bill. The position of Van\u2019s Tractor as to this bill was that it would not pay the bill until it was credited for Noble parts it originally had obtained from Versatile and had returned to Vicon. The position of Ford New Holland was that although it had the right to collect the accounts of Versatile, it had no responsibility to fulfill the obligations of Versatile which had been assumed by Vicon.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">Subsequently, Ford New Holland placed Van\u2019s Tractor on \u201cstop ship\u201d status and withdrew its credit line. On May 20,1988, Ford New Holland drafted a letter demanding that Van\u2019s Tractor pay the bill within ten days or be terminated as a dealer. Termination proceedings began on May 27, 1988. Van\u2019s Tractor did not receive Ford New Holland\u2019s demand letter until June 6, 1988, but it paid the disputed amount within ten days of that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">Despite payment, Ford New Holland did not remove Van\u2019s Tractor from \u201cstop ship\u201d status. As a result, Ford New Holland shipped a four-wheel drive tractor and a Versatile swather ordered by Van\u2019s Tractor to the competing dealer in Havre. Van\u2019s Tractor was unable to obtain any parts until August 23,1988. Van\u2019s Tractor resigned its dealership in September of 1988, and then brought this lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">The case was tried to the court sitting without a jury. The court dismissed all individual claims of Robert and Jean Van Riper and all claims against Ford Motor Credit. The court found in favor of Van\u2019s Tractor on its claims against Ford New Holland and awarded $443,000 in damages, attorney fees of $162,000, and $12,393 in costs. Ford New Holland appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">Did the District Court err by applying \u00a7\u00a7 30-11-802 and -803, MCA, to the Versatile Agreement?</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">The District Court found that Ford New Holland violated both \u00a7 30-11-802, MCA, and \u00a7 30-11-803, MCA. Ford New Holland contends that application of these statutes in this case is a prohibited retroactive application because the statutes were enacted in 1985, two years after the contract was entered between Versatile and Van\u2019s Tractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">The record demonstrates that in the spring of 1987, Versatile was insolvent and in receivership. It had ceased manufacturing, was negotiating liquidation of its assets, and was in bankruptcy. FordNew Holland assumed and undertook the duties and responsibilities of Versatile with respect to certain dealerships, including Van\u2019s Tractor. Versatile had no intention of being responsible any longer under its dealership agreements; it was out of business. Beginning in the fall of 1987, Ford New Holland supplied Van\u2019s Tractor with goods and financing. Van\u2019s Tractor consented to this relationship and believed it was a Ford New Holland dealer.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">Furthermore, the assignment was more than just a product change, which is what Ford New Holland would have us believe. As the District Court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-8\">Ford New Holland\u2019s position that it was entitled to the assets but not the liabilities of the Versatile Agreement is itself sufficient evidence of a change in the duties and obligations under the Versatile Agreement to create a new agreement to which the requirements of MCA \u00a7 30-11-801 <em>et. seq. </em>otherwise apply.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">This refers to Ford New Holland\u2019s refusal to be bound by any obligations of Versatile in relation to the Noble plow line.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-10\">In support of its ruling the District Court cited <em>Kealey Pharmacy &amp; Home Care Serv. v. Walgreen Co. </em>(W.D. Wi. 1982), 539 F.Supp. 1357, modified, 761 F.2d 345, damages set, 607 F.Supp 155. That case supports the view that a non-retroactive statute applies to contracts originally entered before the statute was enacted and which have been significantly altered after the effective date of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-11\">As stated by the District Court, one result of the 1987 sale of Versatile to Ford New Holland and others was that Vicon was responsible for crediting Van\u2019s Tractor for returns of Noble parts for which Ford New Holland was, at the same time, attempting to collect payment. As Robert Van Riper testified, during the months <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>of delay before Van\u2019s Tractor received payment from Vicon for the $11,000 in returned Noble parts, Van\u2019s Tractor was placed, without notice, onC.O.D. status for parts shipped by Ford New Holland.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">Another result of the sale of Versatile was that Ford New Holland required Van\u2019s Tractor to submit a completely new application for a dealership. Requiring this application exceeded the scope of periodic financial reporting allowed under the Versatile agreement. It was, in fact, akin to making a fresh decision whether to continue the contractual relationship between Ford New Holland and Van\u2019s Tractor. (Ford New Holland, however, never approved the new dealership application.)</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">We conclude that the 1987 sale of assets by Versatile to Ford New Holland and others significantly altered the dealership relationship and contract. We hold that the District Court did not err in applying \u00a7\u00a7 30-11-802 and -803, MCA, to the Versatile Agreement between Van\u2019s Tractor and Ford New Holland.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">Did the District Court err in concluding that Ford New Holland violated \u00a7\u00a7 30-11-802 and -803, MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">The District Court concluded that actions taken by Ford New Holland violated \u00a7\u00a7 30-11-802 and -803, MCA. The argument of Ford New Holland that these violations did not occur depends on its position that the terms of the Versatile dealership contract can negate statutory requirements. Such is not the case. Contracts which are in violation of the policy of an express law are unlawful. Section 28-2-701, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">Section 30-11-802, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-10\">No grantor may, directly or indirectly, terminate, cancel, fail to renew, or substantially change the competitive circumstances of a dealership agreement without good cause. The burden of proving good cause is on the grantor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-11\">The District Court concluded that Ford New Holland changed the competitive circumstances of its dealership agreement with Van\u2019s Tractor without good cause and in violation of \u00a7 30-11-802, MCA, in seven separate ways:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-12\">unilaterally placing Van\u2019s Tractor in attrition status without reasonable notice or the opportunity to avoid further investment; without prior notice, depriving Van\u2019s Tractor of the possibility of transferring the Versatile dealership to a qualified buyer;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>requesting the resignation of Van\u2019s Tractor and threatening termination of the franchise on the erroneous pretext that the Van Ripers had sold the business and then, upon being advised of the true facts, maintaining its erroneous position that Van\u2019s Tractor had breached its dealership agreement by attempting to sell the franchise;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-4\">establishing a second Versatile franchise in the Havre area when it was aware that two such dealers could not survive; refusing to remove Van\u2019s Tractor from stop ship status after receiving the payment it had demanded;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-5\">diverting the orders of Van\u2019s Tractor for goods without notice and transferring such products to the competing store without notice; and continuing adverse credit terms against Van\u2019s Tractor (requiring that all purchases be C.O.D.).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">The court also concluded that \u201cthe conduct of Ford New Holland indirectly terminated Van\u2019s Tractor, Inc. as a Ford New Holland dealer without good cause.\u201d The record supports the conclusions of the District Court as to the violations by Ford New Holland of \u00a7 30-11-802, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">Section 30-11-803, MCA, provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-8\">(1) Except as provided in subsections (2) and (3), a grantor shall provide a dealer at least 90 days\u2019 prior written notice by certified mail of termination, cancellation, nonrenewal, or substantial change in competitive circumstances. The notice must state all the reasons for termination, cancellation, nonrenewal, or substantial change in competitive circumstances and must provide that the dealer has 60 days from receipt of the notice in which to rectify any claimed deficiency. If the deficiency is rectified within 60 days, the notice is void.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-9\">(2) If the reason for termination, cancellation, nonrenewal, or substantial change in competitive circumstances is nonpayment of sums due -under the dealership, the dealer is entitled to 10 days\u2019 prior written notice by certified mail. If the dealer does not remedy such default within 10 days after receipt of the notice, the notice is effective according to its terms.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">The court concluded that Ford New Holland violated \u00a7 30-11-803, MCA, by terminating Van Tractor\u2019s franchise -without notice, failing to notify Van\u2019s Tractor of its original attrition plan, and leaving Van\u2019s Tractor on \u201cstop ship\u201d status after Van\u2019s Tractor paid the disputed parts account. The record supports these conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>We hold that the District Court did not err in concluding that Ford New Holland violated \u00a7\u00a7 30-11-802 and -803, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Did Ford New Holland breach the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing?</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">The parties agree that damages are the same under this theory and the theory of statutory violations discussed in Issue II. Because we have ruled that the District Court did not err in finding that the statutory violations occurred, we need not address whether Ford New Holland also breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">Did the District Court err in awarding damages?</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">Ford New Holland argues that the District Court erred in awarding damages for lost profits for a period of ten years into the future because the evidence supporting that award was admitted erroneously. It asserts that the expert for Van\u2019s Tractor, Mr. Stuart, did not independently evaluate the relevant Havre market and that he based his figures on a <em>five </em>year evaluation done by Ford in connection with a different store. Ford New Holland asserts that the damages awarded for ten years into the future were purely speculative.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-10\">When injury caused by a breach of a contract is certain, damages for lost profits may be awarded even though the amount of damage is uncertain. <em>Hostetler v. Donlan </em>(1986), 221 Mont. 380, 382-83, 719 P.2d 1243, 1245. Van\u2019s Tractor points out that the damages it was awarded were half of Mr. Stuart\u2019s projection, and that a five-year profit projection based solely on the Ford New Holland projections suggested lost profits with a present value of $698,040. Ford New Holland\u2019s own expert projected lost profit with an upper range of $501,885.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-11\">We hold that the damage award of $443,000 was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-12\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b237-13\">Did the District Court err in awarding attorney fees?</p>\n<p id=\"b237-14\">The first argument of Ford New Holland on this issue, that Van\u2019s Tractor was not entitled to attorney fees -under contract or statute, is negated by our holdings under Issues I and II. Section 30-11-811, MCA, provides that reasonable attorney fees may be awarded for violation of \u00a7\u00a7 30-11-801 through -811, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>Ford New Holland also argues that the District Court miscalculated attorney fees. It points out that the claims of the individual plaintiffs, Robert and Jean Van Riper, and several theories of recovery were abandoned prior to trial and states that the attorney fees awarded exceed those called for in the contingent fee agreement between Van\u2019s Tractor and its attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">The District Court cited and applied the eight-part standard set forth in <em>Stimac v. State </em>(1991), 248 Mont. 412, 417, 812 P.2d 1246, 1249, for determining the appropriate amount of attorney fees. The court pointed out that this case involved a novel and difficult question of interpretation of statutes which had not been previously construed. It acknowledged that the case involved a series of complicated factual issues. It noted the substantial commitment of time made by the lawyers for Van\u2019s Tractor and their support staff and that this case required over three and one-half years to complete. The court reasoned that this case was an important one, that the result obtained was favorable to Van\u2019s Tractor, and that counsel for Van\u2019s Tractor are experienced and skilled in the litigation of this type of business case. The court further pointed out that Van\u2019s Tractor entered an agreement with its attorneys to pay them a contingent fee of one-third of any recovery obtained, or forty percent of recovery in the event of any appeal, and that, under that agreement, counsel risked the possibility of no recovery. The court also stated its intent to do as little harm as possible to the completeness of the damages awarded to Van\u2019s Tractor as a result of the attorney fees it must pay its counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">We conclude that the District Court acted properly in applying the statute allowing an award of attorney fees and in setting those fees according to the criteria set forth in <em>Stimac. </em>We hold that the District Court did not err in awarding attorney fees of $162,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b238-7\">JUSTICES HARRISON, HUNT and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b238-8\">JUSTICE WEBER</author>\n<p id=\"ANJ\">dissents as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">I dissent from the majority opinion which awards damages, costs and fees against Ford New Holland for violations of \u00a7\u00a7 30-11-802 and 803, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">I will set forth the essential terms of the two contracts which are pivotal to the decision. The first is the Dealer Sales and Services Agreement (herein called Dealer Agreement) dated November 2,1983 between Versatile Farm Equipment Corporation (herein Versatile) and Van\u2019s Tractor, Inc. (herein Van\u2019s Tractor). The <em>non-exclusive </em>right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>to sell products of Versatile granted to Van\u2019s Tractor is contained in the following paragraph:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-4\">1.1 The Company hereby grants to the Dealer the non-exclusive right to sell the products of the Company as hereinafter defined. ... All transactions between the Company and the Dealer shall be governed by this Agreement unless the parties specifically agree otherwise in writing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">I emphasize that Van\u2019s Tractor was given a <em>non-exclusive </em>right to sell Versatile products and that all transactions between Van\u2019s Tractor and Versatile were to be governed by the Dealer Agreement. While the Dealer Agreement did provide that the parties could otherwise agree <em>in writing, </em>there is no such agreement in the record. As a result, the transactions between Van\u2019s Tractor and Versatile were governed by the Dealer Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">The products covered by the Dealer Agreement are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-7\">2.1 Products covered by this Agreement are all those items of agricultural tractors, machines, and equipment ... listed in a current price list... issued by the Company [Versatile] from time to time together with all attachments and accessories thereto ... Each successive Machinery Price List and Parts Price List when issued is deemed to be a part of this Agreement....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">Under this paragraph the products covered by the Dealer Agreement were determined by Versatile from time to time as it issued current price lists. Under the agreement Versatile was given the right to eliminate any portion of its equipment lines without the right to object on the part of Van\u2019s Tractor. As a result Versatile had the power to eliminate the Noble line of equipment if it chose. Such elimination is a factor relied upon in the majority opinion without a consideration of the power to eliminate the Noble line of equipment which Van\u2019s Tractor granted to Versatile.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">Versatile was given the right to refuse to sell and deliver products under certain conditions in the following Dealer Agreement provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQh\">6.3 The Company [Versatile] may refuse to sell or deliver Products to the Dealer [Van\u2019s Tractor] at any time under the terms of payment, herein set forth, or in any purchase order of the Dealer, whether or not previously accepted or approved, when in its opinion the conditions of the current account or financial standing of the Dealer do not warrant further sales or deliveries upon such terms.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>Versatile was given the right to refuse to sell products to Van\u2019s Tractor when in its opinion the condition of the current account or financial standing of Van\u2019s Tractor did not warrant further sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">In addition the Dealer Agreement contains extensive termination provisions in part 21, which in pertinent part provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-5\">21.1 This Agreement shall continue in effect until terminated as hereinafter provided. This Agreement may be terminated immediately, at the Company\u2019s [Versatile] option, by giving notice by hand, verified telex or telecopier or by registered mail, postage prepaid to the last known address of the Dealer [Van\u2019s Tractor] at any time after the occurrence of any of the following events:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-6\">(d) default of any indebtedness of the Dealer to the Company...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-7\">(g) if the Company, in good faith, believes that the prospect of payment or performance hereunder is impaired or that the Products or any part thereof are in danger of being lost, damaged or confiscated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">Substantial rights in the Dealer Agreement were transferred by Versatile to Ford New Holland under the Assignment and Assumption Agreement dated July 10, 1987 (herein called Assignment), which in pertinent part provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-9\">2. <em>Assignment.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-10\">(a) VFEC [Versatile] hereby irrevocably assigns, transfers, sells and conveys to NH [Ford New Holland] all of VFEC\u2019s right, title and interest in and to the U.S. Dealer Agreements [specifically including the Versatile-Van\u2019s Tractor Agreement] to the extent the same relates to the Business [all business carried on by Versatile in the distribution and sale of equipment but excluding the Noble Business], including all right of action and all other rights accruing to VFEC thereunder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-11\">(b) For greater clarity and certainty, it is hereby agreed that VFEC shall retain unto itself all of its right, title and interest in the U.S. Dealer Agreements to the extent same relate to the Noble Business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-12\"><em>3.Assumption. </em>NH [Ford New Holland] hereby accepts the assignment of VFEC\u2019s [Versatile\u2019s] right, title and interest in and to the U.S. Dealer Agreements as above provided, and agrees to observe, perform and discharge the covenants and obligations of VFEC related to the Business under the U.S. Dealer Agreements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>in accordance with their respective terms to the extent that the same shall arise or accrue at any time after the date hereof and relate to periods commencing after the date hereof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">The Assignment irrevocably transferred from Versatile to Ford New Holland all of Versatile\u2019s right, title and interest in the Dealer Agreement with Van\u2019s Tractor as it related to Versatile equipment, but specifically excluded all Noble Business which was defined as the business carried on by Versatile Noble Cultivators Company. Under the Assumption portion of the Assignment, Ford New Holland accepted the assignment from Versatile and agreed to observe, perform and discharge all of the obligations under the Assignment in accordance with its terms. I emphasize that no consent on the part of Van\u2019s Tractor or any other dealer was required under the terms of the Assignment. It is critical to note that there are no terms of the Dealer Agreement or of the Assignment, or of any other instrument in writing which requires consent by Van\u2019s Tractor to the assignment by Versatile to Ford New Holland. Nothing in the written record supports a conclusion that the Assignment from Versatile to Ford New Holland modified the contract relationship under the Dealer Agreement with Van\u2019s Tractor so far as all Versatile equipment was concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">The majority points out that Ford New Holland contended that the application of \u00a7\u00a7 30-11-802 and 803, MCA, is a prohibited retroactive application because the statutes were enacted in 1985, two years after the contract between Versatile and Van\u2019s Tractor was executed. These code provisions in pertinent part provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-6\">30-11-802. Cancellation and alteration of dealerships. No grantor may, directly or indirectly, terminate, cancel, fail to renew, or substantially change the competitive circumstances of a dealership agreement without good cause. The burden of proving good cause is on the grantor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-7\">30-11-803. Notice of termination or change in dealership. (1)... a grantor shall provide a dealer at least 90 days\u2019 prior written notice by certified mail of termination, cancellation, nonrenewal, or substantial change in competitive circumstances. The notice must state all the reasons for termination, cancellation, nonrenewal, or substantial change in competitive circumstances and must provide that the dealer has 60 days from the receipt of the notice in which to rectify any claimed deficiency. If the deficiency is rectified within 60 days, the notice is void.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>Section 802 is construed by the majority opinion as limiting the power of Ford New Holland to terminate, cancel or substantially change the competitive circumstances of the Dealer Agreement without good cause and, placed the burden of proving such good cause on Ford New Holland. In a similar manner, the majority opinion concludes that under \u00a7 803, notice of termination or change in dealership is required, and if a deficiency specified in a notice is corrected in accordance with the statute, then the notice is void. I emphasize the clear contradiction between these code section provisions and the rights given to the parties under the terms of the Dealer Agreement itself. The majority opinion has concluded that the Dealer Agreement provisions may be totally disregarded because of the controlling effect of the subsequently enacted statutes. Clearly these code sections directly contradict the rights given to the parties under the Dealer Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">In Part I of the majority opinion, the key conclusion is stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-5\">We conclude that the 1987 sale of assets by Versatile to Ford New Holland and others significantly altered the dealership relationship and contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">I disagree with the foregoing conclusions. The Assignment of the Dealer Agreement is not prohibited or restricted under such Dealer Agreement and by its terms does not in any way result in a new dealership relationship or contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">In Part I of the majority opinion, the statement is made that the Assignment was more than just a product change as Ford New Holland would have us believe. The majority refers to the District Court finding and then states: \u201cThis refers to Ford New Holland\u2019s refusal to be bound by any obligations of Versatile in relation to the Noble plow line.\u201d The record does not support that statement. As previously quoted, the Assignment from Versatile to Ford New Holland transferred all title and interest in U.S. dealer agreements, including the Versatile-Van\u2019s Tractor Agreement, to the extent that the contract related to the business carried on by Versatile in the distribution and sale of equipment <em>\u201cbut excluding the Noble business.\u201d </em>It is not appropriate to suggest that Ford New Holland in some manner refused to be bound by the obligations of Versatile in relation to the Noble plow line. The record clearly establishes that Versatile transferred all of its interest in the Dealer Agreements regarding the Noble plow line to a different entity. Again, I find that such division <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>by Versatile of its interest in the Versatile-Van\u2019s Tractor Agreement so that it transferred one portion to Ford New Holland and the other portion to another party is not prohibited under the Dealer Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">The majority concluded that the 1987 sale of assets to Ford New Holland significantly altered the dealership relationship and contract. As authority for that conclusion, the majority relies on <em>Kealey Pharmacy &amp; Home Care Serv. v. Walgreen Co., </em>a decision of a federal court in the western district of Wisconsin, which concluded that a non-retroactive statute applies to contracts which have been significantly altered after the effective date of the statute. That is very limited case authority for the guidance of this Court. As previously pointed out, the record contains nothing which demonstrates that Van\u2019s Tractor was required to execute an agreement of any kind as a result of the Assignment by Versatile to Ford New Holland. Apparently the majority concludes that something in the nature of a \u201cnew contract\u201d was executed between Ford New Holland and Van\u2019s Tractor so that subsequently enacted statutes apply. No \u201cnew contract\u201d of any type was executed between Ford New Holland and Van\u2019s Tractor. The record contains nothing which establishes something in the nature of a \u201cnew contract.\u201d As a result I do not know of a proper legal basis for the conclusion of the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">I conclude there was not a significant alteration of the rights and responsibilities of Van\u2019s Tractor as a result of the Assignment. So far as the questions raised by Van\u2019s Tractor regarding credit for returned Noble parts, that is an issue which required determination under the existing contract. There is nothing in that transaction which requires a conclusion that a \u201cnew contract\u201d was executed. I can find no legal basis upon which to conclude that \u00a7\u00a7 30-11-802 and 803, MCA, should be applied to the Dealer Agreement and Assignment to Ford New Holland. I would reverse on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">The majority opinion refers to the application for a dealership submitted by Van\u2019s Tractor to Ford New Holland. Again I believe this to be irrelevant as in fact no new agreement was executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">Issue II addresses whether the District Court erred in concluding that Ford New Holland violated \u00a7\u00a7 30-11-802 and 803, MCA. When enacted in 1985, these code sections were <em>not </em>made retroactive. Article II, Section 31 of the Montana Constitution provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-8\">Ex post facto, obligation of contracts, and irrevocable privileges. No ex post facto law nor any law impairing the obligation of contracts, or making any irrevocable grant of special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>privileges, franchises, or immunities, shall be passed by the legislature.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">The Constitution prohibits the enactment by the legislature of a law impairing the obligation of contracts. I conclude the majority\u2019s interpretation has impaired the obligation of contracts under the Assignment and the Dealer Agreement. I would reverse on Issue II.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">In Issue III the majority opinion concludes that it is not necessary to determine if Ford New Holland breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. I would conclude that this is the only issue which should be considered on retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">I would reverse and remand for new trial on the issue of the breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.</p>\n<judges id=\"b244-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE and JUSTICE GRAY concur in the foregoing dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
