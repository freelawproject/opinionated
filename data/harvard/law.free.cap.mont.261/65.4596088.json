We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-16\">We restate the issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b90-17\">I. Did the District Court err in concluding that under the Federal Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act (PKPA) and the Montana Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (MUCCJA), it did not have subject matter jurisdiction?</p>\n<p id=\"b91-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>II. Did the District Court err by failing to conduct an evidentiary hearing before it concluded that it did not have subject matter jurisdiction?</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">III. Should this Court strike a provision in the April 26,1985 order, stating that \u201cvisitation rights herein are subject to the Respondent being concurrent in his child support obligations?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">The parties, Karen Peterson Erler (Karen) and Scott Erler (Scott), were married on December 22,1979. Two children, twin sons, Thomas and Mark, were born of the marriage on October 5, 1981. The marriage was terminated in Missoula, Montana, on September 7, 1984 with Karen granted sole custody of the children and Scott ordered to pay $400 per month per child for child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">The parties have spent numerous days in corut on a variety of issues since their dissolution in 1984, notably for Scott\u2019s failure to pay monthly child support, Karen\u2019s $6,500 share of the equity in their home, and $4000 for Karen\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees. In an attempt to persuade Scott to pay child support for Thomas and Mark, the Court provided in its April 26, 1985 order that visitation would be contingent upon Scott\u2019s payment of child support to Karen. This order also states that Scott consented to Karen\u2019s move to Seattle, Washington with the two boys, to establish a permanent residence there. A petition for modification of amended decree of dissolution states that a major reason for moving was to avoid encountering Scott.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">In an order dated December 12, 1985, the paternal grandparents were granted limited visitation with Thomas and Mark, with certain restrictions. The District Court noted that \u201cthe request of the grandparents is in part an attempt to circumvent the Court\u2019s earlier Order regarding... the reintroduction of the children to their father and the payment of support.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">The latest matter to come before the trial court involved Scott\u2019s motion to quash the writ of execution issued by the court on his Keogh retirement plan for failure to pay on his dissolution obligations. Also involved was Scott\u2019s motion for an order of investigation and a report concerning custody arrangements, his motion to modify custody and child support and finally, Karen\u2019s motion to dismiss Scott\u2019s petition to modify custody due to lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-10\">In its order, the trial court concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>I.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-4\">The Motion to Quash Writ of Execution is granted, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-5\">II.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-6\">The Motion to Dismiss Petition for Modification of Custody for Lack of Jurisdiction is granted, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-7\">III.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-8\">Having no jurisdiction to hear matters of custody, the court takes no action on Respondent\u2019s Motion for Investigation and Report Concerning Custody Arrangements for the Children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-9\">IV.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-10\">Having no jurisdiction to hear matters of custody of these children, the Court takes no action on Respondent\u2019s Motion to Find Visitation Interference or Respondent\u2019s Motion to Modify Child Support which was based on the condition that he be granted custody.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-11\">The trial court stated that it did, however, retain jurisdiction over child <em>support </em>matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-12\">On December 18, 1992, the trial court denied Scott\u2019s combined motion for a Rule 59(g) order to alter or amend, or in the alternative, a Rule 60(b), order for relief of a judgment or order. Scott\u2019s appeal of the court\u2019s denial brings this action before the Montana Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-13\">Our standard of review is whether the lower court\u2019s conclusions are correct. <em>Steer, Inc. v. Department of Revenue </em>(1990), 245 Mont. 470, 474, 803 P.2d 601, 603; <em>In re Marriage of Danelson </em>(1992), 253 Mont. 310, 317, 833 P.2d 215, 220.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-14\">I. SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION</p>\n<p id=\"b92-15\">The primary issue on appeal is whether the trial court was correct in concluding that it did not have subject matter jurisdiction over child custody matters under the PKPA and/or the MUCCJA. Scott argues that under the PKPA, \u201cMontana must continue as the jurisdictional forum to review all child care issues, including custody,\u201d and that the PKPA supersedes the MUCCJA. Karen counters that Scott is unable to meet the jurisdictional requirements of the MUCC JAand also, the PKPA does not confer subject matter jurisdiction in the instant case. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>A. PARENTAL KIDNAPPING PROTECTION ACT (PKPA)</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">Scott argues that the PKPA supersedes the MUCC JAand \u201cprotects the rights of a custody state to exercise continuing jurisdiction over child custody issues.\u201d However, Karen asserts that the PKPA \u201cwas enacted by Congress so that there will be uniformity in determining which states will have jurisdiction over child custody proceedings <em>when </em>there is a conflict between two states attempting to simultaneously assert jurisdiction.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">Since the PKPA has not previously been interpreted by this Court, the entire statute is set forth at the end of this opinion. '\u2019Additionally, we will briefly discuss the history and purposes of the PKPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">The PKPA was enacted by Congress in 1980 to address the continuing problems of forum shopping and \u201cchild snatching.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738A; History; Ancillary Laws and Directives (a), page 228. Because custody decisions were not thought to be final judgments, State B would frequently fail to accord full faith and credit to a decision from State A. <em>Foster, Child Custody Jurisdiction: UCCJA and PKPA, </em>27 NY L Sch L Rev 297, 297-298, (1981). This fact led to a growing number of parents seizing their child or children, moving to another jurisdiction, and bringing an action for custody in the new jurisdiction to obtain a more favorable judgment. 27 NY L Sch L Rev at 298. All too frequently, the end result was two conflicting decisions from the two different jurisdictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">The Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (UCCJA), which had been adopted by most states to address interstate child custody disputes, was found to be inadequate to address the problems of forum shopping and \u201cchild snatching\u201d because the UCCJA operated at the state level. <em>Pettenati, The Effect of the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act of 1980 on Child Snatching, </em>17:2 New Eng 499, 506-507, (1982). The individual states were unable to deal with problems that were essentially interstate in nature. 17:2 New Eng at 507. Additionally, the lack of perceived finality in child custody issues continued to plague the state courts. 17:2 New Eng at 506.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">The PKPA established <em>national </em>standards under which jurisdictions could determine whether they had jurisdiction and what effect to give the decisions by courts of other jurisdictions. The PKPA requires full faith and credit be accorded to decisions of a jurisdiction if the court appropriately exercised jurisdiction under the PKPA standards. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738A(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>The statute\u2019s general purposes are to promote cooperation and the exchange of information between state courts, facilitate the enforcement of custody decisions of sister states and to discourage continuing interstate controversies over child custody. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738A History; Ancillary Laws and Directives, page 228. These purposes are achieved primarily through 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738A(d) which provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-4\">The jurisdiction of a court of a State which has made a child custody determination consistently with the provisions of this section continues as long as the requirement of subsection (c)(1) of this section continues to be met and such State remains the residence of the child or of any contestant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738A(d) vests continuing j inis diction in the original state as long as the child or one of the contestants continues to reside there. However, subsection (f) of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738Apermits a court of a state to modify a determination of custody of the same child or children made by another court if it has jurisdiction to make such a custody decision and the court of the other state no longer has jurisdiction or declines to exercise its jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">As to the issue of whether the PKPA confers subject matter jurisdiction in the instant case, we conclude that it does not because Montana is the only state involved in the custody issue at this time. \u201cThe purpose of the PKPA is to prevent the issuance of <em>competing </em>decrees in sister states.\u201d <em>Nielsen v. Nielsen </em>(La. 1985), 472 So.2d 133, 136. (Emphasis supplied.) See also; <em>Peterson v. Peterson </em>(Me. 1983), 464 A.2d 202, 204. (\u201cBoth the UCCJA and PKPA were enacted to prevent jurisdictional <em>conflict </em>and <em>competition </em>over child custody....\u201d) (Emphasis added.) In the instant case, there is no other state competing with Montana for jurisdiction. Neither Karen nor Scott have sought to invoke the jurisdictional powers of the Washington courts. Since the State of Washington is not attempting to compete with the State of Montana for jurisdiction in the matter of child custody, the PKPA is not invoked. We conclude that the trial court correctly determined that the PKPA does not apply in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">B. MONTANA UNIFORM CHILD CUSTODY JURISDICTION ACT (MUCCJA)</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">Next, we must determine whether Montana has subject matter jurisdiction over the child custody issues under the MUCCJA, which is found at Chapter 7 of Title 40. Scott argues that \u201cSection 40-4-211, MCA, is also pertinent to this case.\u201d He contends that Montana was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>the home state of the children when the proceedings were commenced and further, jurisdiction is established in Montana because the petition for dissolution was filed in Missoula, Montana. Karen states that Montana is unable to meet any of the jurisdictional requirements of the MUCC JA and therefore, it does not have jurisdiction in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">Section 40-7-104, MCA, states that \u201c[t]he jurisdictional provisions of 40-4-211 apply to this chapter.\u201d Section 40-4-211, MCA, is the \u201cpremier jurisdictional hurdle which must be overcome before a district court may modify a child custody decree with interstate implications.\u201d In <em>re Marriage of Lance </em>(1984), 213 Mont. 182, 188, 690 R2d 979, 982, citing In <em>re the Marriage of Bolton </em>(1984), 212 Mont. 212, 218, 690 P.2d 401, 404. Section 40-4-211, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-5\">Child custody jurisdiction \u2014 commencement of proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-6\">(1) A court of this state competent to decide child custody matters has jurisdiction to make a child custody determination by initial or modification decree if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-7\">(a) this state:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-8\">(i) is the home of the child at the time of commencement of the proceedings; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-9\">(ii) had been the child\u2019s home state within 6 months before commencement of the proceeding and the child is absent from this state because of his removal or retention by a person claiming his custody or for other reason and a parent or person acting as parent continues to live in this state; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-10\">(b) it is in the best interest of the child that a court of this state assume jurisdiction because:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-11\">(i) the child and his parents or the child and at least one contestant have a significant connection with this state; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-12\">(ii) there is available in this state substantial evidence concerning the child\u2019s present or future care, protection, training, and personal relationships; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-13\">(c) the child is physically present in this state and:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-14\">(i) has been abandoned; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-15\">(ii) it is necessary in an emergency to protect him because he has been subjected to or threatened with mistreatment or abuse or is neglected or dependent; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-16\">(d)(i) no other state has jurisdiction under prerequisites substantially in accordance with subsections (l)(a), (l)(b), or (l)(c) of this section or another state has declined to exercise jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>on the ground that this state is the more appropriate forum to determine custody of the child; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-4\">(ii) it is in his best interest that the court assume jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ab\">(2) Except under subsections (l)(c) and (l)(d) of this section, physical presence in this state of the child or of the child and one of the contestants is not alone sufficient to confer jurisdiction on a court of this state to make a child custody determination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Section 40-4-211(l)(a), MCA, requires the trial court to determine which state is the child\u2019s home state or his home state within the past 6 months. \u201cHome state\u201d means \u201cthe state in which the child, immediately preceding the time involved, lived with his parents, [or] a parent ... for at least 6 consecutive months. ...\u201d Section 40-7-103, MCA. In the instant case, Scott consented to Karen\u2019s move to Washington with the boys in 1985. They have consistently resided with her in the State of Washington since that time with the exception of visitation with Scott and/or the paternal grandparents. Washington is unquestionably the home state, not Montana. <em>Lance, </em>690 P.2d at 983. This determination comports with one of the general purposes of the MUCCJA, which is to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-6\">(c) assure that litigation concerning the custody of a child takes place ordinarily in the state with which the child and his family have the closest connection and where significant evidence concerning his care, protection, training, and personal relationships is most readily available and that courts of this state decline the exercise of jurisdiction when the child and his family have a closer connection with another state....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">Section 40-7-102(l)(c), MCA. Section 40-4-211(l)(a), MCA, does not apply to the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">Under \u00a7 40-4-2 ll(l)(b), MCA, Montana has jurisdiction if the child and his parents, or at least one contestant have a significant connection with Montana <em>and </em>substantial evidence is available here concerning the children\u2019s present or future care, training, and personal relationships. Mark and Tom have lived in Washington for the greater majority of their lives. Scott has significant connections with Montana but the boy\u2019s connection stems from visitation with their father. Even if the boys had significant connections with Montana, there must <em>also </em>be available in the state substantial evidence concerning their \u201cpresent or future care, protection, training, and personal relationships.\u201d Section 40-4-211(l)(b)(ii), MCA. In this case, Mark and Tom\u2019s friends, classmates, teachers and physicians reside <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>in Washington where the boys have resided for the last 7 years. Again, under \u00a7 40-7-102(l)(c), MCA, above, the requirements of subsection (l)(b) of \u00a7 40-4-211, MCA, simply cannot be met in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">Subsection (l)(c) of \u00a7 40-4-211, MCA, requires that the child be physically present in this state <em>and </em>have been abandoned or that an emergency situation necessitates the child\u2019s protection -under subsection (l)(c). In this case, the children are not physically present in Montana nor are there any allegations of abandonment, mistreatment, abuse or neglect. Thus, the requirements of \u00a7 40-4-211(l)(c), MCA, cannot be met.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Under \u00a7 40-4-211(l)(d), MCA, this state may assume jurisdiction if no other state has jurisdiction under guidelines comparable to those of subsections (l)(a), (b) and (c) or another state has declined jurisdiction because this state is a more appropriate forum <em>and </em>it is in the children\u2019s best interest that this court assume jurisdiction. Since there has been no contact with the courts in the State of Washington, it cannot be said that Washington, the boys\u2019 home state, would not have jurisdiction nor that it would decline jurisdiction. Neither can it be said that it is in the best interest of the children for child custody to be adjudicated in Montana. As stated earlier, the boys do not have a significant connection with Montana nor would substantial evidence be found in Montana regarding their present and future care and training. Finally, the boys do not live in Montana, have not lived here in years and there is no threat or emergency to necessitate Montana\u2019s claim to jurisdiction. In conclusion, Montana cannot claim jurisdiction over child custody matters in this case and the trial court correctly concluded that Montana does not have subject matter jurisdiction in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">II. EVIDENTIARY HEARING</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">Scott argues that under <em>Pierce v. Pierce </em>(1982), 197 Mont. 16, 640 P.2d 899, \u201cwhen dealing with the children\u2019s best interests, an evidentiary hearing is the only means of determining those best interests as they relate to jurisdiction.\u201d However, Karen counters that this issue is being raised for the first time on appeal and therefore, should not be addressed. Scott does not discuss this assertion in his reply brief; his silence and a review of the record reveal that this is, indeed, the first time this issue has been raised. It is a settled rule in Montana that we will not review an issue raised for the first time on appeal. <em>In re Marriage of Starks </em>(1993), [259 Mont. 138], 855 P.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>527, 532, 50 St. Rep. 719, 722. Therefore, we decline to address this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">III. MOTION TO STRIKE</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">Scott\u2019s final issue on appeal concerns his request to strike a provision in the April 26, 1985 order, stating that \u201cvisitation rights herein are subject to the Respondent being concurrent in his child support obligations.\u201d However, Karen argues that Scott should have appealed this issue within 30 days of the 1985 judgment. Alternatively, if the issue is before the Court, she contends that although the trial court erroneously used the word \u201cconcurrent\u201d instead of <em>current, </em>the trial court\u2019s intention was to require child support payment before the exercise of visitation. Given Scott\u2019s continuing, flagrant abuse of his support obligations we will address this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">At the outset, we note that visitation and child support are not interdependent. <em>State ex rel. Dewyea v. Knapp </em>(1984), 208 Mont. 19, 22-23, 674 P.2d 1104, 1105-1106; <em>State ex rel. Blakeslee v. Horton </em>(1986), 222 Mont. 351, 355, 722 P.2d 1148, 1150. However, in this case, a review of the record reveals a clear intention by the trial court to ensure that child support would be <em>current </em>before visitation could be exercised based on Karen\u2019s continuing child support problems <em>and </em>the parties\u2019 stipulation on the record to that provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">Karen had previously reported to the trial court that she was not being paid child support. In her Petition for Modification of Amended Decree of Dissolution, and affidavit, both signed on January 31,1985, she contended that Scott was in arrears in the amount of $2,800.00. In her February 5,1985 Motion for Temporary Order, she again stated \u201c[t]hat Respondent is in arrears for months July, 1984, until January, 1985 in the amount of $2,800.00.\u201d These documents indicate that Karen was concerned about the child support arrearages, and that she made the court aware of Scott\u2019s noncompliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">A simple reading of Finding of Fact 10 from the trial court\u2019s order of April 26,1985, makes it evident that the trial court intended to require that the child support be current before Scott exercised visitation. It states \u201c[t]hat the visitation rights herein are <em>subject to </em>the Respondent being concurrent [sic] in his child support.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The visitation rights are \u201csubject to\u201d the condition that the child support obligations be met. That condition is an indisputable mandate, that child support payments were to be <em>current. </em>The trial court made this requirement a condition of Scott\u2019s exercise of visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>The following portion of the February 21,1985 transcript further clarifies this issue and provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-4\">(By Mr. MacDonald): The visitation rights as set forth herein are by stipulation subject to the Respondent being concurrent in the child support obligations at the time of the commencement of his child support obligations. I realize, your Honor, that this is an unusual stipulation, as some of these proceedings are, but I would remind the court we have been through this. This is now our third appearance in Court. No child support has been paid to date, and this agreement is being made by stipulation of the parties in view of those circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-5\">THE COURT: I didn\u2019t quite understand what you said about visitation current in child support. You used \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-6\">MR. MacDONALD: Excuse me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-7\">THE COURT: I would like you to repeat it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-8\">MR. MacDONALD: All visitation rights of the Respondent are conditioned upon his being current in the payment of child support at the date he is exercising his visitation. That is, if he is not current, through the Clerk of Court, then the visitation will not take place.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-9\">MR. MacDONALD: Could the Court have both the parties stipulate on the record that they find the agreement acceptable?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-10\">THE COURT: Dr. Erler?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-11\">MR. ERLER: Acceptable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-12\">THE COURT: And you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-13\">MRS. ERLER: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-14\">It is apparent that Scott is using a minor mistake in an otherwise clear order to avoid his child support obligations. His position is untenable. A review of the record and a careful reading of the trial court\u2019s order make it clear that child support is not dependent upon the exercise of visitation, but that visitation is conditioned upon child support payments being current at the time of visitation. His argument, wholly unsupported by the record, leads us to deny his request to strike that portion of the trial court\u2019s order. In so doing, we stress, however, that the facts and stipulation of the parties in this case are unique.
