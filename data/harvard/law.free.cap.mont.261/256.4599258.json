However, we determine the following issue to be dispositive:</p>\n<p id=\"b281-15\">Did the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court err when it failed to impose a 20 percent penalty pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-2907, MCA, and attorney fees pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-612, MCA, after it found that the State Fund acted unreasonably in denying liability for a neurological consultation?</p>\n<p id=\"b281-16\">A hearing was held in this matter on May 13, 1992. On December 28,1992, the hearing examiner issued proposed findings of fact, conclusions of law, and order which were adopted by the Workers\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>Compensation Court. Stordalen appeals the findings of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">Did the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court err when it failed to impose a 20 percent penalty pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-2907, MCA, and attorney fees pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-612, MCA, after it found that the State Fund acted unreasonably in denying liability for a neurological consultation?</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Our standard of review is that findings of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court will not be overturned if there is substantial evidence in the record to support them. <em>Plooster v. Pierce Packing </em>Co. (1993), 256 Mont. 287, 291, 846 P.2d 976, 978. However, when reviewing the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s conclusions of law, our review is plenary. We determine if the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s determination as to the law is correct. <em>Martelli v. Anaconda-Deer Lodge County </em>(1993), [258 Mont. 166], 852 P.2d 579, 580, 50 St. Rep. 479, 480.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">Section 39-71-2907(1), MCA (1989), provides for an increase in award when the State Fund acts unreasonably by refusing to pay benefits.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-7\">When payment of compensation has been unreasonably delayed or refused by an insurer, either prior or subsequent to the issuance of an order by the workers\u2019 compensation judge granting a claimant compensation benefits, the full amount of the compensation benefits due a claimant between the time compensation benefits were delayed or refused and the date of the order granting a claimant compensation benefits may be increased by the workers\u2019 compensation judge by 20%. The question of unreasonable delay or refusal shall be determined by the workers\u2019 compensation judge, and such a finding constitutes good cause to rescind, alter, or amend any order, decision, or award previously made in the cause for the purpose of making the increase provided herein.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">Section 39-71-612, MCA, allows the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court to award attorney fees if it finds that the State Fund acted unreasonably. A determination of what is unreasonable is a question of fact. <em>Metzger v. Chemetron Corp. </em>(1984), 212 Mont. 351, 358, 687 P.2d 1033, 1037.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">We have held that when an insurer acts unreasonably by denying benefits to which a claimant is legally entitled, the court should impose the statutory penalty. <em>Plooster, </em>846 P.2d at 978. In <em>Plooster, </em>the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court found that the State Fund acted unreasonably when it ignored the opinion of claimant\u2019s treating physician and refused to pay for medicine which the doctor had prescribed. <em>Plooster, </em>846 P.2d at 978. However, after making that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>determination, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court denied claimant\u2019s entitlement to a statutory penalty. <em>Plooster, </em>846 P.2d at 978. We reversed the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court and stated that the claimant was entitled to a penalty. <em>Plooster, </em>846 P.2d at 978.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">In <em>Chapman v. Research Cottrell </em>(1991), 248 Mont. 353, 357, 811 P.2d 1283, 1285, this Court held that when an insurer denies a claimant\u2019s request to change treating physicians, the decision must be reasonable. Here, the request is not for a change of treating physicians, but to seek consultation of a medical expert. A claimant must obtain authorization from the State Fund for a referral to a medical expert for consultation. 24.29.1403(3), ARM (repealed eff. 4/1/93).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">In this instance, the State Fund denied Stordalen\u2019s request for a consultation with Dr. Nelson for the following reasons: (1) a neurologist was not indicated on the file; (2) the claimant lives in Livingston, while Dr. Nelson\u2019s practice is in Billings; and (3) billing factors. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court found that none of the above-stated reasons justified denying Stordalen\u2019s request to be examined by a physician of her choice. The court concluded that the State Fund unreasonably denied Stordalen\u2019s request for consultation with a physician of her choice and found the State Fund liable for her neurological examination. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court determined that Stordalen was not entitled to a penally pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-2907, MCA. The State Fund did not appeal this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">We hold that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court should impose the penally and attorney fees because it found that the State Fund acted unreasonably in denying Stordalen\u2019s request for a consultive examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">We reverse and remand to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court for a determination of penalty and attorney fees.</p>\n<judges id=\"b283-8\">JUSTICES HARRISON, TRIEWEILER, GRAY and WEBER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
