By the close of 2000, that same company, now touting the name Vi-vendi Universal, S.A. (\u201cVivendi\u201d)) was a global media conglomerate with extensive dealings in the film, music, telecommunications, publishing, and Internet industries, among related others. What followed on the heels of Defendant-Appellant-Cross-Appellee Vivendi\u2019s seemingly overnight transformation gives rise to the securities-fraud allegations now at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">To pull off its transformation and buttress its position as a mover-and-shaker in the global media-and-telecommunications market, Vivendi spent much of 2000 and 2001 acquiring a diverse array of media and communications businesses in the United States and abroad. Naturally, these acquisitions required money, and Vivendi did not have an unlimited supply. By 2001 and especially by 2002, Vivendi was running critically low. Indeed, Vivendi was in danger of not being able to meet all of its various payment obligations, including payments on loans-it had taken out for the very purpose of financing its buying spree. In the worst case scenario, which inquiries later revealed was not an altogether unlikely one, Vivendi was months away from bankruptcy or insolvency, Yet, up until approximately July 2002, Vivendi made numerous representations to the market suggesting that the course ahead for the company was smooth sailing. That all came to a halt when Vivendi\u2019s stock price came tumbling down in the middle of 2002, after a series of credit downgrades and revelations that Vivendi was strapped, for cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-12\">In a class-action suit they initiated against Vivendi in 2002, Plaintiffs-Appel-lees and Plaintiffs-Appellees-Cross-Ap-pellants (collectively, \u201cPlaintiffs\u201d), investors in Vivendi\u2019s stock during the relevant time period, alleged that Vivendi\u2019s persistently optimistic representations during the period from October 30, 2000 to August 14, 2002, constituted securities fraud under \u00a7 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\u201cExchange Act\u201d), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b), as well as the Securities Exchange Commission\u2019s (\u201cSEC\u201d) Rule 10b-5 (\u201cRule, 10b-5\u201d) promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7\u25a0 240.10b-5. Vivendi now appeals from a December 22, 2014 partial final judgment of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Scheindlin, J.),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> following a three-month jury trial that' started in late 2009 and resulted in a jury verdict finding Vivendi liable for securities fraud under \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-13\">We affirm as to Vivendi\u2019s claims on appeal, concluding as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b256-14\">(1) Plaintiffs relied on specifically identified false or misleading statements at trial and thus, contrary to Vivendi\u2019s argument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>on appeal, did not fail to present an actionable claim of securities fraud by \u201celimi-nat[ing] the foundational element of ... a specific false or misleading statement,\u201d Vi-vendi Br. 41;</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">(2) Vivendi\u2019s claim that certain' statements constituted non-actionable statements of opinion is not preserved for appellate review;</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">(3) Vivendi\u2019s claims that certain statements constituted non-actionable puffery and that others fall under the Private Securities Law Reform Act\u2019s (\u201cPSLRA\u201d) safe harbor provision for \u201cforward-looking statements,\u201d see 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-5(e), is without merit;</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">(4) the evidence was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s determination that the fifty-six statements at issue here were materially false or misleading with respect to Vi-vendi\u2019s liquidity risk;</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">(5) the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the testimony of Plaintiffs\u2019 expert, Dr. Blaine Nye (\u201cNye\u201d); and</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">(6) the evidence was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s finding as to loss causation. As to the Plaintiffs\u2019 cross-appeal, we likewise affirm, concluding that the district court:</p>\n<p id=\"b257-10\">(1) did not abuse its discretion in excluding' certain foreign shareholders from the class at the class certification stage; and</p>\n<p id=\"b257-11\">(2) did not err in dismissing claims by American purchasers of ordinary shares under <em>Morrison v. Nat\u2019l Austl. Bank Ltd., </em>561 U.S. 247, 130 S.Ct. 2869, 177 L.Ed.2d 535 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-12\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b257-13\">At the helm of Vivendi\u2019s transition from a centuries-old French utilities conglomerate into a modern global, media powerhouse was a man named Jean-Marie Messier, who had been the chief executive and chairman of the executive committee since 1994, and chairman of the company since 1996. Messier was not, by trade, an expert in French utilities, but rather a former investment-banker at the firm La-zard Fr\u00e9res &amp; Co.' LLC. Soon after becoming chairman of \"the' company\u2019s executive committee, Messier formulated an ambitious plan to transform the company completely. In broad strokes, Messier\u2019s plan was to merge the company with two other large companies that had significant media dealings; steadily supplement this new company\u2019s core' media operations with various additional media acquisitions; and gradually divest the new company of its utilities and environment divisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-15\">The plan largely got underway in May 1998, when the shareholders of <em>Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Eaux </em>approved the company\u2019s name change to Vivendi, S.A. Over the course of the following year, Vivendi, S.A., contributed or sold its interests in certain water-related holdings to a subsidiary, Vivendi Environnement, and acquired scattered interests in various media and telecommunications firms.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-16\">The most aggressive foray in Messier\u2019s plan came on June 20, 2000, when Vivendi, S.A., formally announced its intent to enter into a three-way merger with Canal Plus, S.A. (\u201cCanal + \u201d), a french film and television production company; and The Seagram Company Ltd. . (\u201cSeagram\u201d), a Canadian entertainment and beverage company that .owned, among other things, Universal Studios and Universal Music Group. Shortly. after the announcement of the merger, credit-rating agencies Moody\u2019s and Standard <em>&amp; </em>Poor\u2019s (\u201cS&amp;P\u201d) undertook to reevaluate the creditworthiness of Vivendi, S.A. On July 4, 2000, Moody\u2019s noted a \u201cpossible downgrade\u201d of a particular senior class of Vivendi,. S.A.\u2019s debt might be on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>the horizon, on account of, <em>inter alia, </em>concerns about the considerable amount of debt Vivendi, S.A., would carry after the merger (including extensive prior debts already incurred). S&amp;P also expressed some concern, but tempered its forecast with the expectation that the company would be able to dispose of several assets and thereby alleviate its debt. Neither Moody\u2019s nor S&amp;P downgraded Vivendi, S.A., at the time. The three-way merger was complete on December 8, 2000, with the surviving entity being Vivendi, formerly a subsidiary of Vivendi, S.A. With the three-way merger, Vivendi became one of the world\u2019s leading media and communications companies, second only to AOL-Time Warner. Among Vivendi\u2019s assets were the world\u2019s largest recorded music company, one of the world\u2019s largest motion picture studios, and businesses in the global telecommunications, television, theme park, publishing, and Internet industries.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">Still, Vivendi pressed forth with additional acquisitions. Over the course of the next eighteen months, .Vivendi acquired significant stakes, or added to its existing interests, in a number of media and telecommunications companies across the world. To start, within just a few days of the three-way merger\u2019s completion in December 2000, Vivendi announced its acquisition of a 35% interest in Maroc Telecom, the Kingdom' of Morocco\u2019s state-owned telecommunications company, for approximately \u20ac2.3 billion. In Summer 2001, Vi-vendi acquired publishing company Houghton Mifflin Company (\u201cHoughton Mifflin\u201d), along with its $500 million in net debt, for approximately $2.2 billion. Several months later, on December 17, 2001, Vivendi'announced that it would acquire full control of television company USA Networks Corporation (\u201cUSA Networks\u201d) for $10.3 billion, approximately $1.6 billion of which Vivendi would finance in cash. That same day, Vivendi announced that it would invest $1.5 billion in satellite television company EchoStar Communications Corporation (\u201cEchoStar\u201d), which was expected to gain access to approximately 15 million homes in the United States when EchoStar acquired DirecTV.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">These multi-billion-dollar transactions merely scratched the surface of Vivendi\u2019s buying frenzy. Vivendi also acquired, in whole or in part, MP3.com, GetMusic LLC, RMM Records &amp; Video, MUSI-DISC, Koch Group Recorded Music, Uproar Inc. and EMusic.com Inc., among other media or telecommunications companies. In total, Vivendi reportedly spent approximately $77 billion on its acquisition spree, with Seagram alone costing roughly $34 billion. According to Plaintiffs, Viven-di\u2019s debts associated with its media and communications operations ballooned from approximately \u20ac3 billion in early 2000 to over \u20ac21 billion in 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">Meanwhile, Vivendi repeatedly expressed its aggressive growth prospects and its secure financial footing. Many of Vivendi\u2019s public statements during its acquisition period focused on EBITDA (\u201cEarnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation, and Amortization\u201d), an earnings measure that is typically considered a \u201cgood example of [a company\u2019s] cash income\u201d and ability to service debt. J.A. 2833. On October 30, 2000, the company announced its \u201cobjective\u201d to \u201cgrow <em>proforma </em>adjusted EBITDA at an approximate 35% compound annual growth rate through 2002.\u201d Special App\u2019x 315. Over the next year, Vivendi repeatedly underscored its \u201cconfidenc[e] that [it] w[ould] meet [its] very aggressive [EBITDA] growth targets,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 316, and emphasized that its fiscal year 2001 quarterly results met or exceeded its EBITDA growth targets, <em>e.g., id. </em>at 320 (\u201cWith three quarters of the \u2018aggressive\u2019 incremental EBITDA target for the full year 2001 already achieved in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>the first half of the year, I can only re-emphasiz[e] our confidence. We will at least meet our stated targets.\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 322 (\u201cEBITDA organic growth is very strong, reaching 36% in the third quarter and 52% year-to-date. It represents the achievement in nine months of close to 100% of the full year 2001 incremental EBITDA growth target\u201d). Vivendi supplemented these statements with representations that it had \u201cvery strong ... results with outstanding growth,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 316, \u201cthe highest growth rates in the industry,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 320, \u201cstrong operating results,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u201cfree operational cash flow [that was] far above [its] objectives,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 328, and \u201cstrong free cash flow,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 330.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">But the tableau painted by Vivendi\u2019s public statements did not match the tenor of the discussions inside the company. With each acquisition, Vivendi \u201chad to borrow some money from the banks,\u201d J.A. 2485, and it became \u201cmore and more difficult to raise the cash\u201d Vivendi needed to pay for its acquisitions and its accumulating debts, J.A. 2487. Vivendi\u2019s liquidity, or its ability to pay its fixed obligations, became increasingly strained. According to one member of Vivendi\u2019s finance department, members of that department believed Vivendi\u2019s liquidity situation was \u201ctense\u201d by the middle of 2001, \u201cdangerous\u201d by late 2001, and \u201cmore than dangerous [throughout 2002].\u201d J.A. 2488. The USA Networks and EchoStar transactions at the close of 2001 were particularly alarming to one member of Vivendi\u2019s finance department, who testified that the two deals \u201cwould create havoc with the debt level of Vivendi,\u201d whose \u201ccash situation\u201d was already \u201cextremely tense\u201d at the time. Special App\u2019x 366 n.21.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Starting in June 2001, Vivendi\u2019s Treasurer, Hubert Dupont-L\u2019Hotelain, \u201cclearly raised the issue of a cash problem inside Vivendi\u201d at each one of Vivendi\u2019s Finance Committee meetings. J.A. 2512. According to a Vivendi employee present at the meetings, Duponh-L\u2019H\u00f3telain repeatedly \u201cexpressed concerns over ... the liquidity situation\u201d and discussed Vivendi\u2019s \u201cshortage in cash.\u201d <em>Id. </em>These discussions prompted Vivendi\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, Guillaume Hannezo, to comment on multiple occasions that Vivendi appeared to be \u201crunning out of cash\u201d and \u201cnearing bankruptcy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2513.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">Hannezo also warned Messier of these conditions. \u2019 For example, after credit-rating \u00e1gencies raised concerns with Hannezo in early December 2001 about Vivendi\u2019s contemplated USA Networks and EchoS-tar transactions, Hannezo wrote Messier warning of the \u201cdanger\u201d of a downgrade. J.A. 4072. He later penned a memorandum to Messier recounting the \u201cpainful and humiliating meetings with the ratings agencies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3794. In that note, he explained that he did \u201cnot want to put up with[] a downgrade, which [he believed] would [lead] to a liquidity crisis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Hannezo also told Messier that he had \u201cthe unpleasant feeling of being in a car whose driver is accelerating in a sharp turn while [he was] the one in the death seat.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe only thing that I am asking,\u201d Hannezo continu\u00e9d, \u201cis that it doesn\u2019t all end in shame.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3794-95. Four days after Hannezo alerted Messier to the \u201cdanger\u201d of a downgrade, Vivendi publicly announced its $10.3 billion USA Networks transaction and $1.5 billion EchoStar transaction. In a press conference shortly after the announcement, Vivendi stated that the transactions were \u201cnot putting pressure on Vivendi Universal,\u201d and that it anticipated maintaining \u201ca very comfortable ... credit rating.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4158, 4162.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">Around the same time, however, fissures began to appear in Vivendi\u2019s public fagade. Despite Vivendi\u2019s assurances about the financial soundness of the USA Networks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>and EchoStar deals, the two transactions prompted Moody\u2019s to change its rating outlook on Vivendi to \u201cnegative.\u201d J.A. 4164. The decision, Moody\u2019s explained, came as a result of its concerns over the additional debt incurred by the transactions, in conjunction' with other debts previously incurred by Vivendi and uncertainty about Vivendi\u2019s ability to take steps to reduce its debt. A few weeks later, on January 7, 2002, Vivendi announced the sale of <em>55 </em>million treasury shares for a total of \u20ac3.3 billion. \u201cThe proceeds of the sale,\u201d Vivendi explained in a press release, \u201cw[ould] be used mostly to reduce the company\u2019s debt.\u201d J.A. 4117. Vivendi\u2019s stock prices dipped following the announcement of the treasury-share sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">. Despite raising \u20ac3.3 billion for Vivendi, the substantial treasury-share sale in January 2002 did not prevent Vivendi\u2019s problems from coming to a head several months later. On May 3, 2002, Moody\u2019s downgraded Vivendi\u2019s long-term senior debt rating from.Baa2 to Baa3, citing concerns about Vivendi\u2019s ability to reduce debt and return its leverage to a point that would justify a Baa2 rating.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In response to Moody\u2019s decision, Vivendi stated that the downgrade \u201cha[d] no impact on Viven-di[\u2019s] ... cash situation,\u201d and that Vivendi \u201cha[d] every confidence in its ability to meet its operating targets for 2002.\u201d J.A. 4667.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Nonetheless, S&amp;P followed Moody\u2019s suit on May 6, 2002, downgrading Vivendi\u2019s short-term debt from A-2 to A-3.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Shortly afterwards, Vivendi issued a press release stating that it \u201cha[d] no reason to fear any further deterioration [in its credit rating].\u201d J.A. 4623. Vivendi\u2019s \u201ccash flow situation,\u201d according to the press release, was \u201ccomfortable,\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[Ejven assuming an extremely pessimistic market,\u201d Vivendi would be able to \u201ccontinue its debt reduction program in all serenity.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">Quietly, Vivendi attempted to slough off some of its less critical holdings for cash. On June 12, 2002, unbeknownst to the public, Vivendi and Deutsche Bank entered into a private sale-and-repurchase agreement, under which Vivendi sold- a 12.7% stake in its 63%-owned subsidiary Vivendi Environnement and agreed to repurchase those shares from Deutsche Bank at a later point. On June 17, 2002, while the public remained unaware of Vi-vendi\u2019s deal with Deutsche Bank, Vivendi announced it was considering selling a significant stake.in Vivendi Environnement when market conditions were appropriate. Vivendi\u2019s stock price took a hit on June 21, 2002, after the market learned that Viven-di had already entered a sale-and-repurchase agreement with respect to some of its shares in Vivendi Environnement. Press reports questioned why Vivendi could not wait until market conditions were appropriate to go through with the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">Three days later, on June 24, 2002, Vi-vendi announced the immediate sale of a 15.6% stake in Vivendi Environnement shares, including the 12.7% stake that was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>the subject of its repurchasa-and-sale agreement with Deutsche Bank. That day alone, Vivendi\u2019s stock price dropped 23%. Financial commentators remarked that-the quick succession of the two Vivendi Envi-ronnement transactions suggested that Vi-vendi \u201cneeded a quick cash injection\u201d and \u201cw[as] in a big rush to get that cash.\u201d J.A. 2792. Vivendi parried back on June 26, 2002, stating in a press release that \u201c[o]wing to its strong free cash flow,\u201d combined with other factors, Vivendi was \u201cconfident of its capacity to meets its anticipated obligations over the next [year].\u201d Special App\u2019x 330. Two days later, however, Viven-di negotiated a new \u20ac275 million credit line from Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">After the market closed on July 1, 2002, Moody\u2019s downgraded Vivendi\u2019s long-term senior debt rating again, this time from Baa3 to Bal, landing Vivendi\u2019s long-term senior debt in junk territory. In a press releas\u00e9 announcing the downgrade, Moody\u2019s explained that its decision-primarily reflected growing doubts about Viven-di\u2019s ability to achieve the level of debt reduction befitting of-a Baa3 rating and concerns over Vivendi\u2019s ability to refinance liabilities that would become due over the course of the next 12 months. When the market opened the following day, on July 2, 2002, S&amp;P downgraded Vivendi\u2019s long-term debt from BBB to BBB-, just a notch above junk status, and warned that liquidity concerns could prompt further downgrades.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Like Moody\u2019s, S&amp;P cited Viven-di\u2019s lack of transparency about large debt obligations that were fast approaching repayment deadlines, among other things, as a reason for the downgrade. After news of both downgrades hit the market on July 2, 2002, Vivendi\u2019s stock price slid approximately 26%. Financial analysts speculated that Vivendi could face a cash shortfall by the end of 2002 because it did not have the means to cover its debt repayments.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">Vivendi\u2019s board of directors, meanwhile, hired Goldman Sachs to assess the severity of Vivendi\u2019s financial difficulties. In late June 2002, Goldman Sachs presented its findings to the board and noted that one of four possible scenarios for Vivendi was bankruptcy, as early as September or October 2002. The- board of directors then zeroed in on Messier as the source of Vivendi\u2019s troubles and sought to oust him from his position as CEO. On July 2, 2002, Messier announced his resignation, and the next day Vivendi\u2019s stock prices tumbled 22%, Now under new management, Vivendi issued a press release acknowledging that the company faced a \u201cshort-term liquidity issue.\u201d J.A.-2049. The press release also revealed that by the end of July, Vivendi would-have to repay creditors \u20ac1.8 billion, and \u20ac3.8 billion in credit lines would be up for renegotiation. The following week, French regulators began a probe into Vivendi\u2019s financial affairs, while Moody\u2019s and S&amp;P warned of further downgrades.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-10\">Additional damaging revelations surfaced on August 14, 2002, when Vivendi\u2019s new management announced that-the company faced refinancing needs of \u20ac5.6 billion, had \u20ac10 billion more in debt than is typical of a company with a BBB credit rating by S&amp;P, and planned to sell \u20ac5 billion worth of assets over the next nine months.- That day, S&amp;P further downgraded Vivendi\u2019s long-term debt, and Vivendi\u2019s stock price dropped more than 25%.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-11\">II. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b261-12\">On January 7, 2003, Plaintiffs filed a Consolidated Class Action Complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>against- Vivendi, Messier, and Hannezo (collectively, \u201cDefendants\u201d) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Baer, /.), principally alleging that between October 30, 2000 and August 14, 2002 (the \u201cClass Period\u201d), Defendants made material misstatements that artificially inflated Vivendi\u2019s stock price, in violation of \u00a7 10(b) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b), and SEC Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.10b-5, as well as \u00a7 20(a) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78t(a),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In February 2003, Defendants moved to dismiss, arguing,- <em>inter alia, </em>that Plaintiffs had failed to specify with sufficient particularity the statements Plaintiffs alleged to be false or misleading. By opinion dated November 4, 2003, Judge Baer denied in part and granted in part Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, and granted Plaintiffs leave to amend its Consolidated Class Action Complaint. On November 24, 2003, Plaintiffs filed a First Amended Consolidated Class Action Complaint. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">After several'years of discovery, during which time the case was transferred from Judge Baer to Judge Holwell, Defendants moved for summary judgment on August 15, 2008: Judge Holwell denied that motion on March 31, 2009. On June 2, 2009, Defendants filed a motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude the testimony of Plaintiffs\u2019 expert, Dr. Blaine Nye. On August 18, 2009, Judge Holwell denied Defendants\u2019 motion, with one narrow exception not at issue on appeal. Trial was scheduled, to begin in the fall of 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">On October 5, 2009, a jury trial commenced on Plaintiffs\u2019 \u00a7 10(b) claims against Vivendi, Messier, and Hannezo, as well as Plaintiffs\u2019 \u00a7 20(a) control-person claims against Messier and Hannezo. At trial, Plaintiffs introduced into evidence the \u201cBook of Warnings,\u201d a compendium of internal communications and memoranda that Hannezo had written to Messier and other Vivendi employees during the period from 2000 to 2002, warning them of financial difficulties Vivendi was facing at the time. Special App\u2019x 364. As Plaintiffs pointed out to the jury, Hannezo\u2019s communications about Vivendi\u2019s deteriorating financial health stood in sharp contrast to Vivendi\u2019s rosy public statements. Plaintiffs also presented the testimony of former Vivendi employees, who generally corroborated the bleak internal view presented by the Book of Warnings. Defendants, meanwhile, called Messier and Hannezo to testify that Vivendi\u2019s optimistic public statements regarding earnings and growth were in fact accurate at the time they were made. Defendants also emphasized that Vi-vendi never actually experienced a full-blown liquidity crisis or defaulted on a loan. According to Defendants, the events that occurred in the summer of 2002 merely reflected a transient hitch, from which the company ultimately rebounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">\u25a0 The jury began its deliberations in early January 2010. The seventy-two-page final jury verdict form identified fifty-seven' alleged misstatements/ some of which were alleged against Viv\u00e9ndi only, and others of which were alleged against Vivendi and Messier and/or Hannezo. Among other things, the final jury verdict form' asked the jury to determine whether Plaintiffs had proven the elements of their \u00a7 10(b) claim with respect to each of the fifty-seven statements for each Defendant against whom that false statement was alleged. It also asked the jury to determine whether Messier and Hannezo had violated \u00a7 20(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>After fourteen days of deliberation, the jury reached a verdict. The jury found that neither Messier nor Hannezo was liable under \u00a7 10(b) or \u00a7 20(a) for any of the alleged misstatements. However, it found Vivendi liable under \u00a7 10(b) for all fifty-seven alleged misstatements. The district court denied Vivendi\u2019s motions for judgment as a matter of law and for a new trial on February 17, 2011, with one exception: it awarded Vivendi judgment as a matter of law with respect to one statement.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See In re Vivendi Universal, S.A. Secs. Litig., </em>765 F.Supp.2d 512, 545 (S.D.N.Y. 2011). This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">I. Plaintiffs\u2019 Theory of the Case</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">Vivendi first challenges Plaintiffs\u2019 theory of the case as well as the way that Plaintiffs presented that theory at trial. According to Vivendi, Plaintiffs were required to prove their case \u201cstatement-by-statement.\u201d Vivendi Br. 2. Vivendi suggests that throughout the trial, Plaintiffs did not focus on specifically alleged fraudulent statements, but rather, argued generally that the company failed to disclose a liquidity risk (an approach Vivendi refers to as the theory of \u201cunitary omission\u201d). <em>Id. </em>at 35. Vivendi contends that Plaintiffs thus sought to prove that it committed securities fraud with respect to no particular statement at all. Only at the eleventh hour and after the close of evidence at trial, Vivendi continues, did Plaintiffs in fact identify the fifty-seven alleged misstatements for which they sought to hold Viven-di liable. The result, according to Vivendi, was that Plaintiffs presented no actionable claim of securities fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-11\">Vivendi thus argues that Plaintiffs\u2019 supposed failure to define a specific set of alleged misstatements earlier in the trial had the effect of \u201celiminatfing] the foundational element of a claim for securities fraud\u201d under \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5: \u201ca specific false or misleading statement.\u201d Vivendi Br. 41. Under Rule 10b-5, it is unlawful to (1) \u201cmake any untrue statement of a material fact,\u201d or (2) \u201comit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made ... not misleading.\u201d 17 C.F.R. .\u00a7 240.10b-5(b). Thus, to support a finding of liability, Rule 10b-5 expressly requires an actual <em>statement, </em>one that \u215b either \u201cuntrue\u201d outright or \u201cmisleading\u201d by virtue of what it omits to state. Absent an actual statement, a complete failure to make a statement\u2014in other words, a \u201cpure omission,\u201d <em>Litwin v. Blackstone Grp., L.P., </em>634 F.3d 706, 719 (2d Cir. 2011)\u2014\u201cis actionable under the securities laws only when the corporation is subject to a duty to disclose the omitted facts,\u201d <em>Stratte-McClure v. Morgan Stanley, </em>776 F.3d 94, 101 (2d Cir. 2015) (quoting <em>In re Time Warner Inc. Secs. Litig., </em>9 F.3d 259, 267 (2d Cir. 1993)); <em>see also Basic Inc. v. Levinson, </em>485 U.S. 224, 239 n.17, 108 S.Ct. 978, 99 L.Ed.2d 194 (1988).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> And in and of themselves, \u201c\u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 do not create an affirmative duty to disclose any and all material information.\u201d <em>Matrixx Initiatives, Inc. v. Siracusano, </em>563 U.S. 27, 44, 131 S.Ct. 1309, 179 L.Ed.2d 398 (2011). No such duty arises \u201cmerely because a reasonable investor would very much like to know\u201d that information. <em>In re Time Warner, </em>9 F.3d at 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-12\">\u201cPure omissions,\u201d of course, must be distinguished from \u201chalf-truths\u201d\u2014statements that are misleading under the sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>ond prong of Rule 10b-5 by virtue of what they omit to disclose.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>See S.E.C, v.

United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 136 S.Ct. 1989, 2000 <em>&amp; </em>n.3, 195 L.Ed.2d 348 (2016) (noting that the principle that \u201chalf-truths\u2014representations that state the truth only so far as it goes, while omitting critical qualifying information\u2014can be actionable misrepresentations\u201d applies in the \u201csecurities law\u201d context (citing <em>Matrixx, </em>563 U.S. at 44, 131 S.Ct. 1309)). The rule against half-truths, or statements that are misleading by omission, comports with the common-law tort of fraudulent misrepresentation, according to which \u201ca statement that contains only favorable matters and omits all reference to unfavorable matters is as much a false representation as if all the facts stated were untrue.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Torts, \u00a7 529, cmt. <em>a </em>(1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">It is undisputed that Vivendi had no legal duty to disclose its liquidity risk, such that Plaintiffs could not hold Vivendi liable simply for its silence on the subject. Viven-di therefore contends that Plaintiffs\u2019 presentation of the case effectively vitiated the requirement that the Plaintiffs prove Vi-vendi made a false or misleading statement. As a result, Vivendi argues, the jury necessarily held Vivendi liable for failing to disclose something that it had no legal duty to disclose. Simply put, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-10\">The record does not support Vivendi\u2019s suggestion that Plaintiffs presented their case to the jury on the theory that Vivendi violated \u00a7 10(b) by remaining completely silent on the subject of its liquidity risk. To be sure, over the course of the litigation below, Plaintiffs were at times less than precise in articulating their theory of liability. In Plaintiffs\u2019 opening statements, for example, counsel for Plaintiffs remarked at points that Plaintiffs were \u201cgoing to prove ,.. that the defendant <em>failed to tell the truth </em>about the growing problems about its liquidity.\u201d Trial Tr. 128 (emphasis added). In isolation, this statement could be taken to suggest that Plaintiffs would attempt to prove that Vivendi was liable <em>merely </em>for failing to disclose the company\u2019s liquidity risk, although, even in isolation, it is at least as easy to understand the statement as an accusation that Viven-di had lied about the subject. In context, however, Plaintiffs\u2019 opening statements made clear that the <em>way </em>in which they alleged that Vivendi \u201cfailed to tell the truth\u201d was by making affirmative statements that. were either outright lies or misleading half-truths. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 128-29 (noting, two lines later, that Vivendi \u2018.\u2018gave reports about how great the company was doing and, in doing so, ... completely disregarded alarms that Vivendi\u2019s own employees ... were sounding inside Vivendi\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-11\">Indeed, counsel for Plaintiffs went on in that opening statement to ask the jury to \u201ctake a look at some examples\u201d of alleged misstatements by Vivendi, Trial Tr; 141, and consider how those statements compared to the actual situation inside Vivendi at the time Vivendi made the statements, <em>see </em>Trial Tr, 142-79. Essentially all of the examples provided were ultimately submit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>ted to the jury for consideration. <em>Compare </em>Trial Tr. 142, <em>with- </em>Special App\u2019x 315 (Statement 3); <em>compare </em>Trial Tr. 152-53, <em>with </em>Special App\u2019x 316 (Statement 5); compare Trial Tr. 154-55, <em>with </em>Special App\u2019x 316 (Statement 6); <em>compare </em>Trial Tr. 162, <em>with </em>Special App\u2019x 320 (Statement 18); <em>compare </em>Trial Tr. 167, <em>with </em>Special App\u2019x 324 (Statement 32); <em>compare </em>Trial Tr. 167-68, <em>with </em>Special App\u2019x 324 (Statement 33); <em>compare </em>Trial Tr. 169, <em>mth </em>Special App\u2019x 324 (Statement 34); <em>compare </em>Trial Tr. 169-70, <em>ivith </em>Special App\u2019x 324-25 (Statement 35); <em>compare </em>Trial Tr. 171, <em>with </em>Special App\u2019x 326 (Statement 40); <em>compare </em>Trial Tr. 172, <em>with </em>Special App\u2019x 327 (Statement 42); <em>compare </em>Trial Tr. 173, <em>with </em>Special App\u2019x 329 (Statement 51); <em>compare </em>Trial Tr. 177, <em>with </em>Special App\u2019x 330 (Statement 55).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">It is. true that Plaintiffs initially proposed to Judge Holwell a jury verdict form that did not include a list of specific alleged misstatements.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>In re .Vivendi, </em>765 F.Supp.2d at 577. It is also true that at oral argument on Vivendi\u2019s renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law, which took place after trial, Plaintiffs suggested that their initial proposed jury verdict form embodied the theory that Viven-di had made \u201ca single unitary omission ... concerning Vivendi\u2019s true liquidity risk\u201d that the Plaintiffs believed \u201cmanifested in many different ways and with respect to many different statements,\u201d and thus that might not easily boil down into a discrete set of specific alleged misstatements. J.A. 3693.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">At trial, however, Judge Holwell insisted on a more specific approach. After \u201creviewing] the verdict forms used in several [then-]recent securities class actions tried before a jury,\u201d Judge Holwell concluded that Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed jury verdict form was inadequate because \u201c[u]nder the plain language of Rule 10b-5, an \u2018omission\u2019 is not a violation unless plaintiffs can point to statements that were made misleading by the omitted facts.\u201d a <em>In re Vivendi, </em>765 F.Supp.2d at 578. Because failing to identify a discrete set of statements in the verdict form might thus invite a verdict that would be inconsistent with this language\", Judge Holwell \u201casked [Plaintiffs' to propose a[ ] ... verdict form that identified specific misstatements.\u201d\" <em>Id. </em>The final jury-verdict form thus asked, with respect to <em>each </em>statement and in regard to each Defendant, whether \u201cplaintiffs [have] proven <em>each element </em>of their Section 10(b) claim.\u201d <em>E.g., </em>Special App\u2019x 243 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">At closing argument after the district court finalized the jury verdict form, counsel for Plaintiffs walked through the fifty-seven alleged misstatements, highlighting with respect to each one the evidence that Plaintiffs believed supported a finding of securities fraud. Repeatedly, counsel for Plaintiffs asked the jury to consider the disparity between Vivendi\u2019s \u201cinside reality\u201d and its \u201coutside message.\u201d <em>See </em>Trial Tr. 7294-365. From opening statements to closing arguments, then, Plaintiffs presented to the jury a theory of securities-fraud liability predicated on Vivendi\u2019s statements, not its silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>In any event, \u201cwe review the proof at trial .only by reference to th[e] charged theory.\u201d <em>United States ex rel. O\u2019Donnell v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., </em>822 F.3d 650, 663 (2d Cir. 2016). As in <em>O\u2019Donnell, </em>the record here \u201cshows that the jury was charged only as to a theory of fraud through an affirmative misstatement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In keeping with the final jury verdict form, Judge Holwell instructed the jury that Plaintiffs had to \u201cprove by a preponderance of the evidence that during the class period ... [Vivendi] made a false or misleading. statement or omitted to state a fact which made what was said under the circumstances misleading.\u201d Trial Tr. 7512. Far from charging, the jury on what Viven-di terms a \u201c \u2018pure-omission\u2019 theory,\u201d Viven-di Br. 2, Judge Holwell informed the jury that Vivendi was \u201cnot required to disclose every piece of material information\u201d it possessed, Trial Tr. 7513. He further expressly distinguished between so-called \u201cpure omissions\u201d and statements that are misleading by virtue of what they omit to disclose. <em>See id. </em>It is simply incorrect, then, to say that Plaintiffs \u201csecured a jury verdict based on \u2018proof [of the six elements of a private 10b-5 action] <em>as to no 'particular statement.\u201d </em>Vivendi Br. 41. In light of the Plaintiffs\u2019 own presentation of their case, it does not appear that they in fact presented a \u201cpure omission\u201d theory, as Vivendi argues. And reviewing the proof at trial with reference to the <em>charged </em>theory, we discern no basis for concluding that the jury verdict was based on a theory other than the one on which the jury was, in fact, instructed.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">In short, Plaintiffs presented a case to the jury based on Vivendi\u2019s alleged misstatements, and the jury entered a verdict against Vivendi based on fifty-seven of them. We thus reject Vivendi\u2019s contention that the way in which Plaintiffs tried and proved their case had the effect of vitiating an essential element of their \u00a7 10(b) claim: proving that Vivendi made materially false or misleading statements.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>II. Materially False or Misleading Statements</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">Having identified no reversible 'error stemming from the manner in which Plaintiffs presented and identified statements at trial, we turn to the statements themselves. Vivendi contests liability for certain statements on the ground that they were non-actionable opinion, puffery, or forward-looking statements. Separately, Vi-vendi also contests liability for <em>all </em>of-the statements on the ground that they all rested on an impermissible \u201cliquidity risk theory\u201d of liability. We address these arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">1. Opinion Statements</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">Vivendi first argues that certain statements (or sub-statements) are non-actionable statements of opinion. This argument is not preserved for appellate review, as Vivendi failed to contend that certain statements were non-actionable as opinions , in its motions for judgment as a matter of law, even after the parties agreed upon the set of statements the jury would consider. <em>See Kirsch v. Fleet Street, Ltd., </em>148 F.Sd 149, 164 (2d Cir. 1998). Recognizing this, Vivendi now tries to excuse its failure to raise this argument below in several ways. Vivendi first points out that it objected to statements as opinions in its motion to dismiss, which it filed in 2003. This argument can be rejected easily. Raising this argument in a motion to dismiss did not sufficiently alert the district court to the existence of the argument more than six years later, when Vi-vendi was required to raise it in its Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50 motions at trial. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">Second, Vivendi suggests that the late submission of the actual statements to the jury prevented Vivendi from challenging certain statements as opinion statements. Even assuming this argument to be otherwise colorable, Vivendi\u2019s own submissions to the district court belie this claim. Specifically, Vivendi\u2019s post-trial Rule 50(b) renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law clearly challenged specific statements on the ground that they were non-actionable <em>fonvard-loohing </em>statements; it also (in a footnote) challenged certain statements on the ground that they were inactionable <em>puffery. </em>Given these challenges, Vivendi cannot now argue that the timing of Plaintiffs\u2019 identification of a specific set of statements prevented it from <em>also </em>challenging specific -statements on the ground that they were non-actionable <em>opinion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b267-12\">Finally, Vivendi contends that intervening authority\u2014by way of <em>Fait v. Regions Fin. Corp., </em>655 F.3d 105 (2d Cir. 2011), and <em>Omnicare, Inc. v. Laborers Dist. Council Constr. Indus. Pension Fund, </em>\u2014 U.S. -,135 S.Ct. 1318, 191 L.Ed.2d 253 (2015)\u2014excuses its failure to raise the argument below. This argument, too,' lacks merit. To excuse waiver on the grounds of intervening authority, it is not enough to argue that the intervening authority may have sharpened or otherwise elaborated upon an argument. Rather, the intervening authority ' must \u2019 have established an argument that was \u201cnot known to be available\u201d to the party seeking to excuse waiver at the first opportunity that the party had to raise the argument. <em>Gucci Am., Inc. v. Weixing Li, </em>768 F.3d 122, 135 (2d Cir. 2014) (quoting <em>Hawknet, Ltd. v. Overseas Shipping Agencies, </em>590 F.3d 87, 92 (2d Cir. 2009)); <em>see also Holzsager v. Valley Hosp., </em>646 F.2d 792, 796 (2d Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>1981). Not so with the decisions Vivendi claims constitute intervening authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">For purposes of the claim Vivendi makes on appeal, neither <em>Fait </em>nor <em>Omni-care </em>established an argument regarding the actionability of opinion statements that was previously unknown. As both <em>Fait </em>and <em>Omnicare </em>acknowledge, <em>Virginia Bankshares v. Sandberg, </em>501 U.S. 1088, 1090-98, 111 S.Ct. 2749, 115 L.Ed.2d 929 (1991), addressed the circumstances under which liability may extend to statements of opinion' or belief expressed in proxy solicitations. <em>See Fait, </em>655 F.3d at 110; <em>Omnicare, </em>135 S.Ct. at 1326-27 &amp; n.2. <em>Fait </em>and <em>Om-nicare </em>merely expanded upon an uncontroversial point already made clear by <em>Virginia Bankshares: </em>that although statements expressing opinions may not be grounds for liability when they are not false or misleading in context to a reasonable investor, such statements are \u201cnot beyond the purview\u201d of the federal securities statutes. <em>Fait, </em>.655 F.3d at 110; <em>see also Omnicare, </em>135 S.Ct. at 1329 (\u201c[I]f a registration statement omits material facts about the issuer\u2019s inquiry into or knowledge concerning a statement of opinion, and if those facts conflict with what a reasonable investor would take from the statement itself, then \u00a7 U[] . creates liability. An opinion statement, however, is not necessarily misleading ydien an issuer knows, but fails to disclose, some fact cutting the other way.\u201d). Indeed, we made similar observations even before <em>Fait </em>or <em>Omnicare. See, e.g., In re Int\u2019l Bus. Machs. Corp. Secs. Litig., </em>163 F.3d 102, 107 (2d Cir. 1998) (\u201cStatements that are opinions ... are not <em>per s\u00e9 </em>inactionable under the securities laws.\u201d); <em>In re Time Warner, </em>9 F.3d at 266 (2d Cir. 1993) (noting that \u201cexpressions of opinion\u201d are \u201cnot beyond the reach of the securities laws\u201d (citing, <em>inter alia, Virginia Bankshares, </em>501 U.S. at 1088-97, 111 S.Ct. 2749)).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">The argument that certain statements are not materially false or misleading because they contain only opinions was therefore known to be available prior to <em>Fait </em>and <em>Omnicare. Cf. Gucci Am., Inc., </em>768 F.3d at 135-36 (concluding that a defendant did not \u201cwaive its personal jurisdiction objection\u201d when, prior to an intervening decision, \u201ccontrolling precedent in this Circuit made it clear that [the defendant] ... <em>was </em>properly subject to general personal jurisdiction\u201d (emphasis in original)); Haw<em>knet, </em>590 F.3d at 91-92 (concluding that a defendant could raise an argument on appeal that the defendant did not raise before the district court because intervening authority \u201cprovided [the] defendant with a new objection\u201d that, prior to the intervening decision, \u201cwould have been <em>directly contrary </em>to controlling precedent in this Circuit\u201d (emphasis added)). Although <em>Fait </em>and <em>Omnicare </em>may have provided a stronger basis for such an objection, having a better argument on appeal is not tantamount to having a previously unknown argument. As it required not \u201cclairvoyance\u201d but \u201cconscientiousness\u201d on Vivendi\u2019s part to object to certain statements on the basis that they were non-actionable opinion statements, Vivendi\u2019s reliance on <em>Fait </em>and <em>Omnicare </em>as intervening authority is unavailing. <em>See id. </em>at 92 (\u201c[T]he doctrine of waiver- demands conscientiousness, not clairvoyance, from parties;\u201d). Finding none of Vivendi\u2019s reasons for excusing -its failure to raise the opinion argument below convincing, we decline to consider the argument on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">2. Puffery</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">Vivendi next contends that several statements are non-actionable puffery. Vivendi raised this argument only in a footnote in its Rule 50(b) renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law, though the district court considered, and rejected, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>argument on the merits. <em>Cf. Fortress Bible Church v. Feiner, </em>694 F.3d 208, 216 n.3 (2d Cir. 2012). Assuming this footnote was sufficient to present the argument to the district court and thus preserve it for appellate review, the statements of which Vi-vendi complains are simply not puffery.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">Puffery encompasses \u201cstatements [that] are too general to cause a reasonable investor to rely upon them,\u201d <em>ECA, Local 134 IBEW Joint Pension Trust of Chicago v. JP Morgan Chase Co., </em>553 F.3d 187, 206 (2d Cir. 2009), and thus \u201ccannot have misled a reasonable investor,\u201d <em>San Leandro Emergency Med. Grp. Profit Sharing Plan v. Philip Morris Cos., </em>75 F.3d 801, 811 (2d Cir. 1996). They are statements that \u201clack the sort of definite positive projections that might require later correction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>In re Time Warner, </em>9 F.3d at 259, 267 (2d Cir. 1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">The jury reasonably concluded that the statements identified by Vivendi as puffery were actionable.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Consider, for example, Vivendi\u2019s June 26, 2001 statement that it \u201cposted RECORD-HIGH NET INCOME, and ha[d] cash available for investing,\u201d Special App\u2019x 318, or its July 23, 2001 representation that \u201c[t]he results produced by Vivendi Universal in the second quarter are well ahead of market consensus,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 319. There was sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that such statements were not so general that a reasonable investor could not have relied upon them in evaluating whether to purchase Vivendi\u2019s stock. <em>Cf. ECA, Local 134 </em>553 F.3d at 205-06 (concluding that \u201cstatements such as the assertion^] that [the defendant company] had \u2018risk management processes [that] are highly disciplined and designed to preserve the integrity of the risk management process\u2019; that [the company] \u2018set the standard for integrity\u2019; and that [the company] would \u2018continue to reposition and strengthen [its] franchises with a focus on financial discipline\u2019 \u201d constituted puffery (citations omitted)); <em>San Leandro, </em>75 F.3d at 806, 811 (concluding that \u201cgeneral announcements,\u201d such as the defendant company\u2019s statement that it \u201c \u2018should deliver income growth consistent with [its] historically superior performance\u2019 \u201d and was \u201c \u2018optimistic about 1993\u2019 \u201d constituted puffery). We thus reject Viven-di\u2019s argument that certain statements found actionable by the jury are statements of puffery that are non-actionable as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">3. Forward-Looking Statements</p>\n<p id=\"b269-10\">Vivendi next argues, that certain statements fall under the safe-harbor provision for \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d under the PSLRA. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-5(c). Under that provision a defendant is not liable if (1) \u201cthe forward-looking statement is identified and accompanied by meaningful cautionary language,\u201d (2) the forward-looking statement \u201cis immaterial,\u201d or (3) \u201cthe plaintiff fails to prove that [the forward-looking statement] was made with actual knowledge that it was false or misleading.\u201d <em>Slayton v. Am. Express Co., </em>604 F.3d 758, 766 (2d Cir. 2010). Because \u201c[t]he safe harbor is written in the disjunctive,\u201d a forward-looking statement is pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>tected under the safe harbor if any of the three prongs applies. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">As an initial matter, Vivendi disputes the district court\u2019s conclusion that \u201c[Plaintiffs challenge the non-forward looking elements of Vivendi\u2019s statements regarding its EBITDA growth, rather than the [forward-looking] elements.\u201d <em>In re Vivendi, </em>765 F.Supp.2d at 569. \u201cThe PSLRA includes several definitions of a forward-looking statement, including \u2018a statement containing a projection of ... income (including income loss), earnings (including earnings loss) per share, ... or other financial items\u2019 and \u2018a statement of future economic performance, including any such statement contained in a discussion and analysis of financial condition by the management.\u2019\u201d <em>Slayton, </em>604 F.3d at 766-67 (quoting 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-5(i)(l)(A) &amp; (C)). However, \u201c[a] statement may contain some elements that look forward and others that do not,\u201d and \u201cforward-looking elements\u201d may be \u201cseverable\u201d from \u201cnon-forward-looking\u201d elements. <em>Iowa Pub. Emps.\u2019 Ret. </em>Sys. <em>v. MF Glob., Ltd., </em>620 F.3d 137, 144 (2d Cir. <em>2010); see also Makor Issues &amp; Rights, Ltd. v. Tellabs Inc., </em>513 F.3d 702, 705 (7th Cir. 2008) '(\u201c[A] mixed present/future statement is not entitled to the safe harbor with respect to the part of the statement that refers to the present.\u201d).-</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">It is clear that at least some of the statements that Vivendi identifies as forward-looking contain present representations, and that it is these\u2019 non-forward-looking elements of those statements that Plaintiffs alleged were false or misleading. Consider the February 14, 2001 alleged misstatement, which Vivendi labels as forward-looking: \u201cVivendi Universal enters its first full year of operations with strong growth prospects and a very strong balance sheet. This new company is off to a fast start and we are very confident that we will meet the very aggressive growth targets we have set for ourselves both at the revenues and EBITDA levels.\u201d Special App\u2019x 316. Although some aspects of this statement could conceivably be characterized as forward-looking, there is nothing prospective about the representation that Vivendi entered 2001 with a \u201cvery strong balance sheet,\u201d which Plaintiffs argued at trial was part of what made Vivendi\u2019s February 14, 2001 statement misleading. <em>See </em>Trial Tr. 7297. The safe-harbor provision does not protect this and other present representations\u2014about \u201cvery strong 2000 results,\u201d Special App\u2019x 316, or achievement of \u201c \u2018aggressive\u2019 incremental EBITDA targets,\u201d Special App\u2019x 320\u2014embedded within statements that Vivendi deems forward-looking.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">To the extent that other statements identified by Vivendi as forward-looking are arguably false or misleading with respect to their forward-looking elements, we need not decide whether those statements, or elements thereof, are indeed forward-looking. Even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that they are, there was sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude that none of the prongs of the PSLRA safe-harbor provision applies to them.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">Contrary to Vivendi\u2019s argument, there was sufficient evidence to support the jury in concluding that any forward-looking statements were not accompanied by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>meaningful cautionary language.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u201cTo avail themselves of safe harbor protection under the meaningful cautionary language prong, defendants must demonstrate that their cautionary language was not boilerplate and conveyed substantive information.\u201d <em>Slayton, </em>604 F.3d at 772. \u201cVague\u201d disclaimers are inadequate. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Although Vivendi points to a miscellany of disclaimers peppered throughout its required SEC filings in 2001 and 2002, there is sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s conclusion that none of them was meaningful. To start, several of the disclaimers highlighted by Vivendi are quite irrelevant to the alleged misstatements at issue. In one, for example, Vivendi warned that factors that \u201ccould cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements\u201d included \u201cinability to identify, develop and achieve success for new products, services and technologies; increased competition and its effect on pricing, spending, third-party relationships and revenue; [and] inability to establish and maintain relationships with commerce, advertising, marketing, technology, and content providers.\u201d J.A. 4167. The considerations mentioned in this disclaimer\u2014success with new products and services, relationships with competitors and third parties, and marketing and advertising efforts\u2014do not bear even tangentially on Vivendi\u2019s liquidity risk. The jury reasonably could have found that this kitchen-sink disclaimer, listing garden-variety business concerns that could affect <em>any </em>company\u2019s financial well-being, was not meaningful cautionary language.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">Vivendi\u2019s disclaimers with respect to the use of EBITDA were no less oblique. In Vivendi\u2019s October 30, 2000 Form F-4 registration statement filing with the SEC, Vivendi stated that it \u201cconsiders operating income to be the key indicator of the operational strength and performance of its business.\u201d J.A. 4681. Vivendi continued to state, however, that while \u201c[a]djusted EBITDA should not be considered an <em>alternative </em>to operating or net income as an indicator of Vivendi\u2019s performance,\u201d or \u201can alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity,\u201d adjusted EBITDA was nevertheless a \u201cpertinent comparative measure\u201d to \u201coperating income.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Given the arguable endorsement of' the EBITDA measure inherent in this language, sufficient evidence supported the jury\u2019s conclusion that such language did not meaningfully caution against reliance on EBITDA figures as a measure of Vivendi\u2019s performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">T\u00farning to the \u201cactual knowledge\u201d prong of the PSLRA safe-harbor provision, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find that Vivendi made the statements with actual knowledge that the statements were false or misleading.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> To take an example, Plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>tiffs presented evidence that Vivendi actually knew that its October 30, 2000 announcement of a 35% EBITDA growth-rate objective was misleading to a reasonable investor. On September 15, 2000, Hannezo circulated an e-mail informing others at Vivendi that \u201cthe analysts will not have it easy to track the purchase accounting benefits\u201d in EBITDA figures. J.A. 4169. Much less would a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>investor, who is not as well-versed at making sense of Vivendi\u2019s disclosures as a financial analyst, be able to discern the impact of purchase accounting.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">To take another example, Vivendi highlights as forward-looking the December 19, 2000 statement that Vivendi would be \u201cfree of debt in its communications businesses\u201d as of January 1, 2001 and have \u201cfree cash flow of more than 2 billion euros for the two coming years.\u201d Special App\u2019x 315. Plaintiffs presented sufficient evidence at trial, however, for a jury to find that Vivendi actually knew that this statement conflicted with internal forecasts of debt and free cash flow and thus was misleading. In December 2000, Vivendi was planning to restructure Seagram\u2019s debt, a process that it knew would incur additional short-term debt and require it to pay substantial premiums on that debt. <em>See </em>Trial Tr. 1305-06, 7295. And just two weeks after Vivendi issued the statement, Hannezo stated in an internal communication that he \u201cbelievefd] that it [was] wrong to reason in terms of ... free cash flow\u201d because \u201cthere [wouldn\u2019t] be any this year.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> J.A. 4059. \u25a0 Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that some of the statements Vivendi claims are purely forward-looking are indeed so, such evidence was sufficient for a jury to find that Vivendi actually knew that its forward-looking statements were false or misleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">4.' Liquidity Risk Theory</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">. In addition to objecting that certain alleged misstatements are non-actionable opinion, puffery, or forward-looking statements, Vivendi lodges a broader attack against the entire set of alleged misstatements. To wit, Vivendi repeatedly protests what.it terms to be Plaintiffs\u2019 impermissible \u201cliquidity risk theory,\u201d under which all of the fifty-seven statements were allegedly false or misleading with respect to Vi-vendi\u2019s liquidity risk. The nub of Vivendi\u2019s argument appears to be that \u201cliquidity risk\u201d is too \u201camorphous\u201d and \u201cephemeral\u201d a concept for <em>any </em>statement to be false or misleading with respect'to it, much less all fifty-seven statements at issue here. Viven-di Br. 51, 88.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">But, even assuming that this argument has separate purchase from the more specific arguments Vivendi makes as to the actionability of the statements,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> \u201cliquidity risk\u201d is not so \u201camorphous\u201d or \u201cephemeral\u201d a concept as Vivendi would lead us to believe. As Plaintiffs defined it at trial, liquidity is \u201cthe ease or difficulty with which\u2019a company can timely meet its financial obligations and fund its operations.\u201d Trial Tr. 128; <em>see also </em>Trial Tr. 3481 (Nye testifying that liquidity is \u201cthe ability to pay fixed obligations\u201d). Liquidity <em>risk, </em>then, is simply a financial-accounting term for the concept of being \u201cdebt rich and cash poor.\u201d Trial Tr. 141. Further, to the extent that liquidity risk is not a <em>perfectly </em>defined concept with rigid outer bounds, that does not necessarily preclude liability for securities fraud. The federal securities laws do not protect against only those false and misleading statements that are false or misleading with respect to very specific material facts. <em>See, e.g., Suez Equity Inv\u2019rs, L.P. v. Toronto-Dominion Bank, </em>250 F.3d 87, 97-99 (2d Cir. 2001) (conclud-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>tag that plaintiffs\u2019 allegations were sufficient to state a claim that certain statements fraudulently concealed a company executive\u2019s \u201cfinancial and business problems,\u201d \u201clack of skill,\u201d and \u201cinability to run the [company]\u201d). The jury found that knowledge of Vivendi\u2019s true liquidity risk at any given time would have been material to a reasonable investor and that the fifty-seven statements were individually false or misleading with respect to this risk. Without opining on whether there are indeed concepts so amorphous or broad that their concealment cannot support an actionable theory under \u00a7 10(b) as a matter of law, liquidity risk as defined in this case was not such a concept.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">The question, then, is whether there was sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s finding that all of the fifty-six statements (excluding the statement on which the district court granted Vivendi judgment as a matter of law) were materially false or misleading with respect to liquidity risk. \u201cThe test for whether a statement is materially misleading under Section 10(b)\u201d is not whether the statement is misleading in and of itself, but \u201cwhether the defendants\u2019 representations, <em>taken together and in context, </em>would have misled a reasonable investor.\u201d <em>Rombach v. Chang, 355 </em>F.3d 164, 172 n.7 (2d Cir. 2004) (emphasis added) (quoting <em>I. Meyer Pincus &amp; Assocs. v. Oppenheimer &amp; Co., </em>936 F.2d 759, 761 (2d Cir. 1991)); <em>see also Meyer v. Jinkosolar Holdings Co., Ltd., </em>761 F.3d 245, 250 (2d Cir. 2014) (\u201cThe literal, truth of an isolated statement is insufficient; the proper inquiry requires an examination of defendants\u2019 representations, taken together and in context.\u201d (quoting <em>In re Morgan Stanley Info. Fund Secs. Litig., </em>592 F.3d 347, 366 (2d Cir. 2010))). Whether a misrepresentation is material is \u201cjudged according to an objective standard\u201d that turns on \u201cthe significance of an omitted or misrepresented fact to a reasonable investor.\u201d <em>Amgen Inc. v. Conn. Ret. Plans &amp; Trust Funds, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014\u2014, 133 S.Ct. 1184, 1191, 1195, <em>185 </em>L.Ed.2d 308 (2013) (quoting <em>TSC Indus., Inc. v. Northway, Inc., </em>426 U.S. 438, 445, 96 S.Ct. 2126, 48 L.Ed.2d 757 (1976)).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">We conclude that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find the fifty-six relevant statements materially false or misleading in regards to Vivendi\u2019s true liquidity risk. To be sure, the statements do not each repeat the precise same refrain. Some speak directly to liquidity risk, while others concern components that contributed to Vivendi\u2019s liquidity risk. That individual alleged misstatements may relate to different aspects of a larger problem does not necessarily subvert a finding of fraud, however. It would be perverse if companies could escape liability for securities fraud simply by disseminating a network of interrelated lies, each one slightly distinct from the other, but all collectively aimed at perpetuating a broader, material lie. Where a company seeks fraudulently to hide a particularly large problem with multiple. contributing factors, it is quite probable that the company will have to lie about a number of related topics in order successfully to conceal the larger issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">Just so here. -Vivendi\u2019s alleged fraud (in the jury\u2019s reasonable estimation) is remarkable in part because the problem that Vivendi sought to conceal from the public was so vast, and touched upon so, many aspects of its business, that a few scattered misstatements would not have sufficed to mask it. Vivendi needed both to systematically misrepresent its ability to satisfy its liquidity demands, and also to assiduously conceal any material facts (of which there were many) that would call into question its ability to meet its liquidity demands.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">Consider, for instance, Vivendi\u2019s statements about its self-described \u201caggressive\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>EBITDA growth rates, which Vivendi consistently advertised as a point of strength. <em>E.g., </em>Special App\u2019x 317 (Statement 9: \u201c[F]or first quarter of 2001, the Company generated very strong \u2022 EBITDA ... growth with 900 million euros, an increase of 112% or an incremental 475 million euros over the first quarter of the prior year.\u201d (first alteration in original)); <em>id. </em>at 320 (Statement 18: &lt;cWith three quarters of the \u2018aggressive\u2019 incremental EBITDA target for the full year 2001 already achieved in the first half of the year, I can only re-emphasiz[e] our confidence\u201d). As Plaintiffs\u2019 expert testified, high EBITDA suggests high profitability\u2014and by implication, ample cash flow available to service debt. But Vivendi\u2019s high EBITDA targets derived in large part from purchase accounting effects (which are just one-time paper adjustments that cannot readily translate into free cash flow) rather than profits from a company\u2019s business operations (which reflect actual earnings that may translate into free cash flow). And although purchase accounting was the required accounting technique at the time, Plaintiffs submitted evidence that Vivendi emphasized EBITDA growth to the public because financial analysts, to say nothing of the average investor, \u201cw[ould] not have it easy to track the purchase accounting benefits\u201d and the degree to which they contributed to Vivendi\u2019s EBITDA figures. J.A. 4169. Hannezo at one point referred to purchase accounting benefits as \u201caccounting magic\u201d and acknowledged that Vivendi met its EBITDA growth targets thanks to purchase accounting benefits. J.A. 4119; <em>see </em>Trial Tr. 1348-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Further, investors did not digest Viven-di\u2019s statements about EBITDA growth in a vacuum. During the Class Period, Viven-di also made numerous statements about, for example, its cash flow and its debt. Whether misleading or not when made, such statements strongly suggested that Vivendi faced no liquidity risk at the time. Given that Vivendi was in a phase of intense buying, moreover, any investor attuned to Vivendi\u2019s pattern of behavior would be keen to know whether and how Vivendi was making sufficient profits to translate into cash flow that would cover all of Vivendi\u2019s \u2022 sundry debt obligations. We find the evidence introduced at trial sufficient to support the jury\u2019s conclusion that a reasonable investor could find Vi-vendi\u2019s statements about high EBITDA growth misleading for omission to disclose Vivendi\u2019s liquidity risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">We need not detail the evidence in support of the jury\u2019s verdict with respect to each of the remaining alleged misstatements. It suffices to highlight a representative sample of statements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-8\">\u2022 On December 19, 2000, Vivendi stated in a press release that, on a January 1, 2001 pro forma basis, Vivendi would \u201cbe free of debt in its communications businesses, yet ... have a free cash flow of more than 2 billion euros for the two coming years.\u201d Special App\u2019x 315 (Statement 2).

J.A. 853; <em>see 'also In re Pfizer Inc., </em>819 F.3d at 649. Thus, an event study can help an expert determine whether, and the extent to which, the release of certain information caused a stock price to fall. <em>See id. </em>at 649-50. This, in turn, allows an expert to make inferences about the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>degree to which the company\u2019s stock price may have been artificially inflated on the basis of the market\u2019s misconception as to the truth prior to the release of that information. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">The first step for Nye was to identify changes in Yivendi\u2019s stock price during the Class Period that could not be attributed to general market dynamics, but were unique to Vivendi, called \u201cresidual returns.\u201d J.A. 856. Nye began by analyzing the normally observed correlation between Vivendi\u2019s stock price and market- and industry-wide trends over the course of a benchmark \u201ccontrol period.\u201d Identifying this correlation made it \u201cpossible [for Nye] to predict,\u201d for each day of the Class Period, the \u201cpredicted return\u201d on Vivendi\u2019s stock, <em>ie., </em>\u201cwhat the return of [Vivendi\u2019s] security should [have] be[en]\u201d on the basis of the normally observed correlation. <em>In re Pfizer, </em>819 F.3d at 649 (quoting Daniel R. Fischel, <em>Use of Modem Finance Theory in Securities Fraud Cases Involving Actively Traded Securities, </em>38 Bus. Law. 1, 18 (1982)); <em>see also </em>J.A. 856. Nye then calculated, for each day of the Class Period, the \u201cactual return\u201d on Vivendi\u2019s stock, ie., the amount that the company\u2019s stock price actually changed. <em>Id. </em>The residual return on any given day, then, was simply the difference between the actual return and the predicted return.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">Thus, because the residual returns equal the predicted returns subtracted from the actual returns, they factored out the market- and industry-wide effects captured by predicted returns. In other words, the residual returns Nye calculated, as he explained it, isolated the variations in Vivendi\u2019s stock price that were specific to Vivendi, rather than reflective of fluctuations affecting the entire market or the industry in which Vivendi operated. A positive residual return on any given day generally implied that good news about Vivendi emerged, and that the stock price went up accordingly. On the flipside, a negative residual return on any given day generally implied that negative information about Vivendi issued that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">After identifying the residual returns that were statistically significant, Nye then attempted to isolate the residual returns that could be attributed to information related to Vivendi\u2019s liquidity risk, rather than other information related to Vivendi but unrelated to liquidity. To do this, Nye reviewed more than 16,000 documents to determine whether the information released in the market about Vivendi on any particular day had to do with Vivendi\u2019s liquidity risk. His analysis yielded a list of days on which there was either a positive or negative residual return associated with information bearing on Vivendi\u2019s liquidity risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">The final relevant list included nine \u201cnegative\u201d residual return days and one \u201cpositive\u201d residual return day. As Nye testified, the nine negative-return days were days on which negative news about Viven-di\u2019s liquidity risk came out and resulted in inflation, dissipating from Vivendi\u2019s stock price. The one positive-return day, meanwhile, was a day on which positive news pertaining to Vivendi\u2019s liquidity came out and inflation in Vivendi\u2019s stock price increased. The sum of the nine negative-return days, offset by the one positive-return day, came to \u20ac22.52. This amount, Nye concluded, was the maximum loss that investors suffered due to the market\u2019s lack of knowledge about Vivendi\u2019s true liquidity risk, which is to say the maximum artificial inflation that entered Vivendi\u2019s stock price and subsequently dissipated as the market found out about the truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">Inflation reached its highest point, Nye believed, around December 13, 2001. As far as the market knew at that time, Vi-vendi had doubled down on statements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>about Vivendi\u2019s growth projections, but inside the company, Vivendi employees viewed the company\u2019s liquidity situation as dangerous and Hannezo was telling Messier that a credit-downgrade would lead to a liquidity crisis. Thus, in Nye\u2019s opinion, December 13, 2001 was when \u201cthe discrepancy between what the market knew and what Vivendi knew was at its widest.\u201d Trial Tr. 3577.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">If what goes up must come down, as the saying goes, then (Nye assumed) what came down must have gone up. In other words, the artificial inflation that dissipated from Vivendi\u2019s stock price must have entered into the price in the first place. <em>See Glickenhaus &amp; Co. v. Household Int'l Inc., </em>787 F.3d 408, 415 (7th Cir. 2015) (\u201cThe best way to determine the impact of a false statement is to observe what happens when the truth is finally' disclosed and use that to work backward, on the assumption that the lie\u2019s positive effect on the share price is equal to the additive inverse of the truth\u2019s negative effect.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">A key question was how that inflation entered the stock or, more aptly, <em>when. </em>Given that the maximum amount of inflation in the stock was \u20ac22.52, one approach to determining how inflated the stock price was throughout the Class Period would have been to say that all \u20ac22.52 of inflation entered into Vivendi\u2019s stock price from the very beginning of that period, on October 30, 2000, and remained at that level until the date of the first negative residual return, January 7, 2002. There is an obvious downside to this approach, however. Namely, the full amount of the inflation reflects the value of the truth about Viven-di\u2019s liquidity problem at the <em>apex </em>of that problem. But the magnitude of Vivendi\u2019s liquidity risk\u2014and by extension, the amount of liquidity-related inflation in Vi-vendi\u2019s stock\u2014presumably had not reached its peak at the start of the Class Period. Rather, it grew over time as Viven-di\u2019s liquidity situation worsened, and as the distance between the truth and the deception thus widened. Ascribing the full value amount of loss to the very first alleged misstatement would therefore tend to overstate the degree to which Vivendi\u2019s stock was inflated due to the market\u2019s lack of knowledge about Vivendi\u2019s true liquidity risk, at least toward the beginning of the Class Period. Such an approach might thus lead to an inflated recovery for class members who purchased the stock earlier in the Class Period.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">A better method, Nye reasoned, would be to model inflation as increasing over time\u2014that is, as the magnitude of Viven-di\u2019s liquidity risk grew\u2014and reaching its maximum point on December 13. But precisely because the market was not privy to the full extent of Vivendi\u2019s liquidity risk, or so Plaintiffs alleged, the scope of that liquidity risk had no direct measure. Without a direct measure, Nye turned to pot\u00e9n-tial proxy measures. He examined three quantitative proxies for the magnitude of Vivendi\u2019s true liquidity risk at any given time and considered how well each. one might approximate the inflation trajectory over the relevant period. Observing that all three \u201cfollowed similar paths over time, and matched qualitative descriptions of [Vivendi\u2019s] accelerating debt and liquidity problems over time,\u201d Nye selected as a proxy the most conservative of the proxy candidates: the increasing degree to which purchase accounting benefits . contributed to Vivendi\u2019s EBITDA figures. J.A. 864-65. Because Vivendi reported EBITDA figures on a quarterly basis, Nye\u2019s model of inflation showed inflation increasing stepwise on such a basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">It is important to emphasize that,\" ah though Nye calculated the artificial inflation in Vivendi\u2019s stock that was due to the market\u2019s misapprehension about Vivendi\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>true liquidity risk, his analysis did not purport to <em>prove </em>that that misapprehension was caused-by Vivendi\u2019s alleged fraud. Artificial inflation is not necessarily fraud-induced, for a falsehood can exist in the market (and thereby cause artificial inflation) <em>for </em>reasons unrelated to fraudulent conduct. <em>See Glickenhaus, </em>787 F.3d at 418. Nye did not measure inflation actually <em>caused </em>by Vivendi\u2019s alleged fraud nor \u201cassume[] that [Vivendi\u2019s] share price was inflated <em>due to misrepresentations.\u201d Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">It was up to the <em>jury </em>to determine how much, if any, of the artificial inflation identified by Nye was caused by Vivendi\u2019s alleged fraud (and thus by the various statements Vivendi released in the relevant period), by assessing the alleged misstatements and their connection to the misconception in question. Nye\u2019s analysis merely operated on the assumption that Plaintiffs would be able to prove at trial all the necessary elements to succeed on their private 10b-5 action.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Because Nye determined the amount of artificial inflation due to the market\u2019s lack of information about Vivendi\u2019s true liquidity risk, without reference to whether that inflation was a result of Vivendi\u2019s alleged misstatements, Nye\u2019s testimony did not depend on the specific identification of the fifty-seven alleged misstatements that Plaintiffs later identified at the close of trial. By design, then; Nye\u2019s testimony did not' exhibit any obvious correlation between the inflation increases identified by Nye and the timing of the fifty-seven statements. Though fifteen of the fifty-seven statements issued on days where, under Nye\u2019s model, inflation increased, such correlation was not something Nye himself sought to prove. And to the degree that the remaining forty-two statements were not associated with an immediate increase- in inflation under Nye\u2019s model, that would not obviously affect Nye\u2019s own testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">Nevertheless, according to Vivendi, the fact that these forty-two statements did not directly correlate with specific increases in inflation made Nye\u2019s testimony unreliable. Vivendi asserts that the securities laws require an alleged misstatement to have a \u201cprice impact,\u201d and that no such impact exists with respect to these forty-two statements. Vivendi Br. 72. To salvage Nye\u2019s testimony from this supposed legal deficiency, Vivendi continues, the district court had to fabricate an erroneous inflation \u201cmaintenance\u201d theory. That theory, as Vivendi frames it, posits that statements that merely maintain inflation already extant in a company\u2019s stock price, but do not add to that inflation, nonetheless affect a company\u2019s stock price. Vivendi urges us to hold that this purportedly newfangled theory violates the securities laws, and that because Nye\u2019s testimony necessarily rests on the theory, the district court abused its discretion in admitting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">We begin with an assessment of Vivendi\u2019s argument that a statement must be associated with an increase in inflation to be actionable, before turning to what relevance, if any, such an argument had to the district court\u2019s decision to admit Nye\u2019s testimony. The \u201cprice impact\u201d requirement to which Vivendi refers arises in the context of \u201ctransaction causation,\u201d or \u201creliance,\u201d the element of a private \u00a7 10(b) action that asks whether there is \u201ca proper \u2018connection between a defendant\u2019s misrepresentation and a plaintiffs injury,\u2019\u201d or, framed more specifically, whether the fraud affected \u201cthe investor\u2019s decision to engage in the transaction.\u201d <em>Erica P. John Fund, Inc. v. Halliburton Co., </em>563 U.S. 804, 810, 131 S.Ct. 2179-12, 180 L.Ed.2d 24 (2011) <em>(\u201cHalliburton </em>I\u201d) (quoting <em>Basic, </em>485 U.S. at 243, 108 S.Ct. 978). \u201cThe traditional (and most direct) way a plaintiff can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>demonstrate reliance is' by showing that he was aware of a company\u2019s statement and engaged in a relevant <em>transaction\u2014e.g., </em>purchasing a common stock\u2014based on that specific misrepresentation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 810, 131 S.Ct. 2179.

If they do not affect the stock price, then there is \u201cno grounding for any contention that investors indirectly relied on those misrepresentations through their reliance on the integrity of the market price.\u201d <em>Amgen, </em>133 S.Ct. at 1199. Defendants can therefore attempt to rebut the presumption of reliance by introducing \u201cevidence that the misrepresentation did not in fact affect the stock price.\u201d <em>Halliburton Co. v. Erica P. John Fund, Inc., </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 2398, 2414, 189 L.Ed.2d 339 (2014) <em>(\u201cHalliburton II\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">In distinguishing between inflation introduction and inflation maintenance, Vivendi contends that statements that introduce new inflation actually affect a company\u2019s stock price, while statements that merely maintain inflation have ho impact. And the reason they have no \u201cprice impact\u201d is because the \u201cpreexisting inflation would have persisted\u201d had the defendant who made those inflation-maintaining statements \u201csimply remained silent\u201d as was the defendant\u2019s right in the absence of a duty to disclose. Vivendi Reply Br. 33. Thus, Vi-vendi\u2019s objection to the idea that a statement may cause inflation by maintaining it (rather than by increasing it) rests on two premises: that the maintained inflation would have remained if Vivendi had simply remained silent; and that Vivendi had the option of remaining silent even though it in fact chose to speak. Both premises are problematic.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-10\">First, contrary to Vivendi\u2019s implication to the contrary, it is not necessarily the case that preexisting inflation indeed remains in a company\u2019s stock price in the face of that company\u2019s silence, either in a circumstance where the stock is inflated because the market arrived at a misconception on its own or a case in which inflation may itself be traced to a prior fraudulent statement. Perhaps, in the face of silence, inflation <em>could </em>have remained unchanged. But it also could have plummeted rapidly, or gradually, as the truth came out on its own, no longer hidden by a misstatement\u2019s perpetuation of the misconception. Alternately, inflation (or, really, the market\u2019s continued belief in the misconception) could have dissipated gradually because the defendant\u2019s silence in the face of escalating concerns on a particular subject would have all but amounted to an admission. The important point is that the defendant\u2019s alleged misstatement, in a scenario where, , as here, the defendant does <em>not </em>remain silent, prevents the market from discovering which of these scenarios, among other relevant scenarios,. would have materialized had the defendant said nothing at all. In light of the dubiousness of the premise that inflation would have continued in the face of silence, it becomes evident that Vivendi has framed the effect of a given <em>affirmative </em>material misstatement in the context of preexisting inflation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>improperly. It is far more coherent to conclude that such a misstatement does not simply <em>maintain </em>the inflation, but indeed <em>\u201cprevents </em>[the] preexisting inflation in a stock price from dissipating.\u201d <em>FindWhat, </em>658 F.Bd at 1317 (holding that \u201cdefendants whose fraud <em>prevents </em>preexisting inflation in a stock price from dissipating are just as liable as defendants whose fraud introduces inflation into the stock price in the first instance\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">In short, it is hardly obvious that had Vivendi remained silent, the market would indeed have maintained its rosy perception of Vivendi\u2019s liquidity state. Even were that not so, however, Vivendi\u2019s attack on the so-called inflation-maintenance theory suffers from a greater deficiency: in\" suggesting that, had it remained silent, the misconception-induced (whether or not fraud-induced) inflation would have persisted in the market price, Vivendi assumes it is even <em>relevant </em>what would have happened had it chosen not to speak. Yet in framing the argument this way, Vivendi misunderstands the nature of the obligations a company takes upon itself at the moment it <em>chooses, </em>even without obligation, to speak. It is well-established precedent in this Circuit that \u201conce a company speaks on an issue or topic, there is a duty to tell the whole truth,\u201d \u201c[e]ven when there is no existing independent duty to disclose information\u201d on the issue or topic. <em>Meyer v.

Citibank, N.A., N.Y., </em>295 F.3d 312, 331 (2d Cir. 2002) (\u201c[T]he lack of an independent duty [to disclose] is not ... a defense to ... liability[,] because upon choosing to speak, one must speak truthfully about material issues.\u201d). That is because, at the moment the company chooses to speak, it takes upon itself the obligation to <em>speak truthfully, </em>and it is the breach of <em>that </em>obligation which forms the basis for the \u00a7 10(b) claim. Framed as such, it becomes clear that, once a company chooses to speak, the proper question for purposes of our inquiry into price impact is not what might have happened had a company remained silent, but what would have happened if it had spoken <em>truthfully. </em>And there is little need to speculate what would have happened to the inflation in Vivendi\u2019s stock price had it released to the public not a rosy picture of its liquidity state, but the misgivings its executives were sharing behind the scenes.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">Vivendi\u2019s argument thus rests on erro-neohs principles that, once dispelled, make clear that it is hardly illogical or inconsistent with precedent to find that a statement may cause inflation not simply by <em>adding </em>it to a stock, but by maintaining it. Were this not the case, companies could eschew securities-fraud liability whenever they actively perpetuate <em>(ie., </em>though affirmative misstatements) inflation that is already extant in their stock price, as long as they cannot be found liable for whatever originally introduced the inflation. Indeed, under Vivendi\u2019s approach, companies (like Vivendi) would have every incentive to maintain inflation that already exists in their stock price by making false or misleading statements. After all, the alternatives would only operate to the company\u2019s detriment: remaining silent, as already noted, could allow the inflation to dissipate, and making true statements on the issue would <em>ensure </em>that the inflation dissipates immediately.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">A hypothetical helps illustrate the point. Suppose an automobile manufacturer widely praised for selling the world\u2019s safest cars plans to release a new model (\u201cModel V\u201d) in the near future. The market believes that Model V, like all of the company\u2019s- previous models, is- safe, or has no reason to think otherwise. In fact, the automobile manufacturer knows that Model V has failed crash test after crash test; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>it is, in short, simply unfit to be on the road. To protect its stock price, however, the automobile manufacturer informs the market, as per routine industry practice, that Model V has passed all safety tests. When the truth eventually reaches the market, the automobile manufacturer\u2019s stock price bottoms out.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">In addition to potentially being liable for any number of things if Model V indeed makes it to the market, the automobile manufacturer has almost certainly committed securities fraud. And the question of the automobile manufacturer\u2019s liability for securities fraud does not turn on whether inflation moved incrementally upwards when the company represented to the market that the new model passed all safety tests. Nor does it rest on whether the market originally arrived at a misconception about the model\u2019s safety on its own, or whether the company led the market to that misconception in the first place. \u201cWe decline to erect a <em>per se </em>rule that, once a market is already misinformed about a particular truth, corporations are free to knowingly and intentionally reinforce material misconceptions by repeating falsehoods with impunity.\u201d <em>FindWhat, </em>658 F.3d at 1317. \u201cDefendants who commit fraud to prop up an already inflated stock price do not get an automatic free pass under the securities laws.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">In rejecting Vivendi\u2019s position that an alleged misstatement must be associated with an increase in inflation to have a \u201cprice impact,\u201d we join in the Seventh and Eleventh Circuits\u2019 conclusion that \u201ctheories of \u2018inflation maintenance\u2019 and \u2018inflation introduction\u2019 are not separate legal categories.\u201d <em>Glickenhaus, </em>787 F.3d at 418; <em>FindWhat, </em>658 F.3d at 1316 (\u201cThere is no reason to draw any legal distinction between fraudulent statements that wrongfully <em>prolong </em>the presence of inflation in a stock price and fraudulent statements that initially <em>introduce </em>that inflation.\u201d (emphases added)). Put differently, we agree with the Seventh and Eleventh Circuits that securities-fraud defendants cannot avoid liability for an alleged misstatement merely because the misstatement is not associated with an uptick in inflation.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-10\">All of that said, it is unclear how Vivendi\u2019s \u201cprice impact\u201d argument, even were it valid, bears on the question here: whether the district court abused its discretion in concluding that Nye\u2019s testimony \u201crest[ed] on a reliable foundation and, [was] relevant to the task at hand.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>506 F.3d at 160 (quoting <em>Daubert, </em>509 U.S. at 597, 113 S.Ct. 2786). Nye\u2019s model measured \u201c \u2018actual inflation\u2019\u2014inflation due to investors not knowing the truth\u201d about Vivendi\u2019s liquidity risk.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>Glickenhaus, </em>787 F.3d at 418. And it identified the amount of inflation due to investors not knowing the truth <em>\u201ceven if no false statement [was] ever made[,] </em>because investors might not know the truth for reasons other than false statements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 417. This method of measuring actual inflation, without reference to the timing or nature of a defendant\u2019s alleged misstatements, is commonly employed by experts who provide testimo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>ny on loss causation and/or damages in securities-fraud cases. <em>See, e.g., In re Pfizer, </em>819 F.3d at 649-52; <em>Glickenhaus, </em>787 F.3d at 415-19; <em>FindWhat, </em>658 F.3d at 1313-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">Here, Nye\u2019s testimony is relevant as to loss causation because the total amount of actual inflation that Nye identified is the maximum amount of loss potentially caused by Vivendi\u2019s alleged misstatements. Nye\u2019s testimony is also relevant as to damages because Nye\u2019s model of inflation over the course of the Class Period provides a means for calculating each Plaintiffs damages. <em>See Gushlak, </em>728 F.3d at 197 (explaining that an investor\u2019s damages are generally \u201cequal to \u2018the artificial inflation when the shares were purchased minus the artificial inflation when the shares were sold.\u2019 \u201d (quoting Michael Barclay <em>&amp; </em>Frank C. Torchio, <em>A Comparison of Trading Models Used for Calculating Aggregate Damages in Securities Litigation, </em>64 L. &amp; Contemp. Probs. 105,106 (2001))).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Vivendi\u2019s \u201cprice impact\u201d argument, <em>if </em>successful, would at most imply that Plaintiffs could not establish reliance with respect to <em>some </em>of the fifty-six relevant misstatements. But that would not render Nye\u2019s testimony wholly irrelevant to loss causation or damages; nor would it transform Nye\u2019s calculation of actual inflation into the product of unreliable principles or methods. <em>See In re Pfizer, </em>819 F.3d at 661 (\u201cThe dispositive question [under Rule 702] is whether the testimony will assist the trier of fact ,.. not whether the testimony satisfies the plaintiffs burden on the ultimate issue, at trial.\u201d (quoting <em>Ambrosini v. Labarraque, </em>101 F.3d 129, 135 (D.C. Cir. 1996))). Thus, even if Vivendi\u2019s \u201cprice impact\u201d argument were correct, it would not justify concluding that Nye\u2019s testimony is sufficiently unreliable or unhelpful to the jury that the district court\u2019s admission of that testimony constituted an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">In any event, we do not accept Vivendi\u2019s position that the \u201cprice impact\u201d requirement inherent in the reliance element of a private \u00a7 10(b) action means that an alleged misstatement must be associated with an increase in inflation to have any effect on a company\u2019s stock price.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <em>A forti-ori </em>Nye\u2019s testimony did not have to show such an association for each alleged misstatement in oi-der to \u201crest[ ] on a reliable foundation and [be] relevant to the task at hand.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>506 F.3d at 160 (quoting <em>Daubert, </em>509 U.S. at 597, 113 S.Ct. 2786). As Vivendi has identified no other convincing reason why Nye\u2019s testimony fails to satisfy these basic requirements, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">IV. Loss Causation</p>\n<p id=\"b284-10\">Finally, we address Vivendi\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence to support loss causation. \u201cLoss causation \u2018is the causal link between the alleged misconduct and the economic harm ultimately suffered by the plaintiff.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lentell v. Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., </em>396 F.3d 161, 172 (2d Cir. 2005) (quoting <em>Emergent Capital Inv. Mgmt., LLC v. Stonepath Grp., Inc., </em>343 F.3d 189, 197 (2d Cir. 2003)). In some respects, loss causation resembles the tort-law concept of proximate cause, which generally requires that a plaintiffs injury be the \u201c \u2018foreseeable consequence\u2019 \u201d of the defendant\u2019s conduct. <em>Emergent Capital, </em>343 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>F.3d at 197 (quoting <em>Castellano v. Young &amp; Rubicam, Inc., </em>257 F,3d 171, 186 (2d Cir. 2001)). But this traditional foreseeability test is \u201cimperfect\u201d in the \u00a7 10(b) context, for \u201cit cannot ordinarily be said\u201d that the alleged misstatements themselves, \u201cas opposed to the underlying circumstance that is concealed or misstated\u201d \u201ccause[ ]\u201d investors\u2019 loss. <em>See Lentell, </em>396 F.3d at 173. We thus clarified in <em>Lentell </em>that to establish loss causation, a plaintiff must show that \u201cthe loss [was a] foreseeable\u201d result of the defendant\u2019s conduct <em>(ie., </em>the fraud), <em>\u201cand </em>that the loss [was] caused by the materialization of the \u2014 risk\u201d concealed by the defendant\u2019s alleged fraud. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Put more simply, proof of loss causation requires demonstrating that \u201cthe <em>subject </em>of the fraudulent statement or omission was the cause of the actual loss suffered.\u201d <em>Suez Equity, </em>250 F.3d at 95 (emphasis added). If \u201cthe relationship between the plaintiffs investment loss and the information misstated or concealed by the defendant ... is sufficiently direct, loss causation is established.\u201d <em>Lentell, </em>396 F.3d at 174. \u201c[B]ut if the connection is attenuated, or if the plaintiff fails to \u2018demonstrate a causal connection between the content of the alleged misstatements or omissions and the harm actually suffered,\u2019 a fraud claim will not lie.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Emergent Capital, </em>343 F.3d at 199).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Homing in on the phrase \u201cmaterialization of risk\u201d from <em>Lentell, </em>Vivendi contends that the loss that Plaintiffs sought to establish here was not a materialization of the risk concealed by Vivendi\u2019s alleged misstatements. According to Vivendi, the risk that it allegedly concealed <em>(ie., </em>the risk of a liquidity crisis) must have materialized into a more significant problem <em>(ie., </em>an actual liquidity crisis) in order for Plaintiffs to show that Vivendi\u2019s alleged fraud caused them loss. Since it is undisputed that Vivendi\u2019s liquidity risk \u201cnever materialized\u201d into \u201can objective event such as bankruptcy, default,- or insolvency,\u201d Vi-vendi asserts that Plaintiffs cannot establish loss causation. <em>See </em>Vivendi Br. 83-84 (emphasis omitted). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">Vivendi fails to appreciate that to show loss causation, it is enough that the loss caused by the alleged fraud results from the \u201crelevant truth ... leaking] out.\u201d <em>Dura Pharm., Inc. v. Broudo, </em>544 U.S. 336, 342, 125 S.Ct. 1627, 161 L.Ed.2d 577 (2005); <em>cf. also id. </em>at 344, 125 S.Ct. 1627 (\u201c[T]he Restatement of Torts, in setting forth the judicial consensus [on what a party must show to demonstrate loss], says that a person who \u2018misrepresents the financial condition of a corporation in order to sell its stock\u2019 becomes liable to a relying purchaser \u2018for the loss\u2019 the purchaser sustains <em>\u2018when the facts ... become generally known\u2019 </em>and \u2018as a result\u2019 share value \u2018depreciated].\u2019 \u201d (emphasis added and all but first alteration. in original) (quoting Restatement. (Second) of Torts \u00a7 548A, cmt. <em>b </em>(1977))). Although we have previously stated that a plaintiff can establish loss causation either by showdng a \u201cmaterialization of risk\u201d or by identifying a \u201ccorrective disclosure\u201d that reveals the truth behind the alleged fraud, <em>see Carpenters Pension Trust Fund of St. Louis v. Barclays PLC, </em>750 F.3d 227, 233 (2d Cir. 2014); <em>Omnicom, </em>597 F.3d at 513, our past holdings do not suggest that \u201ccorrective disclosure\u201d and \u201cmaterialization of risk\u201d create fundamentally different pathways for proving loss causation, such that a specific corrective disclosure is the only method by which a plaintiff may prove losses resulting from the revelation of the truth. Indeed, <em>Lentell </em>itself understood \u201cmaterialization of risk\u201d as reflective of the principle that \u201cto establish loss causation, [plaintiffs must show that a] ... misstatement or omission concealed <em>something </em>from the market that, <em>when disclosed, </em>negatively affected the val<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>ue of the security.\u201d <em>Lentell, </em>396 F.3d at 173 (emphases added).-Whether the truth comes out by way of a corrective disclosure describing- the precise fraud inherent in the alleged misstatements, or through events constructively disclosing the fraud, does not alter the basic loss-causation calculus.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">That \u201ccorrective disclosure\u201d and \u201cmaterialization of risk\u201d are not wholly distinct theories of loss causation highlights the flaws of Vivendi\u2019s position. Vivendi\u2019s conception of loss causation would have the effect of insulating companies from securities-fraud liability whenever the thing concealed in a material misstatement never ripens from a mere risk to an out-and-out disaster\u2014unless' a specific corrective disclosure issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">A simple hypothetical helps bring into stark relief why Vivendi cannot be right that the Plaintiffs, short of pointing.to explicit corrective disclosures, had to point to an event, such as a bankruptcy, to demonstrate loss causation in this case. Suppose that a company knows that it faces tremendous risk of bankruptcy, yet fraudulently informs the market that there is no risk of bankruptcy. Soon, the risk becomes too great to. ignore, and a series of events indicating that the company is on the verge of bankruptcy takes place: a major bank backs out of a potential loan agreement with the company; a large deal with another firm falls through after the other firm does due diligence into the company; the company rapidly sells off an abnormally large amount of its assets in an effort to raise capital; and so on. The company\u2019s stock price sinks, indeed becomes all but valueless.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">The company in this hypothetical lied about its <em>risk </em>of bankruptcy\u2014a lie that was separate and distinct from any he about whether the company actually filed for bankruptcy\u2014and events revealing the truth about the company\u2019s <em>risk </em>of bankruptcy caused investors to lose money. Yet, Vivendi would have us believe that, absent a specific corrective disclosure, the actual filing of bankruptcy is the <em>necessary </em>\u201cmaterialization of risk\u201d that must occur in order for the company to have caused investors any loss under \u00a7 10(b). But whether the company caused loss to investors under \u00a7 10(b) does not turn on whether the company actually files Chapter 11 at some point or manages to steer clear of bankruptcy at the last minute. \u201cFraud depends on the state of events when a statement is made, not on what happens later.\u201d <em>Schleicher v. Wendt, </em>618 F.3d 679, 684 (7th Cir. 2010); <em>see also Pommer v. Medtest Corp., </em>961 F.2d 620 (7th Cir. 1992) (\u201cThe securities laws approach matters from an <em>ex ante </em>perspective: just as a statement true when made does not become fraudulent because things unexpectedly go wrong, so a statement materially false when made does not become acceptable because it happens to come true. Good fortune ... does not make the falsehood any the less material.\u201d (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">Here, although no specific corrective disclosure ever exposed the precise extent of Vivendi\u2019s alleged fraud, Plaintiffs\u2019 theory of loss causation nevertheless rested on the revelation of the truth. According to Plaintiffs, Vivendi\u2019s alleged misstatements concealed its liquidity risk, and a series of events in the first half of 2002 made the truth about that liquidity risk come to light. According to Nye\u2019s testimony on loss causation and damages, those events took place on nine days, when the following news reached the market: (1) January 7, 2002 news that Vivendi sold 65 million of its treasury shares; (2) May 3, 2002 news that Moody\u2019s downgraded Vi-vendi\u2019s long-term senior debt to a notch above junk status; (3) June 21, 2002 news that Vivendi sold a stake in its subsidiary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>Vivendi Environnement, despite earlier statements that it would wait to sell; (4) June 24, 2002 news just three days later that Vivendi sold an even larger stake in Vivendi Environnement; (5) July 2, 2002 news that Moody\u2019s downgraded Vivendi\u2019s long-term senior debt to junk status, followed by S&amp;P\u2019s downgrade of Vivendi\u2019s short-term senior debt; (6) July 3, 2002 news that Vivendi acknowledged its short-term liquidity problems and its \u20ac1.8 billion in obligations that were due that very month; (7) July 10, 2002 news that rating agencies cautioned that further downgrades were possible, and that French authorities had raided Vivendi\u2019s Paris headquarters to investigate possible securities fraud; (8) July 15, 2002 news that a member of Vivendi\u2019s board of directors was urging Vivendi quickly to sell Canal+, which was not generating earnings as expected; and (9) August 14, 2002 news that Vivendi planned to sell \u20ac10 billion in assets over the following two years, \u20ac5 billion of which it hoped to sell within just nine months.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">There was ample evidence to support the jury\u2019s finding of a \u201csufficiently direct\u201d \u201crelationship between the ... loss [that Plaintiffs suffered on these nine days] and the information misstated or concealed by [Vivendi].\u201d <em>Lentell, </em>396 F.3d at 174. To take just one example\u2014Vivendi\u2019s January 7, 2002 sale of 55 million treasury shares\u2014 Nye testified at trial that a treasury-share sale of such magnitude indicated to the market that Vivendi \u201cneed[ed] cash badly,\u201d and that \u201cacademic economic literature ... informed] [this] view.\u201d J.A. 2768. Vivendi\u2019s own witness, the company\u2019s credit-rating liaison at the time of the transaction, testified to the effect that there was \u201cno question\u201d that the sale implied to the market that Vivendi needed cash. J.A. 2770-71. This and other evidence presented at trial were sufficient for the jury to conclude that the nine events identified by Nye revealed the truth about Vivendi\u2019s liquidity risk, and that concealment of \u201cthe <em>subject\u201d </em>of Vivendi\u2019s alleged misstatements\u2014its liquidity risk\u2014was therefore \u201cthe cause of the actual loss suffered\u201d by Plaintiffs. <em>Suez Equity, </em>250 F.3d- at 95 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">V. Plaintiffs\u2019 Cross-Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">Plaintiffs set forth two additional contentions on cross-appeal, challenging prior judgments of the district court. Neither has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-9\">Plaintiffs first maintain that, at the class certification stage, the district court improperly excluded certain foreign shareholders from the class based on a concern that some foreign courts may not give preclusive effect' to a class judgment. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions as to whether the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 were met, and in turn whether class certification was appropriate, for abuse of discretion. <em>Gallego v. Northland Grp. Inc., </em>814 F.3d 123, 129 (2d Cir. 2016); <em>In re Initial Public Offerings Secs. Litig., </em>471 F.3d 24, 31-32 (2d Cir. 2006). \u201cThat standard \u25a0 of review is deferential: the district- court is empowered to make a decision\u2014of its choosing\u2014 that falls within a range of permissible decisions, and we will only find \u2018abuse\u2019 when the district court\u2019s decision rests on an error of law or a clearly erroneous factual finding, or its decision cannot be located within the range of permissible decisions.\u201d <em>Gallego, </em>814 F.3d at 129 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-10\">As an initial matter, the district court did not abuse its discretion when, in assessing whether the class action would be \u201csuperior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating [a] controversy,\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3), it considered whether a class judgment would be given preclusive effect in foreign courts. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>Concerns about foreign recognition of our judgments are reasonably related to superiority. As Judge Friendly recognized in <em>Bersch v. Drexel Firestone, Inc., </em>\u201cif defendants prevail against a class[,] they are entitled to a victory no less broad than a defeat would have been,\u201d and so the risk that a foreign court will not grant preclu-sive effect to a class judgment may, as it did in <em>Bersch, </em>counsel against the inclusion of some foreign claimants. 519 F.2d 974, 996-97 (2d Cir. 1975), <em>abrogated in part on other grounds, Morrison v. Nat\u2019l Austl. Bank Ltd., </em>561 U.S. 247, 130 S.Ct. 2869, 177 L.Ed.2d 535 (2010). It was therefore within the district court\u2019s discretion to take that risk into account.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">With respect to the district court\u2019s ultimate determination to exclude some foreign shareholders on superiority grounds, it was Plaintiffs\u2019 burden to establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that its proposed class met the requirements of Rule 23. <em>See In re Am. Int\u2019l Grp., Inc. Secs. Litig., </em>689 F.3d 229, 237-38 (2d Cir. 2012); <em>Myers v. Hertz Corp., </em>624 F.3d 537, 547 (2d Cir. 2010), We recognize that assessing superiority is. a fact-specific inquiry, and we do not opine on how likely it must be that a foreign court will recognize a class judgment in order for Rule 23\u2019s superiority requirement to be met. Here, however, Plaintiffs do not identify <em>any </em>evidence that they presented to the district court which suggested that foreign courts in the countries at issue would grant pre-clusive effect to a class judgment.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The district court accordingly did not abuse its discretion in concluding that, except for shareholders from a few countries, Plaintiffs had not demonstrated superiority.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 second contention is that, after trial, the district court incorrectly dismissed claims by American purchasers of ordinary shares under <em>Morrison v. Nat\u2019l Austl. Bank Ltd., </em>561 U.S. 247, 130 S.Ct. 2869, 177 L.Ed.2d 535 (2010). Plaintiffs contend that (1) Vivendi forfeited any Morrison-based defense because it did not bring its motion to dismiss the claims until after trial, and (2) in any event, the district court should not have dismissed these claims because the purchasers incurred \u201cirrevocable liability\u201d within the United States, and thus were covered by \u00a7 10(b). We review the district court\u2019s decision <em>de novo. In re Air Cargo Shipping Servs. Antitrust Litig., </em>697 F.3d 154, 157 (2d Cir. 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">Vivendi did not forfeit its <em>Morrison </em>argument because, prior to <em>Morrison, </em>its motion was foreclosed by controlling precedent in this Circuit, and parties are not required to raise arguments \u201cdirectly contrary to controlling precedent\u201d to avoid waiving them. <em>Hawknet, </em>590 F.3d at 92 (2d Cir. 2009); <em>see also Holzsager, </em>646 F.2d at 796 (\u201c[A] party cannot be deemed to have waived objections or defenses which were not known to be available at the time they could \u2022 have first been made, especially when it does raise the objections as soon as. their cognizability is made apparent.\u201d). Here, before the Supreme Court decided <em>Morrison </em>in June 2010 (less than a month before Vivendi filed its motion), this Circuit\u2019s conduct and effects tests were the \u201cnorth star of [its] \u00a7 10(b) jurisprudence,\u201d <em>Morrison, </em>561 U.S. at 257, 130 S.Ct. 2869. In <em>Morrison, </em>the Supreme Court struck down those tests and made clear that \u00a7 10(b) applies only to \u201ctransactions in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>securities listed on domestic exchanges, and domestic transactions in other securities,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 267, 130 S.Ct. 2869, thereby providing, for the first time, a -legal basis for Vivendi\u2019s argument that the claims of American purchasers of ordinary shares were not covered by \u00a7 10(b). Vivendi accordingly did not forfeit its right to seek dismissal of those claims under <em>Morrison.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">Plaintiffs also maintain that under this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Absolute Activist Value Master Fund Ltd. v. Ficeto, </em>American purchasers of ordinary shares, and specifically those who acquired shares in the course of the three-way merger between Vivendi, S.A., Canal+ , and Seagram, are protected by \u00a7 10(b) because they incurred \u201cirrevocable liability\u201d while present in the United States, 677 F.3d 60, 67 (2d Cir. 2012). We disagree. In <em>Absolute Activist, </em>we used the concept of \u201cirrevocable liability\u201d to determine what constitutes a \u201cdomestic purchase or sale\u201d under <em>Morrison. Id. </em>at 67-68. We reasoned that when the \u201cparties\u201d to a transaction incur irrevocable liability in the- United States, defined as \u201cbecoming] bound to effectuate the transaction\u201d or \u201centering into a binding contract to purchase or sell securities,\u201d the transaction is domestic and \u00a7 10(b) applies. <em>Id. </em>at 67. To the extent that Plaintiffs rely on the merger as the transaction at issue, the location of the Americans who acquired ordinary shares as a result of the merger, who Plaintiffs admit were not parties to it, is not relevant to the question of whether the merger qualifies as a \u201cdomestic purchase or sale.\u201d Plaintiffs do not otherwise point to any evidence that the parties to the merger incurred irrevocable liability in the United States. The district court therefore appropriately determined that American purchasers of ordinary shares were not protected by \u00a7 10(b) under <em>Morrison.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">We have considered Vivendi\u2019s remaining arguments, as well as Plaintiffs\u2019 remaining cross-appeal arguments, and find them to be without merit. The partial judgment of the district court is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b256-8\">. Judge Rich\u00e1rd J. Holwell presided over the trial.

Plaintiffs do not appeal this determination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b263-9\">. For instance, \"a duty to disclose under [\u00a7 ] 10(b) [or Rule 10b\u20145] can derive from statutes or regulations that obligate a party to speak.\u201d <em>Stratte-McClure, </em>776 F.3d at 102.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b264-9\">. Because a \"pure omission\u201d theory is relatively uncommon in securities litigation, and also not strictly within the letter of Rule lob-5, courts often, to some confusion, use the term \"omission\" when referring to statements that fall under the second prong of Rule 10b-5. <em>See, e.g., Ganino v. Citizens Utils. Co., </em>228 F,3d 154, 161 (2d Cir. 2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b265-6\">. Specifically, when Judge Holwell solicited proposed verdict forms from both sides towards the close of evidence but before closing statements, Plaintiffs requested that the proposed verdict form ..not list specific statements, on the ground that including \u201cnumerous alleged subsidiary statements\u201d would \"breakf] up\u201d and \u201c[f]ragment[ ] [Plaintiffs\u2019 claim in [a] way [that] risks confusing and misleading the\" jury.\u201d' J.A. 1686. Plaintiffs wanted, instead, a straightforward verdict form that asked the jury simply to determine, with respect to each Defendant (Vivendi, Messier, and Hannezo), whether that Defendant \u201cknowingly or recklessly ma[d]e materially misleading statements or omissions that concealed liquidity risks\"-at the company , during the Class Period.\u201d <em>E.g., </em>J.A. 1690.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b266-4\">. Vivendi also argues that Plaintiffs\u2019 supposedly belated identification of a specific set of statements violated the PSLRA\u2019s requirement that \"securities-fraud plaintiffs ... 'specify <em>each </em>statement alleged to have been misleading\u2019 and 'why the statement is misleading.' \u201d Vivendi Br. 38 (emphasis in quoting source) (quoting 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(b)(l)). This argument appears to assume what it seeks to prove: that the PSLRA\u2019s so-called \"specificity requirement,\u201d as Vivendi terms it, Vivendi Br. 40, confines securities-fraud plaintiffs to the particular alleged misstatements identified in their complaint. We identify no such requirement in the PSLRA, which sets out certain pleading standards so as to prevent securities-fraud plaintiffs from filing costly securities class-action suits on the basis of a barely formed hunch, but nowhere binds such plaintiffs to the precise set of alleged misstatements identified in their complaint throughout the entire course of litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Further, many, if not most, of the fifty-seven alleged misstatements <em>were </em>identified in Plaintiffs\u2019 First Amended Consolidated Class Action Complaint, which Plaintiffs filed in November 2003. As for the remaining alleged misstatements included on the final jury verdict form, when the parties were engaged in discovery in 2007, Defendants submitted multiple sets of interrogatories asking Plaintiffs to \"[[Identify and describe each false statement, misleading statement and/or omission of material fact on which you are suing in this Consolidated Action.\u201d <em>E.g., </em>J.A. 1944; J.A. 2055. Defendants described Plaintiffs\u2019 interrogatory responses as \"enormously detailed\u201d documents that reflected the \"great care\u201d with which Plaintiffs \"identified] ... statements that they even conceivably thought that they m[ight] intend to pursue.\" Trial Tr. 6673. And although a small handful of the alleged misstatements on the final jury verdict form did not appear in the First Amended Consolidated Class Action Complaint or Plaintiffs\u2019 interrogatory responses, they were nonetheless detailed in Plaintiffs\u2019 expert reports, which Vi-vendi received during discovery. <em>See id. </em>at 6737-38. We thus agree with the district court \u25a0that Vivendi was \"aware long before trial\u201d both \"that [P]laintiffs believed the fifty-seven [alleged misjstatements ... were misleading\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>and \u201cwhy [P]laintiffs believed each of [those] statements was misleading.\u201d <em>In re Vivendi, </em>765 F.Supp.2d at 579.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b269-7\">. ' Vivendi argues that these statements should not have been submitted to the jury, but does not contend on appeal that the district court was wrong to view the question whether a given statement was inactionable puffery as a fact one. Thus, we assume this to be the case, and we review the jury\u2019s verdict in this regard for sufficiency of the evidence. <em>See Gronowski v. Spencer, </em>424 F.3d 285, 291 (2d Cir. 2005) (\"In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence in support of a jury\u2019s verdict, we examine the evidence in .the light most favorable to the party in whose favor the jury decided, drawing all reasonable inferences in the winning party\u2019s favor.\u201d). \u25a0</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b270-6\">. We consider here only Vivendi\u2019s arguments that: (1) any forward-looking statements were accompanied by meaningful cautionary language, and (2) Plaintiffs failed to show that Vivendi made such statements with actual knowledge that they were false or misleading. To the extent that Vivendi contends that the statements are not material because they did not increase price inflation, we address that argument <em>infra, </em>in Part III.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b271-6\">. The district court instructed the jury to determine whether any forward-looking statements were accompanied by meaningful cautionary language. It further noted in its opinion denying Vivendi's renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law that \u201cit was for the jury to determine whether the cautionary language accompanying any of the statements ... was sufficiently 'meaningful.' \u201d <em>In </em>re <em>Vivendi, </em>765 F.Supp.2d at 567 n.45. Vivendi does not argue on appeal that the meaningfulness of the cautionary language in question was not a factual question (whether or not the district court could have or should have resolved it as a matter of law). As with puffery, we therefore treat the meaningfulness of the cautionary language here as a question of fact that the district court appropriately put to the jury to consider, and review the sufficiency of the evidence in support of the jury\u2019s determination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b271-11\">. Vivendi suggests in its reply brief that, in assessing whether there was sufficient evidence for any reasonable jury to find liability as to these purportedly forward-looking state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>ments, we must defer to the' impaneled jury's answers, in special interrogatories, that Vi-vendi acted recklessly in making each of the fifty-seven statements. Our hands tied by these interrogatory responses, the argument goes, we should limit our inquiry to whether there was sufficient evidence to find the statements not to be forward-looking, as plainly they cannot have been made with actual knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">As an initial matter, Vivendi does not clearly make such an argument, predicated on the special, interrogatories, in its opening brief. <em>See </em>Vivendi Br. 56, Thus, the argument is waived. <em>See JP Morgan Chase Bank v. Altos Hornos de Mexico, S.A. de </em>C.V., 412 F.3d 418, 428 (2d Cir. 2005) (\u201c[A]rguments not made in an appellant's opening brief are waived even if the appellant pursued those arguments in the district court ....\"),</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">It is also without merit. As the Eleventh Circuit has observed, there is a fundamental distinction between an argument that the actual jury's verdict is internally inconsistent (and thus that the court should order a new trial), and an argument that the district court should grant a party judgment as a matter of law on the basis that there is insufficient evidence in the record to support <em>any </em>reasonable jury\u2019s verdict against the movant. <em>See Hubbard </em>v. <em>BankcAtlantic Bancorp, Inc., </em>688 F.3d 713, 716 (11th Cir. 2012) (\"When a court considers a motion for judgment as a matter of law\u2014even after the jury has rendered a verdict\u2014only the sufficiency of the evidence matters. The jury\u2019s findings are irrelevant.\u201d (citation omitted)); <em>cf. United States </em>v. <em>Jespersen, </em>65 F.3d 993, 998 (2d Cir. 1995) (\"[Wjhen reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, the Supreme Court has made it clear that jury verdicts are not to be reviewed for consistency.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">A consistency challenge argues that the jury verdict itself is flawed\u2014and we generally ask in assessing such a claim whether the jury\u2019s findings are \"ineluctably inconsistent,\u201d an inquiry that may require some examination of the record. <em>Cash v. County of Erie, </em>654 F.3d 324, 343 (2d Cir. 2011) (quoting <em>Munafo v. Metro. Transp. Auth., </em>381 F.3d 99, 105 (2d Cir. 2004)). Since the jury itself is capable of correcting such an inconsistency at the judge\u2019s behest, a party must raise a consistency challenge before the district court discharges the jury. <em>See id; </em>at 342. Because success as to such a claim does not suggest that no reasonable jury <em>could have </em>found for the prevailing party, only that the verdict itself could not be reconciled internally, the remedy is not a directed verdict, but a new trial. <em>See id. </em>at 342.</p>\n<p id=\"AeJ\">In contrast, a motion for judgment as a matter of law is not based, on the jury\u2019s verdict, but on the record established at trial. Such a motion must be made <em>before </em>the jury even renders a verdict (and can be granted' at such a time in rare circumstances), and then renewed thereafter. <em>See Chaney v. City of Orlando, </em>483 F.3d 1221, 1228 (11th Cir. 2007) (\"The fact that Rule 50(b) uses the word 'renew[ed]\u2019 makes clear that a Rule 50(b) motion should be decided in the same way it would have been decided prior to the jury\u2019s verdict, and that the jury\u2019s particular findings are not germane to the legal analysis,\u201d). And success on such a motion results not in a new trial, but in a. directed verdict in favor of the mov-ant\u2014and thus reflects the court\u2019s assessment not that the <em>jury </em>has erred, but that the evidence could not support <em>any </em>jury in reaching a verdict against the movant. For these reasons, a judge, assessing a motion for judgment as a matter of law, looks only to the evidence in the record; she is not bound by a jury\u2019s answers in special interrogatories.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-11\">To the degree that Vivendi indeed means to make a consistency (rather than a sufficiency) challenge, that argument (as well as Vivendi\u2019s argument that the findings of liability as to Vivendi, Messier, and Hannezo were inconsistent) was not timely made. <em>See In re Vivendi, </em>765 F.Supp.2d at 550-52 (finding Vivendi waived any challenge to the verdict on consistency grounds by failing to timely object to the verdict); <em>see also Anderson Grp., LLC v. City of Saratoga Springs, </em>805 F.3d 34, 46-47 (2d Cir. 2015). As to the sufficiency argument that <em>is </em>before us, we. consider all the evidence in the record, and are not bound by the jury\u2019s determination in special interrogatories that Vivendi acted recklessly in making the statements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b273-7\">. Hannezo qualified this statement at trial, testifying that it referred to his view that Vivendi would not have enough free cash flow \u201cwhen it comes to buying things like Direct TV or EchoStar or Yahoo.\u201d J.A. 2540-41.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b273-10\">. Indeed, this broader attack echoes specific points made throughout the other challenges in this section. For instance, Vivendi argues that the amorphousness of \"liquidity risk\u201d necessarily rendered statements regarding or concealing such a risk inactionable opinions. <em>See </em>Vivendi Br. 51.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b277-8\"><em>. </em>Nye holds an M.B.A. and a Ph.D. in finance from Stanford University.

As the Seventh Circuit has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-8\">[T]here are two senses of \"inflation.\u201d One is \u201cactual inflation\u201d\u2014just the difference between the stock price and what the price would have been if the truth had been known; this is what the expert\u2019s model measures. The other is \"fraud-induced inflation\u201d\u2014the difference between the stock price and what the price would have been if the defendants had spoken truthfully; this is what the jury determined using the model <em>plus </em>its findings regarding false statements. Before the first false statement is made, there is \u201cactual inflation\u201d in the stock price but no \"fraud-induced inflation\u201d because although the stock is overpriced, misrepresentations are not the cause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-12\"><em>Glickenhaus, </em>787 F.3d at 418.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b284-6\">, To be clear, we do not hold that all statements unassociated with an increase in inflation necessarily have a \u201cprice impact.\u201d We merely hold that such statements do not, as Vivendi argues, categorically <em>lack </em>a \u201cprice impact.\u201d Thus, we do not address whether there may be other reasons, not raised by Vivendi here, why some statements unassociated with an increase in inflation do not affect a company\u2019s stock price.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b288-5\">. , The only evidence that Plaintiffs identify is Vivendi's suggestion in a prior brief that Canada typically grants preclusive effect to class judgments when there are a significant number of Canadian class members.
