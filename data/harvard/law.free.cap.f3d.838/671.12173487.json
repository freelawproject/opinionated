HIGGINSON, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">After a jury tidal in the Southern District of Texas, Duane Michael Sheridan was convicted of two counts of transporting aliens within the United States, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324\u2014one count for transporting Luis Machaen-Lopez and one count for transporting Maria Cruz-Galin-do, both citizens of Mexico. At a checkpoint in Falfurrias, Texas, United States Border Patrol agents found Machaen-Lo-pez and Cruz-Galindo in a large tool box in the back of a pickup truck driven by Sheridan, but owned by Sheridan\u2019s cousin. Sheridan\u2019s defense at trial partly depended on his supposed unawareness of the aliens in the back of the truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-9\">Sheridan now appeals his conviction, arguing that the district court abused its discretion in denying his request for a jury instruction like that found necessary in <em>United States v. Pennington, </em>20 F.3d 593 (5th Cir. 1994). In <em>Pennington, </em>this court held that a jury can infer the knowledge element of unlawful drug possession from the defendant\u2019s control of a vehicle in which the drugs are contained, but that when the drugs are hidden, control alone is not sufficient to prove knowledge. <em>Id. </em>at 598, 600.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-10\">Sheridan requested the following instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-11\">The government may not rely only upon a defendant\u2019s ownership and control of a vehicle to prove the defendant knew that the aliens were present in the vehicle. The government must prove by competent evidence, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant knew the aliens were in the vehicle, and therefore within his possession and control.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-12\">After denying Sheridan\u2019s proposed instruction, the district court instructed the jury according to the Fifth Circuit Pattern Jury Instructions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-13\">For you to find the defendant guilty of [transporting aliens], you must be convinced that the Government has proved each of the following beyond a reasonable doubt: One, that Luis Alberto Ma-chaen-Lopez was an alien who had entered or remained in the United States in violation of the law; Two, that the defendant knew or recklessly disregarded the fact that said alien was in the United States in violation of the law; and Three, that the defendant transported or attempted to transport said alien, within the United States with the intent to further the alien\u2019s unlawful presence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-14\"><em>See generally </em>Fifth Circuit Pattern Jury Instructions (Criminal Cases) 2.01B (2015). The court also instructed that \u201cCount Two is exactly the same,\u201d but applied to Maria Cruz-Galindo as the illegal alien.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-15\">We review the district court\u2019s \u201crefusal to provide a requested jury instruction for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Wright, </em>634 F.3d 770, 775 (5th Cir. 2011) (quoting <em>Cooper Indus., Inc. v. Tarmac Roofing Sys., Inc., </em>276 F.3d 704, 714 (5th Cir. 2002)). A district court abuses its discretion by failing to issue a defendant\u2019s requested instruction if the instruc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>tion \u201c(1) is substantively correct; (2) is not substantially covered in the charge given to the jury; and (3) concerns an important point in the trial so that the failure to give it seriously impairs the defendant\u2019s ability to present effectively a particular defense.\u201d <em>United States v. Simkanin, </em>420 F.3d 397, 410 (5th Cir. 2005). \u201c \u2018It is well-settled,\u2019 however, \u2018that a district court does not err by giving a charge that tracks this Circuit\u2019s pattern jury instructions and that is a correct statement of the law.\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>676 F.3d 491, 507 (5th Cir. 2012) (quoting <em>United States v, Whitfield, </em>590 F.3d 325, 354 (5th Cir. 2009)). Because the district court followed the Fifth' Circuit Pattern Jury Instructions, the only issue is whether the charge is a correct statement of the law. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b697-13\">Sheridan argues that the district court\u2019s instruction (and by extension, the Fifth Circuit Pattern Jury Instruction) \u201ctook for granted Mr. Sheridan\u2019s awareness that \u2018said alien\u2019 (the hidden cargo) was present in the pickup truck.\u201d Sheridan also argues that the instruction \u201cin no way\u201d addresses whether the Government can rely on a defendant\u2019s control of a vehicle to prove that he knew aliens were present within the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-14\">The actual language of the instruction renders Sheridan\u2019s concerns unfounded. A jury\u2019s finding that a defendant \u201cknew or recklessly disregarded the fact that [an] alien was in the United States in violation of the law\u201d requires the jury to find that the defendant knows that a person, who is an alien, exists. Belatedly, the third element of the offense\u2014that a defendant \u201ctransported ... said alien within the United States with intent to further the alien\u2019s unlawful presence\u201d\u2014confirms both actual knowledge of an alien\u2019s presence as well as \u201cintent to further the alien\u2019s unlawful presence.\u201d In addition, the district court instructed the jury that knowledge cannot be shown by mistake or accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-2\">The district court\u2019s jury 'charge was a correct statement of the law relating to the crime of transporting aliens, and the court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to provide Sheridan\u2019s proposed supplemental instruction, borrowed from our constructive possession of narcotics caselaw. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
