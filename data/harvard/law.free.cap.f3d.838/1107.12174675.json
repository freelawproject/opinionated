In this case,- the law firm of McCullough Payne <em>&amp; </em>Haan, LLC filed-a lawsuit in state court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1109\">*1109</page-number>against Bryson Ray, a consumer-debtor. In compliance with the FDCPA\u2019s venue provision, the McCullough -firm brought that action in Fulton County, Georgia, where Ray resided. After obtaining a judgment against Ray in that action, the McCullough firm initiated a garnishment proceeding against Ray\u2019s bank to collect on the judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As required \u25a0 by Georgia law, it brought the garnishment action in Cobb County, Georgia, where the bank, as the garnishee, was located.</p>\n<p id=\"b1133-5\">In response to the garnishment action, Ray filed this lawsuit, alleging that the' McCullough firm had violated the FDCPA by bringing the garnishment action in a judicial district other than the one in which Ray resided or signed the underlying contract. On the McCullough firm\u2019s motion, the district court dismissed Ray\u2019s complaint, concluding that the FDCPA\u2019s venue provision does not apply to garnishment actions under Georgia law because the provision applies only to legal actions \u201cagainst any consumer\u201d and a garnishment action is against the garnishee, not the consumer. Ray appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal, which we review de novo. See Robbins v. Garrison Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., 809 F.3d 583, 585-86 (11th Cir. 2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b1133-7\">The only question in this case is whether the FDCPA\u2019s venue provision applies to post-judgment garnishment' proceedings. The McCullough firm maintains that this Court has already decided that question in Pickens v. Collection Services, 273 F.3d 1121 (11th Cir. 2001) (unpublished table decision). In that case, the district court concluded that the FDCPA\u2019s venue provision does not apply to Georgia garnishment actions and we affirmed without opinion under 11th Circuit Rule 36-1, which has since been repealed. See id.; Pickens v. Coll. Servs. of Athens, Inc., 165 F.Supp.2d 1376, 1380-81 (M.D. Ga. 2001). The firm asserts that \u201cthe Eleventh Circuit affirmation in Pickens is binding authority on this panel.\u201d That could not be more wrong. In this Court, unpublished decisions, with or without opinion, are not precedential and they bind no one. See 11th Cir. R. 36-2 (\u201cUnpublished opinions are not considered binding precedent \u2014 \u201d); United States v. Irey, 612 F.3d 1160, 1215 n.34 (11th Cir. 2010) (\u201cUnpublished opinions are not precedential ....\u201d); U.S. Steel, LLC v. Tieco, Inc., 261 F.3d 1275, 1280 n.3 (11th Cir. 2001) (\u201cAn affir-mance pursuant to Rule 36-1 has no prece-dential value.\u201d); Va. Props., Inc, v. Home Ins. Co., 74 F.3d 1131, 1132 n.2 (11th Cir. 1996) (explaining that when a panel affirms without opinion under Rule 36-1, the decision \u201cwill have no precedential value\u201d) (quotation marks omitted). And, of course, district court opinions are not binding on us either. See Pereda v. Brookdale Senior Living Cmtys., Inc., 666 F.3d 1269, 1273 n.7 (11th Cir. 2012). No binding precedent answers the question whether the FDCPA\u2019s venue provision applies to Georgia garnishment proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1133-10\">Three other circuits have answered that question as it pertains to the laws of 'other states. The First Circuit did so in Smith v. Solomon &amp; Solomon, PC, 714 F.3d 73 (1st Cir. 2013), which involved post-judgment enforcement proceedings under Massachusetts\u2019 trustee process. Like the McCullough firm, the law firm in Smith obtained a judgment against a consumer in the judicial district in which the consumer resided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1110\">*1110</page-number>and then, about ten months later, it filed a collection action in another district against a \u201ctrustee\u201d (in that case, the consumer\u2019s employer), seeking to attach the consumer\u2019s wages to satisfy the judgment. Id. at 74. The consumer filed suit, alleging that the law firm\u2019s second action violated the FDCPA\u2019s venue provision. Id. \u25a0 While the parties agreed that \u201cthe FDCPA venue provision applies only to legal actions brought \u2018against any consumer,\u2019 \u201d they disputed \u201cwhether a post-judgment enforcement proceeding ... qualifies as a legal action \u2018against any consumer.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 75 (quoting 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692i(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-4\">To answer that question, the Smith court looked to the state statutes and rules that governed Massachusetts\u2019 trustee process. The statute required the judgment-creditor to file the collection action in the county in which the trustee or employer (not the consumer) was located, and the rules required the judgment creditor to direct the summons to the trustee or employer (not the consumer) and required the trustee or employer (not the consumer) to respond. Id. at 75-76. The First Circuit found that although the consumer had an interest in the proceedings and the statute allowed her to request a change of venue, \u201c[flundamentally ... a Massachusetts trustee process action is geared toward compelling the trustee to act, not the debt- or.\u201d Id. at 76. For those reasons, the First Circuit concluded that because post-judgment enforcement proceedings under Massachusetts law did not qualify as a legal action \u201cagainst the consumer,\u201d the FDCPA venue provision did not apply, to them. Id. at 76-77.</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-5\">The Eighth Circuit reached the same result in Hageman v. Barton, 817 F.3d 611 (8th Cir. 2016), which involved post-judgment enforcement proceedings under Illinois law. Like the firms in this case and in Smith, the law firm in Hageman first obtained a judgment against the consumer in Missouri state court and then, several months later, initiated garnishment proceedings in Madison County, Illinois. Id. at 612-13. The consumer sued the law firm, contending, among other things, that the firm violated the FDCPA\u2019s venue provision by bringing the garnishment action in a judicial district \u201cwhere [he] neither worked nor resided and which bore no relationship to the underlying debt.\u201d Id. at 617. The Eighth Circuit explained that \u201c[t]he [FDCPA\u2019s] venue restriction ... applies only to legal actions \u2018on a debt against any consumer,\u2019 \u201d which means that \u201cthe applicability of [the provision] depends upon whether ... the garnishment proceedings pursuant to Illinois law are legal actions \u2018against any consumer.\u2019\u201d Id (quoting 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692i(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-7\">Following the First Circuit\u2019s lead, the Eighth Circuit looked to the state statutes governing Illinois\u2019 garnishment proceedings. Like Massachusetts, Illinois required the judgment-creditor to direct its summons against the consumer\u2019s employer (not the consumer) and required the employer (not the consumer) to respond to and comply with any garnishment order. Id. at 618. Based on that, the Eighth Circuit concluded that because a post-judgment garnishment action under Illinois law \u201cdid not amount to an action \u2018against the consumer,\u2019 \u201d the FDCPA\u2019s venue provision did not apply to it. Id at 617.</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-8\">Only one circuit has reached a contrary result. In Fox v. Citicorp Credit Services, Inc., 15 F.3d 1507, 1515 (9th Cir. 1994), the Ninth Circuit held that the FDCPA\u2019s venue provision applied to post-judgment garnishment proceedings under Arizona law. That decision did not, however, discuss the \u201cagainst any consumer\u201d language in the FDCPA or whether its venue provision applied to actions directed at third parties rather than consumers. As such, it has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1111\">*1111</page-number>little persuasive value. See Smith, 714 F.3d at 76-77; Hageman, 817 F.3d at 618.</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-5\">In this case, the question is whether the FDCPA\u2019s venue provision applies to post-judgment garnishment proceedings under Georgia law. As the First and Eighth Circuits have correctly explained, the FDCPA\u2019s venue provision applies only to legal actions \u201cagainst any consumer.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692i(a); see Smith, 714 F.3d at 75; Hageman, 817 F.3d at 617. That is what its words say and what its words mean. As a result, whether the provision applies to Georgia garnishment proceedings depends on whether those proceedings are legal actions \u201cagainst any consumer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-6\">The answer to that question is not difficult. We know that a Georgia garnishment proceeding is not an action against a consumer because Georgia law tells us as much. The garnishment process in Georgia requires the judgment-creditor to direct its summons to the garnishee (not the consumer), Ga. Code \u00a7 18-4-8(a), and it requires the garnishee (not the consumer) to file an answer, Ga. Code \u00a7 18^-10(a). Not only that, but the governing statute specifically provides that \u201c[a] garnishment proceeding is an action between the plaintiff [judgment-creditor] and garnishee.\u201d Ga. Code \u00a7 18-4-15(a). Although the consumer \u201cmay become a party to the garnishment by filing a claim with the clerk of court,\u201d id the process is fundamentally an action against the garnishee, not the consumer. For that reason, the FDCPA\u2019s venue provision does not apply to post-judgment garnishment proceedings under Georgia law and Ray\u2019s FDCPA claim therefore fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-7\">Ray contends that we should not adopt this interpretation for several reasons. He first argues that this reading fails as a matter of statutory construction. By its terms, the FDCPA\u2019s venue provision applies only to a \u201clegal action on a debt against any consumer.\u201d .15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692i(a). Ray asserts that, under the last-antecedent canon, the phrase \u201cagainst any consumer\u201d modifies only the term \u201cdebt\u201d and not the term \u201clegal action.\u201d If he is correct, the venue provision would apply to \u201cany legal action on a debt,\u201d whether or not that action is against a consumer or some other third party, provided that the debt is \u201cagainst any consumer.\u201d Under that construction, the venue provision would apply to a Georgia garnishment proceeding because it is a \u201clegal action\u201d concerning \u201ca debt against any consumer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-9\">We reject that tortured reading of the statute. To begin with, Ray invokes the wrong canon of construction. Because the statutory clause at issue here does not contain any pronouns and, \u201c[s]trictly speaking, only pronouns have antecedents,\u201d the last-antecedent canon does not apply. Antonin Scalia,&amp; Bryan A. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 152 (2012); see also Lockhart v. United States, 577 U.S. -, 136 S.Ct. 958, 970, 194 L.Ed.2d 48 (2016) (Kagan, J\u201e dissenting). The more appropriate canon is the nearest-reasonable-referent canon, which \u201calso applies to adjectives, adverbs, and adverbial or adjectival phrases.\u201d Scalia <em>&amp; </em>Garner, Reading Law at 152. That canon provides that \u201ca prepositive or postpositive modifier normally applies only to the nearr est reasonable referent.\u201d Id. The FDCPA\u2019s venue provision contains two such modifiers: \u201con a debt\u201d and \u201cagainst any consumer.\u201d The reason the second one does not modify the first one is because \u201con a debt\u201d is itself a prepositional phrase that modifies its nearest referent, \u201cany legal action.\u201d See id. at 153. Under the nearest-reasonable-referent canon, \u201cagainst any consumer\u201d modifies \u201clegal action,\u201d and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1112\">*1112</page-number>FDCPA venue provision applies only to a \u201clegal action ... against any consumer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-4\">Ray also argues that our reading of the FDCPA fails as a matter of policy. One purpose of the statute\u2019s venue provision is to prevent debt collectors from filing suits in distant and inconvenient forums, thereby depriving consumers of the opportunity to defend themselves against debt-collection lawsuits. See Smith, 714 F.3d at 76 (citing S. Rep. No. 95-382 at 5 (1977), reprinted in 1977 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1695, 1699). Ray asserts that excluding post-judgment garnishment proceedings from the FDCPA\u2019s coverage undermines that purpose. As the First Circuit explained in Smith, however, the concern that a consumer will lose his opportunity to defend himself from a debt-collection lawsuit \u201cis not present in the case of a post-judgment proceeding.\u201d Id. That is because \u201c[t]he original suit to collect on the debt occurred in a forum that was convenient for [the consumer],\u201d the consumer \u201chad an opportunity to defend against it,\u201d and the consumer was not \u201cdenied [his] day in court.\u201d Id. (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-5\">The Federal Trade Commission\u2019s reading of the FDCPA supports this reasoning. See Smith, 714 F.3d at 76; Hageman, 817 F.3d at 618. The Commission\u2019s commentary provides, \u201cIf a' judgment has been obtained from a forum that satisfies the requirements of this section, a debt collector may bring suit to enforce it in another jurisdiction.\u201d Statements of General Policy or Interpretation Staff Commentary on the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 53 Fed. Reg. 50,097, 50,101 (Dec. 13, 1988). That interpretation makes sense, the Commission noted, \u201cbecause the consumer previously has had the opportunity to defend the original action in a convenient forum.\u201d Id. at 50,109. Although that commentary does not bind us, we accord it \u201cconsiderable weight,\u201d Hawthorne v. Mac Adjustment, Inc., 140 F.3d 1367, 1372 n.2 (11th Cir. 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-8\">Finally, Ray argues that our reading of the FDCPA fails as a matter of federalism. He asserts that the meaning of federal law should not hinge on state-law definitions and that our interpretation must instead \u201cbegin and end with the text of the federal law.\u201d Not always, and not here. \u201cAlthough federal law governs the interpretation of a federal statute,\u201d federal law sometimes \u201cadopts state law as the federal rule of decision.\u201d In re Prudential of Fla. Leasing, Inc., 478 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir. 2007). And in interpreting a federal statute, we may look to state law when \u201ca national rule is unnecessary to protect the federal interests underlying [a statutory scheme].\u201d United States v. Kimbell Foods, Inc., 440 U.S. 715, 718, 99 S.Ct. 1448, 1453, 59 L.Ed.2d 711 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-9\">As we have already explained, our interpretation of the venue provision is consistent with the statute\u2019s purpose. Under our reading, a debt collector must still bring its original action against the consumer in a venue prescribed by the FDCPA. Once it has obtained a judgment, however, the debt collector may bring an action in another jurisdiction to enforce it. That statutory scheme affords the consumer an opportunity to defend himself against the original action in a convenient forum. Because a national rule in this context is unnecessary to ensure that opportunity, it is appropriate to look to state law to determine whether a state\u2019s post-judgment enforcement proceedings are \u201cagainst any consumer\u201d for the purposes of the FDCPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1133-8\">. The McCullough firm contends that the record \"does not indicate whether the garnishment action was a wage garnishment [against Ray\u2019s employer] or a bank garnishment [against Ray\u2019s bank],\u201d Ray contends that it was a bank garnishment action. Because the outcome of this case does not depend on that issue, we will assume without deciding that Ray\u2019s bank was the defendant in the garnishment action.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
