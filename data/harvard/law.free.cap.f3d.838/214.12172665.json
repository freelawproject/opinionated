Securities Litigation, </em>Nos. 15-180-cv(L), 15-208-cv(XAP), in which we have today issued a separate opinion. Plaintiffs-Appellants-Cross-Appellees \u25a0 (collectively, \u201cGAMCO\u201d) are so-called \u201cvalue investors\u201d who make their own estimation of the value of a publicly-traded company\u2019s securities and attempt to buy such securities when the market price is lower than its own valuation, betting that the market price will rise over time. Between 2000 and 2002, GAMCO invested in the securities of Defendants-Appellees-Cross-Appellants Vivendi Universal, S.A. and Vivendi S.A. (collectively, \u201cVivendi\u201d). Thereafter, when the nature of Vivendi\u2019s liquidity situation came to light, the price of those' securities dropped dramatically.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-12\">GAMCO subsequently brought a securities fraud action against Vivendi under \u00a7 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\u201cExchange Act\u201d), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b), as well as the Securities Exchange Commission\u2019s (\u201cSEC\u201d) Rule 10b-5 (\u201cRule lobs\u2019\u2019) promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7240.10b-5, After a bench trial solely on the question whether Vivendi successfully rebutted the fraud-on-the-market presumption of reliance invoked by GAMCO to satisfy the reliance element of its \u00a7 10(b) claim, <em>see Basic Inc. v. Levinson, </em>485 U.S. 224, 247, 108 S.Ct. 978, 99 L.Ed.2d 194 (1988), the District Court for the Southern District of New York (Scheindlin, <em>J.) </em>entered judgment for Vivendi. <em>See GAMCO Investors, Inc. v.

Gen. Motors LLC, </em>787 F.3d 663, 672 (2d Cir. 2015) (quoting <em>Mobil Shipping &amp; Tramp. Co. v. Wonsild Liquid Carriers Ltd., </em>190 F.3d 64, 67 (2d Cir. 1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">To succeed on a \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 claim, a plaintiff must prove \u201c(1) a material misrepresentation or omission by the defendant; (2) scienter; (3) a connection between the misrepresentation or omission and the purchase or sale of a security; (4) reliance upon the misrepresentation or omission; (5) economic loss; and (6) loss causation.\u201d <em>Halliburton Co. v. Erica P. John Fund, Inc., </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 2398, 2407, 189 L.Ed.2d 339 (2014) (quoting <em>Amgen Inc. v. Conn. Retirement Plans and Tr. Funds, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1184, 1192, 185 L.Ed.2d 308 (2013)). The traditional way a plaintiff demonstrates reliance is directly, <em>i.e. </em>\u201cby showing that he was aware of a company\u2019s statement and engaged in a relevant transaction ... based on that specific misrepresentation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Amgen, </em>133 S.Ct. at 1192). However, a plaintiff may, in some circumstances, invoke a \u201crebuttable presumption of reliance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2408. This presumption rests on the \u201c\u2018fraud-on-the-market\u2019 theory\u201d which states \u201cthat \u2018the market price of shares traded on well-developed markets reflects all\u2019 publicly available information, and, hence, any material misrepresentations.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Basic, </em>485 U.S. at 246, 108 S.Ct. 978). Because \u201cthe typical \u2018investor who buys or sells stock at the price set by the market does so in reliance on the integrity of that price\u2019\u2014the belief that it reflects all public, material information\u2014... his \u2018reliance on any public material misrepresentations ... may be presumed for purposes- of a Rule 10b-5 action.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Basic, </em>485 U.S. at 247, 108 S.Ct. 978). But the presumption, as its name suggests, is rebutta-ble,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cAny showing that severs the link between the alleged misrepresentation and either the price received (or paid) by the plaintiff, or his decision to trade at a fan-market price, 'will'be sufficient to rebut the presumption <em>....\u201d Id. </em>(quoting <em>Basic, </em>485 U.S. at 248,108 S.Ct. 978) (alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-12\">As an initial. matter, GAMCO argues that the District Court \u201cerred in concluding that ... because Vivendi demonstrated that Plaintiffs are value investors[,] Viven-di ... proved [GAMCO] did not rely on the integrity of the market in purchasing Vivendi [securities].\u201d GAMCO Br. at 41. According to GAMCO, though it, like most value investors, does not believe that the market price - necessarily equals, at any given time, the efficient value of a security (and thus makes its .money by identifying under- or over-valued securities), <em>Halliburton </em>forecloses, the conclusion that this fact alone suffices to rebut the presumption.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Vivendi, for .its part, suggests that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>such a showing indeed suffices to rebut the presumption. <em>See </em>Vivendi Br. at 33; <em>cf. Teamsters Loc. 445 Freight Div. Pension Fund v. Bombardier Inc., </em>546 F.3d 196, 199 n.4 (2d Cir. 2008) (\u201cThe ... fraud-on-the-market theory involves [the] rebutta-ble presumption[ ] ... \u2018that :.. investors rely on the market price of securities as an accurate measure of their intrinsic value.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Hevesi v. Citigroup Inc., </em>366 F.3d 70, 77 (2d Cir. 2004))).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">It is true that the district court reasonably found facts that demonstrate that GAMCO\u2019s purchasing decisions relied in large part on an independent valuation of the worth of Vivendi\u2019s securities that was separate and distinct from the market price. The district court found that GAM-CO would begin by calculating a \u201cPrivate Market Value[ ]\u201d (\u201cPMV\u201d) for a' given security\u2014a value that approximated \u201cthe price that an informed industrialist would be willing to pay for [the company], if each of its segments were valued independently in a private market sale;\u201d <em>GAMCO, </em>927 F.Supp.2d at 94-95. GAMCO would then compare this PMV to the public market price. If there was a sufficiently large \u201cspread between [the] PMV and the market price,\u201d and if there was evidence of the existence of a \u201ccatalyst,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 94-96, or \u201csome dynamic that [GAMCO thought was] going to help surface value over time,\u201d J.A. 359, then GAMCO would generally elect to purchase the security in question. Employees at GAMCO \u2022 often referred to its PMV as the \u201cintrinsic value\u201d of the stock, <em>see, e.g., </em>J.A. 338, 508, and frequently referred to the market price, in contrast, as reflecting the whims of the sometimes \u201cirrational ... Mr. Market,\u201d J.A. 358.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">Though the district court indeed found that GAMCO does not necessarily consider the market price to be an efficient reflection of the objective value of a security at any given time, however, it explicitly disclaimed any reading of its opinion as suggesting that this fact was sufficient, on its own, to rebut the presumption. <em>See GAMCO, </em>927 F.Supp.2d at 102 (\u201c[0]ne can imagine a case where an investor ... used the market price of a security merely as a comparator with a private method of valuation, but in which the fraud on the market presumption could not fairly be rebutted, because, but for the material misstatements, that investor would not have transacted in the securities at issue.\u201d). We thus decline to explicate the contours of <em>Halliburton </em>here, further theorize on the presumption, or otherwise address the relevance of the typical value investing model to a rebuttal showing. The district court\u2019s holding was, instead, based on a much narrower theory: that, given the facts in the record, Vivendi proved that GAMCO would have purchased Vivendi securities even had it known of Vivendi\u2019s alleged fraud. <em>See Halliburton, </em>134 S.Ct. at 2408 (observing that a defendant may rebut the presumption by demonstrating, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cthat a plaintiff would have, bought or sold the stock even had he been aware that the stock\u2019s price was tainted by fraud\u201d); <em>Kline v. Wolf, </em>702 F.2d 400, 403 (2d Cir. 1983) (noting that the presumption may be rebutted through a showing \u201cthat plaintiffs did not significantly rely on the integrity of the market or that, even if they had known of the alleged misrepresentation, they would still have purchased the stock\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>GAMCO argues that this factual conclusion was error, and asserts that \u201c[i]t was clearly erroneous for the District Court to find that a sophisticated financial manager would purchase securities in advance of undisclosed adverse information which would have the predictable impact of causing market prices to decline.\u201d GAMCO Reply Br. at 8. Our review of the record demonstrates that it was not \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d for the district court to so conclude as to GAMCO itself. Under that deferential standard of review, we must accept the district court\u2019s findings of fact \u201cunless we have a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>Souratgar v. Lee, </em>720 F.3d 96, 108 (2d Cir. 2013) (internal quotation marks omitted). We therefore need not, and do not, decide whether we would have reached the same factual conclusions as the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">First, though GAMCO repeatedly asserts on appeal that it is all but unthinkable that a sophisticated investor would ever buy a security if he was aware its market price might be tainted by fraud, the idea was not so ridiculous to the Chief Investment Officer of Gabelli &amp; Co. Asked whether he would \u201cbuy a stock in a company ... [where he] knew ... the price was inflated as a result of a management fraud,\u201d Mario Gabelli testified that such a purchase was \u201cpossible, but very unlikely,\u201d and clarified that he would \u201cassign a 90-10 probability\u201d to such a scenario. J.A. 530-31. He went on to qualify this statement, noting \u201c[t]here would have to be a lot of other circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 531. The district court largely dismissed Gabelli\u2019s testimony as \u201cmotivated hairsplitting by an interested witness.\u201d <em>GAMCO, \u25a0 </em>927 F.Supp.2d at 94. It is thus highly significant that a prominent witness the district court believed was exaggerating the facts in <em>favor </em>of the plaintiffs admitted on the stand that, in the abstract, there was a <em>ten percent </em>possibility that, in a given case, he would buy stock inflated by fraud. Such testimony, at minimum, established\u2014in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>contrast to GAMCO\u2019s repeated suggestions\u2014that GAMCO had no ironclad policy against purchasing a stock, it believed might be inflated by fraud, provided that other, circumstances made the deal one worth pursuing.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">To that end, the record in this case includes sufficient evidence supporting the district court\u2019s finding that such circumstances were present here: in other words that, even if aware of Vivendi\u2019s liquidity problems and its concealment of those problems, GAMCO would still have believed the deal it made was a good one. As already noted, the district court reasonably found that the core of GAMCO\u2019s investment decisions could be reduced to two questions: first, was there a material spread between market price and PMV, and second, was there reason to believe a catalyst would cause the market to recognize this discrepancy in the next two to five years. Evidence in the record also supported the district court\u2019s conclusion that, had GAMCO known of the liquidity problems at Vivendi, such knowledge would not have altered the answers \u2022 to either of these questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">As to the spread, Andrew Rittenberry, the analyst primarily responsible for calculating Vivendi\u2019s PMV 'in the relevant period, testified that, once he learned of the liquidity crisis at Vivendi (as the fraud came to light), the knowledge of the liquidity problems had no \u201cimpact [on his] PMV calculation,\u201d as he believed those problems constituted \u201ca short-term issue .... [something that could be solved within a year or so.\u201d J.A. 401-03. Rittenberry also testified that PMV was generally calculated to anticipate the value of the company over the long haul.-This testimony further supports the district court\u2019s factual finding that GAMCO would not have believed that a short-term problem, especially one that it did not perceive to be as significant as the market ultimately came to believe it was, would affect its calculation of the spread. <em>See </em>J.A. 368 (noting that, in calculating the PMV, Rittenberry \u201cprojected the business performance of [the] different] pieces of the business over a five-year period\u201d); J.A. 383 (\u201c[T]he goal in buying a stock is to have it appreciate 50 percent over a two-year period\u201d); J.A. 527 (testimony of Ma\u00eddo Gabelli: \u201cSo the way we think is like a McKinsey thinking out over the next five or ten years\u201d). Thus, the record supports the district court\u2019s conclusion that, if GAMCO had known of the liquidity problems and their concealment, GAMCO would still have believed Viven-di\u2019s PMV to be \u201cmaterially higher\u201d than the public market price. J.A. 363.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">Second, it was also not clearly erroneous for the district court to conclude that knowledge of Vivendi\u2019s liquidity problems would not have changed GAMCO\u2019s belief that a catalyst was <em>likely\u2014ie., </em>its belief that the market price would rise towards the PMV, if not immediately, then over the course of the next several years. Such evidence came in various forms. First, GAMCO continued to buy Vivendi securities as the full extent of Vivendi\u2019s alleged fraud came to light. GAMCO argues that this information is hardly dispositive of whether GAMCO would have purchased <em>prior </em>to the revelation of the fraud at the same price at which it purchased (given that the revelation caused the market price to fall as fraud-induced inflation dissipated). That may indeed be so, but the evidence is <em>specifically </em>relevant, to the narrower 'question whether knowledge of the liquidity problems would have affected GAMCO\u2019s. belief in the existence of a catalyst. That GAMCO continued to buy reasonably suggested to the district court that GAMCO still believed a catalyst to be on the horizon (and thus demonstrated that the liquidity problems had nqt altered, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>would not have altered, this conclusion). Further, Gabelli testified that a \u201cchange of management\u201d was one of the most frequent catalysts on which GAMCO would rely in purchasing a stock. J.A. 482. This testimony further reinforced the district court\u2019s factual findings: had GAMCO known of the liquidity problems at Vivendi (notwithstanding whether they had been fraudulently concealed), the potential for a change in management would have seemed even more likely.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">In short, evidence in the record' supported the district court in concluding that, had GAMCO known of Vivendi\u2019s liquidity problems, GAMCO would still have believed, first, that Vivendi\u2019s securities were substantially undervalued by the market and second, that an event was likely to happen in the next few years that would awaken the market to that fact. Further, the record provided sufficient evidence to find that GAMCO would have believed that, even if the liquidity crisis in fact came to light, it would resolve within a short period of time\u2014and thus, that even if the market price might go down in the short run, the potential for long-term profit still remained. In other words, whereas one can imagine situations in the abstract where a sophisticated investor, apprised of a fraud, would necessarily conclude that a security was no longer a logical purchase, the district court did hot clearly err in concluding, on <em>this </em>record, that <em>in this case, </em>and with regard to' <em>this particular fraud, </em>GAMCO would' still have viewed Vivendi\u2019s securities as a profitable investment\u2014even if it might have been concerned about the hidden liquidity risks.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">GAMCO. counters this extensive evidence by citing, almost exclusively, to testimony of Andrew Rittenberry, which GAMCO employs to argue that the district court\u2019s factual findings were clearly erroneous. Asked whether, assuming the information \u201cdid-not affect [his] PMV calculation, a liquidity crisis would similarly not affect [his] buy, sell, or hold recommendation,\u201d Rittenberry replied, \u201c[n]o, not necessarily.\u201d J.A. 401. \u201cThe big driver,\u201d he continued, \u201c[is] PMV. But the discount to. .the PMV between the market price and the PMV is a key factor. If there is a liquidity crisis or some type of event like that, you would expect the discount to widen.- I mean you would expect the stock to go down.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When further asked whether he \u201cwould expect the public market price to go down,\u201d Rittenberry answered, \u201c[y]es. You wouldn\u2019t want to buy it in front of that\u2014if you thought it was going to go down, you would wait to buy it or buy more or recommend to buy more at that point.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">Pointing to Rittenberry\u2019s testimony, GAMCO argues that even if it would not have believed the liquidity problems to affect Vivendi\u2019s PMV, and even if it would still have believed it likely the investment would be profitable over the long run, the record renders clearly erroneous the district court\u2019s finding that it would have purchased Vivendi\u2019s securities had it known of the fraud. This is because, GAM-CO argues, even if it indeed still thought Vivendi securities were materially undervalued notwithstanding the crisis, it would have waited until the liquidity crisis came to light and <em>then </em>bought the stock. Such a delayed purchase not only would have mitigated the <em>risk </em>associated with the undisclosed liquidity problems (as fraud always creates some risk that the underlying calculations are erroneous), but also would have potentially netted GAMCO a more profitable investment.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">It was not clearly erroneous, however, for the district court to find that GAMCO would indeed have purchased Vivendi\u2019s securities at the price quoted, rather than simply await the potential of a public li<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>quidity crisis. First, both Rittenberry\u2019s testimony and GAMCO\u2019s argument rest on the assumption that Rittenberry (and GAMCO)-would have <em>known </em>that the stock price would indeed go down upon revelation of the liquidity crisis. As already noted, however, the district \u25a0 court reasonably found facts demonstrating that Rittenber-ry, or GAMCO, apprised of the hidden liquidity risks, would not have been so certain. At the time GAMCO had to make its purchasing decision, even if it had known of the fraud, it would not have been able to see the future; \u25a0 And the record evidence as to how GAMCO-would have approached determining\u2019 how likely it was that the hidden risks would be exposed in a way that would materially affect the market price does not support GAMCO\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">Thus, Rittenberry testified that, when he did find out about the liquidity problems, he believed that they constituted a very short-term concern with minimal impact on Vivendi\u2019s value. It was therefore not clearly erroneous for the district court to' infer that GAMCO, privy to this information prior to its relevant purchases, would have \u25a0 believed it possible that the crisis would pass without incident or public revelation, or at minimum be uncertain as to just how the market would value the crisis were it- to come to light. Given that the record makes clear that GAMCO would, in at least some circumstances, have purchased a security even believing it was tainted by fraud, it is highly relevant that the record also provides sufficient evidence to\u2019 find that GAMCO would have believed <em>this particular </em>fraud-unlikely to become material.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Further, against this uncertainty of a future, hypothetical <em>better deal, </em>the record provided evidence that GAMCO had reasons to believe the deal\u2014which, as already noted, would have appeared to be a good one\u2014could get <em>worse </em>if GAMCO waited. As Rittenberry testified, the premise of GAMCO\u2019s model was that it found a stock was \u201ctrad[ing] at a discount to what [GAMCO believed] it[ ] [was] worth <em>temporarily,\u201d </em>and that \u201cthat discount [would] ... narrow over time.\u201d J.A. 357 (emphasis added). As a general matter, then, to wait, rather than -buy the stock, always risked the possibility that the prophesied catalyst would come early, or. that the market would recognize that the value of the stock was depreciated. Further, Gabelli testified that he believed the market, in the aggregate, to be \u201cdown sharply\u201d by the beginning of 2001, J.A. 522, and in GAMCO\u2019s December 2000 Annual Report to investors, it \u201cforecast .... an economic (and earnings) recovery\u201d in \u201cthe second half of 2001\u201d which would \u201chelp[ ] ... renew investor confidence and revive the market,\u201d J.A. 591. To wait for the hypothetical revelation of the liquidity problems, then, would risk not only that the market, specifically, would realize that Vivendi\u2019s stock was undervalued, but also that the market, generally, would rebound and the market price would rise accordingly, sacrificing the spread! It was not clearly erroneous for the district court to conclude that GAMCO, aware of the fraud, would not have waited to buy the securities.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">In other words, the premise of Ritten-berry\u2019s testimony, and GAMCO\u2019s argument, assumes what it seeks to prove: that GAMCO would have known that the liquidity problems would manifest in the way that, in hindsight, they manifested, and would thus obviously have waited to buy if it purchased at all. But the district court\u2019s rejection of that conclusion was not clearly erroneous. Further, GAMCO exaggerates the probative value of Rittenberry\u2019s testimony in another way as well. Even on its own terms, Rittenberry\u2019s testimony does not clearly suggest that GAMCO would not have bought if it had known of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>hidden liquidity risks. Asked whether knowledge of such a hidden crisis would \u201cnot affect\u201d his buy or sell recommendation, Rittenberry, not unlike Gabelli, answered equivocally: \u201cno, <em>not necessarily.\u201d </em>J.A. 401 (emphasis added). And, when describing what his recommendation would be, he <em>did not </em>say that he would recommend that GAMCO not buy; instead, he testified that \u201cif [he] thought [the market price] was going to go down, [he] would wait to buy it or <em>buy more or recommend to buy more at that point.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added). In other words, the district court did not have to read this testimony as GAMCO reads it. Instead, it could reasonably have read Rittenberry\u2019s testimony as suggesting that GAMCO would buy and then wait and <em>buy more </em>if indeed the liquidity problems surfaced. Such an approach would potentially allow GAMCO to ensure it captured a good deal when it saw one while hedging against the possibility of an uncertain future.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-10\">It may seem unlikely, in the abstract, that an investor, aware of fraud, would opt to purchase a given security. Nevertheless, after a trial, we do not review a district court\u2019s factual findings for whether they seem, in the abstract, correct\u2014we review the <em>record </em>for sufficient evidence in support of those judgments. And here, the record at the trial simply does not establish that it was clearly erroneous for the district court to find that GAMCO, had it known of the liquidity problems at Vivendi, would have made the choice to buy the same securities it purchased.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Accordingly, and finding no merit in the Plaintiffs\u2019 remaining arguments, we AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b240-10\">. . Vivendi also cross-appeals from the district court\u2019s determination that Vivendi was barred by collateral estoppel from contesting the other elements of GAMCO\u2019s \u00a7 10(b) claim.

The district court found facts sufficient to establish that that it was more likely than not that GAMCO would have purchased the relevant securities even if it had known that Vi-vendi\u2019s statements were misrepresenting its liquidity. <em>See GAMCO, 927 </em>F.Supp.2d at 97 (finding, <em>inter alia, </em>that \u201cthe liquidity crisis at Vivendi was irrelevant to Plaintiffs\u2019 investment decisions\u201d). Nevertheless, GAMCO takes issue with the district court\u2019s approach to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>determining whether GAMCO would have purchased the security even if it had known there was a fraud. Specifically, GAMCO questions the district court\u2019s reliance on the argument that GAMCO would have considered Vivendi\u2019s securities a <em>more attractive </em>investment had Vivendi fully divulged its liquidity problems to the entire market prior to GAM-CO\u2019s purchase. <em>See id. </em>at 102 (where the district court observes that \"in this c\u00f3unterfactual scenario [where Vivendi did not commit any fraud] ... the price of Vivendi ADS\u2019s would have been lower\u201d as the market price would have fallen with revelation of the truth, and thus \"Plaintiffs would have seen Vivendi as a <em>more </em>attractive investment\u201d). GAMCO does not necessarily question the premise that, if Vivendi had fully disclosed its liquidity problems to the market, then the market would likely have internalized the value of those problems, the stock's price would have fallen, and the spread between the PMV and the market price would thus have been larger. Nor does GAMCO deny that it may have purchased the security at this lower price had there been no fraud at all. Rather, GAMCO contests the relevance of the district court\u2019s inquiry to what GAMCO believes is the central issue, namely whether GAMCO would have purchased shares <em>\u201cat the same price[ </em>]\u201d had it been aware that many of Vivendi\u2019s statements were fraudulent. <em>Id. </em>at 103 (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Halliburton, </em>134 S.Ct. at 2408 (noting that a defendant may rebut the presumption by showing \"that a plaintiff would have bought or sold the stock even had he been aware that the stock\u2019s price was tainted by fraud\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"A0\">Though we observe that GAMCO\u2019s framing of the appropriate inquiry has much to recommend it, we need not conclusively endorse it here. Even adopting, <em>arguendo, </em>GAMCO\u2019s preferred framing, <em>see </em>GAMCO Br. at 27 n. 11 (acknowledging that the presumption may be rebutted by showing that a \"plaintiff would have purchased the stock 'at the same price even if she had known of the fraud\u201d), the district court did not clearly err in concluding, as detailed herein, that revelation of Vi-vendi\u2019s liquidity problems would not have changed GAMCO\u2019s purchasing decisions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b247-12\">. We also conclude that GAMCO\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment is unreviewable. GAMCO concedes that we do not have jurisdiction to hear an appeal from a denial of summary judgment after a trial, unless the \"district court\u2019s error was purely one of law.\u201d <em>Stampf v. Long Island R.R. Co., </em>761 F.3d 192, 201 n.2 (2d Cir. 2014); <em>see </em>GAMCO Reply Br. at 31-32. GAM-CO further acknowledges that one ground on which the district court denied summary judgment was its finding that \"GAMCO could possibly have uncovered non-public corrective information which would rebut the presumption of reliance.\u201d GAMCO Br. at 9; <em>see also </em>J.A. 92. GAMCO concedes that, as a <em>legal matter, </em>this scenario does indeed rebut the presumption of reliance. <em>See </em>GAMCO Br. at 27 n.ll (noting that one of the \"recognized ways to rebut the ... presumption [is when] plaintiff possessed non-public information concerning the fraudulent misstatements.\u201d). GAMCO argues that evidence in the record created no material question of fact, at summary judgment, whether GAMCO had such information. This argument misses the point. To the degree that GAMCO agrees with the legal standard the district court applied (nonpublic corrective information can rebut the presumption of reliance) and argues only that the district court erred in finding a material question of fact <em>pursuant </em>to that legal standard, at least one ground for the district court's denial of' summary judgment was not a pure error of law, but one of fact. Thus, the denial is not reviewable by this Court. <em>See Stampf, </em>761 F.3d at 201 n.2.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
