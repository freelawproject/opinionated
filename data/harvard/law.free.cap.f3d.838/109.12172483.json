LYNCH, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Daniel Patrick Sheehan' appeals from a judgment of conviction entered in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York (Denis R. Hurley, <em>Judge) </em>after a jury found him guilty of extortion in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951, and use of a destructive device to commit extortion in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) (1) (B) (ii). The conviction arises from Sheehan\u2019s plot to extort money from Home Depot by placing a device purporting t\u00f3 be an inert \u201cmodel\u201d of a pipe bomb in a Home Depot store in Huntington Station, New York, and-threatening to plant bombs in other Home Depot locations.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">Sheehan conceded his guilt'on the extortion count at trial; on appeal, he challenges only his conviction for use of a destructive device. The district court instructed the jury that it could find Sheehan guilty if the device, used by Sheehan during his crime was \u201can explosive -bomb\u201d or \u201cany combination of parts ... designed ... for use in converting any device into an explosive bomb and from which an explosive bomb may be readily assembled.\u201d A. 176. Shee-han argues that the evidence was insufficient to establish that the device was an explosive bomb and that the jury should not have been given a combination-of-parts instruction. He also argues: that the district court\u2019s combination-of-parts jury instruction was erroneous because it did not require subjective intent, failed to define the term \u201creadily assembled,\u201d and was misleading. Finally, he contends that he was denied a fair trial because of improper statements made by the prosecutor during summation.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">We conclude that the evidence was,sufficient to establish that the device used by Sheehan was an \u201cexplosive bomb,\u201d as contemplated by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(4), and that the district court did not err in instructing the jury on the combination-of-parts theory of guilt. We further conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s comments during summation did not deprive Sheehan of a fair trial. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b137-10\">On March 20,'2013, a federal grand jury in the Eastern District of New York returned a three-count indictment charging Sheehan with Hobbs Act extortion, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951, use of a destructive device to ' commit extortion; - 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(B)(ii), and use of an explosive to commit extortion, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(h)(1). The charges stemmed from Sheehan\u2019s attempt to obtain money from Home Depot by threatening to \u25a0 plant pipe bombs in Home Depot stores and placing a device purporting to be an inert \u201cmodel\u201d of a pipe bomb in a Home Depot in Huntington Station. At trial, only the first two charges were submitted to the jury. Sheehan conceded that he was guilty of extortion, but contended that the \u201cpipe bomb\u201d he left in the Home Depot was not functional and thus was not - a \u201cdestructive device\u201d as defined by the statute. The jury Convicted Sheehan on both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-11\">I. The Extortion Plot</p>\n<p id=\"b137-12\">Because the jury found Sheehan guilty of all charges relevant to this appeal, \u201cwe view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government.\u201d <em>United States v. Mergen, </em>764 F.3d 199, 202 (2d Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted). So viewed, the evidence established the following facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-13\">At some point prior to October .2012, Sheehan purchased a prepaid cell phone and the components necessary to create a pipe bomb. Using a pipe, end caps, powder from shotguns shells, and an igniter from a model rocket, Sheehan assembled and det<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>onated a pipe bomb in a shed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The explosion left a hole in the floor. Thereafter, Sheehan assembled a similar device using powder from shotgun shells, a metal pipe and end caps, a nine-volt battery, a pull string and switch, and (per his subsequent confession) another model rocket igniter, and placed it in a cardboard light fixture box previously purchased from a Home Depot.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Several days later, while wearing a disguise consisting of a wig, arm sling and make-up, he placed the cardboard box containing the device in the lighting department of the Huntington Station Home Depot. Sheehan, who is allergic to cats, also planted cat hair along with the device to throw off investigators, and further attempted to conceal his identity by changing a character on his license plate number with a marker. Sheehan did not initially connect the pull string to the shelf, but about a week to ten days later, Sheehan returned to the Home Depot and, using a construction adhesive transported in a ketchup packet, affixed the string extending from the device to the shelf \u201cso that it would look like it would work.\u201d G.A. 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">In mid-October, approximately two weeks after he glued the pull string to the shelf, Sheehan sent a handwritten letter to the Huntington Station Home Depot.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The letter states, in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-5\">To the store mgr:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-6\">There is a bomb in the light box in the lighting dept. SKU # 491-803. YOU\u2019RE IN NO DANGER. The battery is not connected [and] igniter is separated. It cannot go off: I needed to prove I can make a device [and] get \u2019em in the stores undetected.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-10\">I want two million (1.5 in 100, .5 in 50) or I will shut down all your [Long Island] stores on Black Friday. I can detonate 3 devices in 3 different stores remotely via [cellular phone]. Then bomb threats will close the rest. Doing this on Thanksgiving will assure no one gets hurt, except your wallet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-11\">I will give you until the week of Oct. 26th to notify the suits in Atlanta [and] to get the cash. If you go to the police or feds I will go to the media\u2014then you risk scaring off way more than two million in sales, and copycat actions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-12\">Pay me this one time and you have my word you will never hear from me again. I am going to a warm climate with thin brown girls and drink myself to death. I will also get a two million dollar] life insurance policy naming Home Depot beneficiary. So consider this an interest free loan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-13\">The other devices are 2[.5]\u201c by 6\u201d black pipe with 1 pound of roofing nails siliconed to them each.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-14\">If you do not pay employees will be the first then customers last. Please don\u2019t let this happen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-15\">I will call your store at noon on Oct. 17th extension 300 to see what you decide.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AbA\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>I will know if you go to the cops. I can see your store all day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-5\">Pay me\u2014end this\u2014raise your prices 10 cents [and] break even.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">G.A. 16-17.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">The Home Depot was subsequently evacuated. Members of the Suffolk County bomb squad located what appeared to be an improvised explosive device (\u201cIED\u201d) in a cardboard light fixture box on a shelf in the lighting department. The device was x-rayed. Upon visual observation of the device and the x-ray images, the device appeared to be a pipe bomb consisting of a metal pipe and two metal end caps with wires and a nine-volt battery extending from the device. The device was affixed to the shelf via a string connected to a pull switch on the device and to a red carabiner glued to the shelf. The string appeared to be part of a triggering mechanism such that, when the device was picked up by a victim, the string attached to the shelf would pull the switch attached to the device (and, presumably, detonate it). The x-rays did not, however, provide the bomb squad with an image of the interior of the pipe.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">Standard procedure for disarming a pipe bomb requires the removal of an end cap to prevent pressure from building up inside the pipe. Before attempting to remove an end cap, the bomb squad moved the device to the back of the store to prevent accidental detonation in the lighting department, which contained metal and glass. Next, the bomb squad used a robot equipped with a Percussion Actuated Nonelectric Disrupter to shoot a disintegrating projectile at the pipe bomb in order to knock off an end cap. The device exploded, however, damaging the ceiling, walls, and doors on either end of the area in which the bomb had been placed. Post-detonation testing revealed that the powder inside the pipe bomb was double-base smokeless powder.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-11\">Two days later, Andrew Salvoni, the Home Depot manager, received a phone call from Sheehan. That call was recorded. During the call, Sheehan reiterated his demand for money, but lowered the request to one million dollars. Sheehan subsequently sent a second, typed, letter addressed to Salvoni in which Sheehan apologized for the stress he was causing Salvoni and stated that his goal was \u201cto get the money, get away ... [,] and not hurt anyone.\u201d G.A. 28. He then wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-12\">To achieve my goal I am going to be wired up like a Christmas tree. I have 2 devices strapped to a belt and 1 to a neck chain that I will be wearing, wired together and attached to a \u201cdeadman\u201d switch in my hand. SO PLEASE tell authorities not to approach me[.] I do NOT want to be the cause of a fatherless child (they always have small children). To keep from being shot from a distance I am going to deposit in one of your stores the morning of the drop a new device I designed. I attached a 2\" x 6\" pipe w[ith] 1 lb. of roofing nails glued to outside, wired to a 6 volt battery w[ith] 2 igniters to one of your digital thermostats set for 68 degrees. I put a[n] ice pack in the box that should give me no less th[a]n 11 hours to get money, get away and buy back device. I will call you when all is clear. You have my word and my word is my bond.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pALY\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-13\">If you guys try to screw me\u2014You told me your company would pay. I have not lied to you or tried to hurt anyone, so if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>you lied or plan to trick me this whole thing will become personal. If you drop off ANYTHING besides US circulated currency I will end Black [F]riday and all following sales events until I am caught.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">G.A. 28. Sheehan later called Salvoni again and expressed anger about the presence of the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Using telephone records, agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\u201cFBI\u201d) were able to identify the number of Shee-han\u2019s prepaid cellular phone and locate the phone, thereby enabling the agents to locate and arrest Sheehan. Upon arrest, Sheehan agreed to make a written statement. Sheehan\u2019s written confession admitted to purchasing a prepaid cellular phone and materials for making a pipe bomb, and creating and detonating a test bomb in a shed. Sheehan further admitted to creating a similar device using smokeless powder (from shotgun shells), a pipe and end caps, a nine-volt battery and a pull string switch, and a model rocket igniter; planting that device in the Home Depot; and returning to the Home- Depot to attach the pull string to the shelf.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-6\">Sheehan also described his escape plan: Earlier this ' year, I ... was given a Yamaha Wav\u00e9-Runner which was hollow and motorless. I got this through a contact on [Craigslist].... I also purchased a cooler' at a K-Mart .,. which I was going to use with the Wave-Runner as part of my plan for the money drop. I modified both the Wave-Runner and the cooler by putting holes in them. The cooler is now attached to the seat of the Wave-Runner-My plan for the money drop was to put the Wave-Runner in Huntington Harbor, and to hide in the water under the Wave-Runner and have the extortion money placed into the cooler and I would retrieve it from beneath the Wave-Runner through the,holes I had cut into the cooler and the Wave-Runner. I planned to use an air tank so I could stay under water and swim away with the money.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-10\">G.A. 14-15. Prior to his arrest, Sheehan had purchased a wetsuit and an air tank.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-11\">II. The Nature of the Device</p>\n<p id=\"b140-12\">At trial, Sheehan conceded his guilt with respect to the extortion count. His sole defense was that he was not guilty of the enhanced charge of using a destructive device to commit extortion because the device he left in the Home Depot was not a \u201cdestructive device\u201d (as it was not capable of detonation, in his view, absent extraordinary circumstances, such as being struck by a projectile), and could not be readily converted into such a device.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-13\">Among other witnesses, the government called Special Agent Christopher Rigopou-los, an FBI explosives and hazardous devices- examiner, as an explosives expert. Rigopoulos testified that a pipe bomb is an IED, meaning that it is not commercially made, and that the, typical ,IED will contain an explosive main charge, an electrical fuzing<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> system, a main charge container, and a concealment chamber. Rigopoulos explained that Sheehan\u2019s device included those items in the form of smokeless pow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>der, the wires and nine-volt battery, pipe, and light fixture box. Rigopoulos clarified that \u201c[t]he components of an electrical fuzing system are typically wires, conductors, a switch, a power source, which are generally batteries, and an initiator, or sometimes called a load.\u201d A. 92. The initiator, also described as an \u201cignitor,\u201d A. 96, is placed inside the pipe to ignite the explosive main charge. No ignitor was recovered from the device, possibly as a result of the explosion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Rigopoulos acknowledged that several wires did not appear to be attached to anything and that the.battery was not attached to the fuzing system, which would prevent the fuzing system from functioning in its current condition. Rigopoulos opined, however, that the battery could be attached easily with tape or epoxy (rendering the device functional) within \u201cten minutes or less.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> .A. 145. Rigopoulos further concluded that the device as planted constituted a \u201cpipe bomb,\u201d notwithstanding the non-functional fuzing system, because it could be detonated by means other than the fuzing system, including by heat, shock, or friction that could be generated by dropping the device or unscrewing an end cap. A. 96. Rigopoulos testified that it was dangerous to disarm a pipe bomb by unscrewing an end cap, as that could generate- a spark and cause the device to detonate.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">Following Rigopoulos\u2019s testimony, the government rested and the defense moved under Fed. R. Crim. P. 29 for acquittal on the use of a destructive device charg\u00e9 on the ground that there was no evidence that the device contained an' igniter and the battery was not hooked up to the fuzing system. The court reserved decision, and ultimately denied the motion post-trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-10\">During the defense\u2019s case, Sheehan presented his own expert, Warren Parker, a retired Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives agent. Parker testified that there was no way, based on the x-rays and recovered portions of the device, to determine whether it contained an igniter, and that, if Sheehan needed to connect an igniter, he would need to unscrew the end cap to do so. Parker further opined that the possibility of the device exploding accidentally was \u201c[s]o remote .-.. as to be not practical at all,\u201d A. Ill, as smokeless powder is stable and ignites, at 600 degrees, a temperature that will not be generated by unscrewing an end cap or dropping the device.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Parker concluded that the device was not an explosive bomb because it \u201cwas assembled in a manner that could not be exploded electrically or accidentally by touching some other electrical component.\u201d A. 110.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>On rebuttal, the government called a second expert witness, Kirk Yeager, a forensic scientist. Yeager, opined that smokeless powder could ignite at a temperature of 400 to 451 degrees, and that, if smokeless powder was in the screw threads, the friction caused by unscrewing an end cap could create sufficient heat for detonation.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">In summation, defense counsel again conceded Sheehan\u2019s guilt on the extortion count, but argued that. Sheehan could not be guilty of using a destructive device because the device was designed to be incomplete. The government argued repeatedly that the device was a \u201creal bomb,\u201d see, <em>e,g., </em>A. 158, 167, or could be readily converted into one. Sheehan did not object to any statements made during the government\u2019s summation.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">III. Jury Instructions and Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">Over Sheehan\u2019s objection, the district court instructed the jury that it.could convict Sheehan of using a destructive device if it found that the device was either \u201can explosive pipe bomb\u201d or \u201cany combination of parts either- designed or intended for use in converting any device into an explosive bomb and from which an explosive bomb may be readily assembled.\u201d A. 176. The district court \u25a0 denied Sheehan\u2019s request for a jury instruction defining the term \u201creadily assembled\u201d to mean that he concurrently possessed all of the necessary components.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">The jury convicted Sheehan on both the extortion and destructive device counts. The district court imposed a sentence of thirty years\u2019 imprisonment on the destructive device charge, to run consecutive to a one-month sentence for extortion.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-13\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b142-14\">Sheehan challenges only his conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(B)(ii), which provides a thirty-year mandatory minimum sentence for use of a \u201cdestructive device\u201d during a violent crime. In relevant part, a destructive device is defined alternatively as either an \u201cexplosive ... bomb,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 921(a)(4)(A)(i), or \u201cany combination of parts either designed or intended for use in converting any device into any destructive device [listed in the statute] and from which a destructive device may be readily assembled,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 921(a)(4)(C).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Under either definition, a device \u201cwhich is neither designed nor redesigned for use as a weapon,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 921(a)(4), does not constitute a \u201cdestructive device.\u201d Sheehan argues that there was insufficient evidence to establish that the device planted in the Home Depot was an \u201cexplosive bomb\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 921(a)(4)(A)(I).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-15\">Sheehan further contends that the jury should not have been instructed at all on the combination-of-parts theory of guilt because that\" theory is inapplicable to completed devices, and that, even if an instruction on that theory was permissible, the charge given was erroneous because it (1) did not include an instruction on subjective intent or define the term \u201creadily assembled,\u201d and (2) misleadingly included a reference to an inapplicable portion of the statute. Finally, Sheehan argues that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>prosecutor\u2019s summation deprived him of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">I. \u201cExplosive Bomb\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">Sheehan first contends that there was insufficient evidence to establish that his device was an \u201cexplosive bomb\u201d within the meaning of the statute. In challenging the factual sufficiency of the government\u2019s case, defendants face a \u201cheavy burden, as the standard of review is exceedingly deferential.\u201d <em>United States v. </em>Brock, 789 F.3d 60, 63 (2d Cir. 2016) (internal quotation marks omitted). We analyze the sufficiency of the evidence \u201cin the light most favorable to the government, crediting every inference that could have been drawn in the government\u2019s favor, and deferring to the jury\u2019s assessment of witness credibility and its assessment of the weight of the evidence,\u201d and will uphold the conviction \u201cif any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Chavez, </em>549 F.3d 119, 124 (2d Cir. 2008) (alteration, citations, and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">The design of the device suggested that it was intended to be \u201cvictim actuated,\u201d A. 93, meaning that when the concealed device was moved by a potential victim, the string attached to the device and the shelf would pull a switch, complete a circuit, and cause the device to explode. It was undisputed at trial that the device\u2019s electrical fuzing system was not fully connected when the device was found and disarmed by the bomb squad. Therefore, the device could not have been detonated via the electrical fuzing system.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">The experts at trial disagreed, however, as to whether the device could be detonated by other.means, for example, by unscrewing, an end cap or by dropping the device.. Because we must draw all inferences in the government\u2019s favor, we must assume that the jury credited the.testimony of Rigopoulos and Yeager that the device could be detonated in some manner, such as by dropping the device or by unscrewing an end cap, even though the fuzing system was disconnected.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-11\">Accordingly, the question presented is whether a jury could reasonably find that a device that is incapable of detonating in its ordinary or intended manner (because,, for example,, it lacks a particular component ordinarily present in such, a device), but is nonetheless capable of detonating, is an \u201cexplosive bomb\u201d within the meaning of the statute. We have little difficulty concluding that it is. Although this Court has not previously had occasion to address the question, our sister circuits that have done so have .held that the touchstone of whether a device is an \u201cexplosive bomb\u201d is simply whether the bomb is capable of exploding, and have affirmed convictions on the theory that a device that is capable of exploding is an \u201cexplosive bomb\u201d within the meaning of the statute. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Uzenski, </em>434 F.3d 690, 702 (4th Cir. 2006) (affirming conviction where evidence established \u201cat the very least, that the device was capable of exploding\u201d); <em>United States v. Langan, </em>263 F.3d 613, 625 (6th Cir. 2001) (\u201c[T]he government need not establish that any particular component be present for a device to qualify as a destructive device. The only requirement is that the device be capable of exploding\u2014\u201d).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> That the bomb could not explode in the way its maker.might have assumed was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>the ordinary or even only way in- which it could be <em>detonated\u2014i.e,, </em>via the fuzing system\u2014because it lacked a particular component of which such a device is ordinarily composed, is irrelevant. As we have held, whether the defendant <em>intends </em>the device to detonate is irrelevant 'when the assembled device constitutes an \u201cexplosive bomb\u201d within the meaning of the statute. <em>United States v. Posnjak, </em>457 F.2d 1110, 1119 (2d Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">Notwithstanding the testimony of the government\u2019s expert witnesses, Sheehan argues that the device cannot be -considered a completed bomb because such testimony \u201cis so contrary to human experience that no reasonable person would believe it beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Reply Br. 8. That argument, however, is essentially premised on the testimony of Sheehan\u2019s expert, which the jury was free to disregard in favor of the contrary \u00e9x-pert testimony offered by the government. Although there may be rare circumstances where an expert\u2019s testimony is so incredible that no rational factfinder could believe it beyond a reasonable doubt, the testimony of Rigopoulos and Yeager does not fall into that category. Their testimony is not so illogical or contrary to common sense that no rational jury could accept it. Drawing all inferences in favor of the govemment,-we must conclude that the jury credited their testimony that the device could be detonated over the contrary testimony of the defense expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">Sheehan additionally argues that, even if the \u201cdevice was an explosive bomb, [his] conviction must still be reversed because, measured objectively, it was neither designed nor redesigned for use as a weapon.\u201d Appellant Br. 35. In light of the objective features of the device\u2014which was built to look like an IED, contained an explosive, and was capable of detonating\u2014 the jury could rationally find that the device was objectively designed as a weapon even if it was missing a component required to enable it to explode in a specific way. <em>Cf. Langan, </em>263 F.3d at 625. To the extent that the lack of a functional fuzing system may indicate that Sheehan did not <em>subjectively </em>intend for the device to be capable of detonation, or did not know such detonation was possible, Sheehan\u2019s belief is irrelevant, since, when it is clear that the assembled device constitutes an explosive bomb as defined in the statute, \u201cintent is irrelevant.\u201d <em>Posnjak, </em>457 F.2d at 1119.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">II. \u201cCombination of Parts\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-10\">With respect to the alternative combination-of-parts theory of guilt, Sheehan pri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>marily argues that the jury was improperly instructed.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Sheehan contends that the jury should not have been instructed on the combination-of-parts theory at all, because it is inapplicable to completed devices. Sheehan also argues that, to the extent it was appropriate to submit the charge to the jury, the jury charge was erroneous because it did not instruct the jury to acquit Sheehan if it found that he did not subjectively intend to build an explosive bomb and because it did not define the term \u201creadily assembled.\u201d Shee-han further contends that the charge was misleading because it mistakenly included a reference to an inapplicable portion of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">\u201cWe review a claim of error in jury instructions de novo, reversing only where, viewing the charge as a whole, there was a prejudicial error.\u201d <em>United States v.

Completed Devices</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">Sheehan argues on appeal, as he did at the- charge conference below, that the combination-of-parts theory is inapplicable to this case as -a matter of law. \u201cWhere a jury is presented with multiple theories of conviction, one of which is invalid, the.-jury\u2019s verdict must be overturned if it is impossible to tell which theory formed the basis for conviction.\u201d <em>United States v. Szur, </em>289 F.3d 200, 208 (2d Cir. 2002). In such circumstances, our task is to \u201cascertain whether a flawed instruction had a substantial -and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>United States v. Ferguson, </em>676 F.3d 260, 276 (2d Cir. 2011) (internal quotation marks omitted). A defendant is not prejudiced by an \u201cinfirm instruction\u201d if \u201cthe jury would have - necessarily found [him] guilty on one of the properly in: structed theories of liability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 277.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-12\">Sheehan argues that the district court erred in instructing the jury that it could convict him if it found that th\u00e9 device was an explosive bomb <em>or </em>a \u201ccombination of parts ... designed ... for use in converting any device into , an[ ] [explosive bomb],\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(4)(C), because the latter theory applies only to incomplete devices, and not to devices that are fully assembled but missing key components. That argument lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-13\">First, the text of \u00a7 921(a)(4)(C) does not limit itself solely to disassembled devices, as it encompasses <em>\u201cany </em>combination of parts\u201d that can be converted into an explosive bomb. The phase <em>\u201cany </em>combination of parts\u201d naturally extends, at a minimum, to both fully disassembled and partially completed devices. There is no meaningful way to distinguish objectively between, a \u201cpartially assembled\u201d device to which critical additional parts have yet to be added, and an identical configuration of assembled and missing parts which is \u201cfully assembled\u201d in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>the sense that its maker believes he has completed his project. Even where a device appears to be fully assembled-, but is defective in some way because not all of the parts are in place, the text of the statute is satisfied if the device has been designed (in an objective sense) in such a way that it can be easily converted into an effective explosive. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>152 F.3d 618, 627 <em>&amp; </em>n.8 (7th Cir. 1998) (observing that a defendant who possesses \u201can assembled combination of parts that is less clearly\u201d a completed destructive device will generally be charged under the combination-of-parts theory, and noting that homemade bombs are likely to be charged under the combination-of-parts theory \u201cbecause that allows the government a more flexible method of proving [its] case\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">Second, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the combination-of-parts theory is categorically inapplicable to \u201cfully assembled\u201d devices, the question of whether a device was \u201cfully assembled\u201d is a question of fact for the jury. Thus, a combination-of-parts instruction would be appropriate as long as a rational jury could find that the device was at least, partially disassembled. <em>See id. </em>at 627 (finding that the trial court had acted within its discretion in giving a combination-of-parts instruction based on the defendant\u2019s argument that- the device was \u201cnot sufficiently assembled to detonate\u201d). The jury in this case heard expert testimony that the device could have quickly and easily been rendered functional with materials readily available within a Home Depot store. A rational jury could conclude that Sheehan\u2019s device\u2014-which indisputably lacked a functional fuzing system\u2014-was a partially completed device designed in such a way that with readily available materials it could have been converted into a functional explosive device.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Accordingly, the district court did not err in instructing the jury that <em>it could </em>convict if it found beyond a reasonable doubt that the device qualified either as a \u201cdestructive device\u201d or as a \u201ccombination of parts\u201d designed so that it could readily be assembled into a listed destructive device.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">B. Subjective Intent</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">Sheehan next argues that the jury instructions were erroneous because they did not include an instruction indicating that he could not be convicted of possessing a \u201cdestructive device\u201d if he lacked the subjective intent to build such a device. The government elected to proceed solely on a theory of \u201cobjective design\u201d and successfully moved <em>in limine </em>to preclude evidence of Sheehan\u2019s subjective intent, which, Sheehan contends, was to create a \u201cmodel\u201d or \u201cprototype\u201d of a pipe bomb. Def.\u2019s Br. 27, 42. Following a post-trial motion for a new trial pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 38, the district court affirmed its ruling. Upon consideration of the statutory text and relevant case law, we conclude that the district court correctly declined to give a subjective intent instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">The relevant portion of the statute provides that a destructive device includes \u201cany combination of parts <em>either </em>designed or intended for use in converting any device into [an explosive bomb] and from which [an explosive bomb] may be readily assembled,\u201d and further exempts from its coverage any \u201cdevice which is neither <em>designed </em>nor redesigned for use as a weapon....\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(4)(C) (emphasis added). The text of the statute, which lists \u201cdesigned\u201d and \u201cintended\u201d in the alternative, thus indicates that the word \u201cdesigned\u201d in this context means something other than \u201cintended.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">In <em>United States v. Posnjak, </em>we parsed the distinction between \u201cintent\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>and \u201cdesign\u201d in considering whether commercial dynamite qualified as a destructive device.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Concluding that it did not, we explained that \u201c[t]he legislative history indicates that \u2018designed\u2019 in [the context of the phrase \u2018designed or redesigned for use as a weapon\u2019] refers to objective, physical structure or method of operation and not to [the] intent or schemes of the possessor,\u201d <em>Posnjak, </em>457 F.2d at 1116, and further explained that the inclusion of the words \u201cor intended\u201d in the statute indicated that in some instances \u201cintention to convert a device into a[ ] [listed device] will be relevant,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1120. We then clarified that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-5\">When it is clear that the assembled device created by combining the components [would be a device listed in the statute], intent is irrelevant, for the parts are clearly \u201cdesigned\u201d to convert the device into a destructive device. When it is equally clear that the end product [would not be a listed device], the same is true. When, however, the components are capable of conversion into both such a device and another object not covered by the statute, intention to convert the components into the \u201cdestructive device\u201d may be important.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AbG\"><em>Id. </em>at \u00cd119. <em>Posnjak </em>thus clarifies the only situations in which subjective intent is relevant: when the unassembled components are capable of being \u00e1ssembled either into an object listed in the statute as a destruc-five device (such as an explosive bomb) or into an object that is not otherwise covered by the statute.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">The relevance of intent is that in some instances, parts that could be used to build a listed device could also be used to construct some other type of device with a legitimate purpose. Because the National Firearms Act (which defines the term \u201cdestructive device\u201d identically as 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(4), <em>see </em>26 U.S.C \u00a7 5846(f)) criminalizes mere possession of an unregistered destructive device, absent some requirement of subjective intent,, a person could be convicted under federal law of the unauthorized possession of a destructive device simply because she possessed, for legitimate reasons, a variety of ordinary items that could be used either to build bombs or to build something quite innocent. Intent to convert those items into a destructive device is thus necessary to prevent persons from being subject to criminal penalties for harmless, legitimate acts. That policy concern is not implicated, however, where the assembled device lacks any legitimate purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-10\">There is no evidence in this record that would permit an inference that the combination of parts assembled by Sheehan could have been made into any kind of product or device <em>other </em>than a bomb, even assuming that it was not already an explosive bomb capable of detonating. Here, Sheehan\u2019s argument'that the parts in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>question could be assembled into somer thing other than a bomb rests on the proposition that the device he planted at the Huntington Home Depot could be converted into either a functioning pipe bomb or an inert \u201cmodel\u201d of a pipe bomb; thus, by-Sheehan\u2019s reasoning, a subjective intent instruction is required because an inert \u201cmodel\u201d is not a listed device. But this theory falls of its own weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">First, the combination of materials installed in the lighting department, again assuming it was not yet a functional bomb, already <em>was </em>an inert \u201cmodel,\u201d and Sheehan has not even hypothesized, let alone offered any evidence at trial, that the parts could have been made into anything of a legitimate nature, or indeed, into anything other than a bomb or model of a bomb. Therefore, policy concerns about criminalizing possession of legitimate items are not implicated because Sheehan\u2019s device was indisputably illegitimate. Second, any combination-of parts capable of being assembled into a functional bomb could <em>always </em>be assembled in such a way as to render the device non-functional. If a bomb-maker could argue that the parts he had assembled were theoretically capable of being assembled into either a functional or a non-functional bomb, simply because the parts could either be connected properly or left, in some respect, unconnected, then a subjective intent instruction would be required in essentially <em>every </em>combination of parts case, thereby rendering the objective \u201cdesigned\u201d alternative in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(4) superfluous. That conclusion is at odds with both <em>Posnjak </em>and with ordinary canons of statutory construction. <em>See State St. Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Salovaara, </em>326 F.3d 130, 139 (2d Cir. 2003) (\u201cIt is well-settled that courts should avoid statutory interpretations that render provisions superfluous_\u201d). We therefore hold that where a device is capable of being assembled only into a listed device, or a non-functioning version of that same device, it does not fall into the exception outlined in <em>Posnjak </em>requiring a subjective intent instruction. Rather, the government may properly proceed on an \u201cobjective design\u201d theory.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">Because Sheehan\u2019s device could only be assembled into an explosive bomb, or a non-functioning version of an explosive bomb, the district court did not err in declining to give a' subjective intent instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-10\">C. \u201cReadily Assembled\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-11\">Sheehan next argues that the district court erred in declining to define the term \u201creadily assembled\u201d in its instructions on the combination-of-parts theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-12\">A trial court\u2019s decision not to include a requested jury instruction may be overturned \u201conly if the instruction that was sought accurately represented the law in every respect and only if viewing as a whole the charge actually given, the defendant was prejudiced.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>407 F.3d 118, 122 (2d Cir. 2005) (alteration and internal quotation marks omitted). Prejudice may result where a requested instruction.\u201crepresents a theory of defense with basis in the record that would lead to acquittal, and the theory is not effectively presented elsewhere in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>charge.\u201d <em>United States v. Quattrone, </em>441 F.3d 153, 177 (2d Cir. 2006) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Sheehan requested, and was denied, a jury instruction stating that in order for the device to be capable of being \u201creadily assembled,\u201d the defendant must possess all necessary components without \u201cgoing shopping.\u201d A. 135. The district court instead instructed the jury that it should interpret \u201creadily\u201d and \u201cassembled\u201d \u201cconsistent with their everyday ordinary meanings.\u201d A. 176.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">Turning to the question of whether the requested charge correctly stated that law, we note that <em>Posnjak </em>mentioned, in describing the combination-of-parts theory, that \u201c[a]ll of the necessary components from which a destructive device may be readily assembled must be possessed in order to possess a destructive device.\u201d <em>Posnjak, </em>457 F.2d at 1116 (internal quotation marks omitted). <em>Posnjak, </em>however, primarily addressed the question of whether commercial dynamite, which has a legitimate purpose independent of its destructive one, could, constitute a destructive device and, apart from that single passing reference, did not analyze what components must actually be possessed. We do not think that the statement in <em>Posnjak </em>was intended to require the government to prove that the defendant possessed every single item, including ordinary household items, that would be necessary to assemble a destructive device.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">\u25a0 In this case, based on Rigopoulos\u2019s testimony, the only-item necessary to convert the device on the Home Depot shelf (if not already functional) into a fully functional bomb was a piece of adhesive tape to connect the wires to the battery. Such an ordinary household item is not only present in virtually every American household\u2014it was also readily available within the Home Depot outlet where the device was installed. Indeed, Sheehan\u2019s own expert acknowledged that there was tape around the device that could have been used to attach one of the wires from the pipe to the .top of the battery. The language in <em>Posnjak </em>on which.Sheehan relies makes sense when read to require that a \u201ccombination of parts\u201d cannot be considered a destructive device based on the hypothetical possibility that the parts could be \u201creadily\u201d made into a bomb only if the defendant could obtain some crucial component that he did not possess and could not acquire without. a \u201cshopping trip.\u201d <em>See, e.g., United States v. Malone, </em>546 F.2d 1182, 1184 (5th Cir. 1977) (holding that the defendant could not be convicted for possessing a combination of parts that could be readily assembled into a bomb where the defendant did not possess any explosive material, a key element required for the creation of a bomb). <em>Posn-jak </em>cannot sensibly be read to require proof that the defendant already owned such a mundane and readily accessible \u201ccomponent\u201d to be used in attaching the functional parts of the device to each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">We therefore hold that the government need not offer evidence that the defendant possessed commonly available materials\u2014such as tape\u2014if the defendant otherwise possesses all of the key components necessary to assemble a destructive device. <em>See United States v. Simmons, </em>83 F.3d 686, 687 (4th Cir. 1996) (observing that possession of a'method of ignition, such as a match, is not typically required to find that the defendant possessed the components necessary to assemble a Molotov cocktail); <em>United States v. Crocker, </em>260 Fed.Appx. 794, 797 (6th Cir. 2008) (\u201cAlthough the government did not introduce evidence that the defendant possessed tape, this Court does not require showing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>possession of all commonly available materials when'determining whether- a destructive device could have been readily assembled.\u201d); <em>Langan, </em>263 F.3d at 626 (holding that a reasonable jury could find the device to be readily convertible into an explosive bomb where wires could be quickly stripped and re-crimped 'to a pager that was part of the detonating mechanism).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">As Sheehan could be convicted of possessing a combination of parts that may be readily assembled into an explosive bomb even absent evidence that he possessed tape, the district court did not err in declining to give the requested instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">D. Mistaken Inclusion of \u201cOr Intended\u201d Language</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">Sheehan further argues that the jury charge was misleading because it mistakenly included a reference to an inapplicable portion of the statute. The government proceeded solely'on a theory of objective design, and the court excluded <em>in limine </em>evidence related to Sheehan\u2019s subjective intent. In instructing the jury, the district court stated':</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARh\">A destructive device has several meanings under the statute. But for the purpose of this case, the . only \u2022 relevant meaning is an explosive bomb. And this would include, A, an explosive pipe bomb or; B, any combination of parts either designed <em>or intended, </em>for use in converting any device into an explosive bomb and from which an explosive bomb may be readily assembled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">A. 176 (emphasis added). The court additionally explained that, in considering whether the device was \u201cdesigned for use as a weapon,\u201d the jury\u2019s analysis \u201cmust be objective\u201d and \u201cfocus solely on the physical structure and operational characteristics of the device in determining its purpose.\u201d A. 176-77.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-11\">Sheehan did not object to the jury instruction. As the district court acknowledged, and the government concedes, it was error to include the phrase \u201cor intended,\u201d as the evidence was limited to that concerning objective design. Sheehan contends that the inclusion of the phrase \u201cor intended\u201d is plain error as it would allow the jury to convict Sheehan if it found that the device was objectively designed to be an inert prototype, but that Sheehan subjectively intended to create a destructive device.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-12\">Because Sheehan did not object to the jury instruction, we review for plain error, which requires him to establish \u201c(1) error (2) that is plain and (3) affects substantial rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Villafuerte, </em>602 F.3d 204, 209 (2d Cir. 2007). If those requirements are met, we then \u201cconsider whether to exercise our discretion :to correct it, which is appropriate only if the error seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). The district court found that the mistaken inclusion of the words \u201cor intended\u201d benefitted the defendant as \u201cit suggested, albeit erroneously, that his intent ... might somehow be germane,\u201d A. 276, and further concluded that the error was harmless. We disagree with the conclusion that the erroneous instruction necessarily benefitted the defendant since, read literally, it would provide an alternative theory (intent to create a bomb) under which the jury could convict Sheehan. Nevertheless, we agree that on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>the facts of this case, the error did not affect Sheehan\u2019s substantial rights or undermine the fairness of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">On the record of this case, there was no meaningful possibility that the jurors could have misunderstood the position of the parties or the theory on which the case was put before them. In light of the evidence, the summations, and the instructions taken as a whole, it was made clear to the jury that the government\u2019s case rested on the alternative arguments that the device, based on its objective design, either <em>was </em>an explosive bomb or was a combination of parts that <em>could </em>be assembled into one, without reference to Shee-han\u2019s intentions. It was undisputed at trial that the device planted in the Home Depot was, at the very least, missing a functional electrical fuzing system and Parker testified that the device had been deliberately rendered inoperable. Sheehan additionally argued in his opening statement and summation that the device was designed to be a \u201cmodel\u201d or \u201cprototype\u201d of an actual pipe bomb. A. 21; A. 160. The government presented no evidence, and made no argument, that Sheehan actually intended to make further alterations to the device; it offered testimony, and argued to the jury, only that such alterations were theoretically possible. On the record, to the extent that the jury had a reasonable doubt about whether the device was objectively designed to be, or capable of ready conversion into, an explosive bomb, it could not rationally have then found that Sheehan <em>intended </em>to build an explosive bomb absent some evidence of his future plans for the device. The district court\u2019s erroneous inclusion of the statutory phrase \u201cor intended\u201d thus did not affect Sheehan\u2019s substantial rights or adversely affect the fairness of the proceedings. <em>See United States v. Tomkins, </em>782 F.3d 338, 347 (7th Cir. 2015) (\u201c[A]ny error with the jury instructions\u2019 definition of \u2018destructive device\u2019 was harmless because there was ample evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the devices were destructive devices.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">Accordingly, we conclude that the district court appropriately instructed the jury on the combination-of-parts theory, was not required to give a subjective intent instruction or definition of the term \u201creadily assembled,\u201d and that the jury charge, taken as a whole, was not misleading. We reject Sheehan\u2019s challenges to the combination-of-parts theory of guilt and, because the evidence was sufficient to convict him of possessing'an explosive bomb, we need not address the sufficiency of the evidence with respect to the combination-of-parts theory.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">III. Summation</p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">Sheehan also argues that the government\u2019s closing arguments, in particular, its rebuttal summation, deprived him of a fair trial, citing a number of examples of purported misconduct. \u201c[A] defendant who seeks to overturn his conviction based on alleged prosecutorial misconduct in summation bears a heavy burden.\u201d <em>United States v. Farhane, </em>634 F.3d 127, 167 (2d Cir. 2011) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cThe defendant must show not simply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>that a particular summation comment was improper, but that the comment, viewed against the entire argument to the jury, and in the context of the entire trial, was so severe and significant as to have substantially prejudiced him, such that the resulting conviction was a denial of due process.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>690 F.3d 70, 74-75 (2d Cir. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted). As Sheehan did not raise this objection at trial, we will not reverse \u201cabsent flagrant abuse.\u201d <em>United States v. Zichettello, </em>208 F.3d 72, 103 (2d Cir. 2000) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">Although we do not include a full recitation of the statements claimed to be improper, they can be broken down into roughly three categories: statements that allegedly mischaracterized the evidence,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> statements that allegedly reflected the prosecutor\u2019s personal beliefs about defense counsel,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and statements that allegedly denigrated the defense expert.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Upon careful review of the record as a whole, we find that most of the comments were permissible arguments about the merits of the defendant\u2019s theory of the case or made in response to defense counsel\u2019s own summation comments, which impugned the integrity of the government\u2019s case. <em>See United States v. Carr, </em>424 F.3d 213, 227 (2d Cir. 2005) (\u201c[T]he government is allowed to respond to an argument that impugns its integrity or the integrity of the case, and when the defense counsel have attacked the prosecutor\u2019s credibility or the credibility of the government agents, the prosecutor is entitled to reply with rebutting language suitable to the occasion.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). In any event, even assuming that some of the statements made by the prosecutor were improper, they certainly cannot be considered to amount to \u201cflagrant abuse.\u201d <em>See Farhane, </em>634 F.3d at 167 (\u201cThe law has long recognized that summations\u2014and particularly rebuttal summations\u2014are not detached expositions, with every word carefully constructed before the event.\u201d (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted)). As the district court observed, although some of the prosecutor\u2019s statements \u201cwere not as nuanced as the power of hindsight in a non-summation context would permit,\u201d A, 252-53, none of the statements were so egregious that, even when taken cumulatively, they could have undermined .the fairness of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b138-7\">. The government did not argue at trial, and does not argue here, that Sheehan\u2019s actions in building and testing this unquestionably explosive device constituted the possession of an explosive bomb in furtherance of his extortion plot.

On appeal as at trial, Sheehan contends that the device he created was not capable of detonation in the ordinary course of handling.

In his PowerPoint presentation accompanying his testimony, Rigopoulos used the term \"fuze,\u201d rather than \"fuse.\u201d Both terms generally refer to a device that initiates an explosion after a delay. <em>See Fuse, </em>Encyclopaedia Britannica (online edition), www.britannica.com/ technology/fuse-ignition-device.

At trial, the parties disputed the significance of the failure to recover an igniter. Sheehan argued that the evidence was insufficient to establish that an igniter was even present while the government argued that the explosion could have destroyed the igniter, and pointed to Sheehan\u2019s confession\u2014wherein he described the device as including an igniter\u2014 as evidence that an igniter was present prior to the \u2019explosion. Given the conflicting evidence, the jury was entitled to find that an igniter was present in the device when planted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b141-7\">. That time estimate assumed that an igniter was in the pipe, and that the only thing that would need to be done to finish the fuzing system was to connect the wires on the exteri- or of the pipe.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b141-12\">.Parker also noted that smokeless powder \"is a military explosive ... designed to live ... under battlefield conditions without accidentally going off,\u201d A. 112, that it is also used by hunters (who are not careful about dropping ammunition), and that a previous incident in which a police officer was killed when a pipe bomb detonated after an end cap was unscrewed involved the less-stable black powder.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b142-8\">. The statute reads, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-9\">(4) The term \"destructive device\u201d means\u2014 (A) any explosive, incendiary, or poison gas-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-10\">Ci) bomb, [or]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAdv\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-11\">(C) any combination of parts either designed or intended for use in converting any device into any destructive device described in subparagraph (A) ... and from which a destructive device may be readily assembled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-17\">The term \"destructive device\u201d shall not include any device which is neither designed nor redesigned for use as a weapon....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-18\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(4).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b143-9\">. Many cases interpreting the term \u201cdestructive device,\u201d including <em>Uzenski, </em>have done so in the context of the National Firearms Act, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5801 <em>et seq., </em>which makes it a crime to receive or possess an unregistered firearm, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 5861(d), with the term \"firearm\u201d being defined to include a \"destructive device,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 5845(a). The National Firearms Act, 26 U.S.C \u00a7 5845(f), arid the statute at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>issue here, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(4), define the term \"destructive device\u201d identically.</p>\n<p id=\"AZ0\">Although the term \"destructive device\u201d is defined identically in the two statutes, and thus must be given a similar construction, <em>United States v. Posnjdk, </em>457 F.2d 1110, 1114 (2d Cir. 1972), -we pause to note that different policy considerations are implicated by each statutory scheme. Under the National Firearms Act, the only \u201cact\u201d required to incur criminal liability is the failure to register a destructive device, whereas a person can be guilty under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) only if she uses a \"destructive device\u201d in furtherance of some other crime of violence. Thus, in <em>Posn-jak, </em>we held that possession of unregistered dynamite does not violate the National Firearms Act because dynamite has a legitimate social purpose; reading the term \"destructive device\u201d expansively in that context could impose criminal liability on persons possessing certain items for perfectly legitimate purposes. <em>See Posnjak, </em>457 F.2d at 1118. But \u00a7 924(c) requires that the device, <em>i.e,, </em>dynamite, be used or carried in furtherance of a crime of violence. In that context, the fact that dynamite also has a legitimate purpose would seem less significant. Thus, while the meaning of the definition is the same in both statutes, caution should be applied in translating broad dictum or policy concerns from National Firearms Act possession cases to extortion cases under \u00a7 924(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b145-8\">. Sheehan largely presents these arguments as challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence under the combination-of-parts theory. His arguments, however, challenge the appropriateness of the theory as presented to the jury and are thus properly framed as challenges to the jury instructions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b147-6\">. As discussed in note 9, <em>supra, Posnjak </em>analyzed the definition of \"destructive device\u201d under the National Firearms Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b147-7\">. That conclusion is very similar, though not identical, to the approach taken by several of our sister circuits that have held that subjective intent is relevant only when the device could have legitimate commercial or social value. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Tomkins, </em>782 F.3d 338, 345-46 (7th Cir. 2015); <em>United States v. Urban, </em>140 F.3d 229, 234 (3d Cir. 1998). But we also note that other circuit courts appear to have reached the conclusion that any conviction under the combination-of-parts theory requires subjective intent. <em>See Uzenski, </em>434 F.3d at 701 n.4 (collecting cases). Because the plain language of the statute contemplates the possibility that a combination of parts can qualify as a destructive device where it is objectively designed\u2014as well as when it is subjectively intended\u2014to be converted into an explosive bomb, we do not find those cases persuasive insofar as they may be read to require intent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b148-5\">. The construction of a device to resemble a bomb, but not actually detonate, is, of course, relevant to the question of, whether it was \u201cdesigned or redesigned for use as a weapon.\u201d 18 IhS.C. \u00a7 921(a)(4). Thus, in some instances, \"the construction of a device, objectively assessed, [may] raise[] the reasonable possibility that it was <em>designed </em>as something other than a destructive device.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>152 F.3d at 627. That inquiry, however, is for the jury to answer and concerns the objective design and construction of the device\u2014not the defendant\u2019s subjective intent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b150-9\">. The court later instructed the jury that \"[a]n act is done intentionally when the defendant acted deliberately and purposefully. That is, defendant's acts must have been the product of defendant\u2019s conscious objective rather than the product of a mistake or accident.\" A. 177.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b151-6\">. \u2018\u2018[W]hen divergent theories of criminal liability are submitted to the jury and the jury renders a general guilty verdict, on a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, if the evidence amply supports one of the theories presented the verdict must be affirmed.\u201d <em>United States v. Delano, </em>55 F,3d 720, 730 (2d Cir. 1995). However, if one of the theories is based on an erroneous view of the law, remand is appropriate even if the evidence is sufficient to prove the other theory. <em>Id. </em>at 730-31. Because the evidence was sufficient to sustain Sheehan\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 921(a)(4)(A)(I), we need not address the sufficiency of the evidence with respect to the alternative combination-of-parts theory of guilt.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b152-5\">. For example, Sheehan claims that the statement, \"[p]ipe bombs, if you unscrew them and there is any smokeless powder in the threading, it's going to explode,\u201d A. 157, misstated the evidence which shows only that pipe bombs <em>may </em>explode in that circumstance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b152-6\">, These challenged statements largely emphasized the point that defense counsel was \"a good lawyer\u201d but \u201cnot a bomb tech\u201d and \u201cnot a mind reader,\" A. 167, and contended that defense counsel \"has a fundamental misunderstanding of the evidence,\u201d A. 168, and had presented irrelevant arguments,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"AfF\">.The challenged statements characterized Parker as a \"hired gun[]\u201d who \u201cflipped flopped,\u201d A. 159, and compared Parker unfavorably to the members of the bomb squad who disarmed the bomb.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
