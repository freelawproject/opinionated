(FAC) (collectively, the Plaintiffs), appeal the district court\u2019s dismissal of their ex post facto challenges to the residency restriction in Miami-Dade County\u2019s Lauren Book Child Safety Ordinance (the Ordinance). On appeal, the Plaintiffs argue that they pleaded sufficient facts to state a claim that the residency restriction is so punitive in effect as to violate the ex post facto clauses of the federal and Florida Constitutions. At this stage, we conclude that Doe #1 and Doe #3 have alleged plausible ex post facto challenges to the residency restriction. Therefore, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1052\">*1052</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-4\">On November 15, 2005, Miami-Dade County (the County) adopted the Ordinance, which imposes, <em>inter alia, </em>a residency restriction on \u201csexual offenders\u201d and \u201csexual predators.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Miami-Dade Cty., Fla., Code of Ordinances ch. 21, art. XVII. The Ordinance prohibits a person who has been convicted of any one of several enumerated sexual offenses involving a victim under sixteen years of age from \u201cresiding] within 2,500 feet of any school.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 21-281(a). The 2,500-foot distance is \u201cmeasured in a straight line from the outer boundary of the real property that comprises a sexual offender\u2019s or sexual predator\u2019s residence to the nearest boundary line of the real property that comprises a school,\u201d rather than \u201cby a pedestrian route or automobile route.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 21-281(b). There are three exceptions to the County\u2019s residency restriction: (1) \u201c[t]he sexual offender or sexual predator established a residence prior -to the effective date of th[e] [0]rdinance\u201d; (2) \u25a0\u201c[t]he sexual offender or sexual predator was a minor when he or she committed the sexual offense and was not convicted as an adult\u201d; and (3) \u201c[t]he -school -was opened after the sexual offender or sexual predator established the residence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 21-282(1). Violations of the Ordinance are punishable by a fine up to $1,000, imprisonment for up to 364 days, or both. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 21-281(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-5\">On December 20, 2014, the Plaintiffs filed a complaint against the County, the Florida Department of Corrections, and the Florida Department of Corrections Miami Circuit Administrator, Sunny Uken-ye, in his official capacity (collectively, the Defendants), challenging the constitutionality of the County\u2019s residency restriction. Specifically, the Plaintiffs, challenged the County\u2019s residency restriction (1) as void for vagueness under the Fourteenth Amendment and the Florida Constitution; (2) as a violation of their substantive due process rights to personal security and to acquire residential property under the Fourteenth Amendment and - the Florida Constitution; and (3) as an unconstitutional ex post facto law under the federal and Florida Constitutions. The Defendants moved to dismiss, and the district court dismissed all the claims with prejudice under Federal Rule of Procedure 12(b)(6). The Plaintiffs properly appealed only the dismissal of their ex post facto challenges against the County.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-10\">\u201cWe review de novo the district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss under 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim, accepting the allegations in the complaint as true and construing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Hill v. White, </em>321 F.3d 1334, 1335 (11th Cir. 2003) (per cu-riam).</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-11\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-12\">Both the federal and Florida Constitutions prohibit the passage of ex post facto laws. <em>See </em>U.S. Const, art. I, \u00a7 9, cl. 3; <em>id. </em>art. I, \u00a7 10, cl. 1; Fla. Const, art. I, \u00a7 10. An ex post facto law is a law that \u201capplies] to events occurring before its enactment\u201d and that \u201cdisadvantage^] the offender affected by it, by altering the definition of criminal conduct or increasing the punishment for the crime.\u201d <em>Lynce v. Mathis, </em>519 U.S. 433, 441, 117 S.Ct. 891, 896, 137 L.Ed.2d 63 (1997) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). In <em>Smith v. Doe, </em>the Supreme Court outlined a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1053\">*1053</page-number>framework for determining whether Alaska\u2019s sex offender registration and notification requirements violated the federal Ex Post Facto Clause. <em>See </em>538 U.S. 84, 92-93, 97, 123 S.Ct. 1140, 1146-47, 1149, 155 L.Ed.2d 164 (2003). We join our sister circuits in applying the <em>Smith </em>framework to evaluate an ex post facto challenge to a residency restriction on sexual offenders.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Doe v. Snyder, </em>Nos. 15-1536, 15-2346, 15-2486, 834 F.3d 696, 2016 WL 4473231 (6th Cir. Aug. 25, 2016) (consolidated); <em>Shaw v. Patton, </em>823 F.3d 556, 561-62 (10th Cir. 2016); <em>Doe v. Miller, </em>405 F.3d 700, 718 (8th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-5\">The <em>Smith </em>Court noted that Alaska\u2019s statute was retroactive and applied the following framework to determine whether the statute violated the Ex Post Facto Clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1077-6\">We must ascertain whether the legislature meant the statute to establish civil proceedings. If the intention of the legislature was to impose punishment, that ends the inquiry. If, however, the intention was to enact a regulatory scheme that is civil and nonpunitive, we must further examine whether the statutory scheme is so punitive either in purpose or.effect as to negate the State\u2019s intention to deem it civil.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1077-7\">538 U.S. at 92, 123 S.Ct. at 1146-47 (alteration adopted) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). After determining that the Alaska legislature intended to \u201ccreate a civil, nonpunitive regime,\u201d the Court explained that several factors guide the second part of the analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1077-10\">whether, in its necessary operation, the regulatory scheme: [1] has been regarded in our history and traditions as a punishment; [2] imposes an affirmative disability or restraint; [3] promotes the traditional aims of punishment; [4] has a rational connection to a nonpunitive purpose; or [5] is excessive with respect to this purpose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1077-11\"><em>See id. </em>at 96-97, 123 S.Ct. at 1149.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Ultimately, the Court concluded that the Alaska statute was not punitive and, therefore, did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause. <em>See id. </em>at 105-06,123 S.Ct. at 1154.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-12\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-13\">The County does not contest that its residency restriction applies to individuals \u201cconvicted\u201d of relevant sexual offenses before the passage of the \u25a0 Ordinance. <em>See </em>Ordinance \u00a7 21-281(a); <em>Lynce, </em>519 U.S. at 441, 117 S.Ct/ -at 896 (a statute is only retroactive if it \u201capplfies] to events occurring before its enactment\u201d (internal quotation mark omitted)). Therefore, we accept for purposes of this appeal that the residency restriction applies retroactively. Additionally, the Plaintiffs do not contest the County\u2019s assertion that the County intended the Ordinance to be civil and non-punitive. Therefore, we also accept for purposes of this appeal that the County intended to \u201ccreate a civil, nonpunitive regime\u201d under the first step of the <em>Smith </em>analysis. <em>See Smith, </em>538 U.S. at 96, 123 S.Ct: at 1149.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-14\">Finally, only Doe #i and Doe #3 have properly alleged that the County\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1054\">*1054</page-number>residency restriction applied retroactively to them\u2014that the restriction applied to their pre-enactment convictions for qualifying sexual offenses.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, we need only decide whether Doe #1 and Doe #3 alleged sufficient facts to state a plausible claim that the County\u2019s residency restriction is- so punitive in effect as to violate the federal and Florida ex post facto clauses under. <em>Smith. See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 677-79,129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949-50, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009). We conclude they have done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-4\">The complaint sufficiently alleged that the County\u2019s residency restriction imposes a direct restraint on Doe #l\u2019s and Doe #3\u2019s freedom to select or change residences. Under the \u201caffirmative disability or restraint\u201d factor, \u201cwe inquire how the effects of the [Ordinance] are felt by those subject to it.\u201d <em>See Smith, </em>538 U.S. at 99-100, 123 S.Ct. at 1151 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Plaintiffs alleged in their complaint that the County\u2019s residency restriction severely limits housing options for individuals subject to the restriction, \u201cdrastically exacetbat[ing] transience and homelessness.\u201d <em>See </em>Amended Complaint at \u00b674. Doe #1 and Doe #3 have specifically alleged that they are homeless and that their homelessness resulted directly from the County\u2019s residency restriction \u201cseverely restricting available, affordable housing- options.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 54; <em>accord id. </em>at \u00b6 28. Doe #1 was twice instructed by probation officers to live at homeless encampments after the County\u2019s residency restriction made him unable to live with his sister and he could not find other housing compliant with the restriction. <em>See id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 18-28. He currently lives at a makeshift homeless encampment near \u201can active railroad track\u201d (the Encampment).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b65, 25. Similarly, Doe #3 sleeps in his car at the .Encampment because, \u201cdespite repeated attempts, he has been unable to obtain available, affordable rental housing in compliance with the Ordinance.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 52-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-8\">Doe #1 and Doe #3 also sufficiently alleged that the County\u2019s residency restriction is excessive in comparison to its public safety goal of addressing recidivism.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See Smith, </em>538 U.S. at 105, 123 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1055\">*1055</page-number>S.Ct. at 1154 (regulation is excessive if \u201c[un]reasonable in light of [its] nonpunitive objective\u201d). Accepting the facts alleged in the complaint as true, the County\u2019s residency restriction is \u201camong the strictest in the nation.\u201d <em>See </em>Amended Complaint at \u00b6 74. An individual becomes subject to the restriction based solely on the fact of his or her prior conviction for a listed sexual offense, without regard to his or her individual \u201crisk of recidivism over time.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 72-73. This is so despite the fact that \u201c[rjesearch has consistently shown that sexual offender recidivism rates are among the lowest for any category of offenses, and that this lower risk of sexual offense recidivism steadily declines over time.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at \u00b6 136. Nonetheless, the County\u2019s residency restriction applies for life, even after an individual no longer has to register as a sexual offender under Florida law and is no longer subject to the state law 1,000-foot residency restriction. <em>See id. </em>at \u00b672. The County\u2019s residency restriction also applies \u201ceven if there is no viable route to reach the school within 2500 feet.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 141.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-5\">The Plaintiffs further argue that the County\u2019s residency restriction not only fails to advance, but also directly undermines, the goal of public safety. The complaint stated that \u201c[t]he only demonstrated means of effectively managing reentry and recidivism [of former sexual offenders] are targeted treatment, along with maintaining supportive, stable environments that provide access to housing, employment, and transportation,\u201d rather than by \u201c[making] categorical assumptions about groups of former sexual offenders.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 137, 143. The complaint also alleged that the transience and. homelessness that the residency restriction causes undermine sexual offenders\u2019 abilities to successfully re-enter society and increase the risk of recidivism by \u201cmak[ing] it more difficult for Plaintiffs and others to secure residences, receive treatment, and obtain and maintain employment.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 146, 149. In light of the foregoing, we conclude that Doe #1 and Doe #3 have stated a plausible claim that the County\u2019s residency restriction is so punitive in effect as to violate the ex post facto clauses of the federal and Florida Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-7\">V-</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-8\">Our role in reviewing the grant of a 12(b)(6) motion merely is to determine whether the plaintiffs stated a plausible claim, such that they should be permitted to proceed to discovery. <em>See Chaparro v. Carnival Corp., </em>693 F.3d 1333, 1337 (11th Cir, 2012) (per curiam). Here, Doe #1 and Doe #3 alleged sufficient facts to raise plausible claims that the County\u2019s residency restriction is so punitive in effect that it violates the ex post facto clauses of the federal and Florida Constitutions. Whether Doe #1 and Doe #3 ultimately prevail is a determination for a future stage of this litigation. Thus, we reverse the district court\u2019s grant of the County\u2019s motion to dismiss as to Doe #1 and Doe #3\u2019s ex post facto challenges and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-9\">AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-10\">Appendix</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-11\">ARTICLE XVII.\u2014THE LAUREN BOOK CHILD SAFETY ORDINANCE</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-12\">Sec. 21-277.\u2014Title.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-13\">Article XVII shall be known and may be cited as \u201cThe Lauren Book Child Safety Ordinance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-14\">Sec. 21-278.\u2014Findings and Intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-15\">(a) Repeat sexual offenders, sexual offenders who use physical violence and sexual offenders who prey on children are sexual predators who present an extreme threat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1056\">*1056</page-number>to the public safety.
