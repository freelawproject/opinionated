He grabbed her and said \u201che was going to take [her] somewhere and rape [her].\u201d He inserted his fingers in her vagina and she screamed. He then removed his hands from her vagina and pulled her 133 feet down the sidewalk past a house with a lit porch light to an area in front of a house with no light. He pushed her facedown onto the hood of a car, \u201cput his hands down [her] pants\u201d and inserted his fingers in her vagina.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-8\">Police Officer James Ella testified that the area to which Nancy C. was moved was \u201cextremely dark.\u201d Trees blocked \u201cmost of the illumination\u201d coming from the light down the street. In a videotaped confession, Aguilar admitted he had grabbed Nancy C., was aroused, and put his fingers in her vagina. He said he moved \u201cto a place where nobody could see [them]\u201d to have intercourse with her. He admitted that what he did was \u201cwrong\u201d and that Nancy C. did not consent to have sex with him. He said he had a knife with him, but he \u201cdidn\u2019t pull the knife out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b845-9\">Martin Molina, a nearby resident, testified that his porch light was the \u201conly light on the street\u201d between the area where Aguilar first grabbed Nancy C. and the location to which she was ultimately dragged. He said the first area was lighter because trees and bushes \u201c[funnel] the light\u201d from his porch light to that area. They deflect light away from the area where the attack ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-10\">Anthony Ventura Castillo was at home when he heard a woman screaming \u201chelp, help\u201d and \u201csave me.\u201d He testified it was so dark he had to turn on the porch light to see what was happening. He saw Aguilar throw Nancy C. to the ground and grab her by the neck. Aguilar was holding a knife \u201c12 or 13 inches from her neck.\u201d Castillo told him to release her. Aguilar \u201cgot up and ran.\u201d Castillo and his brother chased Aguilar and apprehended him.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-11\">[[/]]<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b846-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1048\">*1048</page-number><em>[[Motion To Admit Impeachment Evidence </em>]]<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">I. <em>Sufficiency of Evidence for Aggravated Kidnapping (Count One)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">Aguilar contends the evidence is insufficient to support the aggravated kidnapping conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the judgment and resolve neither credibility issues nor evidentiary conflicts; we look for substantial evidence. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hatch </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 260, 272 [92 Cal.Rptr.2d 80, 991 P.2d 165]; <em>People v. Ochoa </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 1199, 1206 [26 Cal.Rptr.2d 23, 864 P.2d 103].)  \u201cKidnapping to commit rape involves two prongs. First, the defendant must move the victim and this asportation must not be \u2018merely incidental to the [rape].\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Shadden </em>(2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 164, 168 [112 Cal.Rptr.2d 826].) \u201cSecond, the movement must increase \u2018the risk of harm to the victim over and above that necessarily present in the [rape].\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.; </em>see also <em>People v. Rayford </em>(1994) 9 Cal.4th 1, 12 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 317, 884 P.2d 1369]; <em>People v. Daniels </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 1119 [80 Cal.Rptr. 897, 459 P.2d 225].)</p>\n<p id=\"b846-9\">For aggravated kidnapping \u201c \u2018. . . there is no minimum number of feet a defendant must move a victim in order to satisfy the first prong.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Martinez </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 225, 233 [83 Cal.Rptr.2d 533, 973 P.2d 512].) \u201cWhere movement changes the victim\u2019s environment, it does not have to be great in distance to be substantial.\u201d <em>(People v. Shadden, supra, </em>93 Cal.App.4th at p. 169.)</p>\n<p id=\"b846-10\">\u201c[W]here a defendant moves a victim from a public area to a place out of public view, the risk of harm is increased even if the distance is short.\u201d <em>(People v. Shadden, supra, </em>93 Cal.App.4th at p. 169 [defendant moved rape victim from front area of a store in public view nine feet into a closed back room]; <em>People v. Jones </em>(1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 616, 629-630 [89 Cal.Rptr.2d 485] [kidnapping for robbery affirmed where defendant moved victim 40 feet into a car \u201cno longer in public view\u201d]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1586, 1594 [40 Cal.Rptr.2d 31] [defendant moved victim 40 to 50 feet from a driveway \u201copen to street view\u201d into a camper at the rear of the house]; <em>People v. Salazar </em>(1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 341, 348 [39 Cal.Rptr.2d 337] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1049\">*1049</page-number>[conviction for kidnapping with intent to rape affirmed where defendant moved victim 29 feet from outside walkway into a motel bathroom].)</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">Aguilar contends that unlike <em>Shadden </em>and <em>Salazar </em>he did not move Nancy C. into \u201ca hidden location\u201d such as a bathroom or a back room of a store. He says, \u201c[t]he movement was down the sidewalk,\u201d an open area. But this distinction is not dispositive. Courts have held that moving a victim to a more isolated open area which is less visible to public view is sufficient. <em>(People v. Diaz </em>(2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 243, 248-249 [92 Cal.Rptr.2d 682] [defendant moved victim from a well lit area to the back of a recreation center; the court stated, \u201cthe risk to the victim in the dark isolated location of the attack increased significantly as compared to the lighted sidewalk . . . where the incident began\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">In <em>Rayford </em>the defendant forcibly moved the victim 105 feet at night from the parking lot of a closed store \u201cto the other side of a wall located at the edge of the lot.\u201d <em>(People v. Rayford, supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th at p. 23.) <em>Rayford </em>affirmed the kidnapping conviction noting that \u201ca slender tree,\u201d 34 feet from the street, and bushes at the end of the wall \u201climited detection\u201d of the victim. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 6, 23.) Under these circumstances there was sufficient evidence that the forcible movement of the victim was not merely incidental to the attempted rape, but substantially increased the victim\u2019s risk of harm. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 23.)</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">Here Aguilar forcibly moved Nancy C. 133 feet down a sidewalk at night, from an area illuminated by a porch light to an \u201cextremely dark\u201d area. The \u201crisk to [Nancy C.] in the dark . . . increased significantly . . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Diaz, supra, </em>78 Cal.App.4th at pp. 248-249.) Aguilar admitted his goal was to move her \u201cto a place where nobody could see [them].\u201d The movement \u201cdecreased [Aguilar\u2019s] likelihood of detection . . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rayford, supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th at p.13.)</p>\n<p id=\"b847-8\">A reasonable trier of fact could infer this increased the risk to Nancy C. by making it harder for her to escape and \u201cenhanced [Aguilar\u2019s] opportunity to commit additional crimes.\u201d <em>(People v. Rayford, supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th at p. 13.) Moreover, \u201c[a]n increased risk of harm was manifested by appellant\u2019s demonstrated willingness to be violent . . . .\u201d <em>(People v. Jones, supra, </em>75 Cal.App.4th at p. 630.) He pulled Nancy C. down the sidewalk, threw her to the ground, grabbed her neck, choked her, bit her, slammed her onto a car hood, held her facedown and held a knife near her neck. He told Nancy C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1050\">*1050</page-number>that he was moving her to rape her which, when coupled with his violent acts, \u201cpose[d] a substantial increase in the risk of psychological trauma . . . beyond that to be expected from a stationary\u201d sexual attack. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Nguyen </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 872, 886 [95 Cal.Rptr.2d 178, 997 P.2d 493].)</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">Aguilar contends that he did not complete his goal because Castillo rescued Nancy C. But that \u201c \u2018does not. . . mean that the risk of harm was not increased [by the movement].\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Martinez, supra, </em>20 Cal.4th at p. 233 [83 Cal.Rptr.2d 533, 973 P.2d 512].) We conclude the evidence was sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">II. <em>People v. Hoard</em></p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">Aguilar cites <em>People </em>v. <em>Hoard </em>(2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 599 [126 Cal.Rptr.2d 855], which analyzes \u201cincidental movement\u201d much differently than we did in <em>Shadden </em>and our colleagues did in <em>Salazar. </em>He argues that under <em>Hoard: </em>1) he incidentally moved Nancy C. to a more secluded place, solely to facilitate rape, and 2) his violent conduct while moving her was \u201cinextricably connected\u201d to his intent to rape. Aguilar\u2019s reliance on <em>Hoard </em>is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\"><em>Hoard </em>involved charges of kidnapping for robbery. Defendant had moved and tied up two women employees inside a building, and then took jewelry from display cases. The women were neither physically attacked nor sexually molested. The Court of Appeal reversed the conviction concluding that the defendant\u2019s \u201cmovement of the two women served only to facilitate the crime with <em>no other apparent </em>purpose.\u201d <em>(People v. Hoard, supra, </em>103 Cal.App.4th at p. 607, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b848-8\"><em>Hoard </em>criticizes <em>Salazar </em>and <em>Shadden </em>for equating the meaning of \u201cincidental\u201d with \u201cnecessary.\u201d Citing our reference to Alice in Wonderland in <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 564, 570 [96 Cal.Rptr.2d 843], the <em>Hoard </em>majority portray us and our colleagues in <em>Salazar </em>as acting like \u201cHumpty Dumpty\u201d by arbitrarily ascribing our own definitions to words. <em>(People v. Hoard, supra, </em>103 Cal.App.4th at p. 606.) Our reasoning is not scrambled. The <em>Hoard </em>dissent supports our view that here Humpty Dumpty is not off the wall.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-9\">In <em>Salazar, </em>defendant dragged his victim 29 feet down a hallway to a bathroom to commit rape. The appellate court concluded that because the movement was not necessary to commit the crime, it \u201cwas not incidental to the crime.\u201d <em>(People v. Salazar, supra, </em>33 Cal.App.4th 341, 347.) From this <em>Hoard </em>concludes that <em>Salazar </em>defines \u201cnecessary movement\u201d to be the same as \u201cincidental movement,\u201d a definition at odds with Mr. Webster\u2019s definition of incidental as \u201csubordinate, or nonessential.\u201d <em>(People v. Hoard, supra, </em>103 Cal.App.4th at pp. 605-606, fn. 20.)</p>\n<p id=\"b849-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1051\">*1051</page-number>As the <em>Hoard </em>dissent points out, \u201cincidental\u201d often means \u201cnecessary\u201d in the context of the particular case. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Hoard, supra, </em>103 Cal.App.4th at pp. 609-612 (dis. opn. of Ramirez, P. J.).) If a robber moves the victim 20 feet in order to reach the office safe, that movement is necessary to commit the crime, but incidental to it. The <em>Hoard </em>dissent notes that the majority relied on an incomplete dictionary definition of \u201cincidental\u201d and \u201cnecessary.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 612-613 (dis. opn. of Ramirez, P. J.).) Thus, <em>Hoard </em>disregarded <em>Rayford\u2019s </em>reminder that it consider \u201cthe context of the environment in which the movement occurred,\u201d to determine whether that movement was incidental to the crime. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rayford, supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th at p. 12.)</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\"><em>Hoard </em>also went astray by ignoring <em>Rayford\u2019s </em>second prong and its rationale. \u201c[A] primary reason forcible asportation is proscribed by the kidnapping statutes is the increase in the risk of harm to the victim that arises from the asportation.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rayford, supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th at p. 22.)</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">The <em>Hoard </em>majority relies on cases that predate <em>Rayford </em>for the conclusion that \u201cremoval from the public view does not, in itself, substantially increase the risk of harm.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hoard, supra, </em>103 Cal.App.4th at p. 607.) This may be true in some cases, but the critical factor in <em>Rayford\u2019s </em>risk of harm analysis is that \u201cthe tree and the bushes at the end of the wall <em>limited detection </em>of the victim from the street.\u201d <em>(People v. Rayford, supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th at p. 23, italics added.) As Justice Ramirez notes, \u201cthe asportation element has evolved over the years\u201d and the view expressed in <em>Hoard </em>is not in harmony with <em>Rayford, Diaz </em>and <em>Salazar. (Hoard, </em>at p. 615 (dis. opn. of Ramirez, J.).) <em>Hoard </em>thus fails to realize there is a difference between robbery where a defendant moves a victim to target a safe, and rape where a defendant moves a victim to target her body.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-8\"><em>Hoard </em>is at odds with other cases involving the same issues. For example, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Smith, supra, </em>33 Cal.App.4th at page 1594, the Court of Appeal concluded the movement was \u201cnot merely incidental,\u201d noting \u201cit was <em>not necessary to move </em>[the victim] in order to perpetrate the rape.\u201d (Italics added.) Likewise, in <em>People v. Diaz, supra, </em>78 Cal.App.4th at page 248, the Court of Appeal concluded, \u201cThe defendant <em>could have sexually assaulted the victim in the sidewalk area </em>where he first accosted her . . . but moved the victim, as here, to avoid detection.\u201d (Italics added.) Other cases follow this approach and consider whether the movement was necessary. <em>(People v. Martinez, supra, </em>20 Cal.4th at p. 232, fn. 4, [\u201c \u2018over and above that <em>necessarily present </em>in the underlying crime\u2019 \u201d (italics added)]; <em>People v. Nguyen, supra, </em>22 Cal.4th at p. 886 [proper to consider substantial increase in psychological harm <em>\u201cbeyond that to be expected from a stationary robbery\u201d </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1052\">*1052</page-number>(italics added)]; see also <em>People v. Rayford, supra, </em>9 Cal.4th at pp. 12, 22.) <em>Shadden, Smith, Diaz, Jones, Salazar, Martinez, Nguyen </em>and <em>Rayford </em>are consistent.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">It is doubtful <em>Hoard </em>would have reached the same result had Hoard moved the women to rape them. <em>Hoard </em>acknowledges that \u201ca rape victim is certainly more at risk when concealed from public view and therefore more vulnerable to attack.\u201d <em>(People v. Hoard, supra, </em>103 Cal.App.4th at p. 607.) Aguilar creates a subjective \u201capparent purpose\u201d test to determine whether his moving the victim was incidental. He argues his \u201capparent purpose\u201d in moving the victim 133 feet was to commit the rape, and therefore the movement was \u201cincidental\u201d to the crime. Like the <em>Hoard </em>court, Aguilar confuses the two prongs of <em>Daniels </em>as applied in <em>Rayford. Rayford </em>did not speculate about the defendant\u2019s subjective \u201capparent purpose.\u201d Instead, it decided whether \u201cthe jury could reasonably have concluded that [the victim\u2019s] movement . . . was not merely incidental\u201d from the \u201ctotality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>(People v. Rayford, supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th at pp. 12, 23.) As Justice Ramirez points out, the <em>Hoard </em>majority\u2019s reasoning is wrong because \u201cthe defendant\u2019s intent to commit kidnapping as ... a necessary component of the target offenses is not determinate of whether the movement is incidental.\u201d <em>(People v. Hoard, supra, </em>103 Cal.App.4th at p. 611; <em>In re Earley </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 122, 130 [120 Cal.Rptr. 881, 534 P.2d 721].) He correctly notes that <em>Hoard </em>relied on an incomplete \u201cdictionary definition\u201d of \u201cincidental,\u201d misunderstood <em>Shadden </em>and <em>Salazar </em>and created an irrelevant semantic strawman with the words \u201cincidental\u201d and \u201cnecessary.\u201d <em>(Hoard, </em>at pp. 612-613.) <em>Hoard </em>erroneously claimed there is a \u201cseeming contradiction\u201d in <em>Shadden </em>regarding the incidental movement prong without mentioning that it reached this conclusion by quoting <em>Shadden\u2019s </em>language about the second prong risk of harm. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 606, 613, fn. 8.)</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">The recent case of <em>People v. Dominguez </em>(2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 651 [13 Cal.Rptr.3d 212] traces the historical journey of the word \u201cincidental\u201d through the cases and concludes its meaning is paradoxical. <em>Dominguez </em>therefore suggests that the Legislature revisit this area of the law because our Supreme Court failed \u201cto articulate a coherent\u201d standard. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Dominguez, supra, </em>118 Cal.App.4th 651.) We believe <em>Rayford </em>set a clear and coherent standard. The interpretation of \u201cincidental\u201d depends on the facts of the particular case. In any event, the instant case is factually distinguishable from <em>Dominguez </em>and quite similar to <em>Rayford. </em>And <em>Hoard </em>is inconsistent with <em>Rayford.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b851-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1053\">*1053</page-number>[[III.-VI.]]<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">Other than the sentencing errors we have discussed in the nonpublished part of this opinion, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">Yegan, J., and Perren, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">A petition for a rehearing was denied August 9, 2004, and appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied October 13, 2004.
