J.</author>\n<p id=\"AH0\">Defendant Jeffrey Michael Hayes was sentenced to state prison after a jury found him guilty of mayhem, battery, and assault. On appeal he contends that (1) the trial court should have instructed the jury that it was a partial defense to the mayhem charge if defendant acted under a genuine but unreasonable belief that he needed to defend himself; (2) he was denied the effective assistance of counsel in that, among other things, counsel failed to object to evidence of prior misconduct; and (3) a three-year enhancement for inflicting great bodily injury must be stricken because such injury is an element of mayhem. Aside from the third point, which the People concede, we discern no reversible error. Accordingly we will affirm the judgment after striking the three-year enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>Background</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">At the time of the events in question, defendant was living with Melissa Munoz (later Hayes) in her Mountain View apartment. On the night of June 20, 2002, after defendant had been drinking, they had an argument. Melissa called her parent\u2019s house in Sunnyvale and told her brother Anthony Munoz she was going to \u201ccome by.\u201d Shortly thereafter Anthony called her back and offered to come and pick her up. She accepted, and Anthony\u2019s friend Eva Garcia drove Anthony and his brother David Munoz to Melissa\u2019s apartment complex. When they arrived, Ms. Garcia called Melissa\u2019s apartment on her cellular phone. Defendant answered and, according to Ms. Garcia, demanded to know \u201c \u2018what the fuck\u2019 \u201d she wanted. When he refused to put Melissa on the phone, David took the phone from Ms. Garcia and spoke to defendant. According to David, defendant demanded \u201c \u2018Who the fuck is this?\u2019,\u201d refused to put Melissa on the phone, and said things like, \u201c \u2018I\u2019ll kick your ass.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">Before long, Melissa walked toward the car, with defendant following. To David and Anthony she appeared upset, and was either crying or had recently been crying. Ms. Garcia testified that when she saw Melissa \u201ccrying hysterically,\u201d she got out of the car to see what was wrong, and let Melissa into the car by the back door. She and the Munoz brothers all testified that Melissa got into the car under her own power.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">Defendant approached the car and, according to David, threw his jacket onto the ground. Anthony said defendant appeared \u201ckind of in a rage.\u201d Both brothers got out of the car to, in David\u2019s words, \u201cconfront him, see what his problem is, why was he chasing my sister.\u201d Both testified that defendant immediately \u201cswung at\u201d Anthony with a closed fist. In the ensuing fight, defendant bit the tip off of David\u2019s finger. Defendant himself sustained black eyes, a swollen face, and a gash on his back.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">Two months later defendant and Melissa were married. At trial Melissa was called by the prosecution and examined as a hostile witness. She testified that by the time Eva, Anthony, and David arrived to take her to her parents\u2019 house, she had decided not to go with them, but to stay with defendant. She knew defendant and Anthony did not get along, and defendant was \u201criled up\u201d by his conversation with David, so in hopes of defusing the situation she \u201cwent down there to ask them to leave.\u201d Defendant said he would come down with her, but she left before he did. When she reached the car she asked Eva, Anthony, and David to leave, but they ordered her into the car, cursing and threatening to \u201ckick [her] ass.\u201d Eva got out of the car, grabbed Melissa\u2019s sweater, and pushed her into the car while David pulled her in by the arm. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>Eva got back into the car and began to drive away, but stopped when Anthony said, \u201c \u2018There he is. Stop the car, stop the car.\u2019 \u201d The brothers then got out of the car, and Anthony and defendant immediately started fighting, with neither throwing a first punch. She testified that she saw her brothers punch, kick, and knee defendant while he was helpless, but did not see defendant bite David\u2019s finger.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">Defendant testified that after he spoke to Ms. Garcia on the telephone, David called, identified himself as Melissa\u2019s brother, \u201cask[ed] [defendant] to come downstairs,\u201d and asked him \u201cto send Melissa out.\u201d Melissa said she was going downstairs to tell them to leave, and told defendant to \u201cstay in the house.\u201d He told her he was going with her, because \u201cshe was upset, it was 10:30 at night and, once again, her brother asked me to come outside.\u201d She left while he was still putting on his clothes. He denied that he left the apartment intending to start a fight. However, he testified, when he arrived downstairs he \u201cseen someone whom [he had] never seen before tugging with Melissa.\u201d He started walking fast, or perhaps running, toward the car, then to chase it as it began to pull away. Then the car backed up, and Anthony and David jumped out and started coming towards him. Anthony grabbed him by the shirt and they fell to the ground. In his view, David and Anthony were the aggressors in the ensuing melee, and he was helpless. He had no recollection of biting off David\u2019s fingertip.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Defendant called Melissa from the jail after the fight, and the conversation was recorded. During it defendant told Melissa, \u201cTony was such a fucking punk, he\u2019s got to have someone else fucking jump in there with him. He\u2019s on the ground, getting his ass kicked and your other fucking\u2019 . . . punk ass brother [goes] to jump in. God forbid I get out.\u201d When she said, \u201cI told you to fucking leave them alone,\u201d he replied, \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me they were both out there. You didn\u2019t tell me they were both going to jump in.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">Defendant was charged with mayhem (Pen. Code, \u00a7 203),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> battery with serious bodily injury (\u00a7\u00a7 242, 243, subd. (d)), and assault by means of force likely to cause great bodily injury (\u00a7 245, subd. (a)(1)). In conjunction with the mayhem charge, a sentence enhancement was alleged for infliction of great bodily injury. (\u00a7 12022.7, subd. (a).) It was also alleged that defendant had sustained three strike priors (\u00a7\u00a7 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12), one five-year prior (\u00a7\u00a7 667, subd. (a), 1170.12), and one prison prior (\u00a7 667.5, subd. (a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>A jury found defendant guilty on all counts and found all enhancing allegations true. The court sentenced him to state prison for 25 years to life, plus 11 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">I. <em>Flannel Defense</em></p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">Defendant contends that reversal is required because of the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury that it would be a partial defense to mayhem if, in inflicting the maiming injury, defendant acted on an actual, though unreasonable, belief that his conduct was necessary to defend himself from imminent danger to life or limb. Defendant contends that the court should have instructed on this point on its own motion, or if not, that his attorney rendered ineffective assistance by failing to request such an instruction. We have concluded that the doctrine asserted by defendant, variously known as the <em>Flannel </em>defense <em>(People </em>v. <em>Flannel </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 668, 679, 683 [160 Cal.Rptr. 84, 603 P.2d 1] <em>(Flannel)) </em>and \u201cimperfect self-defense,\u201d has no application to a charge of mayhem.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">In <em>Flannel </em>the court held that it is a partial defense to a charge of <em>murder </em>that the defendant killed the victim while under the honest but mistaken belief that his conduct was necessary in self-defense. The basic rationale of the doctrine is that a genuine belief in the need to defend oneself, even if unreasonable, negates the \u201cmalice aforethought\u201d which is required for a conviction of murder. <em>(Flannel, supra, </em>25 Cal.3d at pp. 679-680.) While this doctrine is now well established with respect to murder charges (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Blakeley </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 82, 87-88 [96 Cal.Rptr.2d 451, 999 P.2d 675]; CALJIC No. 5.17), it has been extended to few other offenses, and in particular has not been extended to mayhem.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-10\">Defendant cites the lead opinion in <em>People v. McKelvy </em>(1987) 194 Cal.App.3d 694, 702-703 [239 Cal.Rptr. 782] <em>(McKelvy), </em>in which a single justice of the Court of Appeal concluded that the <em>Flannel </em>defense was applicable to charges of mayhem. That conclusion was dictum, because the court affirmed the defendant\u2019s conviction despite the absence of a <em>Flannel </em>instruction. The lead opinion concluded that the applicability of <em>Flannel </em>to mayhem was not a sufficiently established rule of law to require instruction on the court\u2019s own motion. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 706-707 (lead opn. of Kline, R J.).) The other two members of the panel concurred in the result on the sole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>ground that the procedural conditions triggering a duty to instruct were not present. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 707-708 (cone. opn. of Smith, J., joined by Rouse, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">Defendant urges us to adopt the analysis of the <em>McKelvy </em>lead opinion, but we do not find it persuasive. It acknowledged that mayhem does not require malice aforethought, and indeed is a general intent crime, but noted that the statute defining mayhem requires that the defendant have \u201cacted \u2018maliciously,\u2019 that is, with \u2018a wish to vex, annoy, or injure another person, or an intent to do a wrongful act.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(McKelvy, supra, </em>194 Cal.App.3d at p. 701, fn. omitted, quoting \u00a7\u00a7 203, 7, subd. 4.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It also acknowledged that \u201cthe \u2018malice\u2019 required for the offense of mayhem differs from the \u2018malice aforethought\u2019 with which <em>Flannel </em>was concerned,\u201d but concluded that \u201cin both cases ... the requisite state of mind is inconsistent with a genuine belief in the need for self defense.\u201d <em>(McKelvy, </em>at p. 702.) The pivotal proposition on which the case turns is that \u201c[o]ne who truly believes there is a need for self-defense cannot be said to act with intent to \u2018vex, injure or annoy\u2019 and may be found guilty of no more than an assault or battery.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>fn. omitted.) Thus, the court reasoned, \u201cWhere there is evidence to support such a lesser included offense, the effect of instructing the jury that an honest but unreasonable belief negates malice has a similar effect in the context of mayhem as in that of murder, reducing the severity of the offense without completely absolving the defendant of criminal responsibility.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 702-703, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">We do not agree that a belief in the necessity for self-defense can negate an \u201cintent to vex, injure or annoy.\u201d Such an intent lacks the crucial characteristic of \u201cmalice aforethought\u201d said in <em>Flannel </em>to justify the defense, i.e., awareness that one\u2019s conduct does not conform to the expectations of society. As the court explained, \u201c[A] person who carefully weighs a course of action, and chooses to kill after considering reasons for and against, is normally capable of comprehending his societal duty to act within the law. \u2018If, <em>despite such awareness, </em>he does an act that is likely to cause serious injury or death to another, he exhibits that wanton disregard for human life or antisocial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>motivation that constitutes malice aforethought.\u2019 (Italics added.) [Citation.] H] ... No matter how the mistaken assessment [of a need for self-defense] is made, an individual cannot genuinely perceive the need to repel imminent peril or bodily injury and simultaneously be aware that society expects conformity to a different standard. Where the awareness of society\u2019s disapproval begins, an honest belief ends. It is the honest belief of imminent peril that negates malice in a case of complete self-defense; the reasonableness of the belief simply goes to the justification for the killing.\u201d <em>(Flannel, supra, </em>25 Cal.3d at p. 679, fn. omitted, quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Conley </em>(1966) 64 Cal.2d 310, 322 [49 Cal.Rptr. 815, 411 P.2d 911]; italics in <em>Flannel)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">This passage turns on the statement that \u201can individual cannot genuinely perceive the need to repel imminent peril or bodily injury and simultaneously <em>be aware that society expects conformity to a different stan</em>dard.\u201d <em>(Flannel, supra, </em>25 Cal.3d at p. 679, italics added.) In other words, malice aforethought reflects or embodies a realization by the actor that his or her conduct <em>violates social expectations. </em>It is this realization that cannot be reconciled with an actor\u2019s belief that he or she is acting in self-defense, because society approves the reasonable use of force to that end.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">This rationale cannot be extended to the more general concept of \u201cmalice\u201d as defined in section 7 and incorporated in the statutory definition of mayhem. That definition connotes no element of knowing violation of social norms. It requires only intent to vex, injure, or annoy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A belief that one is acting in self-defense, whether reasonable or unreasonable, has no tendency to negate the element of malice. Indeed the intent to vex, injure, or annoy may be present when one acts in <em>reasonable </em>self-defense. Such a circumstance affords a defense not because it negates the element of malice but because it <em>excuses or justifies </em>the conduct in question despite the intent to injure.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">No case other than the lead opinion in <em>McKelvy </em>has held a <em>Flannel </em>instruction applicable to mayhem. The one other published case on the subject refused to follow that opinion. <em>(People v. Sekona </em>(1994) 27 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>Cal.App.4th 443 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 606] <em>(Sekona).) </em>That decision can be read narrowly as holding only that the views in the <em>McKelvy </em>lead opinion did not reflect a \u201cgeneral principle of law\u201d so as to trigger a sua sponte duty to instruct. <em>(Sekona, supra, </em>27 Cal.App.4th at pp. 451, 457.) However the court went on to express doubts about the correctness of that opinion. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 452-457.) As we have done, the court emphasized the \u201c \u2018central\u2019 \u201d role of the <em>Flannel </em>decision\u2019s conception of \u201c \u2018 \u201cmalice aforethought\u201d \u2019 \u201d as the \u201c \u2018 \u201cwanton disregard for human life or antisocial motivation,\u201d \u2019 \u201d as reflected in the killing of a person despite an opportunity to realize that doing so will violate the actor\u2019s \u201c \u2018societal duty to act within the law.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 452, quoting <em>Flannel, supra, </em>25 Cal.3d at pp. 679-680.) The court found the concept of malice under section 7, subdivision 4 distinguishable from that of malice aforethought. \u201cBecause the concepts are distinct and no specific intent is required to commit mayhem, the necessary intent being inferable from the types of injuries resulting from intentional acts, defendant\u2019s conduct in kicking [the victim] in the eye which resulted in [blindness in that eye] was sufficient to constitute the crime of mayhem. [Citations.] Unlike the situation in <em>Flannel </em>where the imperfect self-defense rule was grounded in part on \u2018both well-developed common law and in the statutory requirement of malice\u2019 aforethought [citation], mayhem involves a different requisite mental state and has no statutory history recognizing a malice aforethought element or the availability of the <em>Flannel </em>defense.\u201d <em>(Sekona, supra, </em>27 Cal.App.4th at p. 457; see <em>People v. Michaels </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 486, 530 [122 Cal.Rptr.2d 285, 49 P.3d 1032] [citing <em>Sekona </em>with approval]; <em>People v. Park </em>(2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 61, 64 [4 Cal.Rptr.3d 815].)</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">In sum, whereas \u201cmalice aforethought\u201d betokens a willingness to violate social standards of conduct, \u201cmalice\u201d under section 7, subdivision 4 requires only an intent to injure, vex, or annoy. One who believes his or her conduct is necessary for self-defense does not manifest a willingness to violate social norms, but may very well manifest a desire to injure. It follows that the <em>Flannel </em>defense has no application to a charge of mayhem. The trial court therefore had no obligation to instruct on such a defense, and counsel was not ineffective for failing to seek such an instruction. (See also <em>People v. Watie </em>(2002) 100 Cal.App.4th 866, 882 [124 Cal.Rptr.2d 258] [expressing skepticism about applicability of <em>Flannel </em>to charge of discharging firearm at dwelling]; <em>People v. Atkins </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 76 [104 Cal.Rptr.2d 738, 18 P.3d 660], [holding that voluntary intoxication is not a defense to arson, despite requirement that crime be committed maliciously].)</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">We find additional support for this conclusion in <em>People v. Atkins, supra, </em>25 Cal.4th 76, where the court rejected the contention that the requirement of malice in arson made voluntary intoxication a defense to such a charge. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>The court wrote that \u201cthe term \u2018malicious,\u2019 as used in section 7, subdivision 4, does not transform an offense into a specific intent crime. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 85-86.) Rather, the requirement of malice functions to ensure that the proscribed conduct was \u201ca deliberate and intentional act, as distinguished from an accidental or unintentional\u201d one. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 88.) A belief that one is defending oneself has no bearing on the issue of intention, and thus no tendency to negate the requirement of malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Other authorities confirm this view indirectly by suggesting that the essential distinction between mayhem and assault is not the actor\u2019s mental state but the <em>result </em>achieved: \u201cIf a person unlawfully strikes another, not with the specific intent to commit the crime of mayhem, and the blow so delivered results in the loss or disfigurement of a member of the body of the assaulted party or in putting out his eye, the crime is nevertheless mayhem. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People v. Nunes, supra, </em>47 Cal.App. at p. 349.) So long as general criminal intent is present, the requisite malice may be inferred from the fact of the injury. (See <em>Goodman </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 621, 624 [148 Cal.Rptr. 799] [mayhem \u201crequires no specific intent to maim or disfigure, the necessary intent being inferrable from the types of injuries resulting from certain intentional acts\u201d]; <em>People v. Reed </em>(1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 489, 492 [203 Cal.Rptr. 659] [\u201cexcept where mayhem is the underlying felony in a prosecution for felony murder, the prosecution need not prove a defendant specifically intended to maim his victim; it is sufficient that a defendant engages in unlawful conduct which foreseeably results in his victim\u2019s disfigurement\u201d]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bryan </em>(1961) 190 Cal.App.2d 781, 787 [12 Cal.Rptr. 361] [instruction on battery as lesser included offense of mayhem was properly refused; \u201cthe deliberate biting off of a piece of a person\u2019s nose, spitting it out and again biting the nose, if it were not an excusable act because done in self defense, could not be anything but mayhem\u201d].) The rule of <em>Flannel </em>is wholly inapplicable to such an offense, and the failure to instruct on that rule reflects neither error nor ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">II.-IV.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">The judgment is modified by striking the three-year enhancement under section 12022.7, subdivision (a).

But this definition seems to permit a finding of \u201cmalice\u201d where an absence of excuse is coupled with a slightly enhanced form of <em>recklessness. </em>If anything, such a definition would weaken the analogy to the \u201cmalice aforethought\u201d required for murder.
