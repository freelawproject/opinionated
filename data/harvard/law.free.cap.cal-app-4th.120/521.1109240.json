Their mother, Leeanna A. (Mother), along with Miguel and the children\u2019s maternal grandmother and maternal step-grandfather, Deborah and John V. (individually, Grandmother and Grandfather; together, Grandparents),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appeal the June 17, 2003 order removing all three children from Grandmother pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code section 387.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellants contend the removal was erroneous for numerous reasons. Mother additionally contends that, in Aaron\u2019s case, the court failed to comply with the notice requirements of the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1901 et seq.). Miguel has filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus seeking relief from the purportedly untimely filing of his notice of appeal. The Agency has filed two dismissal motions: the first requests that Miguel\u2019s appeal be dismissed as untimely and Grandparents\u2019 appeal be dismissed for lack of standing; the second requests that all the appeals be dismissed as to C.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">We deny Miguel\u2019s petition as moot and dismiss Grandparents\u2019 appeal for lack of standing. Because the section 387 and ICWA issues are meritorious, we reverse the section 387 order, remand for a new section 387 hearing at which the juvenile court shall properly exercise its discretion, and reverse in Aaron\u2019s case and remand for proper ICWA notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">THE INCEPTION OF THE DEPENDENCIES</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">In July 2001, the San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency (the Agency) filed dependency petitions for five-year-old Miguel and 10-month-old Aaron. The petitions alleged Mother used marijuana to excess and had been seen blowing smoke in Aaron\u2019s face, and Miguel tested presumptively positive for marijuana. Miguel and Aaron were detained in Polinsky Children\u2019s Center and then, on July 16, with Grandmother, who had cared for them previously.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-10\">In September, the petitions were amended by adding allegations that Mother left Miguel unattended outside their home on numerous occasions between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 12:00 a.m. The juvenile court dismissed the allegations in the original petitions and made true findings on the new allegations. It placed both boys with Grandmother on the Agency\u2019s recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>When C.A. was bom in June 2002, the Agency filed a petition alleging (1) Mother had a mental illness, including adjustment disorder with anxiety and depressed mood with parent-child relational problems, rendering her unable of providing regular care; and (2) she had failed to progress in services following the true finding in Miguel\u2019s case. On June 15, C.A. was detained in Grandmother\u2019s approved home. In July, the court dismissed the first allegation of C.A.\u2019s petition and made a trae finding on the second. In August, the court placed her with Grandmother on the Agency\u2019s recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">THE PLACEMENT WITH GRANDMOTHER</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">In June 2001, just before the original dependency petitions were filed, Psychologist Steven Sparta evaluated Miguel, apparently in conjunction with a family court case. Dr. Sparta noted in Miguel \u201can underlying sense of instability and insecurity with anticipatory anxiety about future disruptions in his ability to maintain an attachment with caretakers.\u201d Dr. Sparta conferred with Miguel\u2019s attorney \u201cabout the importance for Miguel to have a stable and sustained family history.\u201d Dr. Sparta believed it was very important that Miguel experience stability and emotional support \u201cand a continuing opportunity to not change schools, to form other social and familial attachments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">From the beginning of the case, the Agency\u2019s reports regarding the children\u2019s placement with Grandmother were positive. Throughout 2002, the Agency described the home as \u201cappropriate\u201d and noted that Grandmother \u201cprovide[d] adequate care.\u201d In May, however, an Agency report referred to Mother\u2019s \u201cfamily background\u201d as a factor \u201celevat[ing] her potential for child abuse,\u201d and a July report noted: \u201c[Mother] reported issues of domestic violence, physical abuse and sexual abuse during her childhood. She stated that she was responsible for the care of her siblings when she was younger and had reported her mother to CPS where they were once dependents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">According to the boys\u2019 March 2002 six-month review report, Aaron was \u201cprogressing very well.\u201d While Miguel\u2019s school performance had improved, he continued to have difficulty and was working below grade level. Grandmother \u201ccontinue[d] to assist [him] with his school assignments and [was] making efforts with getting [his] work up to par.\u201d Miguel\u2019s therapist had diagnosed post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but said \u201cMiguel [was] stabilizing in his placement and displayed] little acting out.\u201d Miguel had mild flashbacks, abandonment issues, and occasional nightmares.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-10\">According to the boys\u2019 September 2002 12-month review report, they had made very good progress developmental!^ Miguel\u2019s therapist said that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>was doing very well and was less anxious, although he did \u201cexperience some difficulty with transitions.\u201d The therapist believed that Miguel\u2019s current school was good for him and that the school staff were \u201cable to support him.\u201d Miguel had raised his grades, had been promoted to the next grade level, and had received an outstanding citizenship award. He had \u201cimproved immensely academically\u201d and was \u201cexcited about attending school.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">In Miguel\u2019s and Aaron\u2019s January 2003 18-month review report, the Agency stated: \u201cFor the past year, Miguel and . . . Aaron have been able to experience stability, love, care and affection from [Grandparents] who filed a petition in 2001 with Family Court to have Miguel in their care. It was the recommendation of the Family Court that Miguel live with [Grandparents]. This order was countered when the Juvenile Courts became involved with the family and Miguel and Aaron were taken into custody by the Agency.\u201d The report noted that the boys had adjusted to Grandmother\u2019s home and described her care of them as \u201cexcellent.\u201d Miguel\u2019s therapist observed that his PTSD symptoms had subsided and he was doing well. Miguel continued to attend the same school, was socializing better with his peers, had received good behavior awards, and had \u201cshown exceptional improvement with his grades.\u201d The Agency remarked that he had \u201cshown remarkable change while in the care of [Grandparents].\u201d Aaron, whose weight gain had been reported as poor before he was taken into custody, had reached all of his developmental milestones, although there was \u201csome concern regarding his active behavior.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">In a letter filed February 24, 2003, Miguel\u2019s therapist recommended that Miguel continue living with Grandmother, whose home was \u201ca secure and supportive environment that has helped [Miguel] be successful in school and in the community.\u201d The therapist said that Miguel\u2019s therapy could conclude over the next few weeks, as he had been \u201clargely symptom-free for the last 90 days.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">During a social worker\u2019s May 4, 2003 visit to Grandmother\u2019s home, Miguel followed Grandmother around the house and engaged in any activity she suggested. When Miguel gave Grandmother a craft he had made in Sunday school, she \u201cdoted over the craft and hung it on the wall.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">In C.A.\u2019s February 13, 2003 six-month review report, the Agency stated she \u201cseem[ed] to be doing very well in [Grandmother\u2019s] home.\u201d It concluded that C.A. was \u201cin need of a stable and secure environment so that she can continue to be provided with the excellent care that she has been receiving.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>At C.A.\u2019s February 13, 2003, six-month review hearing, the court followed the Agency\u2019s recommendations that she continue to be placed in Grandmother\u2019s approved home and a 12-month review hearing be set. The court set the hearing for August 14. At Miguel\u2019s and Aaron\u2019s February 24 18-month review hearing, the court followed the Agency\u2019s recommendations that the boys continue to be placed in Grandmother\u2019s approved home and that a section 366.26 hearing be set. The court set the hearing for June 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">m.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">THE REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"AG4\">A. The Detention and Petitions</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">On May 30, 2003, the Agency moved the children from Grandmother\u2019s home to emergency shelter foster homes, with Miguel and Aaron in one home and C.A. in another. On June 2, the Agency filed section 387 supplemental petitions for the children, alleging \u201c[t]he previous disposition has not been effective in the protection or rehabilitation of the child\u201d; Grandmother was \u201cno longer able to provide adequate care and supervision ... in that: a prior history of CPS [(Child Protective Services)] neglect and abuse was discovered together with statements by [Grandmother] that [Grandfather] suffers from a mental illness.\u201d The Agency recommended foster home placement. At the June 2 detention hearing, the court ordered the children detained in Polinsky Children\u2019s Center, an approved foster home, or an adjunct.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">B. The Detention Report<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">Concerning the allegation of a CPS history, the Agency\u2019s detention report on the section 387 petition stated: \u201c[In t]he previous CPS history from 1989-1990, [Grandmother] was granted joint custody of her . . . biological children through a family court order. The reading of this past CPS hist[or]y is complicated by many factors. The reunification services period included substance abuse issues in [Grandmother] and her ex-husband, Mr. A[.] Allegations of sexual abuse existed during the course of reunification. [Grandmother]\u2019s ex-husband from whom she was separated allegedly perpetrated the sexual abuse. The case history reveals that [Mother] was not returned to [Grandmother]\u2019s physical custody by court order.\u201d The social worker who had approved Grandmother\u2019s home \u201c[had] not [found] a child abuse history in the current system.\u201d When Miguel\u2019s and Aaron\u2019s cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>moved to the permanency planning stage, Grandparents requested an adoption home study and a new background check was completed. It was then \u201cdiscovered in die old system that there was a child abuse history in the home of [Grandmother]\u201d; she \u201chad an open case to CPS that alleged physical abuse of her daughters [, with p]rior abuse allegations including] domestic violence and physical abuse of her children\u201d; and the daughters had been removed from Grandmother \u201cand eventually placed in their father\u2019s care.\u201d The Agency concluded there was a risk in the current placement with Grandmother in that she had \u201ca significant child abuse history including the removal of her biological children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">As to the allegation of Grandfather\u2019s mental illness, the detention report stated as follows. Grandfather was the primary caregiver and supervised the children while Grandmother worked full time. Grandmother said that Grandfather had schizophrenia. He was unemployed, on disability due to his mental illness, and took medication for that illness. An Agency supervisor had told Grandmother that Grandfather was not to be left alone with the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">The detention report also mentioned another concern about the placement. Since the original home approval, Grandmother\u2019s two biological daughters, who had been living with their father, had moved in, so that the two-bedroom home had nine occupants (including Grandmother\u2019s two other biological children,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> who had been in the home when it was approved). There was clutter and the home\u2019s cleanliness was marginal.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">In a discussion of the above factors with the social worker, Grandmother said she believed the CPS history was based on false allegations by Mother and asked if a letter from Mother\u2019s therapist could clear this up, explaining that Mother had accused her of physical abuse and later recanted in therapy. The social worker cast Grandmother\u2019s statements as a \u201cminimiz[ation of] her previous CPS history\u201d which \u201ccreate[d] concerns about [Grandmother]\u2019s denial and minimization of the significant previous reunification issues of physical abuse, domestic violence, substance abuse, sexual abuse.\u201d Grandmother also said that Grandfather never forgot to take his medication, loved the children, and was good with them; she was aware of their marginal living standards, recognized that the home was too small and cramped, and planned to \u201cmak[e] improvements such as new paint inside and new flooring to deal with the dirty conditions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">The detention report stated that Miguel was \u201cstrongly attached\u201d to Grandmother and apparently regarded her as his primary parent. She was \u201chighly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>involved in his school progress and therapeutic treatment.\u201d The Agency believed \u201cthat it will be emotionally detrimental to Miguel to be separated from [Grandmother].\u201d He said he wanted to remain with her. His school reported that he had recently threatened to kill other children, showed a lack of self-esteem, and needed behavioral intervention.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">The detention report concluded: \u201cWith the current information that there is mental illness, CPS history, and marginal living conditions in this home, the previous licensing home approval is not valid. A reapproval process was initiated upon the realization of this new information. Due to the seriousness of the child abuse history and the fact that [Grandfather] is a primary caregiver with mental illness, the Agency supervisors are unable to approve the home.\u201d \u201cBoth Aaron and [C.A.] have no ability to protect themselves should an emergency situation arise while under the care of this schizophrenic care provider. Although [Grandmother] reports that [Grandfather] is stable and medicated, he is unable to fulfill the requirements of employment. He has been observed to be socially withdrawn and have poor affect.\u201d The Agency requested the children\u2019s removal \u201cwhile more information is pursued through psychological/psychiatric evaluations of both caregivers.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">C. The June 10 and 17, 2003 Section 387 Hearings</p>\n<p id=\"Avz\">1. <em>The Social Worker\u2019s Testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">On June 10, 2003, social worker Lakesha Sledge testified as follows. When she was assigned to the case in September 2001, she was aware of Grandmother\u2019s CPS history, which Grandmother had disclosed to her. The social worker preceding Sledge, who had detained the children with Grandmother, was also aware of this history. The CPS history was documented in contact logs (also called the case narrative) although the logs did not specify the type of history. Thus, Sledge did not know the extent of the history or whether it involved physical or sexual abuse. In a contact log, a previous social worker had noted that the CPS history had been orally \u201cwaivered\u201d and the home approved by former chief Pam Fawcett in July 2001. Approval meant that the placement was deemed suitable and the caregivers were able to provide the children with the necessary care. There was no concern about Grandmother\u2019s CPS history or the children\u2019s safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">Between the time Sledge was assigned to the case and the time the children were removed from Grandmother\u2019s home, Sledge visited the home a total of 16 to 19 times, once a month for about 30 to 45 minutes. During the visits, the children always seemed appropriately dressed, appropriately cared for, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>and appropriately developing. Sledge saw no bruises or marks, other than a bruise or mark on Aaron\u2019s leg or arm, but he was very active, and there was nothing that led her to suspect any abuse. The home had been cluttered throughout the period of Sledge\u2019s supervision. There were about seven people living in the home when she received the case, all relatives, and in the month before the June 2003 hearing, there had been as many as nine residents. Although the two bedroom, one bathroom house was very small, the children\u2019s sleeping arrangements were appropriate and Sledge had no doubt that the home met the minimum standards. The children had always done well in Grandmother\u2019s care.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">When Sledge received the case, she knew that Grandmother was married. Grandfather had been present for 12 of Sledge\u2019s visits to the home, she had seen him in court, and she had talked to him. She had no concerns about his behavior and had never heard him say anything that would raise a concern about the children\u2019s safety. Until June 2002,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> when she learned that Grandfather was a paranoid schizophrenic, she had observed no indication that he suffered from a mental illness. When Sledge asked Grandmother if Grandfather was taking medication, Grandmother said yes. Sledge told her supervisor that Grandfather was schizophrenic. Sledge and her supervisor decided to leave the children in the home after Sledge talked to Grandmother and apparently decided that the children were not to be left in Grandfather\u2019s care. Sledge did nothing to check on Grandfather\u2019s condition in the ensuing year.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">In May 2003, Grandmother\u2019s home was assessed by the Agency\u2019s adoptions unit. At that time, Sledge\u2019s supervisor, Diana Conklin, inquired into Grandfather\u2019s condition. The Agency learned, apparently from Grandmother, that she was leaving the children alone with him. Sledge did not believe it was appropriate for him to be the children\u2019s primary caretaker. She had asked him to sign a release so that the Agency could obtain more information about his mental health status, but he declined. In mid-May, Sledge and Agency supervisors went to Grandmother\u2019s home and instructed Grandmother \u201cto not leave the children in the care of [Grandfather] considering his mental health status.\u201d After this conversation, the children were found in Grandfather\u2019s care \u201cas the only adult provider in the home.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As of May 29, however, Grandmother was providing the children\u2019s primary care.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">In late April or May 2003, Sledge learned the details of Grandmother\u2019s CPS history from adoption unit social worker Jamie Rivas and her supervisor Sue Chamberlin. Sledge then consulted with her supervisor; their section chief, Lisa Johnson; Chamberlin; and Rivas, and performed an updated risk <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>assessment. The Agency\u2019s position was that there were too many risk factors to leave the children in Grandmother\u2019s home and the factors could not be waived. It was determined that the children would be removed. Sledge agreed \u201cto an extent\u201d with that determination. Since she had been assigned to the case, she had always felt that the children were safe in the home. She believed that it was in their best interests to remain there; it would be detrimental to remove them; and there were some risk factors that needed to be remedied, but with a remedy, the children could be safe in the home. Sledge had asked Johnson to sign a waiver, but Johnson had refused. Sledge concluded that it was a risk for the children to be in the home, considering Grandmother\u2019s CPS history (including physical abuse, other abuse allegations, supervised visitation with her own children until the family court awarded her joint custody of the children but not physical custody of her older child);<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Grandfather\u2019s schizophrenia; and the \u201cminimum standards\u201d of the home (the number of occupants, the clutter, and the lack of \u201ca whole lot of room for [Aaron and C.A.] to move as far as . . . their development\u201d). <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">2. <em>Further Evidence, Argument, Orders, and Findings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">During the children\u2019s attorney\u2019s cross-examination of Sledge, the Agency\u2019s counsel objected to the question whether Sledge believed that the children could be safe in Grandmother\u2019s home. The Agency\u2019s counsel argued that \u201conce a waiver isn\u2019t given by a chief, the court is aware it doesn\u2019t matter what the social worker thinks.\u201d The court responded, \u201cIs it your position that I can\u2019t override the waiver? Because if so, then there\u2019s no need for this trial.\u201d The Agency\u2019s counsel then said, \u201cThe case out of L.A. County[<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>]\u2014it does say you are not supposed to put kids in unlicensed homes.\u201d The court replied, \u201cI think what I am asking you if it is your position that the chief says something, [the court] can\u2019t do anything. I need to know that. If Ms. Johnson is in charge of the case, and that the court has no jurisdiction, that is fine, if that\u2019s your legal position.\u201d The Agency\u2019s counsel asserted, \u201c[I]f the home is totally unlicenseable, can a court put the children in there? And our position is no, they cannot.\u201d The court overruled the objection, stating, \u201cThe question that the court has to look at is whether or not the previous disposition was ineffective. And unless it is, per se, answered, because a chief will not grant a waiver, then we have to go on with the trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>Near the end of the June 10, 2003 proceedings, the Agency\u2019s counsel again cited <em>LA. County I. </em>The court and the children\u2019s attorney said they would have to review that case. The court ordered that all appropriate relatives be evaluated and gave the social worker discretion to detain the children with an appropriate relative with 48 hours\u2019 notice to all counsel. It continued the matter to June 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">On June 17, 2003, the petitions were amended to allege that \u201cthe previous disposition has not been effective in the protection or rehabilitation of the child\u201d; and Grandparents were no longer able to provide adequate care and supervision because \u201cthe home [was] no longer approved by [the Agency] for placement of the child.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The allegations concerning Grandmother\u2019s statement that Grandfather suffered from a mental illness and of discovery of a CPS neglect and abuse history were stricken. The court accepted a stipulation that Agency Chief Heidi Staples would testify that the home was not approved and she would not give a waiver. Mother submitted on the petition on the basis of the social worker\u2019s reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">The court entered true findings on the petitions.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> It stated, \u201cThis case is a stinker,\u201d then placed the children in a licensed foster home and detained them, pending placement, in Polinsky Children\u2019s Center, a licensed foster home, or adjunct, and ordered reasonable unsupervised visitation for Grandmother on the condition she not leave the children alone in Grandfather\u2019s care.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">The court said, \u201cThe evidence as it stood when we ended the trial was the social worker testifying, essentially, it would be detrimental to remove these children. [][] I don\u2019t care what anybody says. The court views this case as we supported this. [Grandfather] was schizophrenic for two years and nobody seemed to be that concerned about it. But I know what it is. [f] It is going to interfere with an adoption, and I guess we have to consider that because the most permanent plan is appropriate. But, you know, I mentioned this earlier, I think sometimes we really get hung up on protocols. [][] And you know it\u2019s sad for these kids. I mean, nine people in the home. There has been nine people in the home, C.P.S. history. There was a C.P.S. history. It didn\u2019t seem to bother anybody until it got on the verge of an adoption. And it is very sad for these kids. I think they are going to suffer because of that.\u201d The court also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>noted \u201cthe children [are] going to be in a lot of pain\u201d and it commented, \u201cI still don\u2019t quite understand what went on here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">POSTREMOVAL EVENTS</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">After the removal, Grandmother continued to have visits and telephone contact with Miguel and visits with Aaron and C.A.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The removal was very hard on all three children. Miguel\u2019s therapist said that Miguel had been \u201csomewhat traumatized\u201d by the removal and had displayed \u201ca moderate symptom upswing consisting primarily of nightmares, but also including some mild aggressive acting out at school.\u201d The therapist \u201cagreed that Miguel identified strongly with his relationship with [Grandmother.]\u201d Miguel himself told the social worker that he loved Grandmother, felt safe in her home, and wanted to live with her. While Aaron eventually appeared to stabilize in his foster placement, he showed \u201csome aggressive and tantruming behaviors,\u201d delays in fine motor skills, and speech and language delays. He cried when separated from Grandmother, from Mother, and from his foster mother. His \u201cverbal attempts\u201d were understandable only by his family. Miguel said \u201che would be sad not to live with\u201d Aaron. In spite of the significant sibling relationships among the three children, the Agency concluded that there was no reasonable alternative to different permanent plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">In its assessment filed for Miguel\u2019s and Aaron\u2019s section 366.26 hearing, the Agency recommended permanent plans of another planned permanent living arrangement for Miguel, so the Agency could \u201cfocus on uniting\u201d him with his father, who lived in Florida, had not responded to the social worker\u2019s offer of information about the permanency planning assessment, and had not followed through with previous agreements to visit and contact Miguel. On June 3, 2003, Miguel told the social worker that he had had telephone contact with his father and with a paternal aunt.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> He was happy about that contact and, according to his school social worker, very happy with his new foster mother, apparently wondering out loud if she \u201ccould be his new mother.\u201d On June 27, Miguel\u2019s father came to San Diego for a week of visitation. When the social worker asked him where he would like to live, understanding that he was not allowed to live with Mother or Grandmother, he also said he wanted to live with a maternal aunt and with his father.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">For Aaron, the Agency\u2019s assessment recommended a permanent plan of adoption. The assessment estimated that 72 homes would be available for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>him, 30 of which would also accept C.A. if her case were in the permanency planning phase. Following the removal, C.A. was placed in two successive foster homes, but not with Aaron. The Agency matched Aaron and C.A. with a concurrent planning foster home and Aaron began visits with the family, but this placement did not work out and the two children were not moved from their foster homes.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">On July 22, 2003, Miguel\u2019s attorney filed a section 388 modification petition, asking \u201cthat the petition[<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>] be dismissed pursuant to . . . section 390\u201d or that Miguel be placed with Grandparents, who were entitled to custody pursuant to a family court order.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> On July 22, the court denied the section 388 petition without prejudice, ordered a permanent plan of \u201canother planned permanent living arrangement\u201d for Miguel, and placed him with his paternal aunt and uncle.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">A. Miguel\u2019s Notice of Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">On September 25, 2003, the Agency filed a motion requesting that Miguel\u2019s appeal be dismissed because his notice of appeal was filed late, on August 27. Miguel filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus, seeking relief from the purportedly untimely filing. Both the Agency and Miguel also discuss the issue in their briefs. Mother and Grandparents join in Miguel\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-10\">In the writ proceedings, both Miguel\u2019s counsel and the Agency assume, without explanation, that the notice of appeal was due on August 26, 2003. The Agency\u2019s motion to dismiss explains why it believes the appeal is late, and Miguel\u2019s opposition concedes the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-11\">In its motion, the Agency argues that pursuant to California Rules of Court,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> rule 39(b), the notice of appeal had to be filed 60 days after the order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>became final under rule 1417(c); the referee\u2019s order did not have to be served on Miguel and he was represented by counsel who was present when the order was pronounced; therefore, the order became final 10 days after it was pronounced; thus, the notice of appeal was due 70 days after June 17, 2003. The statutes the Agency cites are not on point and the cases it cites did not involve re<em>f</em>erees.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Generally, in a juvenile dependency case heard by a judge, a notice of appeal must be filed no later than 60 days after the judgment is rendered or the order is made. (Rules 39(b), 39.1(f).) With exceptions not applicable here, when the matter is heard by a referee, the notice of appeal must be filed \u201cwithin 60 days after the order . . . becomes final under rule 1417(c).\u201d (Rules 39(b), 39.1(f); see also \u00a7 395.) Rule 1417(c), also with exceptions not applicable here, states that a referee\u2019s order \u201cshall become final 10 calendar days after service of a copy of the order and findings under rule 1416.\u201d Rule 1416(b)(3) requires that \u201ca copy of the findings and order, with a written explanation of the right to seek review of the order by a juvenile court judge,\u201d be served by mail on the child\u2019s counsel, with service deemed complete at the time of mailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">Here, the June 17, 2003 minute order was served by mail on Miguel\u2019s counsel on June 20. The referee\u2019s order therefore became final on June 30, \u201c10 calendar days after service of a copy of the order and findings under rule 1416.\u201d (Rule 1417(c).) Thus, the notice of appeal was due 60 days after June 30, that is, on August 29. Because the notice of appeal was filed in a timely manner on August 27, we deny the petition as moot and deny the motion to dismiss Miguel\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">B. Grandparents\u2019 Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">The Agency\u2019s September 25, 2003 motion also requests that Grandparents\u2019 appeal of the section 387 order be dismissed for lack of standing. Grandparents oppose the motion. The parties also address the issue in their briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">In section 300 proceedings, the Agency, the child, and the parent or guardian have the right to appeal. (Rule 1435(a).) Additionally, \u201c[u]pon a sufficient showing the [juvenile] court may recognize the child\u2019s present or previous custodians as de facto parents and grant standing to participate as parties in disposition hearings and any hearing thereafter at which the status of the dependent child is at issue. The de facto parent may: [][] (1) Be present at the hearing; [f] (2) Be represented by retained counsel or, at the discretion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>of the court, by appointed counsel; [][] (3) Present evidence.\u201d (Rule 1412(e).) The rights of relatives other than parents are delimited as follows: \u201cUpon a sufficient showing the [juvenile] court may permit the relatives of the child to: [][] (1) Be present at the hearing; [f] (2) Address the court.\u201d (Rule 1412(f).)</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Grandparents were present in court for the June 2, 2003 detention hearing on the section 387 petition and Grandmother was present for the June 17 hearing. They did not ask to address the court. At the time of the June 17 hearing, Grandparents had not applied for or achieved de facto parent status.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Thus, they were merely relatives, not parties. \u201c[0]nly parties of record may appeal. [Citation.] A party of record is a person named as a party to the proceedings or one who takes appropriate steps to become a party of record in the proceedings.\u201d <em>(In re Joseph G. </em>(2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 712, 715 [99 Cal.Rptr.2d 915] [alleged biological father had not become a party and lacked standing].) If Grandparents had sought de facto parent status in a timely manner, and had been granted that status, they would have standing to appeal. <em>(Christina K. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1986) 184 Cal.App.3d 1463, 1469 [229 Cal.Rptr. 564] [juvenile court erred by summarily denying foster parent\u2019s request to participate in the proceedings].) They did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Grandparents assert that they have standing as relatives (citing <em>Charles S. v. Superior Court </em>(1985) 168 Cal.App.3d 151, 157 [214 Cal.Rptr. 47]) and as de facto parents who had not yet been officially granted that status (citing <em>Katzoff </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1976) 54 Cal.App.3d 1079 1083-1085 [127 Cal.Rptr. 178]; <em>In re B.G. </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 679 [114 Cal.Rptr. 444, 523 P.2d 244]; and <em>In re Joel H. </em>(1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 1185, 1193-1195 [23 Cal.Rptr.2d 878]). Not so. Unlike the situations in <em>Charles S. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>168 Cal.App.3d at pp. 156-157; <em>Katzoff v. Superior Court, supra, </em>54 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1082-1083; and <em>In re B.G., supra, </em>11 Cal.3d at pp. 683, 686, 692, Grandparents did not seek to participate in the proceedings below. Unlike the situation in <em>In re Joel H., supra, </em>19 Cal.App.4th at page 1193, the de facto issue was disputed and Grandparents were not described as de facto parents in the juvenile court. \u201cCalifornia\u2019s doctrine of de facto parent status is a judicially created doctrine, but one which is now spelled out in the California Rules of Court.\u201d <em>(In re Brandon M. </em>(1997) 54 Cal.App.4th 1387, 1393 [63 Cal.Rptr.2d 671].) De facto parent status is a factual matter for the juvenile court to decide; the applicant bears the burden of proof. <em>(In re Michael R. </em>(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 150, 155 [78 Cal.Rptr.2d 842]; see also <em>Katzoff v. Superior Court, supra, </em>54 Cal.App.3d at p. 1085; rule 1412(e).) Grandparents do not have standing to appeal as de facto parents or as relatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>Grandparents argue that they were not served with the petitions, properly noticed of the hearing, or informed of their rights, including the rights to counsel, to seek de facto parent status, to request that the court subpoena witnesses and order production of documents, and to address the court, depriving them of their statutory and due process rights. Grandparents cite <em>In re Jonique W. </em>(1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 685 [31 Cal.Rptr.2d 601]. In that case, however, the grandmother had sought and received de facto parent status. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 689, 693.) Thus, <em>In re Jonique W. </em>is distinguishable. Furthermore, although Grandparents appeared at the detention hearing on the section 387 petition and Grandmother was present on June 17, they did not make any of these arguments below. While they should have been served with the petition and notice of hearing (rules 1407(d) &amp; (e)(4)(C), 1431(b)), they waived any right to challenge the lack of notice by failing to do so in the juvenile court. <em>(In re B.G., supra, </em>11 Cal.3d at p. 689.) We grant the Agency\u2019s motion to dismiss Grandparents\u2019 appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">C. The Section 387 Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">Mother and Miguel contend the court erred by removing the three children from Grandparents\u2019 home. Mother asserts the true findings on the section 387 petitions and the removal order are unsupported by substantial evidence; Grandmother\u2019s CPS history and Grandfather\u2019s illness created, at most, a presumption of risk, which was rebutted; the Agency tacitly approved the conditions in Grandparents\u2019 home it later classified as risks; its change of position does not amount to substantial evidence that the placement was ineffective in protecting the children; and the court erred by failing to bifurcate the proceedings. Miguel asserts the Agency\u2019s refusal to approve the home did not compel removal; the juvenile court abdicated its duty to make an independent judgment of the appropriateness of the placement; even if the court had considered Grandparents\u2019 histories and the condition of their home as a basis for its findings and orders, those factors did not constitute substantial evidence; and the removal violated the children\u2019s fundamental rights to remain placed with their biological family.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">The gist of the Agency\u2019s position on the merits is that the juvenile court is barred from reviewing the Agency\u2019s executive decision not to approve a relative placement and not to grant an exemption from placement criteria. The Agency misses the point. Its executive role in determining whether or not to approve a relative placement and whether or not to grant an exemption is not at issue here. There was no criminal conviction to be exempted. The Agency had already approved the placement; although in doing so it apparently did not examine its own records, it was plainly on notice of the alleged deficiencies it later asserted. What is at issue is whether the Agency may usurp the juvenile court\u2019s judicial power under section 387 to determine the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>propriety of a child\u2019s removal from a relative placement, and whether the Agency has an unfettered right to change that placement no matter how the change affects the children. The answer to these questions is no. (Cf. <em>Cesar V. v. Superior Court </em>(2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 1023, 1033 [111 Cal.Rptr.2d 243] [the juvenile court must exercise its independent judgment regarding a section 361.3 relative placement request, not merely review the social service agency\u2019s decision for an abuse of discretion].) For the reasons we discuss below, we determine the Agency does not have the absolute authority to change a relative placement already ordered by the court and that the Agency\u2019s withdrawal of its approval of Grandparents\u2019 home did not relieve the juvenile court of its duty to review the appropriateness of that placement. We further determine that the record lacks substantial evidence supporting the removal order.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">A supplemental petition \u201cshall contain a concise statement of facts sufficient to support the conclusion that the previous disposition has not been effective in the rehabilitation or protection of the child or, in the case of a placement with a relative, sufficient to show that the placement is not appropriate in view of the criteria in Section 361.3.\u201d (\u00a7 387, subd. (a).) The last clause relating to relative placement was added to section 387 in 1997. (Added by Stats. 1997, ch. 793, \u00a7 28.)</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Section 361.3, subdivision (a), lists criteria for relative placement to be considered by the social worker and the court, including, but not limited to, the child\u2019s best interest (\u00a7 361.3, subd. (a)(1)); the wishes of the parent, relative, and child (\u00a7 361.3, subd. (a)(2)); the provisions of Division 12, Part 6 of the Family Code (including Fam. Code, \u00a7 7950 [preference for placement with relative and prohibited discrimination]) (\u00a7 361.3, subd. (a)(3)); placement of siblings in the same home, if in the children\u2019s best interests (\u00a7 361.3, subd. (a)(4)); \u201c[t]he good moral character of the relative and any other adult living in the home, including whether any individual residing in the home has a prior history of violent criminal acts or has been responsible for acts of child abuse or neglect\u201d (\u00a7 361.3, subd. (a)(5)); the nature and duration of the child-relative relationship and the relative\u2019s desire to care for the child and provide permanency (\u00a7 361.3, subd. (a)(6)); the relative\u2019s ability to provide a safe, secure, and stable environment, a home, necessities of life, and legal permanence; exercise proper and effective care and control; protect the child from the parents; facilitate reunification, relative visitation, and implementation of the case plan; and arrange for appropriate and safe child care (\u00a7 361.3, subd. (a)(7)); and the safety of the home (\u00a7 361.3, subd. (a)(8)).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">Section 361.3, subdivision (a)(8) also states, \u201cFor a relative to be considered appropriate to receive placement of a child under this section, the relative\u2019s home shall first be approved pursuant to the process and standards <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>described in subdivision (d) of Section 309.\u201d Section 309, subdivision (d) concerns the Agency\u2019s assessment and approval of a relative\u2019s home for \u201ctemporary placement of the child pending the detention hearing.\u201d (\u00a7 309, subd. (d)(1).) The assessment involves an in-home inspection regarding safety and the relative\u2019s ability to care for the child, and, for adult household members, checks for criminal records and prior allegations of child abuse or neglect. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The approval is to be based on the \u201cstandards set forth in regulations for the licensing of foster family homes which prescribe standards of safety and sanitation for the physical plant and standards for basic personal care, supervision, and services provided by the caregiver.\u201d (\u00a7 309, subd. (d)(2).) If the home meets all conditions except receipt of Federal Bureau of Investigation criminal history information, the Agency may nevertheless approve the home if it obtains signed statements from the adult household members that they have no convictions other than traffic infractions. The Agency may terminate its approval if it later determines an adult household member has a criminal record. (\u00a7 309, subd. (d)(3).)</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">The hearing on the section 387 petition is conducted by first following the procedures for jurisdictional hearings and making a finding that the factual allegations and the allegation of an ineffective prior disposition are or are not true; if there is a true finding, the court then follows the procedures for dispositional hearings to determine whether removal is appropriate. (Rule 1431(d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">We reject Mother\u2019s assertion the juvenile court erred by failing to bifurcate the proceedings. She failed to raise this objection below and has therefore waived the right to do so. <em>(In re Richard K. </em>(1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 580, 590 [30 Cal.Rptr.2d 575].) Even if she had not waived her right to raise the issue, she has not shown prejudice, or even asserted it. She cites <em>In re Fred J. </em>(1979) 89 Cal.App.3d 168, 178 [152 Cal.Rptr. 327], for the proposition that a failure to bifurcate requires reversal. We disagree with that case. \u201cWhen a [rule] does not provide any consequence for noncompliance, the language should be considered directory rather than mandatory. [Citations.] The directory and mandatory designations do not refer to whether a particular . . . requirement is permissive or obligatory, but simply denote whether the failure to comply with a particular procedural step will invalidate the governmental action to which the procedural requirement relates.\u201d <em>(In re C.T. </em>(2002) 100 Cal.App.4th 101, 111 [121 Cal.Rptr.2d 897].) Here, the rule provides no penalty if the court does not comply with it, making the language directory.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">The Agency claims that the appellants have waived the right to assert that the juvenile court had the authority to review the Agency\u2019s rescission of its approval of Grandparents\u2019 home. The Agency contends that at the June 10, 2003 hearing, after its trial counsel cited <em>LA. County I, </em>and at the June 17 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>hearing, when the petitions were amended, no one argued that the court could override the Agency\u2019s decision, the amended petitions failed to state causes of action, or the court should order that the children remain in Grandparents\u2019 home.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">We reject the Agency\u2019s claim. First, its trial counsel cited <em>LA. County I </em>as part of an objection to a question by the children\u2019s attorney during his cross-examination of the social worker (whether she believed the children could be safe in Grandmother\u2019s home). The children\u2019s counsel expressed his disagreement with the Agency\u2019s position that the court \u201ccould not put the children in\u201d a \u201ctotally unlicenseable\u201d home and the court overruled the Agency\u2019s objection. Second, although Mother\u2019s counsel said she had no objection to the amendment of the petitions, this is not the same as saying that the petitions stated a cause of action. While Mother submitted on the social worker\u2019s reports, this does not operate as a waiver of her right to contend that the court\u2019s decision was unsupported by substantial evidence. <em>(In re Richard K., supra, </em>25 Cal.App.4th at pp. 589-590.) \u201cNotwithstanding a submittal on a particular record, the court must nevertheless weigh evidence, make appropriate evidentiary findings and apply relevant law to determine whether the case has been proved. [Citation.] In other words, the parent acquiesces as to the state of the evidence yet preserves the right to challenge it as insufficient to support a particular legal conclusion.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 589.) Finally, questions of law, such as whether the Agency\u2019s refusal to approve the home compelled removal, are subject to de novo review. (See <em>In re Steven H. </em>(2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 1023, 1032 [103 Cal.Rptr.2d 649].)</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">In support of its position that the court lacked the power to review the Agency\u2019s retraction of its approval of Grandparents\u2019 home, the Agency relies on <em>LA. County I. </em>There, after a dependency petition was filed, the children were detained and the juvenile court ordered the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) to investigate the home of the children\u2019s great-uncle and his wife for possible placement. <em>(L.A. County I, supra, </em>87 Cal.App.4th at p. 1163.) The investigation revealed that the great-uncle had a criminal record, apparently including 16 drug-related convictions and jail and prison sentences. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1163-1164.) Because of his criminal record, drug use history, and poor health, DCFS recommended against placement. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1164.)</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">The juvenile court ordered the children released to the wife and allowed the great-uncle monitored contact. <em>(LA. County I, supra, </em>87 Cal.App.4th at p. 1164.) DCFS applied for a rehearing, citing section 361.4, subdivision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>(d)(2),<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> but the court ordered that the children remain released to the wife. (LA. <em>County I, supra, </em>at p. 1164.) After the Court of Appeal issued a <em>Palma </em>notice <em>(Palma </em>v. <em>U.S. Industrial Fasteners, Inc. </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 171, 180 [203 Cal.Rptr. 626, 681 P.2d 893]) directing the court to change the placement order, the juvenile court noted that the wife was caring for the children appropriately, ordered the great-uncle to move out of her home, and ordered DCFS to verify that he had moved out. (L.A. <em>County I, supra, </em>87 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1164\u20141165.) DCFS verified this, but then a social worker paid a surprise visit to the home and found the great-uncle there. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1165.) After the Court of Appeal issued an alternative writ directing the juvenile court to remove the children from the wife\u2019s home or bar contact between the children and the great-uncle, DCFS informed the reviewing court that the juvenile court had granted the wife guardianship over DCFS\u2019s objection. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">The Court of Appeal directed the juvenile court to vacate its orders placing the children in a home in which the great-uncle resided or which afforded him significant contact with the children, enter a new order removing them from the wife\u2019s home and placing them in a suitable home, and vacate its guardianship order. (L.A. <em>County I, supra, </em>87 Cal.App.4th at p. 1171.) The reviewing court noted that the language of section 361.4, subdivision (d)(2), \u201cthe child shall not be placed in the home,\u201d was mandatory, \u201capplie[d] broadly to anyone involved in placement,\u201d and did \u201cnot confer on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>juvenile court any discretion to avoid its prohibition.\u201d <em>(LA. County I, supra, </em>87 Cal.App.4th at p. 1166.) The court observed that the provision in section 361.4, subdivision (d)(3) regarding a waiver of the disqualification did not allow the juvenile court to grant a waiver, but rather allowed only DCFS to request one from the Director of the Department of Social Services (DSS), and only DSS to grant or deny the request. <em>(L.A. County I, supra, </em>87 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1166-1168.)</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\"><em>L.A. County I </em>is not on point. That case concerned placement in the first instance, not removal from an existing placement DCFS had already approved. Additionally, <em>L.A. County I </em>concerned the mandatory statutory language regarding criminal convictions, inapplicable in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">In <em>L.A. County II, </em>the reviewing court confirmed that section 361.4 referred only to placements, not removals. <em>(L.A. County II, supra, </em>112 Cal.App.4th at pp. 519-521.) In that case, three sisters were removed from their parents at birth in 1992, 1994, and 1997. They were detained and then placed with their aunt. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 513.) In 1998, the aunt received probation after pleading guilty to felony infliction of corporal injury on her son (Pen. Code, \u00a7 273d). The girls were removed from the aunt\u2019s care pursuant to a section 387 petition. <em>(L.A. County II, supra, </em>112 Cal.App.4th at pp. 513-514.) In May 1999, the court ordered the two younger girls returned. DCFS had recommended against the return on the ground that the aunt\u2019s recent physical abuse of her son, recent marriage, and recent return of her own children created too many stressors, but it did not argue section 361.4 and did not seek review of the order. <em>(L.A. County II, supra, </em>112 Cal.App.4th at p. 514.) In October 1999, the court ordered the oldest girl be returned. DCFS had recommended against the return because it would have been a violation of its policy to recommend placement in light of the aunt\u2019s criminal record of child endangerment. DCFS did not seek review of this order. The court ordered a permanent plan of long-term foster care. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">In November 2002, the aunt was arrested for inappropriate physical discipline of her daughter. She was convicted of misdemeanor disorderly conduct and placed on probation. In February 2003, DCFS filed a section 387 petition alleging the previous disposition had been ineffective in protecting the children. It requested that the children be detained, arguing that section 361.4 required the court to do so in light of the aunt\u2019s Penal Code section 273d conviction. <em>(L.A. County II, supra, </em>112 Cal.App.4th at p. 514.) The court denied the request, noting that section 361.4 concerned placement, not removal; neither the convictions nor DCFS\u2019s other evidence established a factual basis for removal; and removal would be extremely detrimental to the girls. (LA. <em>County II, supra, </em>at pp. 514-515.) After the detention hearing, the aunt\u2019s Penal Code section 273d conviction was expunged. (LA. <em>County II, supra, </em>at p. 518.)</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>DCFS filed a petition for writ of mandate, contending the court had no discretion to deny its detention request because the aunt\u2019s Penal Code section 273d conviction made her home ineligible for placement under section 361.4. (L.A. <em>County II, supra, </em>112 Cal.App.4th at p. 516.) The Court of Appeal denied the petition <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 516, 521.) It held that despite the expungement, the aunt\u2019s conviction \u201ccontinue[d] to operate as a nonexemptible disqualifying criminal offense under Health and Safety Code section 1522, subdivision (g),\u201d whose definition of such offenses and standards for granting exemptions are incorporated into section 361.4, subdivision (d). <em>(LA. County II, supra, </em>112 Cal.App.4th at pp. 519-520.) Nevertheless, the dependency court had discretion to allow the children to remain in the aunt\u2019s home because section 361.4 \u201crefers only to <em>placements\u201d </em>and \u201cdoes not apply when the issue is whether a child is to be <em>removed from an existing placement </em>if a criminal records check reveals a conviction occurring after the placement.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 519-521, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">The Agency properly notes that <em>LA. County II </em>is distinguishable to the extent it deals with criminal convictions under section 361.4. We disagree with the Agency, however, in its criticism of <em>LA. County II </em>for purportedly ignoring sections 387, 361.3, and 309 and for failing to recognize the executive authority of DCFS to approve relative homes and decide exemptions. The procedural status of that case was consideration of DCFS\u2019s request under section 361.4 to detain the children out of the relative\u2019s home, where they had been placed, pending a hearing on its section 387 petition. (L.A. <em>County II, supra, </em>112 Cal.App.4th at pp. 514-516.) No discussion of section 387, 361.3, or 309 was necessary. The Agency also asserts that the <em>LA. County II </em>court failed to recognize the termination of approval provision in section 309, subdivision (d). Even if section 309 had been applicable, however, there is no indication that the prerequisites in subdivision (d) for termination of approval had been met (approval based on signed statements that there were no convictions, followed by discovery of a criminal record).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">The Agency also discusses <em>In re Jullian B. </em>(2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 1337 [99 Cal.Rptr.2d 241] to illustrate its executive function regarding exemptions. That case is not on point. It concerned the social service agency\u2019s failure to approve the home of an Indian relative who had criminal convictions; the child had not yet been placed in the home. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1342-1344.)</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">As mentioned above, before the court made its true findings, the supplemental petitions were amended by replacing allegations that Grandmother said that Grandfather had a mental illness, and the Agency had discovered a CPS neglect and abuse history, with an allegation that Grandparents\u2019 home was \u201cno longer approved by [the Agency] for placement.\u201d Thus, the court\u2019s findings and orders were based solely on the Agency\u2019s withdrawal of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>approval of Grandparents\u2019 home. Clearly, the record supports the conclusion that the factual allegation of the petitions was true; the Agency did, indeed, withdraw its approval of the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Even though we review the record in the light most favorable to the order <em>(In re Joel H., supra, </em>19 Cal.App.4th at p. 1199),<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> the Agency\u2019s withdrawal of its approval does not constitute substantial evidence that the previous disposition was not effective or that the placement was not appropriate under the criteria in section 361.3. Whether the Agency approved Grandparents\u2019 home (\u00a7 361.3, subd. (a)(8)) was just one of the factors in section 361.3 the court could have considered. The evidence, summarized above, showed that the children had been flourishing in Grandparents\u2019 home for about two years (Miguel and Aaron) and about one year (C.A.). When Miguel\u2019s and Aaron\u2019s cases reached the permanency planning stage, the Agency suddenly changed its mind about the placement.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">There is no evidence in the record that Grandmother\u2019s approximately 13-year-old CPS history consisted of anything but allegations. Although the Agency was aware of this history a part of its own records all along, its reports do not clearly state what the history was. What, precisely, were the allegations? Were any allegations substantiated? If so, which ones?</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">Similarly, the Agency had been aware of Grandfather\u2019s diagnosis for almost a year. There is no indication in the record that his schizophrenia had any adverse consequences. He was stable and on medication. The only negative comments about him were the social worker\u2019s statements in the June 2003 section 387 detention report that \u201che is unable to fulfill the requirements of employment\u201d and \u201c[h]e has been observed to be socially withdrawn and have poor affect.\u201d The report does not say who did the observing, nor is there any indication how Grandfather\u2019s inability to be employed might present a problem. The Agency also remarks on Grandfather\u2019s refusal to sign a release of his mental health information after consulting with Grandmother, but fails to explain why this should lead to an adverse inference. If the Agency wanted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>further information about Grandfather, why did it not request it before approving the children\u2019s placement in the home? In any event, although Grandmother may have initially failed to follow the Agency\u2019s directive not to leave the children alone with Grandfather, she may later have had her own older children help care for the dependent children, and by May 29, she was providing the children\u2019s primary care.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">While the detention report noted that the home was cluttered and of marginal cleanliness and two of Grandmother\u2019s daughters had moved in, Grandmother planned improvements and the social worker was not concerned about the home\u2019s standards. There was no evidence that Grandparents\u2019 home was other than a \u201csecure and stable environment\u201d or that it presented any danger to the children. <em>(In re Joel H., supra, </em>19 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1201, 1203.) The juvenile court\u2019s comments, supported by the evidence, illustrate that moving from Grandparents\u2019 home was going to be difficult for the children, to say the least. The court\u2019s comments also show that it believed it was compelled to rule the way it did although it was not in the children\u2019s best interests. It was not so compelled. While it depends on the Agency\u2019s expertise for guidance <em>(In re Robert A. </em>(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 174, 189 [5 Cal.Rptr.2d 438]), it must exercise its own discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">Because there was no substantial evidence that the previous disposition was ineffective or that the placement was not appropriate under the criteria in section 361.3, the juvenile court erred by ordering the children removed from Grandparents\u2019 home. In light of our conclusion, we need not discuss Miguel\u2019s contention that the removal violated the children\u2019s fundamental rights to remain placed with their biological family.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">D. ICWA</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">Mother contends that the section 387 decision to place Aaron in foster care must be reversed because the required ICWA notice was not given to the tribes or the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">\u201c[W]here the court knows or has reason to know that an Indian child is involved, the party seeking the foster care placement of, or termination of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>parental rights to, an Indian child shall notify the parent or Indian custodian and the Indian child\u2019s tribe, by registered mail with return receipt requested, of the pending proceedings and of their right of intervention.\u201d (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912 (a).) \u201cIf the identity or location of the . . . tribe cannot be determined, such notice shall be given to\u201d the BIA. <em>(Ibid.; Dwayne P. v. Superior Court </em>(2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 247 [126 Cal.Rptr.2d 639].)</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">\u201c \u2018Since . . . failure to give proper notice of a dependency proceeding to a tribe with which the dependent child may be affiliated forecloses participation by the tribe, notice requirements are strictly construed.\u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Karla C. </em>(2003) 113 Cal.App.4th 166, 174 [6 Cal.Rptr.3d 205], quoting <em>In re Samuel P. </em>(2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 1259, 1267 [121 Cal.Rptr.2d 820].) The notice requirement applies even if the Indian status of the child is uncertain. <em>(In re Kahlen W. </em>(1991) 233 Cal.App.3d 1414, 1422 [285 Cal.Rptr. 507].) The showing required to trigger the statutory notice provisions is minimal; it is less than the showing needed to establish a child is an Indian child within the meaning of ICWA. <em>(Dwayne P. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>103 Cal.App.4th at p. 258.) A hint may suffice for this minimal showing. <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201cThe determination of a child\u2019s Indian status is up to the tribe; therefore, the juvenile court needs only a suggestion of Indian ancestry to trigger the notice requirement.\u201d <em>(In re Nikki R. </em>(2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 844, 848 [131 Cal.Rptr.2d 256].) \u201cIf ... the court has reason to know the child may be an Indian child, the court shall proceed as if the child is an Indian child . . . .\u201d (Rule 1439(e).) \u201cIf at any time after the filing of the petition the court knows or has reason to know that the child is or may be an Indian child, the . . . notice procedures must be followed.\u201d (Rule 1439(f).)</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">\u201c \u2018[P]arents are not necessarily knowledgeable about tribal government or membership and their interests may diverge from those of the tribe and those of each other. [Citation.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(Dwayne P. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>103 Cal.App.4th at p. 257, quoting <em>In re Kahlen W., supra, </em>233 Cal.App.3d at p. 1425.) \u201cWe agree that \u2018[t]o maintain stability in placements of children in juvenile proceedings, it is preferable to err on the side of giving notice and examining thoroughly whether the juvenile is an Indian child. [Citation.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(Dwayne P. v.

Although the detention report stated that ICWA \u201cdoes or may apply,\u201d at the detention hearing that month the court found it did not apply. Edward\u2019s May 2002 paternity questionnaire said that he \u201cmaybe\u201d had American Indian heritage through an Apache tribe. On May 6, the court set a hearing on ICWA issues for May 21. On May 16, the Agency filled out notice forms for the Mescalero <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>Apache Tribal Council, the Ikce Oyate Nation, and the BIA. The Agency\u2019s May 21 report says that the notices to the Mescalero Apache Tribal Council and the Ikce Oyate Nation were by certified mail. On May 21, the court found that ICWA did not apply. The parties apparently assumed that because Edward associated with a tribe that was not registered, and he had not yet enrolled in a registered Apache tribe, ICWA was inapplicable. While the notice forms are difficult to read, it appears that Aaron\u2019s biological grandfather was affiliated with an Apache tribe.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">There are several ICWA notice problems here. First, the Ikce Oyate Nation does not appear to be a federally recognized Indian entity and there were and are other Apache tribes in addition to the Mescalero Apache. (65 Fed. Reg. 13298 (Mar. 13, 2000); 69 Fed. Reg. 68180 (Dec. 5, 2003).) Second, there is no indication that the notice to the BIA was ever sent, nor is there any indication the notices were sent by registered mail with return receipt requested. <em>(In re Karla C., supra, </em>113 Cal.App.4th at pp. 174-176.) Third, the notices did not contain much of the required information. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 175.) We remand for compliance with ICWA.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">E. The Agency\u2019s Dismissal Motions</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">On March 2, 2004, the Agency filed a motion to dismiss Miguel\u2019s, Grandparents\u2019, and Mother\u2019s appeals as to C.A. As part of this motion, the Agency requests judicial notice of a February 20, 2004 order placing C.A. with her father and setting a review hearing for August 18. The Agency contends this placement makes the issue of her continued placement with or removal from Grandparents moot. Mother, the three children, and Grandparents filed opposition to the motion. We grant the request for judicial notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">On February 20, 2004, the juvenile court did not terminate jurisdiction. If the June 2003 order is left undisturbed, Grandparents\u2019 home will not be a placement option for C.A. in the event her placement with her father fails. Even if that placement succeeds, leaving the June 2003 order intact may limit her ability to have full visitation with Grandparents. We therefore deny this dismissal motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b414-10\">Miguel\u2019s petition for writ of habeas corpus is denied. Grandparents\u2019 appeal is dismissed. The June 10 and 17, 2003 findings and orders on the section 387 petitions are reversed. This matter is remanded to the juvenile court, with the following directions.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-11\">As to Aaron, the court shall (1) require the Agency to give proper ICWA notice to and file with the court the notices, return receipts, and any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>responses; and (2) hold a new section 387 hearing. If, at the new hearing, the court determines the ICWA notice was proper and no Indian entity seeks to intervene or otherwise indicates Aaron is an Indian child as defined by ICWA, the court shall proceed with the section 387 hearing and exercise its discretion as outlined in this opinion. If, on the other hand, an Indian entity determines Aaron is an Indian child under ICWA, the court shall proceed in accordance with ICWA.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">As to Miguel and C.A., the court shall hold a new section 387 hearing at which it shall exercise its discretion as outlined in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">McConnell, P.
