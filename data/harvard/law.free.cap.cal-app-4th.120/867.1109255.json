Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7 211) with personal firearm use. (\u00a7 12022.53, subd. (b).) Defendant was sentenced to 15 years in state prison. He was ordered to pay $310 in victim restitution (\u00a7 1202.4, subd. (f)), a $2,000 restitution fine (\u00a7 1202.4, subd. (b)), a $2,000 parole restitution fine if he violated the conditions of his parole (\u00a7 1202.45), and a $20 court security fee (\u00a7 1465.8, subd. (a)(1)). Defendant received credit for 139 days of actual presentence custody, plus 20 days of conduct credit (\u00a7\u00a7 2933.1, 667.5, subd. (c)(9)), for a presentence custody credit of 159 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-10\">We appointed counsel to represent defendant on appeal. Counsel has filed a brief in which no issues were raised. <em>(People v. Wende </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 436, 441-442 [158 Cal.Rptr. 839, 600 P.2d 1071]; see <em>Smith v. Robbins </em>(2000) 528 U.S. 259, 264 [145 L.Ed.2d 756, 120 S.Ct. 746].) On January 15, 2004, we advised defendant he had 30 days within which to submit by brief or letter any grounds of appeal, contentions, or arguments he wished this court to consider. No response has been received. We asked the parties to address two issues, one of which we will discuss in the published portion of this opinion. In the published portion of this opinion, we conclude that, consistent with the ex post facto clauses of the United States and California Constitutions, the section 1465.8, subdivision (a)(1) $20 court security fee, which was part of a budget trailer bill, may be imposed on defendants whose crimes were committed prior to its August 17, 2003, effective date.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>n. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"A82\">A. The $20 Court Security Fee</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">Defendant contends the trial court erroneously imposed a $20 court security fee. Defendant argues that since he committed his offense prior to the effective date of section 1465.8, subdivision (a)(1), the imposition of the $20 court security fee violates the ex post facto provisions of the federal and state Constitutions. (U.S. Const., art. I, \u00a7 10; Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 9.) We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">Section 1465.8 states in its entirety: \u201c(a)(1) To ensure and maintain adequate funding for court security, a fee of twenty dollars ($20) shall be imposed on every conviction for a criminal offense, including a traffic offense, except parking offenses as defined in subdivision (i) of Section 1463, involving a violation of a section of the Vehicle Code or any local ordinance adopted pursuant to the Vehicle Code. [][] (2) For the purposes of this section, \u2018conviction\u2019 includes the dismissal of a traffic violation on the condition that the defendant attend a court-ordered traffic violator school, as authorized by Sections 41501 and 42005 of the Vehicle Code. This security fee shall be deposited in accordance with subdivision (d), and may not be included with the fee calculated and distributed pursuant to Section 42007 of the Vehicle Code. [\u00b6] (b) This fee shall be in addition to the state penalty assessed pursuant to Section 1464 and may not be included in the base fine to calculate the state penalty assessment as specified in subdivision (a) of Section 1464. [ft] (c) When bail is deposited for an offense to which this section applies, and for which a court appearance is not necessary, the person making the deposit shall also deposit a sufficient amount to include the fee prescribed by this section, [ft] (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the fees collected pursuant to subdivision (a) shall all be deposited in a special account in the county treasury and transmitted therefrom monthly to the Controller for deposit in the Trial Court Trust Fund, [ft] (e) The Judicial Council shall provide for the administration of this section.\u201d Section 1465.8 was enacted as part of Assembly Bill No. 1759 (2003-2004 Reg. Sess.), hereafter Assembly Bill No. 1759. (Stats. 2003, ch. 159, \u00a7 25.) The enactment of section 1465.8 was conditional upon specified expenditure levels for trial court funding appropriations being approved as part of the fiscal year 2003-2004 budget. (Stats. 2003, ch. 159, \u00a7 27.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>) Because Assembly Bill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>No. 1759 was part of the fiscal year 2003-2004 budget, it was adopted as an urgency measure. (Stats. 2003, ch. 159, \u00a7 29.)</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">In addition to the foregoing, the codified provisions of Assembly Bill No. 1759 made extensive changes to the allowable fees that may be charged litigants and created a mechanism for managing court security issues. Among the statutory changes in Assembly Bill No. 1759 were: increases in fees under specified circumstances in small claims actions (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 116.230; Stats. 2003, ch. 159, \u00a7\u00a7 1-2); imposing new costs for issuance of documents relative to the enforcement of small claims judgments (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 116.820; Stats. 2003, ch. 159, \u00a7 3); requiring the reimbursement of the Attorney General for investigation and other costs in enumerated enforcement actions (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1021.8; Stats. 2003, ch. 159, \u00a7 4); establishment of the Public Rights Law Enforcement Special Fund to be administered by the Department of Justice (Gov. Code, \u00a7 12530; Stats. 2003, ch. 159, \u00a7 5); granting the Attorney General the right to recover attorney fees in charitable trust actions (Gov. Code, \u00a7 12598, subds. (b)-(c); Stats. 2003, ch. 159, \u00a7 6); clarification of the right of the Attorney General to recover attorney fees in Fair Employment and Housing Act enforcement actions (Gov. Code, \u00a7 12989.3, subd. (g); Stats. 2003, ch. 159, \u00a7 7); increased filing fees in civil actions (Gov. Code, \u00a7 26826.4; Stats. 2003, ch. 159, \u00a7 8); increased fees in probate actions (Gov. Code, \u00a7 26827; Stats. 2003, ch. 159, \u00a7\u00a7 9-10); increasing the filing fee for specified motions and requiring the deposit of enumerated funds in the Trial Court Trust Fund (Gov. Code, \u00a7 26830; Stats. 2003, ch. 159, \u00a7\u00a7 11-12); requiring specified fees collected in civil litigation to be transferred to the Trial Court Trust Fund on a monthly basis and providing for its administration (Gov. Code, \u00a7 68085.5; Stats. 2003, ch. 159, \u00a7 13); assessing fees for court reporter usage (Gov. Code, \u00a7 68086; Stats. 2003, ch. 159, \u00a7 14); increasing the fee for filing a notice of appeal (Gov. Code, \u00a7 68926.1; Stats. 2003, ch. 159, \u00a7 16); increasing the fee for filing a review petition in the California Supreme Court (Gov. Code, \u00a7 68927; Stats. 2003, ch. 159, \u00a7 17); establishing the Appellate Court Trust Fund (Gov. Code, \u00a7 68933; Stats. 2003, ch. 159, \u00a7 18); imposing a $20 surcharge for \u201ccourt security\u201d purposes to filing fees in civil actions (Gov. Code, \u00a7 69926.5; Stats. 2003, ch. 159, \u00a7 19); providing a mechanism for managing court security (Gov. Code, \u00a7 69927; Stats. 2003, ch. 159, \u00a7 20); and increasing the filing fees in limited civil cases. (Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 72055-72056; Stats. 2003, ch. 159, \u00a7\u00a7 21-24.) Additionally, uncodified provisions of Assembly Bill No. 1759 allocated reimbursements in the event local entities incurred costs and limited the operability of the provisions relating to appellate fees and the Appellate Court Trust Fund. (Stats. 2003, ch. 159, \u00a7\u00a7 26-28.)</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">Committee reports prepared as part of the legislative process that resulted in the adoption of Assembly Bill No. 1759 indicate the Legislature viewed the set of new laws that were ultimately enacted, including section 1465.8, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>subdivision (a)(1), primarily as a budget measure. Assembly Bill No. 1759 as originally introduced stated only, \u201cIt is the intent of the Legislature to enact statutory changes relating to the Budget Act of 2003.\u201d (Assem. Bill No. 1759, as introduced Mar 11, 2003, \u00a7 1.) The Legislative Counsel\u2019s Digest for Assembly Bill No. 1759 as introduced on March 11, 2003, merely stated, \u201cThis bill would express the intent of the Legislature to enact statutory changes relating to the Budget Act of 2003.\u201d Other than the foregoing single sentence, no statutory changes appeared anywhere in Assembly Bill No. 1759 as originally introduced. The March 11, 2003, Assembly third reading report identified Assembly Bill No. 1759 thusly: \u201cAllows the passage of trailer bills to accompany the Budget Bill (AB 100) in order to assure proper implementation of its provisions. The bill must be limited to address the implementation of the State\u2019s fiscal plan. [][] [] This legislation would provide the mechanism to implement critical provisions of the Budget Act. The fiscal effect of this bill cannot be determined at this time.\u201d (Assem. 3d reading analysis of Assem. Bill No. 1759 as introduced (Mar. 11, 2003, p. 1.) Additionally, the third reading report explained the function of Assembly Bill No. 1759 as a \u201ctrailer bill\u201d to implement the 2003-2004 fiscal year state budget: \u201cThis bill is one of 24 trailer bills to be submitted by the Budget Committee to complement the Budget Bill. Trailer bills are generally separated by subject area such as education, resources, or health, to minimize possible conflicts with single subject limitations that could occur if a general omnibus trailer bill were to be proposed. In addition, separate trailer bills are often used to address specific issues in the Budget Bill.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>A Senate third reading report issued on June 18, 2003, mirrored the foregoing analysis. (Sen. Rules Com., Off. of Sen. Floor Analyses, 3d reading analysis of Assem. Bill No. 1759, June 18, 2003, p. 1.) On June 3, 2003, Assembly Bill No 1759, as described in this paragraph, passed the lower house unanimously, (&lt;http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/bill/asm/ab_17511800/ab_1759_bill_20030802_history.html&gt; [as of July 20, 2004].)</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">California Constitution, article IV, section 12, subdivision (c) mandates the budget be sent to the Governor on June 15. On June 25, 2003, Assembly Bill No. 1759 was amended on the Senate floor to include for the first time 27 sections. (Sen. Amend, to Assem. Bill No. 1759, June 25, 2003, \u00a7\u00a7 1-27.) The June 25, 2003, Senate amendment provided for section 1465.8 in its current format. (Sen. Amend, to Assem. Bill No. 1759, <em>supra, </em>at \u00a7 25.) The Legislative Counsel\u2019s Digest made no reference to the purpose of Assembly Bill No. 1759 other than to recount the statutory provisions affected by its adoption.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A Senate report states: \u201cSenate floor amendments of 6/25/03 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>constitute the bill. The previous version was a spot budget trailer bill.\u201d (Sen. Rules Com., Off. of Sen. Floor Analyses, 3d reading analysis of Assem. Bill No. 1759 as introduced (June 25, 2003) p. 1, underscoring omitted.) The Senate Rules Committee report did not mention section 1465.8 but adverted to the budget-related provisions, virtually all of which were part of Assembly Bill No. 1759 as finally adopted. (Sen. Rules Com., 3d reading analysis, <em>supra, </em>at pp. 1-3.) When referring to the new or increased costs imposed on litigants, the report referred to them as \u201cfees.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\"><em>A </em>July 27, 2003, Senate report again summarized Assembly Bill No. 1759 without specific reference to section 1465.8. (Sen. Rules Com., Off. of Sen. Floor Analyses, 3d reading analysis of Assem. Bill No. 1759 as amended July 27, 2003, pp. 1-2.) The report described the bill as, \u201cJudiciary Omnibus 2003-04 Budget Trailer Bill.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1.) When the legislation was returned to the Assembly for final approval, a report prepared for the Assembly members stated: \u201cAS PASSED BY THE ASSEMBLY this bill expressed the intent of the Legislature to enact statutory changes to the Budget Act of 2003. [1] FISCAL EFFECT: Makes various statutory changes to implement certain portions of the 2003 Budget Bill.\u201d (Assem. Floor Analysis, Cone, in Sen. Amends, to Assem. Bill No. 1759 as amended July 27, 2003, p. 2, underscoring omitted.) The report described the section 1465.8, subdivision (a)(1) $20 court security fee as a \u201csurcharge.\u201d (Assem. Floor Analysis Assem. Bill No. 1759, <em>supra, </em>at p. 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">In assessing whether the court security fee is punitive and therefore subject to the United States and California Constitutions\u2019 ex post facto clauses, the relevant test is as follows: \u201cThe framework for our inquiry, however, is well established. We must \u2018ascertain whether the legislature meant the statute to establish \u201ccivil\u201d proceedings.\u2019 <em>Kansas v. Hendricks, </em>521 U.S. 346, 361 (1997). If the intention of the legislature was to impose punishment, that ends the inquiry. If, however, the intention was to enact a regulatory scheme that is civil and nonpunitive, we must further examine whether the statutory scheme is \u2018 \u201cso punitive either in purpose or effect as to negate [the State\u2019s] intention\u201d to deem it \u201ccivil.\u201d \u2019 <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>448 U.S. 242, 248-249 . . . (1980)). Because we \u2018ordinarily defer to the legislature\u2019s stated intent,\u2019 <em>Hendricks, supra, </em>at 361, \u2018 \u201conly the clearest proof\u2019 will suffice to override legislative intent and transform what has been denominated a civil remedy into a criminal penalty,\u2019 <em>Hudson v. United States, </em>522 U.S. 93, 100 (1997) (quoting <em>Ward, supra, </em>at 249); see also <em>Hendricks, supra, </em>at 361; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ursery, </em>518 U.S. 267, 290 (1996); <em>United States </em>v. <em>One Assortment of 89 Firearms, </em>465 U.S. 354, 365 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>(1984).\u201d <em>(Smith v. Doe </em>(2003) 538 U.S. 84, 92 [155 L.Ed.2d 164, 123 S.Ct. 1140]; see <em>In re Alva </em>(2004) 33 Cal.4th 254, 275-276 [92 P.3d 311] [applying <em>Smith </em>in evaluating whether sex offender registration is <em>punishment </em>for cruel or unusual punishment purposes].)</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">The first inquiry then is whether the Legislature in imposing the $20 court security fee intended to impose a civil rather than punitive regime. The United States Supreme Court described this initial ex post facto inquiry as follows: \u201cThe courts \u2018must first ask whether the legislature, in establishing the penalizing mechanism, indicated either expressly or impliedly a preference for one label or the other.\u2019 <em>Hudson, </em>supra, at 99 (internal quotation marks omitted).\u201d <em>(Smith </em>v. <em>Doe, supra, </em>538 U.S. at p. 93.) The United States Supreme Court has described the judicial analysis that must be utilized in assessing an ex post facto claim: \u201cWe consider the statute\u2019s text and its structure to determine the legislative objective. <em>Flemming </em>v. <em>Nestor, </em>363 U.S. 603, 617 (1960). A conclusion that the legislature intended to punish would satisfy an <em>ex post facto </em>challenge without further inquiry into its effects, so considerable deference must be accorded to the intent as the legislature has stated it. [f] The courts \u2018must first ask whether the legislature, in establishing the penalizing mechanism, indicated either expressly or impliedly a preference for one label or the other.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Smith v. Doe, supra, </em>538 U.S. at pp. 92-93.)</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">The Legislature never indicated it considered the $20 court security fee, which was imposed in both criminal and specified civil cases, as punishment. The stated reason for enacting the $20 court security fee appears in section 1465.8, subdivision (a)(1), \u201cTo ensure and maintain adequate funding for court security . . . .\u201d The maintenance of \u201cadequate funding for court security\u201d purposes is unambiguously a nonpunitive objective. Assembly Bill No. 1759 was one of 24 trailer bills which were part of a \u201cmechanism to implement critical provisions\u201d of the fiscal year 2003-2004 state budget. (Assem. 3d reading analysis of Assem. Bill No. 1759, as introduced Mar. 11, 2003, p. 1.) The only expressed rationale for making Assembly Bill No. 1759 an urgency statute was a budgetary reason: \u201cIn order to provide for changes to implement the Budget Act of 2003, it is necessary that this act take effect immediately.\u201d (Stats. 2003, ch. 159, \u00a7 29.) Moreover, the $20 court security fee was imposed not merely upon persons convicted of crime. Government Code section 69926.5, subdivision (a), which was adopted pursuant to section 19 of Assembly Bill No. 1759, required a $20 court security surcharge also be imposed on the first paper filed on behalf of a plaintiff or a defendant in any limited and unlimited civil action or special proceeding and in probate matters. (Stats. 2003, ch. 159, \u00a7 19; Gov. Code, \u00a7 26820.4, 26826, 26827, 72055, 72056.) Moreover, section 1465.8, subdivision (a)(2) requires that the $20 surcharge be imposed when a traffic violation charge is <em>dismissed </em>because the alleged violator attends traffic school. Further, section 1465.8, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>subdivision (c) requires that the $20 court security fee be collected when bail is posted\u2014a scenario which includes arrestees who will never be charged in an information, indictment, or complaint with a crime. Additionally, section 1465.8 could only go into effect if specified levels of trial court funding were enacted by the Legislature. (Stats. 2003, ch. 159, \u00a7 27.) Although it conceivably could happen, it is difficult to divine a punitive purpose for a fee that would go into effect only if specified trial court funding levels ($2,186,864,000 \u201cor more\u201d for item 0450-101-0932 and $1,001,001,000 \u201cor more\u201d for item 0450-111-0001 in the 2003 Budget Act) were enacted. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Generally, the adoption of a statute with a punitive purpose is not dependent on trial court funding levels in budget line items. Finally, the Legislature has not chosen to refer to the $20 due upon a conviction as a fine; rather it is referred to in section 1465.8 on five occasions as a fee. The Legislature\u2019s choice of what in most cases would be considered a more nonpunitive term, a fee as distinguished from a fine, is directly relevant albeit not entirely dispositive in assessing the legislative intent question which is the first prong of the ex post facto analysis. <em>(Smith v. Doe, supra, </em>538 U.S. at pp. 92-93; <em>United States v. One Assortment of 89 Firearms, supra, </em>465 U.S. at p. 365, fn. 6 [congressional use of the term \u201cpenalty\u201d to describe firearm forfeiture not dispositive].) After giving the expressly stated legislative purpose for enacting section 1465.8, subdivision (a)(1), \u201c[t]o ensure and maintain adequate funding for court security,\u201d the deference mandated by controlling United States and California Supreme Court authority\u2014as to the first prong of ex post facto analysis\u2014we conclude the Legislature imposed the $20 fee for a nonpunitive purpose. <em>(Smith v. Doe, supra, </em>538 U.S. at pp. 93-96.)</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">The second inquiry then is whether section 1465.8, subdivision (a)(1) is \u201c \u2018 \u201cso punitive either in purpose of effect\u201d \u2019 \u201d as to negate the Legislature\u2019s intention that the $20 fee be a civil disability. <em>(Smith v. Doe, supra </em>538 U.S. at p. 92; <em>Kansas v. Hendricks, supra, </em>521 U.S. at p. 361.) The Supreme Court has held though that \u201c \u2018 \u201conly the clearest proof\u2019 \u2019 \u201d will suffice to override legislative intent and transform a civil remedy into a criminal penalty. <em>(Smith v. Doe, supra, </em>538 U.S. at p. 92; <em>Hatton v. Bonner </em>(9th Cir. 2004) 356 F.3d 955, 967; see <em>In re Alva, supra, </em>33 Cal.4th at p. 274 [cruel and unusual punishment context]; <em>People v. Castellanos </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 785, 802 [88 Cal.Rptr.2d 346, 982 P.2d 211] (conc. and dis. opn. of Kennard, J.).) The United States Supreme Court has utilized some of the factors listed in <em>Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez </em>(1963) 372 U.S. 144, 168-169 [9 L.Ed.2d 644, 83 S.Ct. 554], in evaluating the second prong of ex post facto analysis. <em>(Smith v. Doe, supra, </em>538 U.S. at p. 97; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Castellanos, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 802 (conc. and dis. opn. of Kennard, J.).) In the ex post facto context, the <em>Mendoza-Martinez </em>factors, which are not exclusive, are as follows: \u201cThe factors most relevant to our analysis are whether, in its necessary operation, the regulatory scheme: has been regarded in our history <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>and traditions as a punishment; imposes an affirmative disability or restraint; promotes the traditional aims of punishment; has a rational connection to a nonpunitive purpose; or is excessive with respect to this purpose.\u201d <em>(Smith v. Doe, supra, </em>538 U.S. at p. 97; see <em>People v. Castellanos, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 802 (conc. and dis. opn. of Kennard, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">As to the first <em>Mendoza-Martinez </em>factor\u2014whether a practice has historically been considered a punishment\u2014in one sense defendant\u2019s argument has some substance. His conviction has resulted in the imposition of the $20 fee. Whether it is referred to as a fee, fine, penalty, charge, cost, expense, or surcharge, defendant\u2019s obligation to pay the $20 arose only from his conviction. Fines are generally considered to be punishment. But there are several countervailing considerations. A court security fee can logically be viewed as a nonpunitive fee assessed for the use of court facilities which is designed to make them safer. This is particularly true when the same fee is imposed in limited and unlimited civil and probate cases as well. (Stats. 2003, ch. 159, \u00a7 19; Gov. Code, \u00a7 69926.5, subd. (a).) Moreover, in traffic cases, the $20 fee is imposed even when the alleged violator\u2019s case is dismissed because he or she attends traffic school. (Stats. 2003, ch. 159, \u00a7 25; \u00a7 1465.8, subd. (c).) Also, as noted previously, the enactment of section 1465.8, subdivision (a)(1) was dependent on the adoption of specified trial court funding levels. (Stats. 2003, ch. 159, \u00a7 27.) In this respect, section 1465.8, subdivision (a)(1) is unlike any other form of punishment\u2014its effectiveness was entirely dependent on funding of other budget line items.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">The second <em>Mendoza-Martinez </em>factor\u2014whether section 1465.8, subdivision (a)(1) imposes a traditional punishment\u2014militates strongly against defendant. This factor was described by the Supreme Court thusly, \u201cHere, we inquire how the effects of the [challenged statute] are felt by those subject to it. If the disability or restraint is minor and indirect, its effects are unlikely to be punitive.\u201d <em>(Smith </em>v. <em>Doe, supra, </em>538 U.S. at pp. 99-100; <em>Hatton v. Bonner, supra, </em>356 F.3d at p. 963.) The $20 court security fee is a small amount of money. Further, the United States Supreme Court has explained in the context of a challenge to an Alaska sex offender registration law: \u201cThe Act imposes no physical restraint, and so does not resemble the punishment of imprisonment, which is the paradigmatic affirmative disability or restraint. <em>Hudson </em>[v. <em>United States, supra], </em>522 U.S., at 104. The Act\u2019s obligations are less harsh than the sanctions of occupational debarment, which we have held to be nonpunitive. See <em>ibid, </em>(forbidding further participation in the banking industry); <em>De Veau </em>v. <em>Braisted, </em>363 U.S. 144 . . . (1960) (forbidding work as a union official); <em>Hawker </em>v. <em>New York, </em>170 U.S. 189 (1898) (revocation of a medical license).\u201d <em>(Smith v. Doe, supra, </em>538 U.S. at p. 100; <em>Hatton v. Bonner, supra, </em>356 F.3d at p. 963.) On this count, the $20 court security fee is not a traditional punishment for ex post facto purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>As to the third <em>Mendoza-Martinez </em>factor\u2014whether the $20 fee promotes traditional <em>aims </em>of punishment\u2014it does not. The $20 court security fee, which is part of an extensive statutory scheme applicable to both criminal and specified civil cases designed to fund and coordinate court security, does not promote the traditional aims of punishment\u2014it promotes court security. Requiring a convicted criminal defendant to pay $20 to help fund court security will not deter a solitary potential criminal from committing a single crime\u2014not one.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">As to the fourth <em>Mendoza-Martinez </em>factor\u2014whether the challenged provision has a rational relation to a nonpunitive purpose\u2014the $20 court security fee obviously does. The fifth <em>Mendoza-Martinez </em>factor\u2014whether the $20 court security fee is excessive with respect to its purpose of helping fund safe courthouses\u2014militates quite strongly in favor of the position of the Attorney General. The minimal fee is not excessive and furthers the purpose of section 1465.8, subdivision (a)(1) which, as part of Assembly Bill No. 1759, has as its purpose insuring appropriate funding levels for court operations and providing a more rational process for planning court security.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">These sometimes countervailing considerations do not permit us to find the imposition of the $20 court security fee was an ex post facto violation. As noted previously, we cannot override the legislative treatment of the $20 section 1465.8, subdivision (a)(1) fee as a nonpunitive provision unless there is \u201c \u2018 \u201cthe clearest proof\u2019 \u2019 \u201d that section 1465.8 is \u201c \u2018 \u201cso punitive either in purpose or effect as to negate\u201d \u2019 \u201d the Legislature\u2019s intention to treat it as a civil matter. <em>(Smith </em>v. <em>Doe, supra, </em>538 U.S. at p. 92; <em>Hatton v. Bonner, supra, </em>356 F.3d at p. 967; see <em>In re Alva, supra, </em>33 Cal.4th at p. 274; <em>People </em>v. <em>Castellanos, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 802 (conc. and dis. opn. of Kennard, J.).) Defendant has failed to present the \u201cclearest proof\u2019 that the $20 court security fee, which is imposed in criminal and civil cases, is so punitive in its purpose or effect as to override the Legislature\u2019s treatment of it as a nonpunitive measure.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">Our views in this regard are consistent with other decisions. Appellate courts have consistently held that a minimal fee, imposed for a nonpunitive purpose and without punitive effect, is not subject to the limitations of the ex post facto clause. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rivera </em>(1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 705, 708-712 [76 Cal.Rptr.2d 703] [jail booking ($135) and classification ($33) fees]; <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>State of Rhode Island </em>(1st Cir. 1996) 101 F.3d 780, 782-784 [$15 monthly probation fee]; <em>Goad v.

(U.S. Const., art. 1, \u00a7 10, cl. 1; Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 9.) I believe the obligation results in a punishment. Defendant is not a voluntary user of the court facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-11\">Nevertheless, the authorities support the conclusion of the majority. Even the dissenters in <em>Smith v. Doe </em>(2003) 538 U.S. 84 [155 L.Ed.2d 164, 123 S.Ct. 1140], appear to acknowledge that some sanctions may not be subject to the ex post facto clause of the United States Constitution. Justice Ginsburg, in disagreeing with the majority that a sex registration act did not violate the ex post facto clause, said, \u201cWhat ultimately tips the balance for me is the Act\u2019s excessiveness in relation to its nonpunitive purpose.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 116.) Here, the provision involves a modest sum. Justice Stevens, also dissenting in <em>Smith v. Doe, </em>stated, \u201cIn my opinion, a sanction that (1) is imposed on everyone who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>commits a criminal offense, (2) is not imposed on anyone else, and (3) severely impairs a person\u2019s liberty is punishment.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 113.) The fee here does not satisfy all of those criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">The court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Castellanos </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 785 [88 Cal.Rptr.2d 346, 982 P.2d 211], held that California\u2019s sex offender registration provision did not violate the ex post facto clauses of the United States and California Constitutions. A dissent stated, \u201cas the lead opinion itself states, <em>\u2018two </em>factors appear important in each case: whether the Legislature intended the provision to constitute punishment and, if not, whether the provision is so punitive in <em>nature or effect </em>that it must be found to constitute punishment despite the Legislature\u2019s contrary intent.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 806 (dis. opn. of Mosk, J.).) Justice Mosk concluded that the sex offender registration provisions was a penal sanction because it was sufficiently punitive in <em>nature or effect. </em>It is tenable that the provision here is not \u201c \u2018so punitive in nature or effect that it must be found to constitute punishment despite the Legislature\u2019s contrary intent.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid, </em>italics omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">The court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Rivera </em>(1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 705, 711 [76 Cal.Rptr.2d 703], said, \u201cThe fact that the fees come into play only upon a criminal conviction is a factor which can be viewed as punitive. However, an alternative view is that this simply reflects a legislative determination that those who are not convicted are involuntary users of the jail system who should not have to pay for services for which they did not choose to avail themselves; whereas those who are convicted in effect \u2018chose\u2019 to use the jail services when they chose to commit an unlawful act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">I have some difficulty with the idea that by committing a crime, a defendant \u201cchose\u201d to use the services of the criminal justice system, although perhaps that use is what he or she should expect. Also, as the court in <em>People v. High </em>(2004) 119 Cal.App.4th 1192 [15 Cal.Rptr. 3d 148] <em>(High) </em>noted in holding that the imposition of a state court facilities construction penalty upon a convicted defendant violated the state and federal ex post facto clauses, if the monetary charge \u201cwere a user fee, there would be a rational relationship between the amount of the assessment and the extent of the individual\u2019s] use.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1198.) Here, the $20 charge is imposed no matter how long the defendant is in trial or even if he pleads guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">Nevertheless, unlike in <em>High, </em>in which the charge is labeled a \u201cpenalty,\u201d the charge here is referred to as a \u201cfee.\u201d <em>(High, supra, </em>119 Cal.App.4th at p. 1199.) The other points in the majority opinion also are compelling. Accordingly, I conclude that the current state of the law requires a conclusion that the fee in question does not violate ex post facto provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>The increasing imposition of monetary sanctions upon those convicted of crimes to solve budgetary problems or to impose greater punishment could be counterproductive. Saddling with debt those who are serving or have served their criminal sentences is neither rehabilitative nor a deterrent. Also, the fees, even if collected, may not be worth the effort in view of the expense entailed in implementing and enforcing such programs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
