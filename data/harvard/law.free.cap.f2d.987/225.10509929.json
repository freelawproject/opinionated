Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">Goldfaden, as director and treasurer, operated Control Sewer and Pipe Cleaning, Inc., a Texas concern engaged primarily in removal of liquid industrial waste and sewer cleaning. In September 1990 a grand jury returned an 18-count superseding indictment charging Goldfaden and Control Sewer with conspiracy to violate and numerous substantive violations of federal law governing industrial waste transportation and disposal. Goldfaden agreed to plead guilty to one court of unlawful industrial waste disposal in violation of 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1319(c)(2)(A); the prosecutor agreed to dismiss the remaining counts and promised to make no sentencing recommendation and to pursue no further prosecutions arising from the operations. The trial court accepted Goldfaden\u2019s plea and sentenced him to 36 months imprisonment, one year of supervised release, a $75,000 fine, and the mandatory assessment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Goldfaden timely appealed his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">Because the government made a recommendation relating to sentencing in violation of its obligation under the plea agreement we vacated the sentence and remanded for resentencing before a different judge.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Our opinion also addressed several of Goldfaden\u2019s other contentions. We found that the district court properly increased Goldfaden\u2019s offense level for discharge without a permit and for obstruction of justice, but concluded that the court should have applied U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Q1.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-10\">On remand Goldfaden was sentenced under section 2Q1.3. The offense level of 20 ascertained at the proceeding on remand included a four-point upward adjustment for disposal without a permit under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Q1.3(b)(4), and a two-point upward adjustment for obstruction of justice as a result of Goldfaden\u2019s prior conduct. The district court sentenced Goldfaden to 33 months imprisonment,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> a $75,000 fine, one year of supervised release, and the mandatory assessment. Once again, Gold-faden timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-11\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b286-12\">Goldfaden now challenges the four-point offense level increase for disposal without a permit and the two-point increase for obstruction of justice resulting from his perjury at the original sentencing proceedings.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and find both of Goldfaden\u2019s claims devoid of merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-13\">1. <em>Discharge Without a Permit</em></p>\n<p id=\"b286-14\">Goldfaden maintains that because Dallas allows sewerage disposal only by trucks with treatment equipment, he could not have obtained a permit and the district court should not have increased his offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>level for failing to secure one.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Goldfaden correctly points out that the upward adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Q1.3(b)(4) applies only where regulations require a permit.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> However, as Goldfaden acknowledges, Dallas allows waste discharge into its sewer system by permit only.. The use of improper equipment does not excuse Goldfaden\u2019s failure to obtain the required permit. This argument founders.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">Goldfaden argues in the alternative that the enhancement for disposal without a permit again punishes conduct accounted for in the base offense level. As we previously have noted, sentencing courts must follow the clear mandate of the Guidelines, even where more than one offense level increase for the same conduct results.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Notwithstanding the Sentencing Commission\u2019s pending proposal for changes to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Q1.3(b)(4) to avoid \u201cdouble counting,\u201d the district court properly followed the clear and compelling language of that section as presently written.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">2. <em>Obstruction of Justice</em></p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">Goldfaden argues that the <em>vacatur </em>of his initial sentence precludes an offense level enhancement on remand for obstruction of justice based on his prior perjured testimony. We do not agree. The vacating of the earlier sentence in no way diminished the fact or impact of Goldfaden\u2019s perjury.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-13\">Goldfaden further contends that because his perjured testimony did not relate to his offense of conviction, it should not cause an offense level increase under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. As Goldfaden notes, the guidelines refer to obstruction of justice \u201cduring the ... sentencing of the <em>instant </em>offense.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Although we previously have recognized that this language may require a link between obstructive conduct and the offense of conviction,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> we have not resolved that question and need not do so now. The district court found that at his original sentencing hearing Goldfaden gave false testimony about the amount of waste involved in the offense to which he pleaded guilty and about his illegal waste disposal on other occasions. Statements at sentencing about the severity of the offense of conviction and similar conduct on other occasions are patently relevant to sentencing. Goldfaden\u2019s perjurious statements fully support the upward adjustment for obstruction of justice.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-14\">The sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b286-8\">.The trial court sentenced Goldfaden under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Q1.2, arriving at a total offense level of 22. That figure included a four-point increase for disposal without a permit under section 2Q1.2(b)(4). In addition, Goldfaden's offense level reflected a two-point increase for obstruction of justice under section 3C1.1 resulting from his attempt to conceal evidence of his wrongdoing from Dallas authorities, as well as the district court's finding that he perjured himself at the sentencing hearing. Goldfaden\u2019s offense level and criminal history category resulted in a guideline sentencing range minimum of 41-months imprisonment. The district court imposed the 36-month maximum dictated by 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1319(c)(2). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b286-15\">. <em>United States v.
