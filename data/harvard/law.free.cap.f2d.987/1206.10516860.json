Ker-shaw, Sr., seek review of RTC\u2019s denial of deposit insurance coverage as to $52,246.49 deposited in a failed savings institution. We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-21\">Petitioners had three certificates of deposit at First Federal Savings and Loan Association of Scotlandville, Louisiana. In the spring of 1990, First Federal\u2019s records indicated the account holders of these certificates as (1) Mr. Kershaw for Mrs. Ker-shaw, Beneficiary; (2) Mrs. Kershaw for Mr. Kershaw, Beneficiary; and (3) Mr. and Mrs. Kershaw. During May 1990, petitioners were contacted by two employees of First Federal, Yvonne Jackson and Henry Stamper. Jackson and Stamper informed petitioners that a portion of their funds might be without adequate deposit insurance protection and advised them to meet with Jackson. Petitioners immediately did so and accepted Jackson\u2019s recommendations for changing their accounts. Petitioners claim that an agent of RTC, then conservator of First Federal, approved these changes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-22\">The first two accounts were changed to denote Mr. \u201cor\u201d Mrs. Kershaw as account holders. One listed Mr. Kershaw\u2019s name before the conjunction; the other listed Mrs. Kershaw\u2019s name first. These two accounts held a total balance of $51,838.96. The third account was changed to denote Mr. \u201cand\u201d Mrs. Kershaw as account holders. It contained $100,407.53. The records on which these name changes were made listed for each account the ownership code 02; 02 indicated joint ownership.</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-23\">First Federal had been placed into RTC conservatorship in March 1989. According to a RTC document, RTC\u2019s managing agent had direct control of all activities and functions of the institution until it was closed. On August 17, 1990, First Federal was declared insolvent and placed in receivership. Soon after, petitioners contacted RTC officials about their accounts. Petitioners were advised that they could not withdraw more than $100,000. On August 27, 1990, petitioners filed a proof of claim seeking to recover $52,246.49, the deposited amount in excess of $100,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-24\">Petitioners\u2019 counsel contacted RTC regarding petitioners\u2019 claim for $52,246.49. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1208\">*1208</page-number>RTC appears initially to have treated their inquiries as requests for dividends due from the proof of claim, rather than as requests for reconsideration of the denial of deposit insurance coverage. Petitioners submitted information to RTC concerning their May 1990 meeting with Jackson, including a statement from Jackson confirming the petitioners\u2019 account of it. After correspondence with petitioners\u2019 counsel and an inquiry by their congressman, RTC officially denied petitioners\u2019 request for reconsideration of the insurance determination by letter dated August 18, 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-3\">RTC\u2019s August 18 decision stated that the three certificates of deposit were \u201cidentically-owned joint accounts\u201d which must be aggregated for insurance purposes, citing 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 330.7. The decision notes petitioners\u2019 contention that First Federal employees gave petitioners advice to the contrary. RTC maintained that it \u201ccannot be bound by representations as to insurance coverage that were contrary to regulations, whether or not members of the public had justifiably relied on such representation.\u201d Petitioners seek review of this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-4\">RTC contests our jurisdiction under 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1821(f)(4), claiming RTC has not made a final determination. RTC notes that, unlike the facts in <em>Nimon v. RTC, </em>975 F.2d 240 (5th Cir.1992), the last notice given by RTC to the petitioners was not denoted its \u201cfinal determination.\u201d Labels are probative, but not dispositive. We find that RTC \u201chas made a \u2018definitive statement of the agency\u2019s position\u2019 that is reviewable under section 1821(f)(4).\u201d <em>Abrams v. FDIC, </em>938 F.2d 22, 25 (2d Cir.1991) (quoting <em>G. &amp; T. Terminal Packaging Co. v. Hawman, </em>870 F.2d 77, 80 (2d Cir.1989)). The finality of agency action is determined by considering the practical effect of the determination. <em>See Hawman, </em>870 F.2d at 79. RTC\u2019s decision in this case was, practically speaking, a final determination of petitioners\u2019 request for insurance coverage. We base this conclusion in part on RTC\u2019s statement, in its brief, that \u201c[tjhere would be nothing gained at this point to require the RTC to submit nor perform any additional activity in this matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-10\">We review RTC deposit insurance determinations under the Administrative Procedures Act and must affirm them unless they are \u201cfound to be arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the law.\u201d <em>Nimon, </em>975 F.2d at 244. In deciding whether RTC\u2019s decision was arbitrary, capricious, or not in accordance with the law, we consider whether the agency followed its governing regulations. <em>Id. </em>at 245.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We give deference to the interpretation of statutes and regulations by the agencies charged with their implementation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1260-11\">Petitioners contend that RTC disregarded its regulations by failing to consider the ownership and capacities in which the three accounts were maintained. The regulations state</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1260-12\">All deposits in an insured depository institution which are maintained in the same right and capacity (by or for the benefit of a particular depositor or depositors) shall be added together and in-sured_ Deposits maintained in different rights and capacities, <em>as recognized under this part, </em>shall be insured separately from each other.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1260-14\">12 C.F.R. \u00a7 330.3(a) (emphasis added). Petitioners argue that an account held in the name of Mr. <em>and </em>Mrs. Depositor is maintained in a different capacity than an account held in the name of Mr. <em>or </em>Mrs. Depositor. Petitioners can point to no support for this contention. Indeed, their brief states that \u201cthere is nothing in the SCR\u2019s [sic] relating to whether or not accounts listed \u2018Mr. or Mrs.\u2019 can be aggregated with accounts listed \u2018Mr. and Mrs.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-15\">The regulations recognize a variety of capacities in which accounts may be maintained: single ownership accounts, joint ownership accounts, accounts held by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1209\">*1209</page-number>agents or guardians, revocable trust accounts, and so forth. Joint accounts are defined as those whose co-owners (1) are natural persons, (2) each of whom has personally signed a signature card, and (3) each of whom possesses withdrawal rights on the same basis. \u00a7 330.7(c). This category includes accounts owned as joint tenancies with rights of survivorship, tenancies in common, and accounts in the names of both spouses containing community property funds. \u00a7 330.7(a). Joint ownership is the only capacity recognized under the regulations which could apply to accounts held by a couple denoted either \u201cMr. and Mrs. Depositor\u201d or \u201cMr. or Mrs. Depositor.\u201d Moreover, both petitioners signed the signature card for each account, and First Federal\u2019s records indicate joint ownership.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-4\">Usually, the presence of two or more signatures on a deposit account signature card is conclusive evidence that an account is jointly owned. \u00a7 330.7(c). This conclusive ownership presumption, however, does not apply to certificates of deposit. <em>See Palermo v. FDIC, </em>981 F.2d 843, 846-47 (5th Cir.1993) (construing \u00a7 330.7(c)). FDIC and RTC must consider extrinsic evidence to determine whether a certificate of deposit is \u201cin fact\u201d jointly owned, if such ownership is disputed. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In <em>Palermo, </em>the petitioner sought separate insurance coverage for a certificate of deposit by claiming that the account was individually owned despite the presence of two signatures on the signature card. <em>Id. </em>at 844. In this case, petitioners have never asserted that the certificates of deposit were not jointly <em>owned; </em>they claim that the certificates are held in different <em>capacities. </em>There is no need here, as there was in <em>Palermo, </em>for a further inquiry into actual ownership.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-5\">Petitioners also contend that RTC reached an erroneous decision because it failed to consider the community property aspects of Louisiana law. All property in the possession of spouses is presumptively community property in which each spouse owns an undivided one-half interest. La. Civ.Code Ann. arts. 2340, 2336 (West 1985). Therefore, petitioners argue, they each had an interest of roughly $75,000,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the regulations ought to be construed in order to protect the interest of each spouse up to $100,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-9\">Petitioners fail to realize that the regulations governing RTC\u2019s determination expressly deal with community property in a different manner. RTC found that petitioners\u2019 accounts were governed by \u00a7 330.7, which provides that joint accounts in the names of both spouses comprised of community property will be insured separately from accounts in the names of either spouse individually. \u00a7 330.7(a); <em>see also </em>\u00a7 330.5(c) (providing that an account in the name of one spouse containing community funds is treated as that spouse\u2019s individual account). In this fashion, a couple such as the petitioners could maintain at least three accounts in one institution, each separately insured up to $100,000: one in each spouse\u2019s individual name and a third in the name of both.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1261-10\">Petitioners maintain that they were justified in relying upon the recommendations of First Federal\u2019s employees\u2014 and, allegedly, the approval of an RTC agent \u2014 when structuring their accounts. Thus, they argue, RTC should have overlooked the faulty form of the May 1990 changes and considered their substance, i.e., petitioners\u2019 intent to structure the accounts so as to provide adequate insurance coverage. RTC must rely upon rights and capacities as they are reflected in a failed institution\u2019s records. <em>Nimon, </em>975 F.2d at 245. Ordinarily, RTC acts neither arbitrarily nor capriciously when it refuses to base its determinations on the subjective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1210\">*1210</page-number>intent of depositors not reflected in the institution\u2019s records. We are not persuaded that petitioners\u2019 detrimental reliance mandates a different conclusion here. RTC\u2019s insurance fund cannot be depleted due to the mistakes of a savings institution\u2019s employees. <em>See Nimon, </em>975 F.2d at 246. Jackson, the First Federal employee, states that a RTC agent approved the account changes, which in light of RTC con-servatorship might have misled petitioners if they were aware of it. Assuming ar-guendo that petitioners relied upon a RTC agent\u2019s assurance of insurability, RTC cannot be bound to a misrepresentation that was contrary to regulations. <em>Federal Crop Ins. Corp. v. Merrill, </em>332 U.S. 380, 68 S.Ct. 1, 92 L.Ed. 10 (1947); <em>see also Mendrala v. Crown Mortgage Co., </em>955 F.2d 1132, 1141 (7th Cir.1992) (Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. cannot be bound by unauthorized actions of its independent servicing agent).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1262-4\">Finally, petitioners\u2019 claim that RTC\u2019s determination violates their due process rights lacks merit. <em>See Nimon, </em>975 F.2d at 247-48.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-5\">The petition for review is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1260-5\">. The regulations currently found in 12 C.F.R. Part 330 became effective July 29, 1990, 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 330.16(a), and so were in effect when First Federal was placed in receivership on August 17, 1990. <em>See Spawn v. Western Bank-Westheimer, </em>925 F.2d 885, 887 n. 1 (5th Cir.1991) (applying pre-FIRREA regulations in effect at time FDIC was appointed receiver).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1261-6\">. <em>Nimon </em>involved money market accounts, not certificates of deposit. <em>See </em>975 F.2d at 242-43.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1261-7\">.
