After reviewing the record de novo, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-14\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-15\">Waggoner, employed by the City in 1987 as a fleet mechanic, was given written notice of his discharge on October 2, 1989. The discharge notice, sent by Benny Hamilton, director of fleet maintenance, set forth in detail that Waggoner was being fired as \u2022a result of sexual harassment claims made by a female co-worker. The discharge notice recounted some of the specific allegations. Hamilton stated that a female employee, Etta Connor, had complained to Denny Phillips, a supervisor, about several incidents involving Waggoner, and that Phillips had reported overhearing Waggoner make several inappropriate comments. Hamilton further stated that he had reviewed the situation and had confirmed that Waggoner had exhibited offensive conduct on more than one occasion. As Wag-goner\u2019s behavior violated the City\u2019s personnel directives, Hamilton concluded that discharge was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-17\">Waggoner pursued an appeal of his termination through City procedures, and sought unemployment benefits from the Texas Employment Commission (TEC). Concluding initially that the City had fired Waggoner for misconduct, the TEC denied benefits to Waggoner. On appeal, however, the TEC Appeals Tribunal reversed the original determination and found that (1) Waggoner had not committed the offensive conduct; (2) Hamilton, Connor, and Phillips had ulterior motives for lying; and (3) Waggoner had been dismissed without cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-18\">Waggoner thereafter filed a charge of age discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), based on the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The EEOC issued a determination in August 1990, finding no evidence that Waggoner\u2019s termination violated the ADEA. The EEOC concluded that Waggoner was discharged for his offensive sexual and racial remarks. Despite the EEOC\u2019s determination, Waggoner filed suit in federal court alleging age discrimination and age-related harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-19\">The district court granted partial summary judgment to the City on Waggoner\u2019s age-related harassment claim as a result of his failure to raise that claim with the EEOC. Subsequently, the City filed a sum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1163\">*1163</page-number>mary judgment motion on Waggoner\u2019s ADEA claim, arguing that his responsive allegations failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact that the City\u2019s proffered explanation for his discharge was pretextual. In opposition to this motion, Waggoner proffered his own affidavit and the affidavit of Allen Howey, a co-worker.</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-4\">In his affidavit, Waggoner: (1) denied the harassment charges; (2) recounted Phillips\u2019 comments that Hamilton disliked Waggoner; and (3) claimed Hamilton had called him \u201can old fart\u201d and had told him that a younger man could do faster work. Waggoner stated his subjective belief that Hamilton wanted to fire him because of his age and, as a result, entered into a conspiracy with Phillips and Connor to fabricate the sexual harassment story. Howey, in his affidavit, testified that six months prior to Waggoner\u2019s discharge, Phillips informed Waggoner that Hamilton disliked and wanted to fire Waggoner. Howey also stated that he had never heard Waggoner make any off-color remarks to his female co-workers. Notably, Howey\u2019s affidavit makes no reference to age, even by implication.</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-5\">In addition to these affidavits, Waggoner submitted the decision of the TEC Appeals Tribunal with the above mentioned findings. Waggoner insisted that these findings, particularly the finding that he had not been discharged for his conduct, created a genuine issue of material fact on the pretext issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-6\">In its consideration of the evidence, the court disregarded Waggoner\u2019s claims that he did not in fact harass Connor, stating that \u201cthe relevant inquiry is whether the decision makers believed at the time of discharge that the employee was guilty of harassment and, if so, whether this belief was the reason for discharge.\u201d In addition, the court declined to consider the TEC decision, as the Texas legislature has provided by statute that such findings are inadmissible in subsequent actions. After excluding this evidence, the court concluded that the only evidence submitted by Waggoner were the statements made by Hamilton that Waggoner was \u201can old fart\u201d and that younger employees could do better and faster work. The court characterized these statements as \u201cstray remarks\u201d that were as a matter of law insufficient to establish age discrimination. Consequently, the court granted the summary judgment motion, and Waggoner timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-14\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-15\">A, <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1215-16\">\u201cWe review a summary judgment de novo, applying the same criteria as the district court.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Summary judgment is appropriate if there is \u201cno genuine issue of material fact and ... the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> An issue is not genuine when there is nothing more than \u201csome metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In sum, \u201c[w]here the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the nonmoving party, there is no \u2018genuine issue for trial.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> When a court excludes evidence from consideration on evidentiary grounds, we review that decision for manifest error.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1215-17\">B. <em>ADEA Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1215-18\">To establish an ADEA claim, a plaintiff must initially create a prima facie case of discrimination by showing that: (1) he was within the protected class; (2) he was qualified for the job in question; and (3) employees outside the protected class <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1164\">*1164</page-number>were treated more favorably.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Once the plaintiff has established a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the employer, who may rebut the presumption of discrimination by articulating \u201c \u2018some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason\u2019 \u201d for the discharge.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> If the employer is able to do so, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff, who must prove at \u201c \u2018a new level of specificity\u2019 that the reasons articulated by the employer are not true reasons but only pretexts.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The plaintiff may satisfy his burden of persuasion \u201ceither directly by persuading the court that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the employer or indirectly by showing that the employer\u2019s proffered explanation is unworthy of credence.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AHAF\">Both the City and the district court assumed, for the purposes of summary judgment only, that Waggoner had established a prima facie case, and that the burden had shifted to the City to articulate a nondiscriminatory reason for Waggoner\u2019s discharge. The City justified the discharge on the basis of the allegations of Waggoner\u2019s sexual harassment of Connor, on its face a legitimate and nondiscriminatory reason. The burden, therefore, returned to Wag-goner to prove that the City\u2019s reason was a pretext for age discrimination. On appeal, Waggoner attempts to demonstrate that there are genuine issues of material fact whether the City\u2019s proffered reason is pre-textual.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-3\">C. <em>Summary Judgment</em></p>\n<p id=\"AChx\">Although summary judgment is not favored in claims of employment discrimination,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> it is nonetheless proper when \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and ... the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In reviewing a motion for summary judgment, the court must draw all inferences in favor of the nonmovant.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> A court may exclude summary judgment evidence from consideration ^ on statutory or evidentiary grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-9\">In viewing Waggoner\u2019s summary judgment evidence, the court declined to consider many of Waggoner\u2019s statements in his affidavit, ruling that they were made without personal knowledge in violation of Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(e). In addition, the court declined to consider the decision of the TEC, which by statute is not admissible in subsequent proceedings. Waggoner takes issue with both of these evidentiary rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-10\">Although Waggoner does not address the court\u2019s ruling that many of the statements contained in his affidavits were made without personal knowledge, he insists that his affidavit presents credibility issues that are inappropriate for summary judgment. We agree with the district court, however, that Waggoner\u2019s statements concerning a conspiracy among Hamilton, Phillips, and Connor is speculation. We have held that a plaintiff\u2019s subjective belief that his discharge was based on age is simply insufficient to establish an ADEA claim.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1216-11\">Waggoner argues more forcefully on the second point, i.e., that the district court erred in excluding the TEC decision, which supports some of Waggoner\u2019s allegations. The court based its exclusion of the TEC decision on article 5221b-9 of the Texas civil statutes,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> which provides that findings of the TEC are inadmissible in subsequent actions. On appeal, Waggoner insists that the TEC findings were admissible because article 5221b-9, which precludes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1165\">*1165</page-number>their use, did not become effective until twenty days <em>after </em>the filing of the instant suit. Application of the statute to the instant case would, in Waggoner\u2019s view, amount to an ex post facto law and an impermissible retroactive application of the law. Waggoner\u2019s argument is unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-4\">In determining whether a statute properly may be applied to actions pending at its passage, the case law recognizes an important dichotomy between substantive statutes\u2014which affect vested rights or impose penalties\u2014and procedural statutes\u2014 \u201cthe mechanism for maintaining a suit ... including] pleading, process, and evidence.\u201d <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> \u201cA procedural statute controls litigation from its effective date, and it may be applied ... to proceedings pending at the time of its enactment.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Article 5221b-9, which limits the evidentiary uses of a TEC decision, is a procedural provision and contains no express provision barring its application to pending cases. Article 5221b-9 is therefore applicable to Waggoner\u2019s claim, and the district court did not err in declining to consider the TEC decision.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1217-5\">Waggoner also challenges the district court\u2019s refusal to consider his evidence regarding the veracity of the underlying charge of sexual harassment. The district court concluded that Waggoner\u2019s guilt or innocence of sexual harassment was largely irrelevant; that the true issue was whether the City believed in good faith that Waggoner had committed the offensive behavior and that Waggoner was discharged for that reason. Waggoner insists this is error, referring to language in prior decisions by this court discussing the veracity of the legitimate non-discriminatory reason advanced to justify the discharge.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Again, Waggoner misses an important distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-6\">In the typical age discrimination claim, the employer\u2019s proffered reason for discharge will rely on the employer\u2019s own evaluation of the employee, e.g., his work performance was unsatisfactory, he was a discipline problem, or another employee was better qualified. In <em>Thornbrough, </em>a case in which the employer justified the employee\u2019s discharge on the basis of qualifications, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1217-14\">Of course the issue in this case is not whether Thornbrough or the retained employees were better qualified. The [employer] is entitled to make that decision for itself. The ADEA was not intended to be a vehicle for judicial second-guessing of business decisions, nor was it intended to transform the courts into personnel managers.... However, if the factfinder determines that [the discharged employee] was clearly better qualified than the employees who were retained, it is entitled to conclude that the [employer\u2019s] articulated reasons are pretexts.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1217-15\">In other discrimination cases, however, the employer begins an investigation and discharges an employee based on complaints lodged by one or more other employees, such as complaints of sexual harassment. In those cases, the validity of the initial complaint is not the central issue, because the ultimate falseness of the complaint proves nothing as to the employer, only as to the complaining employee. The real issue is whether the employer reasonably believed the employee\u2019s allegation and acted on it in good faith, or to the contrary, the employer did not actually believe the co-employee\u2019s allegation but instead used it as a pretext for an otherwise discriminatory dismissal. Thus, the inquiry is limited to whether the employer believed the allegation in good faith and whether the decision to discharge the employee was based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1166\">*1166</page-number>on that belief.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1218-3\">To the extent that Waggoner\u2019s summary judgment evidence relates to his innocence of the sexual harassment charge, it is irrelevant. He must, instead, produce evidence demonstrating that Hamilton .or Phillips did not in good faith believe the allegations, but relied on them in a bad faith pretext to discriminate against him <em>on the basis of his age. </em>Indeed, he alleges that Hamilton and Phillips not only knew the allegations were false, but that in fact they fabricated them for the purpose of discriminating against Waggoner because of his age. He fails, however, to produce any evidence that supports his conclusion-ary allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-4\">Having determined that some of Wag-goner\u2019s evidence is either inadmissible or irrelevant, we are left with only the following allegations to support his claim: First, Waggoner reports that six months prior to his discharge, he was informed (by Phillips) that Hamilton did not like Waggoner and wanted to fire him\u2014a statement supported by the affidavit of his co-worker, Howey; second, Waggoner and Howey testified that Connor repeatedly had attempted to transfer to the day shift, but it was only after Waggoner was fired that she received the coveted transfer (Waggoner\u2019s purely speculative conclusion is that this supports his theory that Connor lied about his conduct and was rewarded by Hamilton and Phillips); and finally, Waggoner recounts Hamilton\u2019s statements that a younger person could do faster work and his reference to Waggoner as an \u201cold fart.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-5\">Only the last statement has any conceivable connection to Waggoner\u2019s age, but, as we have held on several occasions, a mere \u201cstray remark\u201d is insufficient to establish age discrimination.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Moreover, aside from these stray comments, there is no evidence that Hamilton\u2019s dislike of Waggoner was in any way connected to his age.</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-8\">In addition, Waggoner\u2019s belief that Hamilton and Phillips engaged in a conspiracy with Connor to fabricate the sexual harassment claim is mere speculation, insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact. Waggoner\u2019s only support for his theory that the sexual harassment claim was fabricated by Hamilton, Phillips, and Connor is the fact that Connor received a desirable transfer to a different shift the day after Waggoner was fired. This too rises to nothing higher than mere speculation, devoid of the required nexus with Waggoner\u2019s age.</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-9\">In closing, we reiterate that in all of Waggoner\u2019s evidence one important element is absent\u2014a genuine issue of fact that the City\u2019s proffered non-dis\u2019criminatory reason for Waggoner\u2019s discharge was a pretext <em>for age discrimination. </em>Hamilton and Phillips may have disliked Waggoner; they may have even sought to concoct a reason for his discharge. Yet, unless Wag-goner can connect that dislike to his age, there is no genuine issue of material fact regarding age or age based discrimination. As we have held that mere stray remarks, with nothing more, are insufficient to establish a claim of age discrimination, we agree with the district court here that there is no genuine issue of material fact, and that summary judgment is therefore appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1167\">*1167</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1214-20\">. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 621-634.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1215-7\">. <em>Guthrie v.
