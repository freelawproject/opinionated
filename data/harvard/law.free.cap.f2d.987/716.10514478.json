Zweifel seeks enforcement of the mandate we issued in <em>Pelletier v. Zweifel, </em>921 F.2d 1465 (11th Cir.) <em>(Pelletier I), reh\u2019g denied, </em>931 F.2d 901 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 112 S.Ct. 167, 116 L.Ed.2d 131 (1991). This panel affirmed the district court\u2019s dismissal, under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) and 56, of Ronald 0. Pelletier\u2019s claims. <em>Id. </em>at 1495.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We reversed, however, the district court\u2019s decision denying Zweifel relief under Fed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>R.Civ.P. 11,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> concluding that monetary sanctions were in order. <em>Id. </em>at 1521-23. We did so because Pelletier\u2019s claims against Zweifel were utterly baseless. We explained that \u201call of the claims Pelletier made clearly fall below the standard of reasonableness required by Rule 11. While these claims were frivolous when made, they became even more so as discovery proceeded and it became apparent that Pel-letier\u2019s own evidence contradicted his factual allegations_\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1521. We concluded that \u201cPelletier\u2019s complaint had no reasonable factual basis when pled and that Pelletier and [his lawyer, Herbert P.] Schlanger knew this. When they decided to pursue this action despite their knowledge that it was frivolous, they acted in bad faith_\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1515. We remanded the case to the district court, and directed the court</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-7\">to award Zweifel a sum of money [against both Pelletier and Schlanger, jointly and severally] that will compensate him for the attorney\u2019s fees, litigation expenses, and costs he incurred in defending this lawsuit in the district court and in prosecuting his motion for Rule 11 sanctions. Such award shall take into account any fees, expenses, and costs Zweifel may incur, on remand, in obtaining the award.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b769-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 1522.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-9\">Because Pelletier\u2019s appeal was also patently frivolous, we awarded Zweifel, under Fed.R.App.P. 38,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cdouble costs and a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee for opposing Pelle-tier\u2019s appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1523. We directed the district court, on remand, to \u201cdetermine the amount of that fee and give Zweifel judgment for the full amount thereof against Pelletier and Schlanger, jointly and severally.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b769-13\">At the hearing convened to implement <em>Pelletier </em>Fs mandate, Zweifel established that he incurred $282,837.96 in attorney\u2019s fees, litigation expenses, and costs in defending the case in the district court, and $18,318.50 on appeal. Pelletier and Schlan-ger did not challenge the reasonableness of these amounts. Instead, they argued that Zweifel was entitled to recover nothing because he had \u201cincurred\u201d no litigation expenses at all; rather, his insurance company had incurred and paid the expenses. Pelletier and Schlanger supported their argument with the following language (a portion of which we have quoted supra) from <em>Pelletier I: </em>\u201cwith respect to the amount of the sanction, we direct the district court, upon receipt of our mandate, to award Zweifel a sum of money that will compensate him for the attorney\u2019s fees, litigation expenses, and costs <em>he incurred </em>in defending this lawsuit in the district court....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1515 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-14\">This purely semantic argument convinced the district court, and it awarded Zweifel nothing for the litigation expenses that his insurance carrier expended on his behalf in the district court. The court felt that some sanction was warranted under Rule 11, however, and fined Pelletier $25,-000 for his conduct at the trial level. Turning to our direction that it award Zweifel double costs and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees under Fed.R.App.P. 38, the district court awarded Zweifel $18,318.50 ($265.00 in double costs, and $18,053.50 in attorney\u2019s fees) against both Pelletier and Schlanger. Zweifel appeals, and asks us to enforce the <em>Pelletier I </em>mandate with respect to the Rule 11 sanctions; Pelletier and Schlanger <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>cross-appeal and ask us not to enforce the mandate in any respect because Zweifel has \u201cincurred\u201d no litigation expenses in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-3\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">We have in this circuit a well-settled \u201cmandate rule\u201d obligating district courts to adhere closely to the dictates of our opinions. <em>See Barber v. International Bhd. of Boilermakers, </em>841 F.2d 1067, 1070 (11th Cir.1988); <em>Litman v. Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co., </em>825 F.2d 1506, 1511 (11th Cir.1987) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>484 U.S. 1006, 108 S.Ct. 700, 98 L.Ed.2d 652 (1988); <em>Piambino v. Bailey, </em>757 F.2d 1112, 1119 (11th Cir.1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>476 U.S. 1169, 106 S.Ct. 2889, 90 L.Ed.2d 976 (1986); <em>Wheeler v. City of Pleasant Grove, </em>746 F.2d 1437, 1440 &amp; n. 2 (11th Cir.1984); <em>Westbrook v. Zant, </em>743 F.2d 764, 770 (11th Cir.1984); <em>Dorsey v. Continental Casualty Co., </em>730 F.2d 675, 678-79 (11th Cir.1984); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>728 F.2d 1402, 1405-06 (11th Cir.1984); <em>Baumer v. United States, </em>685 F.2d 1318, 1321 (11th Cir.1982).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This rule derives from the law of the ease doctrine, <em>see Litman, </em>825 F.2d at 1511; <em>Piambino, </em>757 F.2d at 1120, and simply means that \u201ca district court is not free to deviate from the appellate court\u2019s mandate.\u201d <em>Barber, </em>841 F.2d at 1070 (quoting <em>Wheeler, </em>746 F.2d at 1440 n. 2). An issue decided by an appellate court must be followed in all subsequent proceedings \u201cunless the presentation of new evidence or an intervening change in the controlling law dictates a different result, or the appellate decision is clearly erroneous and, if implemented, would work a manifest injustice.\u201d <em>Piambino, </em>757 F.2d at 1120.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">We have outlined a district court\u2019s limited role on remand. A district court</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKj\">may not alter, amend, or examine the mandate, or give any further relief or review, but must enter an order in strict compliance with the mandate. The trial court must implement both the letter and the spirit of the mandate, taking into account the appellate court\u2019s opinion, and the circumstances it embraces. Although the trial court is free to address, as a matter of first impression, those issues not disposed of on appeal, it is bound to follow the appellate court\u2019s holdings, both expressed and implied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b770-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 1119 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-9\">Zweifel contends that the district court erred by refusing to follow our mandate that Rule 11 sanctions be imposed against Pelletier and Schlanger for their conduct before the district court. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-10\">We neither intended nor imagined that the district court, whether at Pelletier\u2019s and Schlanger\u2019s urging or on its own initiative, would meticulously parse our opinion, as they have done, to determine the meaning of our mandate. The plain language of our opinion indicates that we considered all of Pelletier\u2019s claims to be utterly baseless and that we intended Pelletier and Schlan-ger to pay all of the attorney\u2019s fees, litigation expenses, and costs incurred to defend against those claims in the district court. <em>See Pelletier I, </em>921 F.2d at 1511, 1515, 1522, 1523. At the very least, the palpable \u201cspirit of the mandate,\u201d <em>Piambino, </em>757 F.2d at 1119, demands this result. The court\u2019s sole task on remand was to determine what the fees, expenses, and costs were. <em>See id. </em>921 F.2d at 1522-23. In refusing to carry out this task, and, in deciding instead to fine Pelletier $25,000, the court abused the limited discretion that our mandate left to it. <em>See Barber, </em>841 F.2d at 1070-71 (prohibiting a district court from addressing the issues to be resolved on remand on a novel theory).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-11\">It is of no moment that Zweifel purchased insurance to cover the expense of defending claims such as those that Pelle-tier brought against him. Pelletier and Schlanger are not entitled to \u201cfree\u201d violations of Rule 11 because of Zweifel\u2019s prudence in investing in insurance coverage. Nor is it of any moment that Zweifel\u2019s insurance carrier has not been made a party in this appeal. Pelletier\u2019s and Schlan-ger\u2019s argument that Zweifel cannot recover what he may have to pay over to the insur-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>anee company in satisfaction of its subro-gation rights is patently frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\">In sum, because Pelletier and Schlanger do not dispute that Zweifel\u2019s defense in the district court cost $282,837.96 in attorney\u2019s fees, litigation expenses, and court costs, there is no reason for further consideration of this matter in the district court. All that remains is the entry of judgment. Accordingly, we direct the district court, upon receipt of our mandate, to enter judgment forthwith for Gary D. Zweifel against Ronald 0. Pelletier and Herbert P. Schlanger, jointly and severally, in the amount of $301,156.46 plus interest from April 10, 1991, the date the <em>Pelletier I </em>mandate issued.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b768-25\">. A detailed exposition of Pelletier\u2019s claims and the facts underpinning them may be found in <em>Pelletier I, </em>921 F.2d at 1470-95.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b769-10\">. Rule 11 provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-11\">The signature of an attorney or party constitutes a certificate by the signer that the signer has read the pleading, motion, or other paper; that to the best of the signer\u2019s knowledge, information, and belief formed after reasonable inquiry it is <em>well grounded in fact </em>and is warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law, <em>and that it is not interposed for any improper purpose, such as to harass </em>or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation.... If a pleading, motion, or other paper is signed in violation of' this rule, the court, upon motion or upon its own initiative, shall impose upon the person who signed it, a represented party, or both, an appropriate sanction....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AnCh\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 11 (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b769-16\">. Fed.R.App.P. 38 provides that \u201d[i]f a court of appeals shall determine that an appeal is frivolous, it may award just damages and single or double costs to the appellee.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b770-6\">. All circuits have this rule. <em>See Litman, </em>825 F.2d at 1511.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b771-16\">. We note that on March 26, 1992, the district court entered judgment for Zweifel against Pel-letier and Schlanger, jointly and severally, in the sum of $43,318.50. That amount is made up of the fine, $25,000, the district court imposed against Pelletier and Schlanger under Fed. R.Civ.P. 11 and the double costs and attorney\u2019s fees, $18,318.50, we directed the court to enter under Fed.R.App.P. 38. For the reasons stated in this opinion, that judgment, to the extent it included the fine, was erroneously entered. We therefore direct the district court to vacate that judgment, noting that the portion representing the Fed.R.App.P. 38 relief will be included in the judgment to be entered pursuant to this mandate.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
