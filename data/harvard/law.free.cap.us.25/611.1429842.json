Unfounded doctrines ought at. once tp be met and put down; and dicta, as well as decisions, that cannot bear examination, ought not to be evaded and permitted to \u25a0 remain on the books to be commented upon, and acquiesced in, by Courts of justice, or to be read and respected by those whose opinions are to be formed upon books. It affords facilities for giving an undue bias to public opinion, and, I will add. of interpolating doctrines which belong not to the law.</p>\n<p id=\"AMB\">There need be no stronger illustration given than this case affords. Here is a libel, <em>in personam, </em>on a contract, in the Admiral\u00ae filed expressly upon the authority of the case of <em>The Geiieral Smith. </em>1 bad never read the report of that cas\u00e9, that 1 recollect, until the argument in this cause; or, if I had, 1 attached so little importance to any thing in it besides the point that it decides, as to have- forgotten that such doctrines were to be found in the reports of our decisions. But, upon being examined, what does it amount to? A genllemau of the bar, whose . knowledge, particularly in the Admiralty, commanded the highest respect in this Court, is reported'to have laid down a doctrine in very explicit terms, which, I will venture to say, has no authority in law ; and the Court, carried away probably by the influence of his concessions, echoes them in terms which are not only not called for by the case, bijt actually, as I conceive', contradicted by the decision which \"is rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">The correctness of the decision in the case of <em>The General Smith, </em>cannot be questioned-; it dismisses the libel upon the ground, \u201c that material men and mechanics, furnishing repairs to a domestic ship, have no particular lien Upon the ship Ifcelt for the recovery of their demands.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b623-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>But why have they no lien upon the ship ? or, to speak more correctly, why are they precluded from a remedy in the Admiralty for subjecting the ship to arrest and sale in order to satisfy their demands ? It is because jurisdiction over the contract has been taken from the Courts of Admiralty, and the exercise of jurisdiction, in such a case, prohibited to them by the common law Courts of Great Britain for hundreds of years. And it is a fact of the most positive certainty and notoriety, that so far from retaining jurisdiction over this contract'?\u00bb <em>personam, </em>after being driven from jurisdiction <em>m </em>rem, that the former was first surrendered, and that in the most unequivocal terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">I refer to the resolutions of February, 1632, adopted d&gt;y the King in council, and subscribed by all the judges in England, and to be found in the collection of the sea laws, and in various other books; by the second section of the second article of which it is declared; that \u201c ifsuit be in the Court of Admiralty for building, or mending, saving, or necessary\u2019 victualing pf a ship, <em>against the ship </em>itself. <em>and not against any party by name, </em>but such as for his interest makes himself party, (i.' e. a claimant,) no prohibition is to-be granted, though this be done wilhin the realm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">This resolution implies an express recognition, that if such suit be instituted against <em>the person, </em>a prohibition shall issue. And this 1 hold to-be the test of admiralty jurisdiction; for wherever a prohibition will issue, the jurisdiction has been taken away from the admiralty, or it never possessed it, And, accordingly, for two hundred years has this jurisdiction been abandoned by the British Courts, with the single exception of seamen\u2019s wages ; an exception, of which it may emphatically be said, \u201c <em>probat regulamP </em>For, if any one will take the trouble to refer to the language of Ch. j.. Holt, in the case of <em>Clay </em>v <em>Snelgrave, </em>he will there find it said, \u201c that it is an ,-indulgence that the Courts at Westminster permit mariners to sue for their wages in the Admiralty Court, because they may all join in suit, aiid is grounded-upon the principle, that <em>i communis error facit jus? </em>\u201d <em>(Lord Raym. </em>576.)</p>\n<p id=\"b623-10\">This privilege is denied to the master, and even toa mate succeeding tp the mgster, when he sties for bis wages as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>master; so rigid are the Courts of Westminster in confining the admiralty to the few contracts over which it is permitted to retain jurisdiction. Arid when it is argued, that this discrimination, to the prejudice of the master, is confined to his.suit <em>in rem. </em>arid that ri\u00f3 case can be found in which his remedy <em>in personam, </em>in the admiralty, has been denied him, it becom- s necessary to remind counsel, that this may haye proceeded from no one\u2019s ever having had the temerity to prefer such a suit \u2014 a consequence which would necessarily follow from what ! hold to be undeniable, that, except on the contract for seamen\u2019s wages, <em>the proceeding inpersonam upon contracts </em>is now. unknown to the British admiralty tribunals.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">I will sketch a brief history of the admiralty jurisdiction over contracts, and a view of its present state.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">The study of the history of,the admua.lty jurisdiction in England, in common with\u2018that of all the. Courts of that kingdom, except the common, law Courts, presents an instructive, lesson on the necessity of. watching the advancement of judicial power, in common with\u2019all power; inasmuch as it showg in what smail-beginn\u00edngs, and by what indirect and covert means, aided by perseverance and ingenuity, originated the mighty structures-against which, ulti-mately, the legislative and judicial power of the country had to exert the full force of their united efforts.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">The vast variety and importance of the subjects, which the admiralty had appropriated to itself, will appear in a. variety of autbyrs; but I would refer the reader to <em>Godolpkiri\u2019s </em>\u201c <em>.View of the Admiral </em>Jurisdiction,\u201d as well for., its antiquity, as the great learning and respectability of the author. There, it will be seen, that the admiralty, before the time\" of Richard 11.. had arrogated to itself a scope of judicial, legislative, and ministerial power, which withdrew from the trial- by jury, and placed under the surveillance of the crown, of which the admiralty was only the representative,' more than half the jurisprudence,'and particularly the commercial jurisprudence of the kingdom.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">. The statutes of 13th and'15th Richard \u00a11. were passed to set limits to this power, but such was the stability-it h\u00e1d already acquired, that it-was not until the act of 2 Henry IV <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>Ci 11 which gave to the subject exactly the right which the Constitution a\u00a7 jthe United States gives to its citizens, against aiiconstitutio\u00edt\u00f3l laws, was passed,.that this overgrown power could\u2019Be effectually restrained. For it could then no Ionger prescribe its own limits in prejudice -of the individual 'and to the exclusion of his common law rights; NeiiRer the King nor his pr\u00f3ct\u00f3r could any longer justify or secure the indi vidual, who resorted to the Admiralty in a casein which the common law could give redress. (3 Levinz. 353.)</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">- The act of 13 Richard says, upon complaint of encroachments made by the admirals and their deputies, it is enacted, \u201c that the admirals and their deputies shall meddle with nothing done within the realm, but only with things done upon the sea;\u201d and the 15th Richard, c. 3. \u201c that in all contracts, pleas, and quarrels, and other things done within the bodies'of counties, by land or water, the admira! shall have no cognizance, but they shall be tried by the law of the land,\u201d And the 2d Henry IV. c. <em>11. </em>provides, \u201cthat he that finds himself aggrieved against the form of the statutes of Richard, shall have his action by writ grounded , upon the case against him that so pursues in the Admiralty, and recover double damages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">The check given by legislative provision was fo lowed up by prohibitions from the common law Courts, and suits under the statute of Henry, until, upon the murmurs of the Lord High Admiral at the checks imposed upon his power; the subject was taken up by the King in council in 1632, and a kind of compromise entered into, to which ail the different tribunals appear to hav\u00e9 at first conformed; but in which, after a time, the common law judges appear to have discovered, that the crown and the Admiralty had gained too decided an advantage over them to admit of its being adhered toas a correct exposition of the statutes of Richard. Hence, in the 3d edition of <em>Crohe's </em>Reports, at the end of the 2d volume, we find these resolutions declared to be of no authority, as undoubtedly they were not, since it was not a regular judicial act. But in this, it must he noticed, that the authority denied to those resolutions was not on the sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number><em>je\u00b0t </em>^lose powers which the Admiralty renounced, but of those which they retained.</p>\n<p id=\"AYdB\">Upon this ground, itis well known, that those resolutions* although printed-ih the 1st and 2d editions of <em>Crolce's Reports, </em>were omitted from the 3d, The mantissa at the end oi the edition of 1767, declares their.rejection as authority. But, even before the adoption of those resolutions, a decision had taken place, which was conclusive, as well against their jurisdiction over the particular contract here under consideration, as against their right of proceeding upon it by process <em>in personam.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">I allude to <em>Craddock's </em>case, (2 <em>Brownl. </em>37.) which was decided in the 7th of James, or in the year 1608, twentyrour years before the date of these resolutions. This was listinctly the case of a materialman; his purchases were of cordage, powder, and shot, for a ship, and the party of whom they were bought sued Craddock in the Court of Admiralty. A prohibition was granted, and the reason assigned by the Court is, that the statute 13 Richard. II. \u201c that the admiral shall not meddle with things made within the realm* but o\u00f1ly of things made upon the sea, and here the contract was at St. Katharine\u2019s Stairs, in the body of a county.\u201d And thus we see, that in the resolutions alluded to, the claim to jurisdiction <em>in personam, </em>denied the Admiralty by the effect of that adjudication, is abandoned by them; at the. same time that they assert the right to exercise jurisdiction <em>in rem </em>upon the same class of contracts. It wa\u00ab not long after; however, that the exercise of jurisdiction <em>in rem </em>was als* taken from them. And yet there is a semblance of authority for their having exercised.it during the interval of time between the adoption of the resolutions.of .1632, and when they were declared to be of no authority. I allude to that quotation from 1 <em>Rolle's </em>Abr. 533. which is copied into <em>Bacon's Abridgment, </em>p. 196. of the 1st vol. and there, together with the note which refers to <em>Cro. Charles, </em>296. has remained the permanent source of many an error to those who have not taken the trouble to examine into the authority for the law there laid down.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">This subject will be found learnedly examined in the cases of <em>Clinton </em>v. <em>The brig Hannah and ship General Knox, </em>de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>\u00abjdfed in the Admiralty by Judge Hopkinson, of Pennsylvama, in the,year 1781 ; and by Judge Bee in the Admiralty of South Carolina, in the case of <em>Shrewsbury </em>v. <em>The sloop Two </em>Friends, in 1786 ; in both which cases the authority of those quotations is rejected, and the lien of the shipwright to sue <em>in rem </em>in the Admiralty denied. <em>(Bee\u2019s Adm. Rep. </em>419. 433.)</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Both those cases go to show the law of this .subject at the adoption of our constitution, and they merit high respect, both for the known abilities of the judges who pronounced, them, and the intrinsic learning they display. They show plainly, that the quotations mentioned rest altogether on the authority of the resolutions of 1632, to which certainly no \u2022 lawyer will attribute authority any farther than they go to show, that the Admiralty did not even then pretend to the jurisdiction <em>in personam </em>upon contracts at all', and upon very few. even <em>in rem.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">It may seem surprising, that from the time of Richard the Second down to the beginning of the 17th century, the jurisdiction of the Admiralty Court should have attracted so little of the attention of the common law Courts. One principal cause will be found in the civil wars, and the low state of commerce; and when the nation returned to a state of tranquillity, the power and vigour of her monarchs left Sittlq scope for legislative or judicial action. Yet there arc cases to show, that the subject was not forgotten; and when the increase of commerce, and the weak reign of the Stew-arts, presented a motive and an opportunity, that the atten\u00ae tion of the nation was attracted to the usurpations and unconstitutional power exercised by that Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">It is obvious, also, from the cases and discussions of that day, that the common law Courts were embarrassed by a technical difficulty, arising out of the necessity of laying a venue to every action. As soon as this was removed, (and the advocates of the Admiralty murmur very much at the supposed absurdity of removing this absurdity,) the progress of the common law Courts was rapid in wresting from the Admiralty every species of contract, leaving them none to act upon, on which they could themselves render complete justice-accordingto,the established rights of t)ie par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>Oes. They are charged ..itith absurdity and inconsistency/ but I pronounce the charge utterly groundless; for the one principle runs through all their decisions, that of subjecting t0 the trial by jury every cause in which that form of trial could be applied without injury to the parties\u2019 rights. It is true, that where'they found them in the exercise of a power analogous to that of a Court of equity, they did not take from Ihe Admiralty a power which they should only have handed over to anothercivil law Court; they had no motive, if they1 had the power, to make the transfer. And hence'the Admiralty is left in the exercise of jurisdiction in cases of hypothecation, bottomry,, and a kind of specific execution between part owners of ships. Their jurisdiction of prize a id salvage are royalties, and ' that over seamen\u2019s wages is a peculiarity, but perfectly reasonable and consistent, in whatever \u00a1ight.it be viewed. In the sea laws it is called \u201c a custom of the realm.\u201d Ch. J. Holt, we have seen, puts it on the ground of a positive concession and <em>communis error. </em>And the judges often say, \u201c <em>w'e permit </em>them to exercise this jurisdiction, because they may sue together there, and must sue sfejerally in the common law Courts, and there they can have remedy upon the body of ,tfie vessel, which they cam not have herethus placing the exception in their favour upon the conceded ground of incapacity in'the common law Courts to do .complete justice, and the equitable ground of preventing a multiplicity of suits.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">My own opinion is, that it stands on a much higher ground., and has its basis in the same policy which makes their wages to depend on the safety of the ship they navigate, by giving them, in that event, every possible chance of getting compensated. To which we may add, that their thoughtless character and ignorance, renders them emphatically the \u2022wards of the Admiralty.'while the law on which they earn or lose their wages is a system of the Admiralty. . The assertion of the general principle against the captain\u2019s contract, finds its solution in his right to receive the freight in preference even to his owner, and thus to pay himself; and in the perfect competence \u00f3f the common law Courts to do justice in his contract with the owner. In the case of ransom, he still may resort to the Admiralty, and proceed <em>in </em>rem.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>But, right or wrong, it is not W be questioned at this day, tnat the Admiralty have lost their jurisdiction over contracts, with the exceptions stated. The most animated advocateS of the Admiralty do not deny. this. They mourn bitterly over its fall, but uniformly acknowledge that they are eulogizing the dead. In <em>Godolphin, </em>Sir <em>Leoline </em>Jenkins\u2019 <em>Works, </em>and the collection of the <em>Sea </em>Laws, will be found all in substance that ev\u00e9r was said on this subject. Yet they all unequivocally acknowledge that its jurisdiction has long since been at an end over contracts, and <em>m personara, </em>with the exceptions I have stated; while they dwell eloquently on the folly of plucking this 4\u2018 diamond from the crown;\u201d and enlarge' greatly on the inconvenience of leaving toa jury the decision of causes which could be' so much more advantageously disposed of by a single Judge, and by a system of laws peculiar to the Admiralty Courts ; and arraign with sev\u00e9rity the inconsistencies, absurdities, and unkindly feelings, with which the common law Courts have stripped the Admiralty of its ancient and eminent power. Even <em>Brown, </em>the modern champion in Europe of the Admiralty jurisdiction, but who obviously has only caught'the fee'ings, and borrowed the arguments of those who .have gone before him, is forced reluctantly to acknowledge that the Admiralty has for ages been stripped of these powers, though be would spare no effort to restore them if he could. (See Appendix to his 2d vol. and note at the end, said to be omitted at p. 100.)</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">\u2022 It has sometimes been contended that the decisions of the common law Courts, as exemplified by their granting prohibitions, is not conclusive against the.Admiralty jurisdiction - \u2014 that it is a disputed jurisdiction, and therefore that the Admiralty judges themselves should be heard in this <em>\u201cLitis Contestation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">But this is obviously incorrect; for'the Coiirt of King\u2019s Bench, by its acknowledged jurisdiction, as exemplified in the very exercise of its power to prohibit, is the very source to which we are to look for lights to determine the respective powers of the inferior Courts. And the decisions that have taken place on this subject, are nothing less than judicial expositions of the statutes which limit the powers of the Admiralty. They amount to the construction and npplica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>t*on ^ie law the reSilm, of the statute law, and ara therefore conclusive. So every lawyer knows' they are held to be in the British Courts; and together, they make up that system of law which, by universal consent, was adopted in the Admiralty Courts in this country before the revolution, at least on the subject of jurisdiction over contracts,#nd in <em>personam. </em>1 will now take a brief view of some of the leading decisions, m England and in this country, on the subject of contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">The quotations I shall first make have two objects in view; first, to show that the particular contracts under consideration, to wit, of material men, have been denied to their.jurisdiction ; and secondly, that,, in every instance in which they have been prohibited from the exercise of jurisdiction over contracts, it has been upon aground that is fatal to the exercise of jurisdiction in this and similar causes.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">On this latter subject it woul.d be unnecessary to search further than that article in the <em>4th Inst. </em>(138.141.) in which Sir Edward Coke gives a detailed account of his own answers to the complaints of the Lord High Admiral to the King,'.against the restraints then recently imposed by the common law Courts upon his jurisdiction. This was early in the reign of James the First; and notwithstanding the revival of the clamours against that learned judge on the same subject^ 1 cannot but express the opinion that it is a calm, dignified, learned, and triumphant answer. The authorities which he cites are valuable fo.r their antiquity, as they show that the Courts in his time were only treading in the steps of those who had preceded them.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">Thus, to prove that charter parties were without their jurisdiction, he cites <em>Hare v.

And thus the common law and the statutes of 13 Rich. 2. chap. 15. 15 Rich. 2. chap. 3. confine and limit their jurisdiction to matters maritime, and such only as are done upon the high sea.\u201d (Chap. 2. p. 35.)</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">I have before cited the case of <em>Craddock, </em>from <em>Brownlow. </em>to show how early the Admiralty was prohibited from exercising jurisdiction, and that <em>in personam, </em>on the contracts of materiaPmen. In a note to <em>Abbot on Shipping, </em>(page 136.) it is asserted that the same is reported in <em>Owen, </em>under the \u2022 title <em>Leigh </em>against <em>Burleigh. </em>But 1 think it clearly a distinct case, as not only the parties but the facts are different . <em>(Owen, </em>122.) but the principle of the decision is the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">In <em>Sheppard\u2019s Abridgment, </em>(vol. 1. p. 125.) is to be found an excellent summary of the ancient Admiralty law; and one article merits notice, as it serves very distinctly to show the true origin of the articles in <em>Rolle </em>and <em>Bacon\u2019s </em>Abridgment, which have been so often relied upon as authority for a contrary doctrine. He quotes 3 <em>Cro. </em>296, 297. for the following doctrine, \u201c that a suit may be in the Admiralty Court for building, saving, amending and victualling of a ship against the ship itself, not <em>against the party, but such as make, themselves for their interest parties,\u201d </em>This is the very lan - <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>guag\u00e9 of the resolutions of 1632, and those are the pages its which they were inserted in the two first editions of Croke, before they were exploded.</p>\n<p id=\"ArS\">Sir Leolihe Jenkins, whose authority certainly no advocate of the Admiralty will deny, acknowledges, in so many words,, that, the Admiralty could not exercise jurisdiction over the contracts of material men. (1 Vol. 83.)</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">That the remedy against the ship itself, has long since been taken away,, is .established by many authorities. In the American edition of <em>Abbott on Shipping, </em>a work entitled to great respect, it is laid down,, in very general terms, \u201c that a shipwright, who has once parted with the possession of a ship, or has worked upon it without taking possession, and a tradesman who has provided ropes, sails, provisions, or other necessaries for a ship, are not, by the law of England, preferred to other creditors, nor have any particular claim or lien upon the ship itself for the recovery of their demands.\u201d (p. 135.)</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">That the author is here speaking of a \u201c claim or lien\u201d in the Admiralty, is fully established by reference to the cases which, he cites and comments upon. The authorities he cites fully bear him out in his doctrine. They are chiefly <em>Hoare v. Clement, </em>2 <em>Show. Justen </em>v. <em>Ballam, </em>2 <em>Lord Raym. </em>805. <em>Watkinson </em>v. Barnardiston, 2 <em>P. Wms. </em>367. And numerous other cases might be cited, both ancient and modern, to the same effect, upon which the doctrine seems fully established in England, that neither shipwrights nor material men can sue in the Admiralty, either <em>in personam </em>or <em>in rein, </em>without express hypothecation, and all assigning the universal reason, that they have, the common law Courts open to them. (See also <em>Bushnel </em>v. <em>Suel, </em>1 <em>Vesey, </em>155.)</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">Some of those loose <em>obiter dicta </em>in which the most eminent and prudent judges sometimes indulge, have been attributed to an eminent English jurist, which have been thought to cast some doubt upon these doctrines in modern times. The facts stand thus : in the 17th Geo. III. Lord Mansfield is reported to have said, in the case of <em>Rich </em>v. <em>Coe, </em>(Cowp. 636.) \u201c that a person who supplies a ship with necessaries, has not only the personal security of the master and owner, but also the security of the specific ship.\u201d And, again1. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>nine years after, he is reported to have repeated the sam\u00e9 \u2022 <em>dictum </em>in the case of <em>Farmer </em>v. Davis, (1 <em>Term Rep. </em>108.) in both instances, however, mere gratis dicta with regard to the points decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">But, in opposition to this, we have the expression of Lord Kenyorf in the case of <em>Westerdell </em>v. Dale, which occurred eleven years after, in which he is reported to have said, that he doubted whether the doctrine had not been too generally laid down by Lord Mansfield, and referred to the authority of some of the old' decisions, which establish the contrary doctrine/ Indeed, when we refer to the language of Lord Mansfield himself, in the case of <em>Welkins </em>v. <em>Carmichael, </em>which occurred only two years after <em>Rich </em>v. Coe, it is difficult to imagine how the same judge could have held such inconsistent doctrines. For there (3 <em>Dougl. </em>101.) he is reported to have decided, \u201c that a carpenter, in parting with his possession, had lost his lien, if he ever had <em>one\u201c </em>that creditors for stores and provisions had no lien,\u201d. <em>\u201c </em>and that work done for a ship in England is supposed to be on the personal credit of the employer, although, <em>in foreign ports, the master might </em>hypothecate.\u201d This is all consistent with the. established doctrines of the English Courts; and the truth is, that if this learned judge had bad the subject fully before him, pn a motion for a prohibition, he would never have confounded the law of other states, or other times, with the cprnmon law of England in his time. To do him justice, what he decides in the last case, should be received as what he meant in the two former.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">In the third American edition of <em>Abbott on Shipping, </em>p&gt; 1B0. I find a note in these words: \u201c It does not appear, that it has ever been held in the Courts of the United States, that shipwrights and furnishers, of supplies in the ports of the United States <em>have not </em>a lien on the ships, or a right to Admiralty process, to recover the amounts due them. The question has not, to my knowledge, arisen in the Supreme Court of the United Slates. But in the District Court of Maryk n 1, after a <em>very [earned </em>discussion, Winchester, Justice, dec ded, that a shipwright, by the maritime laws, has a lien &lt; n the ship for repairs done', and materials found by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>h'irt whde the ship is in a port of the United States.. <em>(Stevens </em>v. <em>The ship Sandwich, </em>1 <em>Peters\u2019 Rep. </em>233. note.) The game opinion was given by Peters, Justice, in Pennsylvania, in <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>The ship </em>New-Jersey, 1 <em>Peters\u2019 Rep. </em>223. (See also, 1 <em>Roll. Abr. </em>533. 1. 15. <em>Cro. Car. </em>296.\")</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">. From this note it appears, that the learned editor, to whom, 1 presume, it is to be attributed, was not aware of the two decisions rendered by Judges Hopkinson and Bee, to which I have above alluded. Both of them will be found directly'in point against the shipwright\u2019s lien, and the research and learning which they display will be found worthy of the high reputation of the judges who rendered them. These cases will also be found interesting, from the circumstance of their containing criticisms upon the-authority of the law upon which, both Judges Peters and Winchester appear to have been misled; I mean the standing quotation from 2 Bacon, with its usual accompaniments from <em>Roll. </em>and <em>Cr. Ch. </em>i. e. <em>Roll. Abr. </em>533. and <em>Cro. Ch. </em>296.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">I, cannot, however, admit, that the decision of Mr. Peter?, in .the case of the <em>Mew-Jersey, </em>is a case in point on the proposed subject. For the question of the Ken of-material men or shipwrights did not there arise. It is only mentioned argdendo, as an apology for making an allowance to the captain out of funds in the registry, for wages paid, and supplies furnished the vessel from his own funds. An allowance, which he at last excuses in a note, by saying, \u201c that it was not opposed,P and for which he might also have plead the high authority of the case of <em>Watkinson </em>v. <em>Barnardiston, </em>(2 <em>P. Wms. </em>367.) in which the same thing was done, and that of <em>The John </em>(3 <em>Rob. </em>288.) But the doctrine laid down as to material men and shipwrights by the learned judge, are gratis dicta, and, as' is fully shown in the &lt;?ase of <em>The General Knox, </em>cannot be sustained by the authority quoted.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">With regard to Judge Winchester\u2019s decision in the c\u00e1se of <em>The, Sandwich, </em>it'cannot be denied that it is directly, in point. But, it is equally true, that -it appeals to no authority that can sustain it. It is not by an exhibition of learning that decisions are to be tested, but by sound conclusions from unquestionable premises. To obstruct our inquiries by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>a battery of cases, or learned and, remote quotations, often obtain from <em>faith </em>concessions that ought tobe yielded only to <em>investigation. </em>I admit, that Judge Winchester\u2019s decision is characterised by learning, but certainly his premises cannot be conceded to him; they are founded in error. His course of .reasoning is this:</p>\n<p id=\"b635-3\">\u201c The constitution of the .United States vests in the United States Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, and that jurisdiction is vested in the District Court.\u201d \u201c In England, (I now quote his words,) where the jealousy of the civil law was most conspicuous; while its authority was opedly denied, the principles of equity derived from that code influenced the decisions of their Courts in as great a degree as . in countries where it was adopted. In all of which, fr.om the books within my power, I can obtain any legal information, every contest or dispute between the owners and .mariners, and the owners and builders, or equippers of a ship for navigation On the sea, is of a maritime nature, and cognizable in the Admiralty.\u201d He then goes on to observe, \u201c that the statutes of 13th and 15th Richard II.' have received a construction Which must, at all times, prohibit their extension to this countryand, Anally, when he comes to state the proposition,- \u201c H\u00e1s a shipwright a lien on the vessel by him repaired for the value of his materials, labour,\u201d &amp;c. ? he says, \u201c to decide thfe question, it is necessary to examine the nature of liens and privileged debts at the civil law and, accordingly, he proceeds to examine what is the law of various countries of the continent, .which are subject to the civil law, and concludes with adopting two propositions, thus: \u201c I am, therefore, of opinion, that a ship-carpenter, by the maritime law, has a lien on the ship for repairs in port; and that the cause being a maritime cause, the Court has a jurisdiction over the person as well as over the ship.\u201d The authorities which he quot\u00e9s are, Zouch, <em>Beawes, Valin, Rolle's Abr. </em>533. and 1st <em>Bacon, </em>178.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">Now, learned as this decision may be, it is obvious that it is but a tissue of errors, since it adopts the civil law as its guide, and the Admiralty law, in the time of its most extravagant pretensions, positively denying the authority of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>statutes of. Richard, and the modifications which they in* troduced into the law maritime.</p>\n<p id=\"AKYT\">The laws of the continent of Europe furnish no authority on this question. Every state has its own laws 6n these contracts, as have most of the States of this Uniop. The. ordinance of Louis XIV. on which Valin comments, is the <em>statute </em>law of France, and expressly vests in its Courts maritime jurisdiction over a variety of contracts. which the common law Court has taken from the jurisdiction of the Admiralty. The question-is not what the civil'law would give, but what remains to the Admiralty of that jurisdiction, which no one denies that it had assumed under the authority of civil law principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">The laws of Oleron, which may be called the statute law of Great Britain in maritime affairs, and whichl jim pleased to find published in Mr. Peters\u2019 first volume, together with PostlethWaite\u2019s Commentaries, give none of these powers \u2018 over contracts' to the Admiralty.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">F think it has been sufficiently shown, and, indeed, in de? ,,nying authority to the British decisions under the statutes of Richard, Judge Winchester mu-ft be held-to. admit,, that the British decisions are contrary to his decision on the lien of the shipwright.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">Mr. <em>Brown, </em>(in his 2d vol. p. 80, 81.) distinctly acknowledges it to be settled, \u201c that no person can sue in the Admiralty for work and labour done in the port before the voyage btegins, or necessaries sold for the ship\u2019s use before she sails, nor even where supplied to a foreign ship lying in a British port.\u201d Where money is lying in the registry, as in the case decided by Judge Peters, there has been a disposition manifested recently, to get over the rigid rule, if there could be found ail excuse for it; but none yet, I believe, h\u00e1s been found, except for money actually expended by the captain, and for which he might have hypothecated. There, perhaps, it may be considered as a <em>quasi </em>hypothecation. (3 <em>Term Rep. </em>323. 2 <em>P. Wms. </em>367. 2 <em>Rob.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">I will now showtbat Judge Winchester is equally unsustained in his other principle,.to wit, that \u201con a maritime contract, 'as a general proposition, the Court of Admiralty hasqurisdiction over the person as well as over the ship.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>I will not refer to the instance of bottomry by the master, because I do not believe that he had in mind that case, but will confine myself, td the distinct proposition, \u201c that in no case of contracts, except that of seamen\u2019s wages, can. the Admiralty proceed <em>in personam\u201d </em>which is the point now before this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">I have referred to the celebrated resolutions of 1632, in which, when the Admiralty were solemnly gathering up and consecrating, as they thought, the remains' of their jurisdiction,, this right is, in express terms, relinquished ; to Sheppard\u2019s Abridgment, in which, at a period long subsequent, such is given as the purport and exposition of' that document; and I have quoted Craddock\u2019s case, and Leigh and Burleigh\u2019s case, in which the Court of Admiralty was expressly prohibited from proceeding <em>in personam </em>in behalf of mkterial men. I should think here 1 have a right to demand, if from the whole library of law books, and God knows we have enough*of them already, \u201c camel loads,\u201d a single attempt tc proceed <em>in personam, </em>upon a contract in the Admiralty, except for seamen\u2019s wages, since the date of the resolutions of 1682, can be extracted. Adjudged cases cannot be found, because, since the antique cases to which I have referred, the right has been abandoned. <em>Dipta </em>enough can be produced, and some of those very modern.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-10\"><em>Godbolt </em>speaks of the process <em>in rem, </em>as the only process issuable in the first instance from the Admiralty, (260.)</p>\n<p id=\"b637-11\">In the edition of <em>Abbott, </em>which I have quoted, in a note upon the case of <em>Hoare </em>v. <em>Clement, </em>(p. 136.) a case arising on a contract for necessaries, it is admitted, \u201c that the Court of Admiralty had no. jurisdiction over the person in that case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b637-12\">In <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Shippen, </em>(2 <em>Salk. </em>983.) in which a libel was filed against, ship and owners, on an hypothecation for money borrowed abroad on her voyage, it-was argued that, if suit lay against the owners at all, it lay at common law, and a pro libition was granted as to the suit against the owners, but refused as to the vessel,</p>\n<p id=\"b637-13\">In <em>Bull </em>v. Trelawney, (16 <em>Ch. </em>1.) Trelawney had sued In the Admiralty on a foreign contract, <em>in personam; </em>obtained judgment, and Bull was in gaol. The latter brought his ac-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>ii\u00b0n under the stat. 2 <em>Hen. VI. </em>c. 11. recovered double damages, and was discharged on habeas corpus, on the ground 0f being in confinement in a cause \u201c <em>coram non judice.'l% (Cro. Ch. </em>603. and 3 <em>Lord Raym. </em>982.)</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">Brown, (2 vol. 100.) lays down the rule in these terms; <em>\u201c </em>The general rule, however, at present, is, that the Admiralty acts only <em>in </em>rem, and that no person can be subject, to that jurisdiction but by his consent, expressed by his entering into a stipulation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">And even this mode of subjecting the person, through the medium of a stipulation, it is well known, was itself resisted at first, and acquiesced in only on the ground of its being an indispensable incident to the. exercise of the jurisdiction in <em>rem.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">In <em>Keble\u2019s Reports, </em>(p. 500.) quoted by <em>Brown, </em>it is expressly said, \u201c that without a stipulation,'the Admiralty has no jurisdiction at all over the person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">In the case <em>of Ousten v. Hebden, </em>(1 <em>Wils. </em>101.) where one libelled in the Admiralty, to compel his part owner in a ship to join in a sale, a prohibition was granted, upon the ground that this was in fact an attempt to exercise a jurisdiction <em>in personam.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">There is a class of cases which may appear, at first view, to maintain a contrary doctrine, but which, upon examination, will be found consistent with the general principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-9\">The case of <em>Manro </em>v. Almeida, decided in this Court, was one'of that description. They are cases in which the Admiralty proceeds <em>quasi in rem, </em>when the subject of the suit is withdrawn from its jurisdiction. These cases proceed upon the supposed contempt in withdrawing the <em>res subjecta </em>from the. process <em>in rem. </em>This was the case of <em>Smart </em>v. <em>Wolf, </em>(3 <em>Term Rep. </em>323.) in which the prize Court had improvidently ordered (he cargo <em>of </em>the captured vessel to be delivered .to the captors, reserving the question of freight, but without taking a stipulation bond, in a sum equal to what afterwards appeared due for freight. A monition from thej Admiralty was sued out to the captor\u2019s hgeni, to respond ter the captain\u2019s demand for-frgight, to the full amount decreed to him; arid against this proceeding, the Court of' King's Bench refused a prohibition.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>Here the prize Court acted upon a <em>quasi </em>hypothecation of thetgoods for the freight, resulting from their reserving the question of freight 5 and considered the captors in the light either oftheir own bailee of the goods, or in his original relation of captor, against whom, if the goods are not returned on monition, the Court proceeds as on contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">In <em>Manro v. Almeida, (10 Wheat. Rep. </em>472.) the libellant claimed redress against a foreign captor, in a cause peculiarly of Admiralty jurisdiction. The captain of a foreign privateer had, on the ocean, seized a sum of money in dollars, the property of the libellant, which the libellant alleged had been piratically taken; and finding property of the captor here, sued out process against the captor for the purpose of examining before the Admiralty the correctness of the seizure, and obtaining indemnity for it. The principal question considered in 'that case, arose on the form of proceeding ; but the object was the prosecution of a suit <em>in rem, </em>to wit, to obtain restitution of the $5,000 seized by Almeida on the ocean; as prize.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">A ease very similar to this is to be found in a note to the ease of <em>Smart </em>v. <em>Wolf, </em>in which the Admiralty proceeded1 against the agents of a captor to subject to its jurisdiction a sum of money, that had been taken out of a prize, and passed infiy acc\u00f3unt between the agent and his principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">. On the cases of this class, two remarks will always hold good. 1st, They are instances in which the Court of Admiralty had jurisdiction of the principal question, not contracts, \u2022but maritime torts and prize causes, or their incidents; and, 2dly, that the process <em>in personam </em>is only the means to get possession of the <em>res subject a ; </em>that is, of exercising an unquestionable jurisdiction <em>in rem. </em>\u00b0</p>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">We sometimes hear of a concurrent jurisdiction between the Admiralty and common law. Courts. But, on the subject of contracts, which is the subject now under consideration, I deny that, with the exception of seamen\u2019s wages, buy such concurrent jurisdiction can exist. It is an absurdity in terms, for the rule which goes through all the cases, is in direct hostility with it. If the common law can try the cause, .and give full redress, that alone lakes away the Admiralty jurisdiction. This is the principle on which the decisions rest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>^om the remotest periods. The contract of bottomry is sometimes cited as an instance of concurrent jurisdiction. gut jg a mistake, and an instance cannot be cited, better . to illus.tr rte the true doctrine on this subject, than this species of contract. If executed by. the master, jurisdiction of it is exclusive in the Admiralty, because it gives remedy only <em>in rem. </em>But if executed by the owner, it becomes also a personal contract. Yet who ever heard of a remedy upon it as such, any where but in a common law Court, or a Court of equity ? The contract of <em>respondentia, </em>which is as much a maritime contract as bottomry, gives no jurisdiction jto the Admiralty either <em>in rem </em>or <em>personam. </em>(2 <em>Brown, </em>196, 197. and 4 <em>East. </em>p. 319.)</p>\n<p id=\"AV7\">The case <em>of Menetone </em>v. <em>Gibbons, </em>(3 <em>Term Rep. </em>267.) has nothing new in it; it is a recognition of doctrines as old as the hills. The question was, whether an hypothecation was taken out of the Admiralty jurisdiction, because it was, in that instance, a sealed instrument. The general jurisdiction of the Admiralty to proceed <em>in rem </em>on a bottomry bond, was not denied. The Court explicitly acknowledge the doctrine, \u201c that if the cotnmon law can try the cause, the Admiralty shall not, and affirm the jurisdiction of the Admiralty merely on the ground, that there wa9 no action against the party at common law, and the common, law Courts could not proceed <em>in rem </em>under the hypothecation.\u201d. As to the rule there . laid down, \u201cthat the jurisdiction of the Admiralty shall be adjudged <em>secundum subjectam </em>mate<em>riam, </em>it is as ancient as <em>Bridgands </em>case, in.\u00b1he time, of Hobart. But this decision is of importance here in twppointp of view; since the Court reason upon the principle throughout, that the Admiralty jurisdiction is to be tested by the common law remedy, and the grant of prohibitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">There was a case decided in this Co\u00fcrt in the year .1824, which merits some attention. I mean the case <em>of The St. Jago de.- Cuba </em>; in-which the Court, at first view, would seem to have given a decision in favour of the claims of materia) men upon, a foreign ship, in a case where no actual .hypothecation had been executed. But there are several considerations from which it will-app.ear, that the Court did not commit itself on that subject. The most material is, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>{hat,th^ q\u00fcestio\u00fc arose upon the application of money in the registry of the Court, arising from the sale of th\u00e9 vesBel for another chuse. And, in such instances, it will be seen from several eases, s\u00f3m\u00e9 of which have been, noticed in the course of this discussion, that the Court may act towards creditors as if that had been done which might lawfully have been done in their favour. And there is a peculiar propriety in doing this, when the. Court, by selling the vessel, has put it out of the'power of the captain to give that security to creditors which it is reasonable to suppose would hav\u00e9 been given, where the. captain had no other means of getting advances made of money or materials. Several cases have been noticed of the captain himself having the benefits of an actual hypothecation extended to him when he expends his own money where he might have raised it on bottomry, and the proceeds of the vessel are in the registry of the Court. Yet this has been severely questioned in the British Courts. (9 <em>East, </em>426.) Attention to the language of the Court, also, will show, that they have been guarded on this subject.</p>\n<p id=\"AHAB\">The questi\u00f3n whieh the Court is examining is, not wh\u00e9* ther the lien of a material man attaches independently of an aetual hypothecation, but whether, if the master has exercised this \u201c power of pledging or. subjecting the vessel to material men,\u201d \u2019the forfeiture to the government, without notice, would supersede their rights. And, although speaking of implied liens, Whether the material man here retained his supposed lien on the money in the registry, was distinctly the question, and the language of the Court ought not to have ally other effect given to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">Yet, I am free to confess, individually, that itja case in which an hypothecation would be so clearly valid and legal, if actual!^ made, 1 should want nothing, but authority to. induce me to sustain such a claim against the vessel; with regard to money in the registry, I think this case is authority for sustaining it, and that it is sanctioned by other authorities. (Vide case of <em>The New-Jersey </em>and <em>the John, 3 Rob. </em>288.)</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">Mr. <em>Brown </em>(2d vol. p. 100.) has thought proper to charge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>the common law Courts with having \u201c involved the subject we are now- upon in endless confusion.\u2019\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b642-3\">To me it appears, that, the charge may more correctly be. toiadfe up,on those who have engaged, like himself, with so much zeal, in an effort to shake the authority of a course o\u00ed* decisions that are uniform and consistent, and with one single exception, (which exception is- acknowledged as arbitrary, or positive law,) reducible to a single principle-^-a principle altogether fatal to this action in its origin, since there can be no question that the party here had his common law remedy\u00bb.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">And. I consider the effort particularly ungracious in' an author who is driven to acknowledge its futility so often 5 one who confesses, in so many words,</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">\u201c That if the parties hav\u00e9 bound themselves to answer personally, the Admiralty .cannot take cognizance of the question.\u201d (vol. 2\u00bb p. 101.)</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">\u201c That the Admiralty has, in a great measure, (he should have said, altogether,) dropped its claim, to taking cognisance of charter-party, freight, and suits by- material men, end almost all other proceedings upon contract, except those, for recovery, of seamen\u2019s wages, or enforcing bottomry bonds.\u201d (p. 103\u00bb)</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">\u201c That the Admiralty is excluded from jurisdiction of contracts if personal, <em>or </em>sealed, or made on land.\u201d (p. 107.)</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">\u201c That the jurisdiction of the Instance Court of Admiralty, which is at present <em>seemingly </em>(he should have said actually) allowed by. the law Courts, is, that it. is confined, <em>in matters of contract, </em>to suits for seamen\u2019s wages, or those on hypothecations; in matters of tort, to actions for assault, collision, and spoil; and in <em>quasi </em>contracts, to actions by part owners for security, and actions of salvage.\u201d (p. 122.)</p>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">\u201c That the contract of insurance is, in practice, uniformly and decidedly out of the cognizance of the Admiralty.\u201d (p. 188.)</p>\n<p id=\"b642-11\">And, finally, to acknowledge, in the last page of his book, among his <em>errata et omissa.;</em></p>\n<p id=\"b642-12\">\u201c That personal contracts are held not to be cognizable in the Admiralty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b642-13\">It has sometimes been said, that this is a disputed juris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>diction ; but by whom is it disputed ? Not by the Courts of-Great Britain; for, in all their Courts, as well of common of civil law, when called distinctly to act upon the juris, diction of the Admiralty, there is no dispute, np contrariety of opinion; they all \u00e1re governed by the same rules of de, cisi\u00f3n. From time to time, some extravagant admirer of Admiralty jurisdiction, or royal prerogative, has risen up in England, who has revived the an'crent murmurs uttered by the friends of that Court, when reluctantly putting pt\u00a3 its usurped powers ; but, with that exception, I know of po' part of the English law that seems more clearly fixed th\u00e1b that of the Admiralty jurisdiction. The misfortune is, that people will not bg content to leave it as \u2022\u2022 they find it, but employ themselves in efforts to revive what they cannot but acknowledge has been long since extinct. If the learning upon this subject should appear remote and antiquated, }et it be remembered, that the law has been fixed in England for two centuries. And since the futile attemptof Sir <em>I, Jenkins to </em>revive it, UP one, 1 believe, hptii Air, <em>Brgpp </em>ap, peered before the public, had made any attempt to change the law of the Admiralty in that kingdom.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">I have felt, it my duty to pay some attention t\u00a9 the subject for seyeral reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">In the first place, I rit\u00e1nd before the public as bearing pay. share of the responsibility incurred for. certain opinions ex&gt; pressed in the case of <em>The General Smith. </em>For the jUstpx, tent \u00f3f my responsibility in that case, I must rely on .the re, .peated decisions which <em>J </em>have made in my circuit in bosti, lity with that doctrine. But I 'ant willing to treat it as my own error, and shall, on that ground, claim the privilege pf treating it with the greater freedom; at least 1 shajl ppdea, vour to administer the antidote if I have diffused the poi, son, and claim credit for an unequivocal proof of my re, pentance by a public acknowledgment that it was inexcu, sable.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">1 will now examine that case upon its authorities and its consistency with itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-10\">The case of <em>The General Smith </em>was a case pf the most px, travagant attempt ever made to enforce this supposed lien of material men.- It serves to show to what embarrassments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>the commercial world might be exposed by pushing these maritime liens to excess. Since, upon the same principle on which the libel was mere filed, however long the time that had elapsed, whatever number of voyages the vessel had made; and whatever changes of\u2022 property she might have passed through, she would still have remained liable to material men. For, in that instance, the General Smith had made a voyage, and the property of her been changed, before the libel was filed. She was admitted, too, to be an American ship, in her home port. The Court below very properly dismissed the libel, and this Court did not hesitate to affirm the dismission; and, confined to its just import, as an adjudication, it is most unquestionably correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-3\">No mart will subscribe more implicitly than myself, to the authority of decisions in this Court; and I am ready at all imes to adhefe to the principles necessarily deducible from, or conducing to . such decisions. But farther than this no judge is bound to subscribe to authority, for no other Subjects \u25a0are considered \u00e1nd adjudicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">But the report informs us, that Mr. Pinkney, who argued against the material men, \u201c admitted the general jurisdiction of the District Court as an Instance Court of Admiralty over suits by material men in <em>personam </em>and <em>in rem, </em>but denied that a suit could be maintained in the present case, because the parties had no specific lien upon the ship for supplies \u2022furnished in the port to which she belonged. That in the case of materials furnished or repairs done to a foreign ship, the maritime law has given such a lien, which may be enforced by a suit in the Admiralty. But in the case of a domestic ship, it was long since .settled by the most solemn adjudications of the common law, (which was the law of Maryland,) that mechanics have no lien upon the ship itself for their demands, but must look to the personal security of the owner.\u201d (4 <em>Wheat. Rep. </em>441, 442.)</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Now 1 have too high an opinion of Mr. Pinkney\u2019s law-reading, and of his talents as an advocate, no,t to be well convinced that in this, as well as the residue of the argument attributed to him, he must have been misunderstood. And I find my sanction for this belief upon the face of the report itself; for. with the exception of the nullity of the. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>lien claimed against a domestic ship, the authority which he quotes to sustain his doctrine, contradicts it in so many words.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-3\">His quotations are <em>Abbott on Ship. </em>pt. 2. ch. 3 sec. 9 to 13, and the case of <em>The Levi Dearborne, </em>(4 <em>Hall's Am. L. J. </em>97.) The last quotation was a case of material men suing <em>in Ttm </em>in a home port, and was in point. Rut the quotation from Abbott was no other than the very passage on which I have before commented, and which, although commencing with stating the doctrines ascribed to Mr. P. as prevailing on the continent of Europe, shows most distinctly that the law is otherwise in England. Mr. P. never would have quoted, to support such doctrines, an author who has- been shown to assert \u201c that a shipwright, who has once parted with a ship, or-has worked upon it without taking possession, and a tradesman who has provided ropes, sails, provisions, or other necessaries for the ship, (i. e. material men,) are . not by the law of England preferred to other creditors, nor have any particular claim dr lien upon the ship itself, for the recovery of their demands.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">Mr. Pinkney\u2019s quotation from Abbott comprises, and ig limited to the sections that are occupied in maintaining ttie doctrine thus laid down by the author, and in showing, expressly, that it extends to a foreign as well as a domestic ship. In section 10, the author cites <em>Justin </em>v. <em>Ballam, </em>(2 <em>Lord Raym. </em>805.) which he considers as conclusive against the foreign ship. The distinction taken, is not between a domestic and foreign ship, but between a ship \u201c on her voy age and absent from her owner, and one in her home port.\u201d And,eveu ih that case, the law, as laid do.vri by the learned an notator to Abbott, in a note to the 8th section, upon 9 <em>East, </em>426. in the language of Lord Ellenborough, is, \u201c that the master <em>may hypothecate, </em>not that the hypothecation attaches <em>per sc </em>on the contract for necessaries.\u201d It is true, he cites Judge Peters\u2019 decision in the case of <em>The New-Jersey, </em>for a contrary doctrine; but he seems not to have adverted to the distinction recently admitted between distributing money in the registry, which is Judge Peters\u2019 case, and that of arresting the vessel and subjecting her to sale. Nor has he adverted to the fact, that Judge Peters places his derision on theautho<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>\u00aeRy of the English cases, which the text of Abbott alone will snow are directly hostile to it. To whir-h may be added, tha.t even Judge Peters does not countenance the doctrine of a right ofproce\u00e9ding <em>m personam, </em>attributed to Mr. Pinkney. But this, also, when we find the rest of his reported argument So.clearly a mistake, we have good reason for hesitating to ascribe to him. And the rather, for that, so well read a lawyer would not have advanced so bold a doctrin\u00e9, without attempting to find some shadow of authority for it. Even Mr. Winder, who argued against Mr. Pinkney, does not venture to put his case upon the taw of England, but relies upon the law of the continent, and insists on a right arbitrarily to adopt it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">Mr. Winder quotes Judge Winchester\u2019s decision, and the case of <em>De Lovio </em>v. <em>Boit, </em>from 2 Gallison, 400. But Judge Winchester affords no authority, since he decides on grounds which 1 have shown to be altogether heterodo'x or exploded-</p>\n<p id=\"Abc\">With whom the idea originated, that the Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction vested by the constitution in the United States, was that which the Admiralty possessed or pretended to, before the. time of Richard 11., I am at a loss to conceive. Judges Hopkinson, Bee, and Peters, all distinguished revolutionary men, educated before the revolution, and deeply engaged in public life until long after the constitution, concurred in fixing the period of the revolution for the laXv of the jurisdiction of the Admiralty. And who can doubt that the doctrine of that day was, that the jurisdiction anciently claimed by that Court, was.founded in usurpation, The acts of Richard expressly declare it; that 'of Henry treated it as vain and void ; and such all history proves it. Yet it is only by goiug back to those early times, thatshadow of, authority Can be found Ibr the pretensions which it seems disposed to put forth in our day.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Of-the case m 2 <em>Gallison, </em>1 will only remark, that it was a decision in the first circuit, in which the right to proceed <em>in personam </em>in tjne Admiralty was asserted, in a suit upon a polio* of insurance; and if the nisi prlus decisions of the judge\u00bb of this Court are of any authority here, it is only necesaarv to Observe, that a contrary decision has been rendered ia the sixth Circuit. Let them, therefore* fell toge* <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>th\u00e9r 5 and let tne question be tested upon principle arid authority, independent of those decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">I now come to the consistency of the.opinion of the Court in <em>Thi General </em>Smith, with itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">That decision is, that the common law is the law of Maryland with regard to the rights of material men, and that it ills long since been settled that they have no remedy <em>in rem. </em>But the opinion is introduced with a <em>dictum </em>purporting, that had they sued in the Admiralty <em>in personam, </em>there would have been no doubt of their right to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">And here the question is, whether there can be found any where in the books, a case in. which ah action <em>in personam </em>could be maintained in the Admiralty, wherein the action <em>in rem </em>was denied to that Court. No such cas.e can be found; and the reasbn. is obvious; that right alone would take away the Admiralty jurisdiction altogether, since it would follow, that the right might be pursued at the common law ; the \u00abas\u00e9 of Seamen\u2019s wages always excepted, which I regard as positive law, and. which, indeed, has been supposed by some to be retained by the Admiralty, under the authority giveo that Court by a statute of one of the Henrys, to Control mitrriners in regard to . the amount of their wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">Let the cases be searched from the remotest period down to the time of <em>Menetone </em>v. <em>Gibbons, </em>and the ground of prohibition, and of recovery, ui?iW the 2d of Henry IV. win uniformly be found to be.the competency of ihe common law to enforce the contract. This is the principle by which even their jurisdiction <em>iri </em>rem is controlled, and hence it follows, that in no case- in which they are prohibited from proceeding <em>in </em>rem, can they have the action <em>i\u00f1 personam.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">I consider the decision, therefore, iri th\u00e9 cage of <em>The General </em>Smith; as conclusive against the doctrine- which as* serts the right of material men to proceed <em>in Mrsonam, </em>and upon the authority of which th\u00e9 prfeseptBuit is\u00a1avowedly instituted. At least, a\u00a3 there - is no authority given for it by the Court, we may conclude, that it has no better authdrity than that on which wc are given to understand Mr. Pinkney relied for the same dectrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">I have now said a great deal on this subject, ano I could not have 6aid less, and discharged the duty which I feel that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>I to the community. I am fortifying a weak point in the wall-of th\u00e9 constitution. Every advance of the Adinira|ty js a victory over the common law ; a conquest gained upon the trial by jury. The principles upon which alone this suit could have been maintained, are equally applicable to one half.the commercial contracts between citizen and citizen. Once establish the rights here claimed, and it may bring back with it all the Admiralty usurpations of the fifteenth century. In England there exists a controlling power, but here there is none. Congress has, indeed, given a power to issue prohibitions to \u00e1 District Court, when transcending the limits of the Admiralty jurisdiction. But who is to issue a prohibition to uS, if we should ever be affected with a,partiality for that jurisdiction ?</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">I, therefore, hold, that w\u00e9 are under a peculiar obligation to restrain the Admiralty jurisdiction within its proper limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">That in case of contracts it has no jurisdiction at all <em>in personam, </em>except as incident to the exercise of its jurisdiction <em>m rem.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">That with regard to the contracts of shipwrights and material men in her home port, the vessel cannot be subjected, imless by express hypothecation by the owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">That <em>on </em>her voyage, and where the master is destitute of other means of- raising the necessary funds, she may be so subjected by the master, but it must be'by actual hypothecation.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">But that wlien the shjp has been sold for other claims, and the money in the registry, so that the master no longer has. it in his power to raise money on her bottom to satisfy demands which have been legally incurred, cases may arise in which the claims of material men and shipwrights, and of the master himself, may be sustained, without actual hypothecation.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">Decree affirmed.<footnotemark>a</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>given in tlie third volume of this work, of .Mr. <em>Pinkney's </em>argument in the case of <em>The General Smith. </em>Whether the Editor was'so unfort\u00fanate as to misunderstand the argument of that truly learned person, he is willing should be'determined by the test proposed in the above opinion. No other reason is there given for questioning the accuracy of the report, than that Mr. Pinkney was too well read-a lawyer* and too able, an advocate, to have urged an argument which is contradicted by the authorities -hei cites in its support. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">This argument includes the following positions: .</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">1. An admission of \u201c the general jurisdiction of the Admiralty over suits by material men <em>in personam </em>and <em>in rem.\"</em></p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">All that is necessary to remark upon this passage is, that it was superfluous for Mr. P. .to cite any authority for a concession voluntarily made by him, <em>argumenti gratia, </em>and it does not appear that the' authorities subsequently referred to in the margin were intended for that purpose. On this occasion, as on many other occasions, he probably spoke from the fulness of his learning, and with a confidence&gt; inspired by his well grounded reliance upon its accuracy</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">2. That no \u201c suit could be maintained in the present case, be-, cause the parties had no specific lien upon the ship <em>for supplies furnished in the port to which she belonged.\"</em></p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">This is admitted to be an exception to the sweeping denunciation ..against the applicability to the argument of the authorities cited in its support- The authorities'cited are, \u201c <em>Abbott on Shipp, </em>pt. 2. ch. 3. s. 9\u201413. and the cases there cited. Woodruff <em>et al. </em>v. The Levi Dearborne, 4 <em>Hall's Am. Law Journ. </em>97.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b649-10\">S. \u201c That in the case of materials furnished, or repairs donp to a <em>foreign ship, </em>the maritime law has given such a lien, which may be enforced in the Admiralty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b649-11\">The passage cited from the text of <em>Abbott, </em>(s. 9.) show's, that by \u201c the maritime law\u201d of all Europe, England only excepted, material men have such a lien, which may be enforced in rile Admiralty. Such was the law of Rome, and such is the law of all the maritime countries of the European continent. Such, too, was the law of Scotland, until it was recently altered by a decision \u201c founded principally, as it seems, upon a desire to render the law of Scotland conformable to the law of England upon this subject.\u201d <em>(Abbott, </em>pt. 2, ch. 3. s. 14. p. 142 ) How far the limits prescribed to the jurisdiction of the Admiralty in England over maritime contracts, by the decisions of the common law Courts, after ages of controversy, had been adopted in this country before the revolutio. and how far the grant of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction in the constitution of the United States is to be construed with, reference to those decisions, are questions foreign to the purpose of this .note The only question here is, whether Mr. Pinkney was warranted in quoting this passage, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>\u201candvthe cases there-cited,\u201d a* an authority, for the position, that <em>\u201c the maritime law </em>has given such a lien, which may be enforced in the Admiralty.\u201d The question is not whether the authority is con-elusive to support the position ; but whether it is sufficiently pertinent t0 ren(jer jt probable that it w\u00e1s actually referred to for that purpose. It may be, that there is, as is contended in the above opinion, some discrepancy among the decisions of the Admiralty judges in this country on the subject; but still the cases collected in a note to the American edition of <em>Abbott, </em>(p. 160.) .are believed to be sufficient to rescue the argument attributed to Mr. Pinkney from the imputation of being directly contradicted by the authorities quoted to sustain it. The case of <em>The LeviHearbome, </em>determined by Mr. Justice Johnson in the Circuit' Court of Georgia, is also quoted by Mr. Pinkney for the same' purpose. That \u201c this quotation was in point,\u201d will appear by the following extract from the opinion of the learned judge, as we find it reported by Mr. <em>Hall. </em>\u201c The lien on vessels for material men and shipwrights, exists only <em>in a foreign port, </em>Where the owner is present and resident, the common law principle must govern. In such case, no lien on the vessel is created. In the case of the owner, who, though present when the work and materials are furnished, is transient and non-resid\u00e9nt, I am disposed to think otherwise, <em>and that ip. such case the lien attaches. </em>It is proper \u2022also to state, what shall be deemed a foreign,, and what a domestic port, as to this question: <em>the sea ports of the different States ought, in this respect, to be considered as foreign ports in relation to each other. </em>Charleston, for instance, is a foreign port, as to a claim of this nature made in Savannah.\u201d <em>4 Hall\u2019s Law Jmm. </em>101.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">4. That' \u201c in the case of a domestic ship, it was long since - settled by the most solemn adjudications <em>of the common law, </em>(which was the law of Maryland,) that, mechanics have no lien upon the. ship itself for their demands, but must look to the personal security of the owner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">This position is not denied to he supported by the authorities said to have been quoted by Mr. Pinkney ; but the error imputed to the report consists in the asserted liability of a foreign ship to such a lien, which (as it has-been seen) is recognised and enforced by the general maritime law, and which appears also to-have been maintained by several Admiralty judges in this country, and especially by Mr. Justice Johnson, although it may not have been adopted by the peculiar law of England.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">In making these remarks, the Editor has certainly not been influenced by any feelings of disrespect towards the learned judge by whom the above opinion was delivered, nor even by a desire to controvert the peculiar doctrines maintained, in that opinion. It is his own character for accuracy and integrity as the Reporter of- the decisions of this Court which the Editor feels to be assailed, and, there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>fore, seeks to vindicate. It is a duty which he owes to the Court, to the profession, and to his own reputation, to maintain the fidelity of the Reports, which are' received as authentic evidence of the proceedings and adjudications of this high tribunal. If they are not to be relied on in this respect, they are worthless. In closing his labours, the Editor has the consolation of reflecting, that it has been his humble aim to do justice to the learning and talents of the bar, and to uphold the honour and dignity of the bench. How far he has succeeded in this attempt, it does not become him to speak; but he is willing to submit to the impartial judgment of his professional bre- . thren, whether the above accusation is supported by evidence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"a\">\n<p id=\"b648-10\"> The Editor of these Reports feels it to he a duty which he owes to self respect, and to the independence of the bar, to Jtakp some noth\u00bb of the comments made in the above opinion upon the account</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
