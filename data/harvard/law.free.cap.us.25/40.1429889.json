But that proceeds on the grounds that these <em>quasi </em>corporations have no funds ; but where a grant is made, conferring a special franchise, and imposing special duties, there is the sam\u00e9 responsibility in them as in any incorporated banking or insurance company. Here the contract was with the managers, as the agents of the corporation, acting within the scope of their authority.<footnotemark>a</footnotemark> Where special duties are imposed upon corporations, which can only be performed through the instrumentality of their agents, the law will raise an implied assumpsit under the same circumstances as in dealings with private individuals. It is enough to show a ratification of the acts of the agent, by receiving the benefit of the act, or otherwise. In short, they are responsible, under these circumstances, for their promises, whether express or implied, in writing or by parol.<footnotemark>b</footnotemark> And,.it was contended, that the fact of .their contract</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQz\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>being cloatbed with the forms of a legislative or political act of the corporation, or the authority being conferred on their agents by such an act, could make no difference in respect to their liability. But as the principal grounds of argument on the part of the plaintiff are fully stated in the opinion of the Court, it has been deemed superfluous to enlarge upon them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AKY\">On the part of the defendants, it was argued, that the documentary evidence given by the plaintiff was inadmissible, and incompetent to charge the defendants in the present action. 1st. Because, if the papers given in evidence imported any contract chargeable on the corporation through their supposed agents, the managers, or through their supposed agent Gillespie, no foundation was laid for their admission by any preliminary evidence to authenticate them as the acts either of the managers or of Gillespie, far less of the corporation; but the papers (all that are any wise essential, being taken from newspapers, or other printed papers) were left to their own internal and unvouched evidence of their authenticity, as the acts of the persons whom they purport to implicate. 2d. Because, if authenticated as the acts of Gillespie, there is nothing to connect him with the managers in the relation of principal and agent; but that relation is assumed from the mere acts of the supposed agent himself. 3d. Because, whatever privity may be inferred, as between those persons, there is nothing to connect the corporation with the supposed managers, in the relation of principal and agent. The authority of the mayor to appoint seven managers of a certain lottery described in the law which gives him that authority, is shown; seven persons are afterwards found professing to act as managers of a lottery, in the terms and description of which no reference whatever is made to any lottery authorized by the corporation;, and from these premises alone are inferred, (1.) the actual appointment by the mayor of these same managers: and (2.) the identity of the lottery contemplated by the corporation law, and-that promulgated in. the scheme of the. managers,and their alleged agent, Gillespie. 4th. Because, setting aside .all the preceding objections, the alleged agency-of. the managers, or of any agents, clerks, or servants, of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>fhpir appointment, purports not, from the terms of their authority as shown by the plaintiff himself, to have extended to the making ,of contracts for and in behalf of the corporation, or in any manner to bind the corporation as the guaranty or insurer of the due payment of prizes ; far less of the solvency or punctuality of any lottery contractor or undertaker; but such agency is plainly and necessarily excluded by the nature of the official relation between them, apd by the terms of the only authority for predicating the existence of any kind of agency. The authority of the managers is clearly limited to the performance of certain public duties, and to the exercise of certain ministerial functions piescrib'ed by law to the. officers or ministers of the law; the true and only relation between them and the corporatioi', is that which subsists between the legislative or paramount authority that enacts the law, and the ministerial functionaries who execute it; not that of principal and agent in a commercial sense. 5th. The same objection lies to the nature and extent of the alleged agency of Gillespie for the managers ;. Which must be presumed to have been limited to the official and prescribed duties of the latter, as ministerial functionaries of the law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b56-7\">No privity of contract,- as between the plaintiff and the corporation, could .be inferred from the evidence; but such privity was clearly and positively excluded: 1st. By the nature and objects of the power communicated to the corporation by the amended charter; a power to authorize, not to exhibit and draw lotteries, at the risk and charge of their constituents; and for important objects of public improvement, to which the ordinary revenues were inadequate ; not as a source of revenue, or fiscal aggrandizement, far less as a gulf to swallow up all the subsisting sources of revenue in lottery speculations. 2d. By the terms, intent, and spirit of all the corporate acts in execution of the power ; all of which strictly conform to the scope and policy of the paramount law, by which the authority was vested. , 3d. By the fact that Gillespie had purchased the privilege, <em>in </em>integro, to exhibit and draw the lottery, at his own risk and charge, and for his own exclusive emolument ; for which he had paid a gross sum, neither to he enlarged or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>diminished- by, nor in any manner dependent- upon the event of the lottery. The entire scheme was his, and at his disposal; subject merely to a superintending vigilance and control of municipal police, intended to protect the public from frauds and impositions in the conduct of the lottery; but, by no means, to guaranty the payment of prizes, or, in other words,-the solvency and punctuality of Gillespie. 4th. By another fact, that the1 plaintiff purchased his ticket of one James, the keeper of a miscellaneous lottery, office in Richmond, for Gillespie, and having no. sort of connexion with the corporation or its managers, nor with any lottery authorized, by the one, and conducted by the other, but as a general vender of lottery tickets, who might, in'the course of his trade, occasionally buy or sell tickets in this as in other lotteries; and so the contract was solely between the plaintiff and James, who sold the ticket and received the price, not as the agent of the corporation or its managers, but as the agent of Gillespie individually. The lottery ticket, on which the plaintiff founds his claim, imports, <em>in </em>termini\u00a1s, no contract whatever between the .corporation and the possessor; nor any assurance or invitation to the ticket-buying public-to trust to the corporate funds or credit for the payment of \u201c such prize as may be drawn to its number;\u201d nor, indeed, the remotest allusion to any interest or concern of the corporation in the scheme. If any such contract, invitation, or allusion, be involved in the terms, it must be completely .latent, and only to be developed by extrinsic facts and circumstances. All the facts and circumstances adduced' to explain the relations and bearings of those terms, concur in fixing upon Gillespie the primary obligation to pay the prize, in virtue of his contract, express or implied, as the exhibiter and proprietor of the lottery, and vender of the ticket. Then, if there be any contract, express or implied, between the corporation, or the managers and vendee, to see to the payment of the prize, it must be as collateral guaranty for Gillespie. But no fact is deducible, from the evidence, which goes to fix either upon themanagers,or, through their agency, upon the corporation, the relative duties and obligation of such collateral guaranty.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b58-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>As to the managers; if they he under any obligation to see to the payment of prizes, it must be either because it was one of the official duties prescribed to them by the terms of their appointment under the law from which they derive their authority, or because they voluntarily assumed it in addition to the duties devolved on them <em>virtute officii.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b58-10\">Then, 1st. No such duty is imposed upon them by the nature of their office and functions; 2d. If it be, it is not in the nature of an absolute obligation or-duty, that makes them liable, in all events, for anp failure to fulfil its end and aim, but of a relative duty, which, by the express terms of the law that creates it, exacts of them nothing but \u201c that they will diligently and impartially exercise and perform the duties and authority vested in them.\u201d 3d. No breach of this duty, arising either from negligence or design, is imputed to them ; but, on the contrary, by the plaintiff\u2019s own showing, they exerted great care, zeal, and diligence, (if, indeed, they did not take upon themselves gratuitous labour and trouble,) in order to secure the rights and interests of adventurers in the lottery ; all that is imputed to them is, the mere failure to accomplish the end and aim of their exertions. 4th. But if the grossest breach of this duty, in act and'intent, were imputed to them, they would be amenable for their official misdemeanour to the corporation only; or, if at all responsible to third persons, it c\u00f3uld not be as collateral guaranties of Gillespie\u2019s contract, nor for any other duty <em>ex contractu, </em>but <em>ex </em>delicto, for consequential damage, unless in possession of the fund out of which the prizes should have been paid ; an,d then they might have been liable, jointly or severally, according to the nature of their possession, to an action for money had and received for the use of the persons entitled to prizes. But this cannot be pretended in the present case. 5th. No voluntary assumption of any obligation upon themselves, beyond the limits of their prescribed authority and duties, can be presumed ; and any express contract, beyond those limits, is not pretended.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b58-11\">As to the corporation $ if there be any contract in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>the case, it must impose an obligation, either primary and absolute, to pay the prize, or secondary and contingent, as collateral guaranty for Gillespie. The plaintiff\u2019s declaration lays a contract of the first description only, and ties him down to the proof of such a contract, made through ,, _ , 1 ,. , , ' , \u00b0 the agency ol these managers, and m no other form; while his actual proof, and every circumstance in the case, exclude and repudiate it, by fixing upon Gillespie the primary and absolute obligation; and, indeed, equally exclude and repudiate any contract of the second description. If the managers held out any assurance or invitation to the ticket-buying public, or otherwise contracted any obligation, absolute or contingent, to see to the payment of prizes, it must have been either <em>virtute officii, </em>as one of the specific duties prescribed to them by the law of their appointment, or as one gratuitously undertaken by them, and not inherent to the nature of their office and functions; either way, it was an obligation contracted, <em>proprio jure, </em>and attaching responsibility to them personally and individually.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b59-11\">Then, 1st. For the due performance of the prescribed duties, inherent to the nature of their office, they are directly responsible, on their bond, to the corporation,jfrom which it is impossible <em>to </em>infer such an inversion in the order of responsibility, as that the managers should have made that very corporation, to which they are themselves amenable, liable for their own transgressions \u00f3f such duties. 2dly. If (as is quite clear from the plaintiff\u2019s own showing) no action lay against the managers, either because the seeing to the payment of prizes was no part of their prescribed duties, or because they \u201c diligently and impartially exercised and performed the duties and authority vested in them,\u201d it follows, necessarily, that no action lies against the corporation. Though the converse of the proposition be utterly untenable, since they may have contracted an obligation either inherent to the nature of their office, or voluntarily superinduced, the violation of which was'either an official misdemeanour, or a breach of contract; for neither of which could the corporation liave been held anywise responsible. Cdly, Tf the corporation were chargeable, under any circam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>stances, or in any form of action, for the misconduct.of the managers, in the course of their official or ministerial duties, it could only be <em>ex delicto, </em>or <em>quasi ex contractu, </em>in an action for consequential damages, and not in an action, like the present, purely <em>ex contractu? </em>4thly. But no action could be conceived, to make the corporation responsible to third persons for a wrong done to itself ^ fora transgression by its own officers against its own authority, in the breach of a positive duty to itself, voluntarily prescribed, in the exercise of its own legislative, discretion, to its own officers, and enforced by adequate sanctions of its own institution. 5thly. As an obligation not strictly imposed upon the managers, <em>virtute officii, </em>it is impossible to contend that the corporation can be responsible, in this or any other conceivable form of action, for that or any other act of its officers, without the prescribed limits and sphere of. their duties and authority.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AXA\">\n<em>Feb. 7th.</em>\n</decisiondate>\n<headnotes data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AFX\">Nature of the ?n thTcorporation.</headnotes>\n<footnote data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"a\">\n<p id=\"b54-11\"><em> </em>15 <em>Johns.

In considering this question, that gart of the charter which contains a grant of power on the subject of lotteries, the ordinances of the corporate body in execution of the power, and the proceedings of its agents, must be reviewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-12\">The charter enacts, \u201c that the corporation shall have full power and authority\u201d \u201c to authorize the drawing of lotteries, for effecting any important improvement in the city, which the ordinary funds or revenue thereof will not accomplish; provided, that the amount to be raised in each year shall not exceed the sum of 10,000 dollars. And provided also, that the object for which the money is intended to be raised, shall be first submitted to the President of the United States, and shall be approved of by him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AB\">Some doubt has been expressed whether this power is to exerc\u2019seJ hy drawing the lottery, on account and at the risk of the corporation, or by selling the privilege to individuals, and authorizing them to draw it on their own account. This doubt is founded on the word \u201c authorize.\u201d Congress, we are told, has not granted the power to draw lotteries. but to \u201cauthorize\u201d their being drawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>We cannot admit the correctness of this, criticism. We do not admit the justice of that construction, which denies to the corporation the power of causing the lottery to be drawn on its own account. A corporation aggregate can legislate within its prescribed limits, but can carry its laws into execution only by its agents.' Any legislative act directing a lottery to be drawn, is literally an act \u201c to authorize the drawing of lotteries.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">The object for which the lottery may be authorized, is \u201cany important improvement in the city.\u201d Its produce is to come in aid of the ordinary funds or revenue thereof; and \u201c the amount to be raised in each year shall not exceed the sum of 10,000 dollars.\u201d The language of the charter is not that the sum to be brought into the treasury <em>o\u00ed </em>the city shall not exceed the sum of 10,000 dollars, but that \u201c the amount to be raised shall not exceed that sum.\u201d This-language, it is admitted, comprehends the net proceeds of the lottery, but it comprehends all those net proceeds, and does not allow a partition of profit, so as to retain 10,000 dollars for the' treasury, and reserve a residue for others. The single object, for which the lottery can be drawn, is \u201c any important improvement in the city,\u201d not the emolument of individuals. , The motivg with Congress for this restriction on the amount is, not to limit the sum (to come into the city treasury, but to limit the extent of gaming, which the corporation may authorize. Congress must have perceived, that to bring 10,000 dollars into the treasury, dither \u201cthe amount raised must exceed that sum,\u201d or the lottery must be drawn on account of the city ; for no man will purchase a lottery from which he can make nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">The counsel of the plaintiff in error have remarked, and the remark is certainly entitled to attention, that, in describing the power, Congress has used no words indicating the idea, that the corporation might grant or sell lotteries. \u201c To authorize the drawing of lotteries,\u201d is, as has been said, an appropriate term for a corporate act, instituting a lottery for . the benefit of the city; but if the granting a lottery to others, or a sale of the privilege to others, had been id'the mind of Congress, it is to be presumed that some words would have been used, indicating the idea.</p>\n<p id=\"A4Y\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>There is great weight, too, in the argument, that it is a trust, and an important trust, confided to the corporation itself, for the purpose of \u201c effecting important improvements \u2019n the city,\u201d and ought, therefore, to be executed und\u00e9r the immediate authority and. inspection of the corporation. It is reasonable to suppose that Congress, when granting a power to authorize gaming, would feel some solicitude respecting the fairness with which the power should be u'sed; and would take as many precautions against its abuse, as was compatible with its beneficial exercise. Accordingly, we find a limitation on the amount to be raised, and on the object for which the lottery may be authorized. It is to be for \u201c any important improvement in the city, which the ordinary funds or revenue thereof will .not accomplishand is subjected to the judgment of the President of the. United States. The power thus cautiously granted, is deposited with the corporation itself, without an indication that it is assignable. It is tobe exercised, like other corporate powers, by the agents of the corporation, under its control. While it remains where Congress has placed it, the character of the corporation affords some security against its abuse; some security that no other mischief will result from it, than is inseparable from the thing itself But if the management, control, and responsibility, may be transferred to any adventurer who will purchase, a&gt;i the security for fairness, which is furnished by character and responsibility, is lost.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">We think, then, that the most obvious, if not the exclusive construction of the charter, is, that the lotteries to be authorized by the corporation, are to be drawn und\u00e9r its superintendence and on its own account.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">We will next advert to the measures which have been adopted for carrying this power into execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-10\">\"Ten successive resolutions were passed, the first approved on the 23d of November, 1812, and the last on the 21st of May, 1821, each of them for raising the sum of 10,000 dollars, by lottery, for particular improvements mentioned in the resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-11\">The ordinance of the 24th of July, 1815, which was passed for carrying the three first of these resolutions into effect, contemplates and authorizes lotteries to be drawn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>entirely under the management, for the benefit, and on the responsibility of the corporation. Seven managers are appointed by the ordinance, and they, or a majority, are authorrized to employ agents, fill up vacancies in their own body, and to do every act which may'be necessary for carrying its provisions into effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">The ordinance passed on the 17th of November, 1818, forcarrying the 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th resolutions into effect, authorizes the may or to appoint seven managers, whose duty it was to agree on a scheme, to sell the said lottery, or dispose of the tickets to the best advantage. A proviso is inserted, that, should the lottery be sold, the purchasers may make the scheme; but the ordinance enacts generally, (and the enactment makes no distinction between a sale of the lottery itself, and a disposition of the tickets,) that it shall be the duty of the managers to attend diligently to the drawing of the lottery, and to pay the fortunate adventurers for prizes drawn by them. The ordinance, however, adds the farther duty of paying over the balance, after deducting all necessary expenses, into the city treasury. From this it has been inferred, that these provisions are made for the contingency that the tickets should be disposed of for the benefit of the city, and are entirely inapplicable to the contingency of an entire sale. Certainly, in the event of an entire sale, the balance, after deducting all necessary expenses, would not be payable into the treasury;, unless we suppose it to mean the balance of the sum for which the lottery might be sold. But this is the only part of the clause which is inapplicable to a lottery sold out and drawn for the benefit of the purchaser.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">In October, 1819, the managers appointed under the act of 1815, were empowered to sell and dispose of the, lotteries to which that act refers, or so much thereof as yet remains to be drawn, in such classes, and on such.terms and conditions, as shall appear to them right and expedient. The duty of the managers to superintend the drawing, and to pay the prizes, is not changed by this act, unless the mere power to sell implies such change.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">The managers sold to David Gillespie, of New-York, in pursuance of the acts of 1815 and 1819, a lottery denomi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>natecl the'5th class of the Grand National Lottery, for the sum of 10,000 dollars, to be paid before the commencement of-the drawing the said lottery or class; and articles of agreement, in pursuance thereof, were executed on the 14th 1821. The ticket held by the plaintiff is in \u2019 this class.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"A13\">omTtTck\u00edtin evidence against the corporation,</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">On the 22d of the same month, an ordinance was passed, authorizing the managers to appoint a president, whose duty it should be, in addition to the duties imposed by the acts of 1815 and 1819, to sign all contracts, with the concurrence of a majority, of the said managers, and to sign all th'e lottery tickets in every scheme or schemes sold by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">This ordinahce recognises the duties prescribed by the \u25a0the acts of 1815 and 1819. Its 2d section allows each of the managers of the city lotteries 3 dollars for each day he has been or shall be employed; and the 7th section enacts that this compensation, \u201c except for the class now contracted for,\u201d shall be provided for and paid out of the proceeds of lotteries hereafter contracted for.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">This act is understood to recognise it as a part of the duty of the managers, to continue their superintendence of the drawing of the very class which had been sold, and which comprehended the ticket' that drew the prize for which this suit is brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-9\">The defendant has excepted to the admissibility, as well . as sufficiency of the testimony offered by the plaintiff in the Circuit Court, and the objection is made in general terms. We presume, however, that it cannot apply to the charter, or to the resolutions and ordinances of the corporation. Nor do we suppose that any exception was intended to' be made .to the testimony which establishes the ownership of the tickets, or to the admissibility of the deposition of Mr. Webb. The first document on which a question can arise, is the ticket, itself. Is this admissible in a suit against the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"A7S\">considering this question, we must inquire into the connexion between the ostensible managers and the corpora- . \u00b0 <em>x </em>tlOIl*</p>\n<p id=\"b64-13\">' The persons who were held out as managers to superintend the drawing of the lottery comprehending this ticket, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>were, with one exception, the same persons who were ap\u201epointed in the ordinance of 1815, as managers for the lotteries established by that act. The name qf R, C. Weightman, is substituted for that of S. N. Smallwood. No other change appears. It is in proof that S. N. Smallwood was elected mayor; and, as the managers have, by the ordinance, a right to fill up vacancies in their own body, their acting uniformly with R. C. Weightman, is a proof that they had chosen him to fill the vacancy made by Mr. Smallwood.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-12\">But it is contended that this lottery was drawn under the act of 1818, and there is no proof that the individuals who appeared and acted as managers, had any authority under that act.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-13\">There is undoubtedly some confusion in this part of the case, and there is not much difficulty in ascribing it to' its' real cause. The mayor was authorized by the ordinance of 1818, to appoint managers to carry that act into execution, and the probability is, that he appointed the persons who were in office under the appointment of the corporation. The fitness of this proceeding renders it probable ; and the subsequent proceedings of the corporation itself, turn this probability almost into certainty. In. \u00e1 case where written evidence of appointment is not in the power of the plaintiff, if indeed it exists, circumstances must be relied on to prove the fact, should it be deemed necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-14\">The act of 1821 takes no notice of any appointment under the act of \u00a1818, and makes it the duty of the managers, createc\u00ed under the act of 1815; to elect a president to sign all contracts, \u201c and <em>to </em>sign all the lottery tickets, in every scheme or schemes'sold by the said managersi\u201d Class No. 5, was then sold by these managers. Lotteries, under seven resolutions, to raise the sum of 70,000 dollars, were either sold, or for sale, either in mass or in detail, under the acts of 1815, 1818, and 1819. The language of this ordinance appears to extend to them all; and if it does, certainly admits the authority of the managers appointed under the act of 1815, to extend to all. The 7th section of. the act of 1821, which provides the fund for their compensation, expressly excepts \u201c the class now contracted for,\u201d The/ contract for the 5th class was' executed a few days before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>the passage of this ordinance, and it is difficult to resist the conviction that the allusion is to this contract. These provisions in the ordinance of 1821 go far to establish the authority of these, managers in this very case. The receipt of the purchase money under this very contract, is also a strong circumstance in support of the authority of those who made it. But we think the corporation h\u00e1s waived all exception to the authority of the\" managers, by producing and relying \u2022.on their contract for the sale of this very lottery. That body defends itself from the claim of the plaintiff, by alleging that their managers sold this lottery. Their attorney .produces the contract in Court, and insists that it ex\u00e9mpts his clients from- all liability. Can he in the same cause deny the authority of those who made it? We think the connexion between the managers and the corporation is esta.blished beyond controversy.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"AsM\">\u2019 Liability, of tioa -forP\u00b0th\u00e9 prize.</headnotes>\n<p id=\"Abq\">If the persons who made this contract, are the persons appointed under the authority of the corporation, as managers for class No. 5, no doubt exists whether the ticket has emanated from them. The ordinance of the 21st .of May, 3821, authorizes them to appoint a president from their own body, whose duty it shall be \u201c to sign all the lottery tickets in every scheme or schemes sold by the said managers.\u201d The scheme for the 5th class was annexed to the agreement between Gillespie and the managers, and has been produced in Court with it. Mr. Webb proves that the ticket' 2929, on which this., suit was brought, was' signed by T. H. Gillis, whose name is subscribed to it; and that T. H. Gillis was at.that time president of the board of managers.</p>\n<p id=\"A2x\">It is then satisfactorily proved that the ticket was issued an(l S\u00b0W under the authority of the corporation, and was consequently admissible in a suit brought against that body. .The remaining inquiry is, does it bind the defendants to pay the prize it has drawn in the lottery ?</p>\n<p id=\"b66-11\">Had the managers, instead of selling the whole scheme in mass, sold the tickets in the usual manner, and received the purchase money .'of the several tickets, instead of a sum. in gross, for the use of the city, this question could not have arisen. No person would have denied the liability of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>u&amp;rporation. The sole inquiry then is, whether .the agreement of the 14th of May, 1821, has discharged this liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">If the exposition of the charter in the early part of this opinion be correct, this question is answered.' If the corporate body was not empowered to vest in an individual the f l <em>J </em>r \u25a0 independent right of drawing lotteries for himseli, and on his own responsibility, uncontrolled by the city government, then the agreement with Gillespie can operate only as a sale of the profits for a given sum, leaving the responsibility of the corporation as if that agreement had never been made. The contract would be between the corporation and the ticket purchaser; and, although the price of the ticket was paid to Gillespie, y\u00e9t the-corporation had consented that he should receive it for the purpose of performing their engagements to such ticket holders as should draw prizes, and had consented to receive from him 10,000 dollars, as full compensation for that portion of it which would remain after satisfying those engagements.</p>\n<p id=\"A-J\">If the charter did grant the power to the corporation. which is now claimed, the whole transaction must be considered, in order to determine its actual character. We must inquire whether the corporation has so acted as to devest itself entirely of all connexion with, control over, and responsibility for, this lottery, and substituted the purchaser in their place.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-13\">In its origin, the lottery was a city lottery. It was to be managed by persons appointed by the city, drawn under their superintendence, and, so far as the public was informed, for the benefit, and on the responsibility of the city. Tickets were prepared under the authority of the corporation, bearing on their face the city improvements for which the lottery was to be drawn, the names of the managers appointed by the city, and the words \u201c national lottery,\u201d and \u201c by authority of Congress.\u201d Before these tickets were disposed of in the usual way, the managers entered into an agreement with David Gillespie, to sell him a lottery denominated the fifth class of the Grand National Lottery, to be drawn according to the scheme annexed, at the costs of the said Gillespie, except the expense of drawing the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-15\">The stipulations of this contract show that it w\u00e1s not in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>tended to dissolve the connexion between the city and the lottery, and to give the absolute property in it, and control over it, to Gillespie; nor to exhibit him to the world as its owner, with whom alone the purchasers of tickets were con^rac^ an&lt;^ *-\u00b0 whom the fortunate adventurers were to \u2018 look for the payment of their prizes. He engages to draw the lottery in the city of Washington, in the presence of the managers; to finish the drawing within two years from the date of the contract; to pay ail the prizes within sixty-days from its completion; to provide two clerks to assist at the drawing; and to execute,, within thirty days, and before the drawing should commence, a bond to the. managers, with such security as they should approve, in the penal sum of 35,000 dollars, conditioned for the faithful drawing of the lottery, according to the scheme, for the punctual payment of the prizes, and for conducting the lottery fairly and honestly, according to the scheme,- and according to the true intent and meaning of the acts of the aldermen and board of common council.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-3\">' A bond was executed in pursuance of this agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">These provisions are in the spirit of a contract made'to secure the city from the hazard of a continuing responsibility ; a responsibility which they were induced to continue by the consideration of the 10,000 dollars paid by Gillespie. Why else stipulate that the lottery should be drawn in the city ? Why that it should be completed within a limited time, and drawn in the presence of the managers appointed by the corporation ? Why that the prizes should be paid ? and why take a bond to the managers, conditioned, among other things, for their payment ? Had the corporation felt no farther interest in the lottery, the purchaser might have been permitted to exercise his own discretion with the article he had purchased, and to appear to the world as its owner. But the. nature of the case justifies the opinion \u2022that such a sale could not have, been made. No. purchaser could have been found who would have given 10,001) dollars for the privilege of drawing a lottery on his own account and responsibility, having iio connexion with the city. The probability is strorig, that the aspect which, the lottery still continued to bear was a necessary part of the contract, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>without which it would never have been made, and that these precautions were used to diminish the hazard of a responsibility which was unavoidably continued. We find the appearance of this responsibility carefully preserved by the corporation itself, and by its managers. In the ordinance of the 2id of May, 1821, it is enacted, that the tickets shall be signed by the president of their board of managers, and that their managers shall receive a daily allowance for attending the drawing of the lottery. The tickets were signed in conformity with this ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">The manner in which the lottery was advertised, confirms the opinion that the contract of sale was made with a view to the continuing the responsibility of the city. Exception is taken to the admission of these advertisements, and we will not affirm, that their appearance in the city papers, one of which was published by a member of the corporate body, is evidence that the publication was made by authority of the managers; but the advertisements prove the fact that the lottery was ushered to the world in the form and character which those advertisements represent. It is proved that they were published in two papers in the city, in the National Intelligencer from the 18th of May, 1821, and in the Washington City Gazette from the 17th of July, 1821, until the completion of the lottery. These advertisements exhibited the scheme which was agreed on between the managers and Gillespie, which was annexed' to their contract; gives notice of the time when the drawing would take place ; of the number of days to be employed in the drawings, and that they would be completed as soon as possible, under the superintendence of the managers. To this advertisement the names of the managers are annexed. The lottery is drawn in pursuance of it, and the managers superintend the drawing. In its progress, a postponement takes place. An advertisement purporting to be signed by three of the managers appears, giving notice of this postponement, and of its cause. Another advertisement soon follows, purporting to be signed by the president, by order of the board, giving notice when the drawing would recommence. It does recommence under the super intendence of the managers,</p>\n<p id=\"AbF\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>It is not, we think, within the compass of human credulity, to believe that the managers did not see these advertisements, or did not believe that they would be received by the public as being accredited by their names. Not to contradict them was'to sanction them. To appear in pursuance of them, and superintend the drawings of which they had given notice,'was to adopt them. It is not tobe believed that this concurrence of circumstances, all tending to assure the public that these advertisements were published by authority of the managers, could have been produced by accident. To sit daily superintending the drawing oT a lottery, in pursuance of notice published every day under their names, verifies that publication, and must be considered as \u00e1 ratification of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">The proceedings which took place between the managers and Gillespie, after the contract, still farther corroborates the opinion that this continuing responsibility of the corporation which was held put to the public, was not a fraudulent representation for the purpose of enabling Gillespie to sell the tickets, but a representation of the fact as then understood.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">It appears, from the deposition of Mr. Webb, that all the tickets, amounting to 50,000, were put into the possession of Gillespie; but these tiokels were not vendible until signed by the president of the board of managers. .Those unsigned could no more be used by him than if they had not been in his possession. As soon as the scheme was. agreed on, three or four thousand tickets were signed, and afterwards tickets were occasionally signed, so as to make the additional number of -17,208. Why were these tickets thus withheld from him, if he had become the absolute and unconditional proprietor of them? The conduct of the managers, as disclosed in the subsequent part of Webb\u2019s deposition, will inform us. He says, that sonje time after the drawing of the lottery commenced, the president of the managers refused to sign tickets, unless an equivalent in prize tickets, either paid and taken in by Gillespi\u00e9, or. drawn on hand, or the notes of individuals which Gillespie had taken, payable* to himself, for tickets sold, were deposited with them; and. accordingly, when the witness, as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>clerk and agent of Gillespie, presented tickets to be signed, he was obliged, at the same time, to deposit such prize tickets or promissory notes; and, on some occasions, when tickets were called for, and wanted, the managers have refused to sign the same for want of such equivalent; that the amount of such prize tickets so deposited with the managers was about the sum of 141,779 dollars; that the managers on such occasions objected to trusting Gillespie with the disposal of .tickets much beyond the penalty of his bond, and the witness understood, from the conversations and transactions between the parties at the time, that this precaution- arose from doubts which had been circulated respecting Gillespie\u2019s solvency. The whole number of ticket's actually signed was 30,960. This conduct of the managers is explained by the supposition that they considered the city as still responsible for prizes, but is irreconcilable with the idea of an entire transfer of responsibility to Gillespie. Such entire transfer would have entitled him to the free use of all the tickets. That the parties who made the contract so understood it, would go far in its construction, were it even in the power of the corporation to transfer its responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">We, think then, that the contract of May, 1821, can be considered only as a sale of the profits of the lottery, and could not, under all the circumstances of the case, affect the responsibility of the corporation. The ticket was in fact what it purports on its face t\u00f3 be, a ticket in the National Lottery, by authority of Congress, sold under the direction of the corporation, and signed by the -person who was authorized by an act of the corporate body to sign it. It asserts that it shall entitle the possessor to such prize as may be drawn to its number; and this is, we think, in'such a case, the promise of the corporation, made by its authorized agent, to pay such prize.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">The judgment of the Circuit Court, then, on the verdict found in the cause, and on the case , agreed, to which that verdict refers, ought to have been for the plaintiff. The judgment is to be reversed, and the cause remanded to the Circuit Court, with directions to enter judgment foe the plaintiff</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
