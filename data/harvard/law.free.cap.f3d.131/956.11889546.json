After he presented his alien registration card and a Dominican passport, an INS inspector determined, following a computer inquiry, that appellant had been deported' five weeks earlier. Appellant was read his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and waived his right to remain silent and to have the presence of counsel. He then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-27\">Look, this is what\u2019s going on. I was deported a month ago from the United States from New Jersey and I was told not to come back after five years, and I did, I\u2019m here, just do whatever you have to do.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1023-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>A grand jury of the Southern District.of Florida promptly indicted appellant for attempting to reenter the United States after having been deported. <em>See 8 </em>.U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1326(b), (b)(2) (West Supp.1997). A jury convicted him as charged, and, after sentencing, he took this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-4\">Appellant presents four claims of error. None has merit, and only one is worthy of comment: appellant\u2019s claim that the district court erred in refusing to instruct the jury that the charged offense is a specific intent crime, not a general intent crime as the court instructed the jury. In <em>United States v. Henry, </em>111 F.3d 111, 114 (11th Cir.1997), we held that \u201cspecific intent is not an element of the offense of illegal reentry into the United States after deportation in violation of Title 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326.\u201d Appellant, acknowledges that we are bound by <em>Henry's </em>holding and seeks to distinguish it on the ground that appellant was charged with <em>attempting </em>to reenter the United States, not reentering. The First Circuit, in <em>United States v. Reyes-Medina, </em>53 F.3d 327 (1st Cir.1995) (unpublished), found no merit in this distinction. We find <em>Reyes-Medina </em>persuasive and adopt its holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"Am3I\">. Appellant\u2019s deportation resulted from his conviction in a New Jersey state court, on April 25, 1988, for possession with intent to distribute cocaine. For that offense, appellant received a 20-year prison sentence. He served that sentence until September 25, 1995, when he became eligible for parole. On that date, the state turned him over to the federal authorities, who immediately deported him.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
