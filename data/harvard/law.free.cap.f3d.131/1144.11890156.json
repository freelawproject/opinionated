Sanchez (Sanchez) and Liliana Sanchez against a number of public officials.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Sanchez alleged that he was illegally detained for twenty-six hours in violation of his due process rights. The defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that they were entitled to qualified immunity as a matter of law. The magistrate judge held that the defendants\u2019 motion should be granted. After conducting a de novo review of the record, the district court declined to follow the magistrate\u2019s recommendation, holding that the defendants were not entitled to qualified immunity because Sanchez had shown that he was deprived of a clearly established constitutional right and that there was a disputed issue of material fact about whether the defendants acted in an objectively reasonable manner. The defendants now appeal. We reverse and remand this case to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"A6G7\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"A7kN\">On August 20, 1992, Sanchez arrived at Houston\u2019s Intercontinental Airport from Mexico at approximately 7:50 p.m. When Sanchez passed through the United States Customs Service, a Customs agent matched his name and general description to a fugitive warrant issued from Cheatham County, Tennessee. Because of the match, Sanchez was detained. Defendant John Chandler was the sheriff of Cheatham County; defendant Floyd Duncan was an investigator in the criminal investigation division of Cheat-ham County\u2019s Sheriffs Department; and Sarah Hunter was a dispatcher with the Cheat-ham County Sheriffs Department.</p>\n<p id=\"AfXy\">That same night, at approximately 8:33 p.m., the Cheatham County Sheriffs Depart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1146\">*1146</page-number>ment, through dispatcher Hunter, received a request from Customs at the International Airport in Houston for confirmation that a person named \u201cOscar F. Sanchez\u201d was still wanted. The Cheatham County\u2019s Sheriffs Department, acting through either Hunter or investigator Duncan, responded at 8:46 p.m. that a person by the name of \u201cOscar F. Sanchez\u201d was, in fact, still wanted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1212-4\">At 8:59 p.m., Duncan received a message from Customs in Houston that proceedings had been initiated to take custody of \u201cSanchez.\u201d At 9:36 p.m., Duncan faxed to Customs in Houston identifying information, including photographs, fingerprint copies, and other information, including the fact that the wanted \u201cSanchez\u201d had a tattoo of a rose on his left shoulder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1212-5\">A unit from the Houston Police Department (HPD) was dispatched to Customs at approximately 10:29 p.m. Defendant Officer Warren K. Haywood arrived at the airport at approximately 11:24 p.m. Defendant Officer Michael S. Lewellen received a phone call and authorized a \u201cfugitive hold\u201d on Sanchez. Shortly after 12:15 a.m. on August 21, 1992, Officer Haywood transported Sanchez to HPD headquarters.</p>\n<p id=\"b1212-6\">Later that day, defendant Officer W.H. Bearden along with defendant Sergeant P. Pohl brought Sanchez before a Harris County, Texas probable cause court at which time Sanchez refused to waive extradition proceedings. During the probable cause hearing, Sanchez claimed his innocence and argued that he was not the person named in the Cheatham County fugitive warrant. During that hearing, Officer Bearden noticed that Sanchez did not have the same tattoo on his shoulder that was described in the warrant from Tennessee. At the conclusion of the probable cause hearing, the judge ordered defendant Sheriff Johnny Klevenhagen to hold Sanchez until his (Sanchez\u2019s) identification could be confirmed. Officer Bearden then took Sanchez to the Harris County jail. Sanchez was searched and placed in a cell with other offenders.</p>\n<p id=\"b1212-13\">Pursuant to the judge\u2019s request, defendant Officer Barry J. McDermott compared the fingerprints provided by Cheatham County against those of Sanchez. They did not match. Sanchez was released from custody at approximately 9:00 p.m. on August 21, 1992 \u2014 about twenty-six hours after his initial detention by Customs agents at the airport, two hours and twenty-five minutes after he had been placed in the Harris County jail, and before he was even booked at the jail. Assistant District Attorney Bill Delmore filed a motion to dismiss the fugitive complaint against Sanchez on September 1,1992.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1212-14\">Sanchez and his wife brought a \u00a7 1983 civil rights suit against a number of public officials, claiming that Sanchez had been deprived of a clearly established constitutional right and that the officials involved in his twenty-six hour \u201cordeal\u201d acted unreasonably.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendants moved for summary judgment on the ground that they were entitled to qualified immunity, and a magistrate judge agreed. However, the district court declined to follow this recommendation and denied the defendants\u2019 motion. This appeal followed. We have jurisdiction<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1212-15\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1212-16\">We begin by addressing the immunities enjoyed by the various defendants named in this \u00a7 1983 lawsuit. In concluding that the defendants were not entitled to summary judgment, the district court threw all of the defendants into the qualified immunity basket, such that the district court made no distinction (for immunity purposes) between law enforcement officials and Assistant District Attorney (ADA) Delmore. All defendants, in the district court\u2019s eyes, were enti-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1147\">*1147</page-number>tied to qualified immunity (of course, the district court did not believe that the facts of this case triggered immunity from Sanchez\u2019s suit). Accordingly, we must first decide whether ADA Delmore should enjoy the same immunity from \u00a7 1983 damages as the other defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-4\">I. Does ADA DelmoRE Enjoy Qualified or Absolute Immunity</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-5\">We begin with the well-settled principle that although \u00a7 1983 contains no immunities on its face, the Supreme Court has recognized the potentially disruptive effect of limitless civil liability, and as such, has held that certain public officials enjoy either absolute or qualified immunity from \u00a7 1983 suits. <em>See Hunter v. Bryant, </em>502 U.S. 224, 228-29, 112 S.Ct. 534, 536-37, 116 L.Ed.2d 589 (1991); <em>Malley v. Briggs, </em>475 U.S. 335, 339, 106 S.Ct. 1092, 1095, 89 L.Ed.2d 271 (1986); <em>Imbler v. Pachtman, </em>424 U.S. 409, 417, 96 S.Ct. 984, 988-89, 47 L.Ed.2d 128 (1976). The test for determining whether a particular public official enjoys immunity from a \u00a7 1983 suit is not a rigid one. Rather, the Court has said that \u201cwhether particular actions of government officials fit within a common law tradition of absolute immunity, or only the more general standard of qualified immunity, [courts] have applied a \u2018functional approach,\u2019 ... which looks to \u2018the nature of the functions performed, not the identity of the actor who performed it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Buckley v. Fitzsimmons, </em>509 U.S. 259, 269, 113 S.Ct. 2606, 2613, 125 L.Ed.2d 209 (1993) (quoting <em>Forrester v. White, </em>484 U.S. 219, 229, 108 S.Ct. 538, 545, 98 L.Ed.2d 555 (1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-6\">This functional framework has spawned certain general principles that operate to guide courts in their determination of whether prosecutors enjoy qualified immunity or absolute immunity. Prosecutors, for example, are entitled to absolute immunity from civil damages arising out of any acts geared towards the initiation of a prosecution or in preparation for judicial proceedings. <em>See Imbler v. Pachtman, </em>424 U.S. at 427, 96 S.Ct. at 993; <em>Brooks v. George County, Miss., </em>84 F.3d 157, 168 &amp; n. 17 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, \u2014 </em>U.S. -, 117 S.Ct. 359, 136 L.Ed.2d 251 (1996); <em>Young v. Biggers, </em>938 F.2d 565, 569 (5th Cir.1991). On the other hand, prosecutors enjoy qualified immunity only if the \u201cprosecutor\u2019s administrative duties and ... investigatory functions ... do not relate to an advocate\u2019s preparation for the initiation of a prosecution or for judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Buckley v. Fitzsimmons, </em>509 U.S. at 272, 113 S.Ct. at 2615; <em>see Burns v. Reed, </em>500 U.S. 478, 492-94, 111 S.Ct. 1934, 1942-44, 114 L.Ed.2d 547 (1991) (qualified immunity for giving legal advice to police); <em>Buckley, </em>509 U.S. at 274-75, 113 S.Ct. at 2616-17 (qualified immunity for participating in investigatory functions prior to establishing probable cause or initiating suit); <em>id. </em>at 277-78, 113 S.Ct. at 2617-18 (qualified immunity for making out-of-court statements to the press). In general, qualified immunity \u201c \u2018represents the norm\u2019 \u201d for executive officers. <em>Malley v. Briggs, </em>475 U.S. at 340, 106 S.Ct. at 1095 (quoting <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 807, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 2732, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-10\">In this case, our job is to determine whether the actions of ADA Delmore constitute preparation for judicial proceedings (which would entitle him to absolute immunity) or whether ADA Delmore was merely performing administrative duties (which would entitle him to qualified immunity). The record reveals that the only thing ADA Delmore did was file a motion that would remove the fugitive complaint against Sanchez from the docket of the county criminal court. We hold that this act was simply administrative in nature, thereby entitling ADA Delmore to qualified (and not absolute) immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-11\">II. Are the Defendants Entitled to Qualified Immunity as a Matter of Law?</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-12\">\n<em>A. The Doctrine of Qualified Immunity</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-13\">The test for \u00a7 1983 qualified immunity is by now familiar. We engage in a two-step inquiry. First, we must determine whether a public official\u2019s conduct deprived a \u00a7 1983 plaintiff of a \u201cclearly established\u201d constitutional or statutory right. <em>See Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. at 818, 102 S.Ct. at 2738; <em>Salas v. Carpenter, </em>980 F.2d 299, 304 (5th Cir.1992). The constitutional right must be sufficiently clear to put a reasonable officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1148\">*1148</page-number>on notice that certain conduct violates that right. <em>See Anderson v. Creighton, </em>483 U.S. 635, 639, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 3038-39, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987); <em>Feagley v. Waddill, </em>868 F.2d 1437, 1439 (5th Cir.1989); <em>Melear v. Spears, </em>862 F.2d 1177, 1187 (5th Cir.1989). The Supreme Court has warned against vague or general assertions of constitutional rights and has required a \u00a7 1983 plaintiff to state with specificity the constitutional right that has been allegedly violated \u2014 otherwise, liability could be imposed in every case. <em>See Anderson v. Creighton, </em>483 U.S. at 639, 107 S.Ct. at 3038-39. The federal courts of appeal have taken an especially strict approach to determining whether a constitutional right is cognizable, thus resolving any doubts in the law against \u00a7 1983 plaintiffs.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We have followed this trend, mindful that \u201ca constitutional violation does not occur every time someone feels that they have been wronged or treated unfairly.\u201d <em>Shinn ex rel. Shinn v. College Station Indep. Sch. Dist., </em>96 F.3d 783, 786 (5th Cir.1996), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 117 S.Ct. 1695, 137 L.Ed.2d 822 (1997).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1214-7\">Second, a public official may successfully assert the defense of qualified immunity even though the official violates a person\u2019s civil rights, provided the official\u2019s conduct was objectively reasonable. <em>Mouille v. City of Live Oak, </em>918 F.2d 548, 551 (5th Cir.1990); <em>Pfannstiel v. City of Marion, </em>918 F.2d 1178, 1183 (5th Cir.1990). Whether an official\u2019s conduct is objectively reasonable depends upon the circumstances confronting the official as well as \u201cclearly established law\u201d in effect at the time of the official\u2019s actions. <em>Anderson v. Creighton, </em>483 U.S. at 641, 107 S.Ct. at 3089-40. The subjective intent of the public official is irrelevant, and the official\u2019s knowledge of the relevant law need not rise to the level of a \u201cconstitutional scholar.\u201d <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. at 815-17, 102 S.Ct. at 2736-38; <em>Babb v. Dorman, </em>33 F.3d at 478.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1215-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1149\">*1149</page-number>This two-part test sits atop a firm policy foundation. Foremost among these policy considerations is the deterrent effect that civil liability may have on the willingness of public officials to fully discharge their professional duties. <em>See Pierson v. Ray, </em>386 U.S. 547, 555, 87 S.Ct. 1213, 1218, 18 L.Ed.2d 288 (1967); <em>Anderson v. Creighton, </em>483 U.S. at 638, 107 S.Ct. at 3038; <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. at 814, 102 S.Ct. at 2736; <em>Scheuer v. Rhodes, </em>416 U.S. 232, 239-41, 94 S.Ct. 1683, 1687-89, 40 L.Ed.2d 90 (1974). For example, the Supreme Court has expressed concern that expansive civil liability for actions taken while on duty may cause police officers to hesitate before acting \u2014 a situation that could produce unwelcome results. <em>See Malley v. Briggs, </em>475 U.S. at 341, 106 S.Ct. at 1096; <em>Briscoe v. LaHue, </em>460 U.S. 325, 343, 103 S.Ct. 1108, 1119-20, 75 L.Ed.2d 96 (1983). Balanced against these concerns is the right of injured persons to receive redress for a violation of their constitutional rights, with the threat of monetary damages operating to deter public officials from violating citizens\u2019 constitutional rights. <em>See Butz v. Economou, </em>438 U.S. 478, 504-07, 98 S.Ct. 2894, 2909-11, 57 L.Ed.2d 895 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-4\">\n<em>B. Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-5\">With these background principles in mind, we now turn to the merits of this appeal. Sanchez alleges that he was wrongfully detained and falsely imprisoned by the defendants when they knew that he was not the person wanted on the fugitive warrant. Notably, Sanchez does not attack the validity of the warrant, which he concedes had been issued for \u201cOscar F. Sanchez\u201d with his date of birth and social security number. Sa.nchez argues instead that because the defendants were in possession of the actual suspect\u2019s photographs, fingerprints, and information that the suspect had a rose tattoo on his left shoulder within two hours after Sanchez\u2019s initial detention, the defendants had \u201cconclusive proof\u2019 that he was not the person wanted on the outstanding arrest warrant. From this, Sanchez concludes that his constitutional rights were violated because no one compared his fingerprints to those of the suspect until almost twenty-four hours after his initial detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-9\">We disagree, go no further than step one of the qualified immunity analysis, and conclude that Sanchez has not shown that the defendants deprived him of a clearly established constitutional right.</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-10\">In <em>Baker v. McCollan, </em>443 U.S. 137, 99 S.Ct. 2689, 61 L.Ed.2d 433 (1979), the Supreme Court held that the detention of an individual for three days on the basis of a facially valid search warrant did not amount to a deprivation of liberty without due process of law \u2014 despite the individual\u2019s protestations of innocence. <em>Id. </em>at 143-45, 99 S.Ct. at 2694-95; <em>see also Douthit v. Jones, </em>619 F.2d 527, 532 (5th Cir.1980).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Court reasoned that officials charged with maintaining custody of the accused named in a warrant are not required by the Constitution to perform an error-free investigation of a claim of innocence. <em>Id. </em>at 145-46, 99 S.Ct. at 2694-96. \u201cThe Constitution does not guarantee that only the guilty will be arrested,\u201d for \u201c[i]f it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1150\">*1150</page-number>did,\u201d reasoned the Court, \u201c\u00a7 1983 would provide a cause of action for every defendant acquitted \u2014 indeed, for every suspect released.\u201d <em>Id, </em>at 145, 99 S.Ct. at 2695.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Court concluded that the three-day detention did not amount to a violation of the plaintiffs constitutional right to due process. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1216-4\">We find that the facts of this case come within the compass of <em>Baker; </em>in fact, we fail to see any meaningful distinction between <em>Baker </em>and this case. Federal law enforcement officials and officials from Houston and Cheatham County, Tennessee held Sanchez on the basis of a valid arrest warrant. Those same officials also declined to release Sanchez even though he consistently asserted his innocence. Under these facts, <em>Baker </em>compels the conclusion that the actions of the defendants in this case did not deprive Sanchez of any clearly established constitutional right.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-5\">That law enforcement officials were in possession of information that exculpated Sanchez does not change this result. Although we have held that illegal detention by way of false imprisonment is a recognized \u00a7 1983 tort, <em>Simmons v. McElveen, </em>846 F.2d 337 <em>(5th </em>Cir.1988), we have required proof that the official\u2019s actions went beyond mere negligence before that tort takes on constitutional dimensions. <em>Sanders v. English, </em>950 F.2d 1152, 1159 (5th Cir.1992) (cases cited therein). Sanchez has failed to show that failure to act on the exculpatory information went beyond mere negligence. We need not look any further than Sanchez\u2019s own testimony for support for this conclusion. In his deposition, Sanchez said that there was \u201cconsiderable debate amongst the officers involved as to whether he [Sanchez] matched the appearance of the suspect wanted in the warrant.\u201d Given this fact, we simply cannot say that the defendants\u2019 failure to release Sanchez sooner was anything more than negligent. <em>See, e.g., Simmons v. McElveen, </em>846 F.2d at 339 (failure to compare suspect\u2019s fingerprints with those on a cigarette package amounted to no more than mere negligence).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> A contrary conclusion would produce the anomalous result that the defendants were required to conduct a virtually error-free investigation. In light of clear language to the contrary in <em>Baker, </em>we decline to so hold.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-8\">Finding that Sanchez has not shown that he has been deprived of a clearly established constitutional right, we hold that all defendants named in Sanchez\u2019s \u00a7 1983 suit are entitled to qualified immunity as a matter of law. Accordingly, we REVERSE the district court\u2019s conclusion to the contrary and REMAND this case to that court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-9\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AkZ\">.

Carpenter, </em>980 F.2d at 309-10 (holding that the Fourteenth Amendment imposes no duty on a sheriff's department to train and equip police officers to handle hostage situations); <em>White v. Taylor, </em>959 F.2d 539, 546 (5th Cir.1992) (holding that a decision issued by the Supreme Court after the defendant officer\u2019s trial, which held that the Court\u2019s standard regarding probable cause determinations had not provided guidance, was sufficient to show that the plaintiff had not been deprived of a clearly established constitutional right); <em>Hodorowski v. Ray, </em>844 F.2d 1210, 1217 (5th Cir.1988) (reversing the district court's decision that \"family integrity\u201d is a clearly established constitutional right); <em>cf. Brewer v. Wilkinson, </em>3 F.3d 816, 825-26 (5th Cir.1993) (stating that most recent decisions of the Supreme Court indicated that opening of prisoners\u2019 incoming mail is not a violation of the prisoner\u2019s constitutional rights, but opening outgoing mail is a violation), <em>cert. denied, </em>510 U.S. 1123, 114 S.Ct. 1081, 127 L.Ed.2d 397 (1994); <em>James </em>v. <em>Sadler, </em>909 F.2d 834, 838 (5th Cir.1990) (\"The right to be free from an unreasonable pat-down search is a constitutional right sufficiently contoured to remove the defendant\u2019s actions from the protection of the immunity doctrine.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1214-9\">. Prior to the Supreme Court's decision in <em>Harlow, </em>the Court's determination of whether a public official's actions were reasonable included a subjective component. <em>See Wood v. Strickland, </em>420 U.S. 308, 321, 95 S.Ct. 992, 1000, 43 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1149\">*1149</page-number>L.Ed.2d 214 (1975). In <em>Harlow, </em>however, the Court abandoned the subjective component of the qualified immunity analysis. 457 U.S. at 815-17, 102 S.Ct. at 2736-38; <em>see also </em>Stephen J. Shapiro, <em>Public Officials' Qualified Immunity in Section 1983 Actions Under </em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald <em>and its Progeny: A Critical Analysis, </em>22 U.MichJ.L.Ref. 249, 273-74 (1989); John D. Kirby, Note, <em>Qualified Immunity for Civil Rights Violations: Refining the Standard, 75 </em>Cornell L.Rev. 462, 484-85 (1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1215-7\">. Of course, the Court qualified this statement and suggested that at some point, even though law enforcement officials are proceeding pursuant to a valid warrant in the face of protestations of innocence, detention of that individual would run afoul of the Constitution. 443 U.S. at 144-45, 99 S.Ct. at 2694-95. However, the Court held that three days \"does not and could not amount to such a deprivation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 145, 99 S.Ct. at 2695; <em>Simons v. Clemons, </em>752 F.2d 1053, 1054-55 (5th Cir.1985) (plaintiff who alleged that she had been illegally arrested and detained for 14 to 16 hours failed to allege any constitutional deprivation because she had been arrested on a facially valid warrant); <em>compare Douthit, </em>619 F.2d at 532 (detention of prisoner for 30 days beyond the expiration of his sentence in the absence of a facially valid court order or warrant constitutes a deprivation of due process). Accordingly, to the extent Sanchez bases his constitutional claim on the amount of time he was detained (approximately twenty-six hours), we reject the argument under the authority of <em>Baker.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1216-20\">. This conclusion makes perfect sense in light of the important policy underlying qualified immunity, namely, that public officials should not be deterred from discharging their professional obligations out of fear of civil liability.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1216-21\"><em>. </em>Both Sanchez and the district court point to the testimony of one defendant which illustrates the view that Sanchez should have been released sooner. It is ironic that Sanchez chose to name so many defendants and now relies on the testimony of a single defendant for his claim that the defendants deprived him of his constitutional right to due process. In any event, the mere fact that one of the actors in the events surrounding Sanchez\u2019s detention believed that Sanchez was not the person named in the warrant does not alter our conclusion that there was an ongoing debate among the officers as to whether Sanchez was the Tennessee fugitive.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
