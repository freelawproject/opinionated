The administrator of a county correctional facility may grant like authorization to a committed offender in such facility. ... A committed offender shall, during his absence from a correctional facility under this section, be considered as in the custody of the correctional facility and the time of such absence shall be considered as part of the term of sentence.\u201d On January 18, 1973, the defendant, Steven Leroy Hughes, a prisoner at the house of correction at Billerica, was granted a furlough for the period running from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. on that date. He failed to return by 8 p.m. and was taken in custody the next day. Did the defendant commit the crime of escape as defined and made punishable by G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 16?</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">The Middlesex County grand jury indicted the defendant, using the following language: \u201cThat Steven Leroy Hughes . . . being lawfully imprisoned in the [Billerica] House of Correction . . . did break therefrom and escape.\u201d Before trial, the defendant attacked that indictment, and moved for its dismissal, on the ground that failure to return from furlough does not constitute a crime under any statute of the Commonwealth. This motion was denied subject to the defendant\u2019s exception. At the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, the defendant moved for a directed verdict,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> this time arguing that, contrary to the language of the indictment, he was not \u201cimprisoned\u201d at the house of correction at the time of his alleged escape, having been on furlough, and therefore there was no evidence, nor could there have been, that he \u201cdid break therefrom and escape.\u201d This motion was denied, subject to the defendant\u2019s exception and the judge, sitting without a jury, found the defendant guilty of the crime of escape. The case is here on appeal pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7\u00a7 33A-33G, with the assignments of error based on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>denial of the defendant\u2019s motions. We hold that there was no error and that the failure to return from furlough constitutes the crime of escape as defined and made punishable under G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 16.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">We deal first with the contention that G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 16, did not apply to the failure to return from a furlough granted pursuant to G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 90A. General Laws c. 268, \u00a7 16, enumerated four specific circumstances of escape from correctional custody other than the Massachusetts Correctional Institution at Framingham: (1) from the \u201cpenal institution\u201d itself; (2) \u201cfrom land appurtenant thereto\u201d; (3) \u201cfrom the custody of any officer thereof\u201d; or (4) \u201cwhile being conveyed to or from any such institution.\u201d The defendant contends that none of these four circumstances existed in his case. By-passing situations (2) and (4), which are self-evidently not applicable to his case, the defendant argues that he did not \u201cescape\u201d from the \u201cpenal institution\u201d itself, because he had permission to leave the Billerica house of correction. Likewise, he continues, he did not escape from \u201cthe custody of any officer thereof,\u201d since there is no evidence that during the period of his furlough he was under the custody of any correctional officer. We reject such a limited reading of G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 16. As was said in <em>Matter of Haines, </em>195 Cal. 605, 621 (1925), \u201c[e]yen if the statute might be held to be susceptible of either construction, we are justified in the public interest in adopting the one favoring the punishment of all escaping prisoners. The courts will be astute to avoid a result contrary to sound sense and wise policy . . . [and] \u2018[w]hile the intention of the legislature must be ascertained from the words used to express it, the manifest reason and the obvious purpose of the law should not be sacrificed to a literal interpretation of such words.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">It is clear from a reading of G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 90A, that the Legislature wished to introduce the concept of \u201cconstructive custody\u201d for purposes of defining the status of a prisoner while on furlough. \u20181 <em>The commissioner may extend the limits </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number><em>of the place of confinement ... at any state correctional facility </em>by authorizing . . . [the prisoner] under prescribed conditions to be away from such correctional facility but within the commonwealth for a specified period of time .... [The prisoner, while absent,] <em>shall... be considered as in the custody of the correctional facility\u201d </em>(emphasis added). Thus, legally, a prisoner is as much in the custody of the correctional facility when he is on furlough as when he is physically within its walls. It therefore follows that if a prisoner violates the terms of his furlough, he has removed himself from the \u201ccustody of the correctional facility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">Literally, G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 16, did not make it a crime to remove oneself from the \u201ccustody of the correctional facility.\u201d The statute did, however, provide punishment for escape from the \u201cpenal institution\u201d itself. While most likely that language was originally designed for escapes from the physical confines of the institution, it can, and indeed should, see <em>Matter of Haines, supra, </em>be construed in light of (1) the statute\u2019s over-all purpose of deterring and punishing prisoner escapes, and (2) the introduction of the concept of \u201cconstructive custody\u201d in G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 90A. Importantly, c. 268, \u00a7 16, did not define, and thereby limit, the term \u201cpenal institution,\u201d and thus the language is open to interpretive expansion suited to changes in the area of corrections which have come about since the time of its formulation. We believe that G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 90A, brings about such a change, constructively, in the meaning of \u201cpenal institution\u201d in the context of the furlough program with its provision that \u201c[t]he commissioner may <em>extend </em>the limits of the place of confinement ... at any state correctional facility\u201d by granting a furlough (emphasis added). Conceptually, then, the Legislature authorized the commissioner or other appropriate officer to \u201cextend the limits of the place of confinement\u201d when, acting under this statute, he authorizes a committed offender to be away from a correctional facility, and to contract the limits upon the expiration of the time prescribed by him. We believe that it follows that any committed offender who without authority goes beyond the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>limits of his place of confinement, whether the limits be as determined by the original sentence, or as extended by authority of this statute, or as contracted after the expiration of such an extension, can be held to have escaped from a \u201cpenal institution\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 16. See <em>People </em>v. <em>Haskins, 177 </em>Cal. App. 2d 84 (1960); <em>State </em>v. <em>Furlong, </em>110 R. I. 174 (1972); contra, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Person, </em>223 F. Supp. 982 (S. D. Cal. 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">To adopt the defendant\u2019s argument would be to conclude that the Legislature either intended no sanction for failure to return from furlough, or was so careless as to overlook the question. We reject both theories. The defendant argues that for programs analogous to furlough, such as work release, G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 49, the Legislature has specifically defined escape and prescribed lesser penalties than those imposed under c. 268, \u00a7 16, and therefore the Legislature could not have rationally intended to treat furlough escapes under G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 16. We disagree. In the past the Legislature has indicated an awareness of, and has given its attention to, the problem of escape under liberalized custody circumstances. Thus it can reasonably be assumed that in this instance the Legislature considered excepting furlough escapes from the operation of G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 16, and rejected the idea.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Consistent with this assumption is the fact that G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 49, under which the commissioner may permit the release of committed offenders for participation in certain education, training or employment programs \u201coutside a correctional facility,\u201d does not authorize the commissioner as \u00a7 90A expressly does, to \u201cextend the limits of the place of confinement\u201d of such persons. Sections 49 and 90A were revised simultaneously as part of the same legislative package involving correctional institutions. St. 1972, c. 777, \u00a7\u00a7 13, 18. We must assume that the Legislature intended the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>inclusion of the quoted language from \u00a7 90A to have some meaning and we must give it due effect. The absence of similar language in \u00a7 49 suggests that the Legislature thought it necessary to include in that section express language making the failure to return to the penal institution from a program outside the correctional institution punishable as an escape.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">Next, the defendant argues, that if we hold G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 16, was applicable, a furlough escapee would be punished more severely than a work release escapee. This does not necessarily follow and in fact the opposite may be true. Under c. 127, \u00a7 49, failure to return from work release is punishable by a term of <em>\u201cnot less </em>than three years and not more than five years\u201d (emphasis added) whereas under G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 16, an escape is punishable \u201cby imprisonment in the state prison for not more than ten years or by imprisonment in a . . . house of correction for <em>not more </em>than two and one half years\u201d (emphasis added). We need only point out that the defendant, who escaped from a house of correction, received a thirty day sentence in this case, whereas a defendant in a work release program would have received a minimum of three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">The foregoing discussion,also disposes of the defendant\u2019s second assignment of error, that he was entitled to a directed verdict because the Commonwealth offered no evidence that he was \u201cimprisoned\u201d at Billerica at the time of the escape, and therefore could not show that he \u201cdid break therefrom and escape.\u201d As we have said, the term \u201cimprisoned\u201d must be interpreted in light of the expanded concept of \u201ccustody of the correctional facility\u201d expressed in G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 90A.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b436-14\">On November 20, 1973, the Legislature amended G. L. c. 268 and broadened the scope of \u00a7 16. St. 1973, c. 1062. However, our concern today is with G. L. 268, \u00a7 16, before the amendment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b437-6\">This motion, although not appropriate to this case which was tried without a jury, was intended to raise the issue of the sufficiency of the evidence and we therefore treat it as a request for a ruling on that issue. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>306 Mass. 141, 143 (1940). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Corcoran, </em>332 Mass. 615 (1955). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Binkiewicz, </em>339 Mass. 590 (1959).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b438-7\">See note 1, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b440-6\">The defendant argues that the recent amendment to G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 16, see note 1, <em>supra, </em>which expressly covers escape of persons on furlough indicates a legislative determination that prior to the amendment the statute did not cover furlough cases. We believe, however, that the Legislature, with an abundance of caution, meant only to clarify the statute. See <em>People </em>v. <em>Haskins, </em>177 Cal. App. 2d 84, 87 (1960).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b442-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>Hennessey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AbF\">(dissenting). The defendant is charged with an escape in violation of c. 268, \u00a7 16, due to his failure to return from a temporary furlough authorized by c. 127, \u00a7 90A. A statement of facts was stipulated by the parties. It is not shown that the defendant fled the jurisdiction. I conclude that the judge was not warranted in entering a finding of guilty based merely upon the defendant\u2019s inaction in failing to return. \u201cLiability for the commission of an offense may not be based on an omission unaccompanied by action unless: (a) the omission is expressly made sufficient by the law defining the offense; or (b) a duty to perform the omitted act is otherwise imposed by law.\u201d Am. Law Inst., Model Penal Code, \u00a7 2.01 (3) (Proposed Official Draft May 4, 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Words, except for technical words, are to be construed according to their common and approved usage. G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 6. It is not consistent with common usage to hold that a failure to return constitutes an \u201cescape.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">General Laws c. 268, \u00a7 16, does not itself purport to make the failure to return from furlough an escape. It could not; at the time of its enactment there was no furlough program in Massachusetts. To hold that the revision of G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 90A, imported the escape statute into it by implication and so made the defendant\u2019s inaction a crime punishable by imprisonment is too strained a construction of that enactment for me to accept. There is no question that the Legislature can make such inaction an escape; I do not believe that it did so. Section 90A on its face says nothing about a prisoner\u2019s conduct. It merely authorizes the commissioner of correction to grant, and incur expenses for, furloughs for specified reasons, with or without the accompaniment of a correction officer. The final sentence deems that the furloughed prisoner \u201cbe considered as in the custody of the correctional facility and the time of such, absence shall be considered as part of the term of sentence.\u201d The clear purpose of this sentence was to ensure that a prisoner on furlough would continue to receive good time credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">Had the Legislature, by such an enactment, intended to create a crime it would have been simple to say so. In G. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>c. 127, \u00a7\u00a7 85 through 86G, the Legislature had provided for work release from a house of correction and other penal institutions and defined escape in these contexts. Without such a precise declaration of intent, the majority opinion amounts to legislating the creation of a crime where none existed heretofore.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">The Commonwealth\u2019s argument that the Legislature could not have intended that failure to return go unpunished is unconvincing. The Legislature could well have intended that such mere failure be handled as an internal problem of prison discipline and as a matter for consideration by the parole board, leaving the escape statute to deal with cases of actual flight from the place of confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">In a sense the legislative intent is not relevant here. Nor is it relevant that the Legislature may have overlooked something that it intended to do. It is not enough that the Legislature may have had a certain intent; the proper steps must be taken to effectuate it. Where a statute is ambiguous it may be appropriate to seek the elusive legislative intent to interpret it. But where, as here, the statute\u2019s meaning is apparent on its face, we should not strain to distort that meaning to effectuate a supposed intent which the Legislature could easily have expressed, but did not. \u201cWe do not inquire what the legislature meant; we ask only what the statute means.\u201d Holmes, Collected Legal Papers, 207 (N. Y. 1920).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">The Commonwealth points out that the defendant was forewarned that failure to return would be punished as escape, and signed a statement demonstrating this knowledge. While this no doubt resolves any due process problems of notice or vagueness that might otherwise arise, it is irrelevant to the question before us. No statement by correctional officials or prior admission by a defendant can establish a crime where none exists by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">Criminal laws are to be strictly construed and are not to be extended by mere implications. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Paccia, </em>338 Mass. 4, 6 (1958). In my view, that rule should be controlling here. Traditionally, penal statutes have been strictly construed in favor of the defendant. Sutherland &amp; Horack, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>Statutes and Statutory Construction (3d ed.) \u00a7 5604 (1943). \u201cThe rule that penal laws are to be construed strictly, is perhaps not much less old than construction itself.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wiltberger, </em>5 Wheat. 76, 95 (1820).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">An appropriately strict construction of both G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 16, and G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 90A, leaves the defendant\u2019s inaction outside the prohibitions of the criminal law of Massachusetts as of the date of his trial. This legislative oversight should be remedied by the Legislature,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> not by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">The trial judge correctly denied the motion to dismiss the indictment, which was proper in form to charge an escape under c. 268, \u00a7 16. The motion for directed verdict was not appropriate for filing in a case heard by a judge without a jury.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Nevertheless, I would treat it as effectively raising the issue that the proof did not warrant a finding of guilty. Therefore, as the stipulated facts do not establish guilt of that crime I would reverse the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b444-7\">It now has been.
