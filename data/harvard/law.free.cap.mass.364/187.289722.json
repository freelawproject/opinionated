A decree was entered in the Superior Court under G. L. c. 231 A, declaring that the commission \u201chas the right and authority to publicly investigate, by all appropriate means, the effect\u201d of such activities \u201con the administrative, operational, and financial practices and methods\u201d of the committee and the School Department of Boston (department). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">On May 24,1973, the commission adopted resolutions and votes whereby it determined to conduct an investigation into the practices of the committee and the department, including testimonials and other fund-raising activities. Public hearings commenced on June 11, 1973, and continued on June 12, 13, and 19. On June 22 the individual plaintiffs, acting for themselves and as members of the committee, brought a suit in the Superior Court under G. L. c. 231A for declaratory and injunctive relief, and obtained temporary orders restraining the defendants from issuing press releases or other comments based on testimony at the hearings and from conducting hearings \u201cor other action on the issue of testimonials or fund-raising activities\u201d of the plaintiffs. Both restraining orders were continued in force by an interlocutory decree of June 27. Also on June 27 the four plaintiffs stipulated in writing that they would not make press releases or comments on testimony at the hearings. At a hearing on the merits on July 23, the court allowed a motion to add the committee as a party plaintiff and to add a prayer for a declaration that the commission lacked authority to investigate the committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">On August 10, 1973, the judge, adopting as his findings the parties\u2019 statement of agreed facts, entered a final decree upholding the authority of the commission. The decree vacated as of August 22, 1973, the interlocutory decree continuing the restraining orders in effect, relieved the plaintiffs of similar restraints imposed by stipulation, and retained the court\u2019s jurisdiction of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">The plaintiffs appealed from the final decree. On August 28 the judge denied their motion to suspend the final decree pending appeal. The plaintiffs filed a separate claim of ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>peal from the denial of the motion to suspend, and they filed a petition, again seeking injunctive relief pending appeal, before a single justice of this court pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, and c. 214, \u00a7 22. An order denying relief was entered on September 4, 1973, and a bill of exceptions was allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Public hearings into the issue of testimonials resumed. On September 20 special counsel for the commission voluntarily agreed that no further public hearings would be held pending expedited decision by this court on the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal from the final decree entered on August 10. The case was submitted to us on September 28 on the original papers and briefs of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">1. The commission, as presently constituted, was established by St. 1909, c. 486, \u00a7\u00a7 17-21.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Section 18 of that chapter provides: \u201cIt shall be the duty of the finance commission from time to time to investigate any and all matters relating to appropriations, loans, expenditures, accounts and methods of administration affecting the city of Boston or the county of Suffolk, or any department thereof, that may appear to the commission to require investigation, and to report thereon from time to time to the mayor, the city council, the governor, or the general court. The commission shall make an annual report in January of each year to the general court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">Three of our decisions provide guidance on the scope of the commission\u2019s power. The Legislature intended the commission\u2019s range of inquiry to be broad but not unlimited. Its investigations must have a reasonable relation to the finances and methods of management of the city. The commission may \u201cinvestigtate fairly, by comprehensive but reasonable methods, matters which it is justified in regarding as affecting the finances and management of Boston.\u201d Subject to judicial determination whether subpoenas may properly be enforced, the statutes leave to the commission the determina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>tian in the first instance \u201cwhether the inquiry is relevant to the statutory functions, and whether particular methods of inquiry are necessary.\u201d <em>Finance Commn. of Boston </em>v. <em>McGrath, </em>343 Mass. 754, 760-762 (1962). <em>Finance Commn. of Boston </em>v. <em>Sheriff of Suffolk County, </em>349 Mass. 503, 504 (1965). <em>Finance Commn. of Boston </em>v. <em>Basile, </em>354 Mass. 188, 192(1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Apart from the special status of the committee, considered hereafter, there seems to be little doubt that its activities may have effects on the finances and management of the city. We need not decide whether it is a \u201cdepartment\u201d of the city for the purposes of the governing statute. Compare <em>Eastern Mass. St. Ry. </em>v. <em>Mayor of Fall River, </em>308 Mass. 232, 233-234 (1941), with <em>Sweeney </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>309 Mass. 106, 108-110 (1941). The commission may investigate matters affecting the finances and management of the city, whether or not a \u201cdepartment\u201d is involved. No extended discussion is needed to demonstrate that school problems may have such effects.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">The commission concluded that testimonials and other fund-raising activities \u201cmay\u201d have a significant effect upon the administrative, operational and financial practices and methods of the committee. The judge thought it \u201cnot an unreasonable assumption\u201d that fund-raising conducted by an official among the employees of his department might have such an effect. See <em>Ex parte Curtis, </em>106 U. S. 371, 375 (1882). Hence, he ruled, the commission may investigate such activities unless the committee as such is beyond the reach of the investigatory powers of the commission. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">2. The plaintiffs contend that the committee is \u201can autonomous political entity,\u201d and hence that the commission has no power or jurisdiction over its management. The argument rests in part on the \u201csubstantially final authority\u201d over the school budget established by our decisions under G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 34. See <em>Bell </em>v. <em>North Reading, </em>363 Mass. 505, 510 (1973) and cases cited. The city of Boston has contended in the past that that statute is not \u201coperative\u201d in the city. See <em>Kerrigan </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>361 Mass. 24, 33 (1972). We did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>resolve the question raised by that contention, and we do not decide it now. Even if G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 34, is not operative in Boston, the committee has apart from the statute a large measure of independence in the management of the public schools. <em>Lynch </em>v. <em>Fall River, </em>336 Mass. 558, 560-561 (1958). <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>338 Mass. 704, 707-709 (1959). See <em>School Comm. of Salem </em>v. <em>Gavin, </em>333 Mass. 632, 634-635 (1956). On the other hand, even where the statute is operative, the power of a school committee is not unlimited. <em>Bell </em>v. <em>North Reading, </em>363 Mass. 505, 511 (1973). For example, it is not inconsistent with the traditional pattern to subject certain votes of school committees to review by referendum. G. L. c. 43, \u00a7 42. <em>Gorman </em>v. <em>Peabody, </em>312 Mass. 560, 566-569 (1942). Compare <em>Fantini </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Cambridge, </em>362 Mass. 320, 322-323 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">The traditional supremacy of the committee in the field of education does not lead inevitably to the conclusion that it is immune from investigation by the commission. Whatever the degree of its independence, that independence is conferred by statute and may be changed by statute. We upheld the commission\u2019s power to investigate dealings affecting the Boston Housing Authority, even though such an authority is a complete corporate entity in itself, distinct from the municipal corporation within whose territory it is set up. <em>Finance Commn. of Boston </em>v. <em>McGrath, </em>343 Mass. 754, 763-764 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">The trial judge relied on items in annual reports of the commission relating to investigations of the committee as showing the commission\u2019s practices and interpretation of its authority over the years, sanctioned by the acquiescence of the Legislature, and as providing strong evidence of the authority of the commission. See <em>Burrage </em>v. <em>County of Bristol, </em>210 Mass. 299, 301 (1911). The commission has cited to us more than 100 such items. The plaintiffs have moved that the case be remanded so that these reports and other materials referred to in the commission\u2019s brief may be introduced in evidence and rebutted, citing <em>Finlay </em>v. <em>Eastern Racing Assn. Inc. </em>308 Mass. 20, 27 (1941). Since this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>material merely confirms the conclusion we would reach without it, the motion is denied. As to the propriety of considering such materials, see Davis, Administrative Law (1958 ed.) \u00a7 15.03, <em>id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 15.00, 15.03 (Supp. 1970); McCormick, Evidence, (2d ed. 1972) \u00a7\u00a7 330-335.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Apart from the practice of the commission, it is common for the Legislature to conduct investigations, obtain facts, and receive reports through commissions. See <em>Sheridan </em>v. <em>Gardner, </em>347 Mass. 8, 12 (1964). The statute establishing the commission contemplates annual reports by the commission to the Legislature, presumably with a view to changes in the law. We do not believe the Legislature intended to deny to the commission the power to obtain facts relevant to needed changes in the law governing matters otherwise within its field of concern. It may investigate school affairs to the same extent that it may investigate other aspects of the administration of the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">3. The plaintiffs claim that the individual defendants acted improperly in making public comments on the commission\u2019s investigation, and attack several provisions of the rules of the commission as invalid and unfair. The judge excluded evidence of improper conduct of the individual defendants, and refrained, \u201cat least at this time,\u201d from making any rules or orders with respect to the conduct of the commission\u2019s hearings. He correctly ruled that the jurisdiction of the commission would not be lost by reason of improper motives or improper conduct of the hearings. <em>Mayor of Everett </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>324 Mass. 144, 150-151 (1949). He also properly followed our decision in the <em>McGrath </em>case by retaining jurisdiction so that the parties may apply for additional relief upon short notice as occasion may arise. <em>Finance Commn. of Boston </em>v. <em>McGrath, </em>343 Mass. 754, 768 (1962). Further relief would have been premature. <em>St. Luke\u2019s Hosp. </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn. </em>320 Mass. 467, 470 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">4. The final decree is affirmed. It is not necessary to consider any questions relating to interlocutory relief pending appeal. The appeal from the interlocutory decree denying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>relief pending appeal and the bill of exceptions with respect to the interlocutory ruling of the single justice of this court are dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b199-8\">The commission had its origin in an order passed by the city council and approved by the mayor on January 29, 1907. See 1. (Boston) Fin. Com. Rep. 1-10 (1908). Subsequent legislative provisions are contained in St. 1907, c. 481, and St. 1908, c. 562.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
