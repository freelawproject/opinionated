L. c. 231A onde. 214, \u00a7 10A,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>to enjoin the construction by the defendant Massachusetts Port Authority (Authority) of a major new passenger terminal and automobile parking garage at the General Edward Lawrence Logan International Airport (Logan Airport). The plaintiff requested, in addition to injunctive relief, a declaration that the Authority,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in planning for, approving, and contracting for the construction of the terminal and garage, had failed to comply with certain air pollution control regulations adopted by the Department of Public Health (Department) pursuant to G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7\u00a7 142A-142E,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and also with certain requirements of G. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>c. 30, \u00a7 61.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendants filed answers to the bill, and, after a partial trial, the judge of the Superior Court entered findings, rulings, and an order for a decree. Thereafter, he entered a final decree in which he declared that the Department\u2019s regulations are inapplicable to the Authority, that the Authority had complied with G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 61, and that because there was no violation of \u00a7 61, there was no basis under G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 10A, for further review of the action taken by the Authority under \u00a7 61. Having thus declared the \u201crights, duties and status\u201d of the parties, the judge dismissed the bill. This appeal presents for our decision the correctness of the judge\u2019s rulings of law and the propriety of his decree dismissing the bill. We hold that the ruling that the Authority has not violated G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 61, was correct, but that the conclusion that the Department\u2019s regulations do not apply to the Authority for the reasons stated was incorrect. The decree dismissing the bill must, therefore, be vacated and the case remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings (see fn. 15, <em>infra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">The factual context in which this controversy arose may be briefly summarized. The Authority was created by the Leg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>islature in 1956 as a \u201cpublic instrumentality,\u201d one of its functions being to own and operate Logan Airport. St. 1956, c. 465. On April 12, 1973, at a special meeting, a majority of the members of the Authority voted to authorize the execution of a contract for the construction of the so called South Terminal at Logan Airport. The plans for such a terminal included a provision for a five-story automobile parking garage with 2,700 parking spaces. On the same day, April 12,-the State Commissioner of Public Health (Commissioner) notified the Authority\u2019s executive director by letter that the Department considered the construction of the South Terminal parking garage to be within the scope of certain air pollution control regulations adopted by the Department pursuant to G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 142D. Those regulations, inter alla, prohibit the construction of any \u201cfacility\u201d which may contribute to a condition of air pollution until the plans and specifications for such facility are reviewed and approved by the Department. The Commissioner therefore requested that the plans and specifications for the garage be submitted to the Department. In a separate letter of the same date to the chairman of the Authority, the Commissioner urged the Authority not to execute a contract for construction of the garage until the Authority and the Department could resolve the \u201cvery serious questions\u201d concerning the application of the regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">On April 13 the city of Boston commenced this suit in the Superior Court. On April 19 or 20 the Commissioner requested from the Attorney General his opinion \u201cas to the applicability of . . . [the Department\u2019s] regulations to the Massachusetts Port Authority.\u201d (In the letter stating this request the Commissioner mentioned that the city had requested that the Department join in the city\u2019s suit against the Authority.) In a letter dated April 21, supplemented by another dated April 24,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the Attorney General stated as his opinion that the Authority, by virtue of \u00a7 2 of its enabling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>act,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> is exempt from the Department\u2019s air pollution control regulations. In a letter dated April 24,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the Commissioner informed the executive director of the Authority that, in light of the Attorney General\u2019s ruling, the Department could not enforce its air pollution control regulations against the Authority. The Commissioner expressly reserved his right to reverse that decision in the event that the Superior Court, in the suit brought by the city, ruled that the Authority is in fact not exempt from such regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">On April 25 the Authority and Vappi &amp; Company, Inc., executed the contract for construction of the South Terminal, and on or about April 30, construction work began and has since continued. On May 2 the judge entered his findings, rulings, and order for decree. A final decree was entered on May 7 dismissing the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s bill comprises two principal claims which we shall deal with separately. The first claim concerns the Authority\u2019s failure to obtain prior approval of its plans for the South Terminal garage from the Department in accordance with the allegedly applicable air pollution control regulations. The second claim concerns the alleged failure of the Authority fully to comply with the requirements of G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 61. Before reaching these issues, however, we must first consider the challenge raised by the defendants to the plaintiff\u2019s standing to maintain this action under G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 10A.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">A. <em>Jurisdiction under </em>\u00a7 <em>10A.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">The question of the plaintiff\u2019s standing was neither raised by the defendants\u2019 pleadings nor argued during the pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>ceedings in the Superior Court. We would, therefore, ordinarily decline to consider it at this juncture. <em>Lyon </em>v. <em>Bloomfield, </em>355 Mass. 738, 743 (1969). However, the gravamen of the defendants\u2019 argument before this court raises not an issue of standing but rather an issue of jurisdiction. The defendants argue that the bill is insufficient under the terms of \u00a7 10A in that there is no allegation that the environmental damage which allegedly is \u201cabout to occur\u201d because of the construction of the parking garage \u201cconstitutes a violation of a statute, ordinance, by-law or regulation.\u201d The only allegation of any \u201cviolation\u201d concerns the Authority\u2019s failure to submit its garage plans for the Department\u2019s approval and its failure to comply with \u00a7 61 of c. 30. These are not the type of violations to which the statute speaks. Therefore, say the defendants, the plaintiff has no standing to maintain this suit under \u00a7 10A. But clearly this argument does not go to the plaintiff\u2019s standing, which is expressly established by the statute (\u201cupon the petition of any political subdivision of the commonwealth\u201d). Instead, it raises the question whether the plaintiff\u2019s allegations are sufficient to invoke the jurisdiction of the Superior Court under the terms of \u00a7 10A.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">The jurisdictional issue implicit in the defendants\u2019 argument must be decided, regardless of the point at which it is first raised. <em>Witzgall </em>v. <em>Witzgall, </em>334 Mass. 365, 368 (1956). In order to invoke the jurisdiction of the Superior Court under G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 10A, there must be an allegation that \u201cdamage to the environment is occurring or is about to occur,\u201d and it must further be alleged that such damage \u201cconstitutes a violation of a statute ... or regulation the major purpose of which is to prevent or minimize damage to the environment.\u201d The bill in the present case is adequate in all respects but one: it is not the damage to the environment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>(i.e., increased air pollution) which is alleged to constitute the violation of the statute or regulation. Rather, the violations alleged are merely procedural failures, i.e., failure to obtain prior approval of the garage plans and inadequate compliance with \u00a7 61. Thus, whereas the scheme of \u00a7 10A appears to contemplate that the court is to determine whether damage to the environment is in fact occurring or about to occur, whether such damage constitutes a \u201cviolation,\u201d and whether it should therefore be enjoined, the present bill would have the court decide merely procedural questions having no immediate bearing on any actual damage to the environment. The remedy provided in \u00a7 10A is clearly available to enforce the substantive prohibitions of environmental statutes and regulations; we must now decide whether it is also available to enforce the procedural requirements of those same statutes and regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">We hold that the present bill is sufficient to invoke the jurisdiction of the Superior Court under \u00a7 10A. The legislative intent underlying that provision is broadly stated in the title under which it was enacted: \u201cAn Act establishing a cause of action in behalf of certain persons and political subdivisions for the purpose of protecting the natural resources and environment of the commonwealth.\u201d St. 1971, c. 732. In submitting proposed legislation permitting environmental suits to be brought by citizens, the Governor indicated that his intention was to permit \u201cthe citizen to join in the enforcement of the battery of anti-pollution laws we have passed in recent years.\u201d 1971 House Doc. No. 5023. We believe that these broad statements of purpose are incompatible with a narrow, technical interpretation of \u00a7 10A which would limit the operation of the statute to the enforcement of only prohibitory environmental laws and regulations. The present case exemplifies the anomalous result to which such an interpretation would lead.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">\u201cDamage to the environment\u201d as defined in \u00a7 10A expressly includes air pollution. The principal legislative and administrative response to the problem of air pollution in Massachusetts is contained in G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7\u00a7 142A-142E, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>and the Department\u2019s regulations adopted pursuant to those sections. Nowhere in \u00a7\u00a7 142A-142E is there any provision which expressly prohibits pollution of the air. Instead, those sections, in broad outline, empower the Department to establish a regulatory scheme for the prevention and control of air pollution. The scheme which the Department has adopted, as set forth in its regulations, constitutes a comprehensive attempt to deal with a complex problem. In fulfilling its legislative mandate the Department has decided not only expressly to prohibit certain practices (e.g., Reg. 2.5, \u201cEmission Limitations\u201d) but also to establish certain procedural requirements (e.g., Reg. 2.1, requiring prior departmental approval of plans for the construction or alteration of certain facilities; Reg. 12.1, requiring annual registration of certain pollution sources). If we were to adopt a narrow construction of G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 10A, the consequence would be that only one part of the State\u2019s air pollution regulatory program could be enforced by petition under that section. For example, a petition under \u00a7 10A would lie to enforce the Department\u2019s emissions limitations on an operating \u201cindustrial facility,\u201d Reg. 2.5.2, but would not lie to require submission for the Department\u2019s approval of the plans for such facility prior to its construction, Reg. 2.1. We perceive no reason to conclude that the Legislature intended such a result. The Department\u2019s regulatory scheme is comprehensive, with each part necessary to the accomplishment of the end goal of preventing air pollution. If one of the principal purposes (i.e., the prevention of air pollution) of \u00a7 10A is to be realized, then a petition under that section must lie to enforce the entire air pollution regulatory scheme.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We hold, therefore, that a petition under \u00a7 10A will lie to enforce the procedural as well as the prohibitory provisions of the Department\u2019s regulations.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>B. <em>Applicability of the Department\u2019s Regulations to the Authority.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">We move now to consideration of the merits of the plaintiff\u2019s claims, dealing first with the question of the applicability of the Department\u2019s air pollution control regulations to the Authority.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The defendants contend that this question actually involves \u201cfour broad areas of dispute.\u201d They argue that they should prevail on any or all of the following grounds: (1) the Department\u2019s regulations do not by their own terms apply to the South Terminal parking garage; (2) the regulations were never validly adopted for the air pollution control district in which Logan Airport is situated; (3) the regulations were adopted, if at all, pursuant to G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 142D, and thus are not made applicable to authorities by the terms of \u00a7 142E; and (4) in any event, \u00a7 2 of the Authority\u2019s enabling act (St. 1956, c. 465) exempts it from any attempted regulation by the Department unless such regulation is provided for in the enabling act. Of these four contentions, however, only the latter two were relied on by the Superior Court judge as bases for his ruling on the plaintiff\u2019s first claim.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> As to the first two, the judge express<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>ly declined to decide whether the regulations on their own terms could apply to a parking garage,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and he made no mention at all of whether the regulations were validly adopted.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Thus, on this record, the only questions now before us concern, first, the applicability of \u00a7 142E to regulations purportedly adopted pursuant to \u00a7 142D, and second, the exemption of the Authority from regulation by \u00a7 2 of its enabling act.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">By the terms of \u00a7 142E only regulations adopted \u201cpursuant to\u201d \u00a7\u00a7 142A-142C, inclusive, are made applicable to \u201c[a]ll departments, agencies, commissions, authorities and political subdivisions.\u201d The trial judge concluded that the exclusion of regulations adopted pursuant to \u00a7 142D from the coverage of \u00a7 142E indicated a legislative intent that \u201cpublic bodies (including the Authority) not be subject to any regulations adopted under that section [i.e.,\u00a7 142D].\u201d Since the only explicit authority cited by the Department for the adoption of its regulations is \u00a7 142D,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> the judge concluded that those regulations could not apply to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>Authority. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">No authority to adopt rules and regulations is expressly granted in \u00a7 142D (except to the extent that \u201cstandards\u201d might be deemed to be regulations. See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 1 [5]). That section merely authorizes the Department to establish air pollution control districts compatible with the air quality control regions designated under the Federal \u201cAir Quality Act of 1967\u201d (see 42 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1857-1857 1 [Supp. V, 1965-1969]),<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> to adopt \u201cambient air quality standards applicable to said districts,\u201d and to adopt \u201ca plan for the implementation, maintenance and attainment of such standards.\u201d The section closes with a provision that: \u201cThe powers, duties and rights of the department in the exercise of air pollution control in districts established under this section . . . shall be as provided in . . . [\u00a7 142B].\u201d Thus, any authority in \u00a7 142D to adopt rules and regulations can come only from the reference to \u00a7 142B just quoted.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We are left, then, with the somewhat metaphysical problem of whether regulations which are adopted by the Department to apply to air pollution control districts created under \u00a7 142D should be deemed to be adopted \u201cpursuant to\u201d \u00a7 142D, and thus outside the scope of \u00a7 142E, or \u201cpursuant to\u201d \u00a7 142B, and thus, under \u00a7 142E, applicable to \u201c[a] 11 . . . authorities.\u201d We believe that the latter interpretation is the one intended by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">The judge\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7\u00a7 142D and 142E, if correct, would mean that the Legislature has mandated the creation of duplicate air pollution schemes for the State, one under \u00a7\u00a7 142A-142C and another under \u00a7 142D. The import of the ruling below is that the Department may establish air pollution control districts and may adopt regulations applicable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>to those districts under \u00a7 142D. However, if it wishes to enforce its regulations against \u201cpublic bodies\u201d in those districts it cannot do so pursuant to \u00a7 142D; it must also establish those districts and adopt regulations applicable thereto pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 142A-142C in order to invoke \u00a7 142E. It is not inconceivable that the Department might be required to take all administrative actions relative to the State\u2019s air pollution control districts pursuant both to \u00a7\u00a7 142A-142C and to \u00a7 142D, thus avoiding any gap in its coverage, but we do not believe that the Legislature intended to impose any such cumbersome procedural requirement. The legislative history of \u00a7\u00a7 142D and 142E supports our conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">The original versions of the bills which were eventually enacted as \u00a7\u00a7 142D and 142E were among several bills proposed in 1969 by a special joint legislative committee on air pollution.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In drafting these bills the committee was expressly cognizant of the requirements of the Federal Air Quality Act of 1967.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In its draft of \u00a7 142D (which is substantially identical to \u00a7 142D as enacted) the committee clearly intended to harmonize the State\u2019s air pollution control scheme with the Federal scheme, and to grant to the Department the powers necessary to comply with the Federal legislation. For example, the Department may establish air pollution control districts compatible with the Federal air quality control regions (see 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1857c-2 [Supp. V, 1965-1969]) and the Department may adopt ambient air quality standards, and a plan to implement such standards (see 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1857d [c] [1] [Supp. V, 1965-1969]). For the \u201cpowers, duties and rights\u201d necessary to the Department to \u201cexercise . . . air pollution control\u201d in such districts, however, reference was merely made to those powers already provided in \u00a7 142B (originally enacted in 1960). Thus, it would appear that the primary purpose underlying \u00a7 142D was to ensure conformity between the State and Federal air pollution con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>trol mechanisms by providing the Department with the authority, in addition to that already provided in \u00a7\u00a7 142A-142C, necessary to comply with certain Federal requirements. There is no reason to assume that a second system of air pollution control districts, with coverage different from the system authorized by \u00a7\u00a7 142A-142C, was contemplated by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">Along with the proposed \u00a7 142D the legislative committee also submitted a proposed \u00a7 142E (which is substantially identical to \u00a7 142E as enacted). This section applied regulations adopted pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 142A-142C to authorities and other public bodies. At the time this bill was drafted \u00a7 142D was, of course, merely a proposal, and thus the failure to refer to it might be explained by the fact that it was not yet part of the General Laws.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> It appears more probable, however, that the Legislature never intended that any regulations would be adopted \u201cpursuant to\u201d \u00a7 142D. In a 1972 amendment to \u00a7 142B, the Legislature empowered the Department to issue orders to stop or abate violations of \u201cany of the <em>rules and regulations </em>adopted pursuant to this section [i.e., \u00a7 142B] or of any of the <em>rules and regulations </em>adopted under the provisions of section one hundred and forty-two A and <em>standards </em>adopted under . . . [\u00a7 142D]\u201d (emphasis supplied). St. 1972, c. 359, \u00a7 1. The phrasing of this amendment indicates that the Legislature intended that \u201cstandards\u201d were to be adopted pursuant to \u00a7 142D, but regulations and other measures to enforce those standards were authorized only in \u00a7\u00a7 142A and 142B. Thus, the most reasonable explanation of the omission of any reference to \u00a7 142D in \u00a7 142E is that the Legislature did not intend regulations to be adopted \u201cpursuant to\u201d \u00a7 142D. Regulations to enforce the provisions of \u00a7 142D must be deemed to be adopted \u201cpursuant to\u201d the terms of \u00a7 142B, and therefore are in fact applicable to public bodies under \u00a7 142E.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>We are now squarely presented with the final issue raised by the plaintiff\u2019s first claim: how to reconcile the mandate of \u00a7 142E that \u201call . . . authorities . . . shall be subject to\u201d the Department\u2019s regulations with the mandate of \u00a7 2 of the Authority\u2019s enabling act that the Authority \u201cshall not be subject to the supervision or regulation ... of any department, commission, board, bureau or agency of the commonwealth except to the extent and in the manner provided in this act.\u201d St. 1956, c.465. Although there has been no amendment of the enabling act subjecting the Authority to the Department\u2019s air pollution regulations, we nevertheless hold that the absolute language of the enabling act must yield to the equally absolute language of \u00a7 142E.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">In reaching this conclusion we start from the fact that the provision of \u00a7 142E here in question merely expands the scope of coverage of regulations adopted under \u00a7\u00a7 142A and 142B. Those sections by their own terms originally applied to \u201c[a]ny municipality, corporation or person\u201d [\u00a7 142A] and to \u201cany person, corporation or political subdivision\u201d [\u00a7 142B], Section 142E extends their already broad application to include \u201c[a]ll departments, agencies, commissions, authorities and political subdivisions.\u201d This development is significant for two reasons. First, it is some evidence that the Legislature intended that the air pollution control scheme devised under \u00a7\u00a7 142A-142E is to be universally applicable throughout the State.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Second, the fact that the regulations are enforceable against public bodies to the same extent that they are enforceable against individuals and private businesses greatly undercuts the Authority\u2019s most persuasive argument for broad application of its \u201cexemption\u201d from regulation, that is, that the Authority was intended to be as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>free from State regulation as any private business.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">The Authority\u2019s contention that it was created in order to permit the management of two State-owned airports<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and the port of Boston in a businesslike manner is based principally on the findings and recommendations of a special commission created by the Legislature prior to the creation of the Authority.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The commissioners found that the airport and port operations were essentially business operations which were being \u201cdelayed and hampered in their operations as business enterprises, sometimes for several years, by an intricate and complex web of legislative and executive controls over policy, management, budgeting, financing, personnel and building construction.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The commissioners concluded that the airport and port should be turned over to an authority, the members of which \u201cwould operate the Authority as the directors of any business corporation should manage affairs, and that is on a businesslike basis.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> (Among the \u201cdesirable businesslike characteristics\u201d the Authority was to have was freedom from the usual State controls over building construction.)<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Admittedly the Commission report provides persuasive evidence that the purpose of the exemption in \u00a7 2 of the enabling act was to ensure that the Authority would be free to act essentially as a private business rather than as a State agency. The defendants would have us go further, however, and find in the report evidence of a legislative intent to exempt the Authority even from regulation which applies to private businesses as well as to public agencies unless the Legislature has amended the Authority\u2019s enabling act explicitly to permit such regulation. This we cannot do.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">The consequence of the defendants\u2019 interpretation of \u00a7 2 of the Authority\u2019s enabling act would be that a small group <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>of State authorities<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> would have a unique exemption from the regulatory power of the State, an exemption available to no other person or legal entity, public or private.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> The extent of this exemption would be such that no legislation authorizing State regulation of any activity or subject, regardless of the breadth of its language and the generality of its application, would supersede such exemption except by express reference to and amendment of the enabling act of each such authority. Thus, in the present case, the Legislature by c. Ill, \u00a7\u00a7 142A-142E, has authorized and directed the creation of a comprehensive regulatory scheme for attacking the Statewide problem of air pollution. This legislation on its face demonstrates a legislative awareness that any scheme to control and prevent air pollution must apply to all sources of such pollution, whether privately or publicly controlled. Yet the defendants contend that the Authority and its fellow authorities with similar enabling acts occupy a special status in that they are exempt from this regulatory scheme, free to engage in air polluting activities or not as they in their sole discretion choose unless and until the Legislature expressly amends their enabling acts to subject them to air pollution control regulation. This contention is, of course, inconsistent with the argument that the Legislature intended to free the Authority from State regulation to the same extent that a private business is free from such regulation. Because private businesses are subject to air pollution control regulation under \u00a7\u00a7 142A-142E, it follows that the Authority should also be subject to such regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">The defendants cite several special acts which, they argue, demonstrate the Legislature\u2019s understanding that the Authority\u2019s enabling act must be amended if the Authority is to be subjected to any type of regulation by a State agency. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>See St. 1961, c. 384; St. 1962, c. 760; St. 1971, c. 295. The acts cited, however, demonstrate no more than that the Legislature has on occasion expressly referred to the Authority in legislation which it wishes to be applicable to the Authority. In fact, these acts undermine the defendants\u2019 argument in that in two of them the Legislature did not bother to amend the Authority\u2019s enabling act. For example, St. 1971, c. 295, provides that, \u201c[notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary,\u201d the Authority must submit lists of its tax-exempt property to, inter alla, the State Department of Corporations and Taxation. Nothing in that act expressly amends the enabling act, yet the defendants do not suggest that the Authority is free to ignore its requirements.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Even more significant is St. 1962, c. 760, which empowers the Authority and three other named authorities to bargain collectively with their employees. In addition, \u201c[notwithstanding any provision of law to the .contrary,\u201d the Authority is made subject to the provisions of various sections of G. L. c. 150A dealing with labor relations. Once again there is no express amendment of the Authority\u2019s enabling act, yet among the provisions of c. 150A which are made applicable to the Authority are \u00a7\u00a7 5, 6, 6A and 7, which give the State Labor Relations Commission various powers to regulate elections of collective bargaining representatives, to determine collective bargaining units, and to investigate and prevent unfair labor practices. Quite clearly St. 1962, c. 760, subjects the Authority to regulation by a State commission without any amendment of the enabling act expressly authorizing such regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">The defendants, apparently realizing that the special acts cited do not support the contention that \u00a7 2 requires express amendment of the enabling act, advance the alternative argument that those acts at least demonstrate that \u00a7 2 \u201crequires special legislation specifically applicable to the Authority in order to subject it to state regulation.\u201d But even this more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>limited interpretation is undermined by G. L. c. 22, \u00a7 13A, which, by general law, expressly subjects the Authority (at least in so far as it owns \u201cpublic buildings\u201d) to regulation by the State board to facilitate the use of public buildings by the physically handicapped. Thus, it would appear that the defendants\u2019 argument is reduced to the proposition that \u00a7 2 of the enabling act exempts the Authority from all State regulation except such as is authorized by a statute, either general or special, which contains express reference to the Authority. As to this final argument, however, we hold that the language \u201ca// . . . authorities\u201d (emphasis supplied), used in G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 142E, is sufficient to encompass the Authority even absent any explicit reference. It seems to us reasonable to believe that the Legislature would have chosen another adjective if it had intended to reach less than \u201call\u201d authorities. \u201c[Wjhere the language of a statute is plain there is no room for speculation as to its meaning or its implication. The Legislature must be presumed to have meant what the words plainly say . . ..\u201d <em>Condon </em>v. <em>Haitsma, </em>325 Mass. 371,373 (1950).<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">In conclusion, we emphasize the narrow basis of our present decision on this issue. It is clear that the language of the enabling act that the Authority \u201cshall not be subject to the supervision or regulation of . . . any department... of the commonwealth ...\u201d was intended to have some effect. However, we believe it is unnecessary to attempt a definition in general terms of the precise scope of the Authority\u2019s \u201cexemption\u201d from the several jurisdictions of the various State regulatory and supervisory bodies.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Thus, our present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>holding is limited to the following: the exempting provision of \u00a7 2 of St. 1956, c. 465, does not exempt the Authority from a regulatory scheme which is designed to alleviate a pervasive public health problem and which, by virtue of the statutes authorizing it, is universally applicable to private and public entities, including \u201c[a] 11. . . authorities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">C. <em>Compliance with G. L. c. 30, </em>\u00a7 <em>61.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">There remains for our consideration the second issue raised by the plaintiff\u2019s bill, which is whether the Authority has adequately complied with the requirements of G. L. c. 30, \u00a761.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">At the same meeting (April 12, 1973) at which the contract for construction of the South Terminal project was authorized, the members of the Authority also adopted a resolution in which it was declared that the Authority had made certain determinations as to the environmental impact of its proposed \u201c1973 Improvements\u201d (one of which was the South Terminal project). The language of the resolution essentially paraphrased the requirements of \u00a7 61 that all authorities \u201cshall review, evaluate, and determine the impact on the natural environment\u201d of their activities and \u201cshall use all practicable means and measures to minimize damage to the environment.\u201d The \u201cfinding\u201d determined by the Authority was that \u201csubstantially no adverse effect on the environment will result from construction of the 1973 Improvements.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> The judge ruled that the resolution of the Authority was on its face conclusive evidence of the Author<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>ity\u2019s compliance with \u00a7 61. In addition, the judge determined that \u00a7 61 must be read in conjunction with \u00a7 62<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> as a \u201ccomprehensive legislative attempt to deal with environmental problems.\u201d Because \u00a7 62 was not effective until July 1, 1973,<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> almost two months after the close of the trial of this case, the trial judge concluded that as to \u00a7 61, there \u201care no specific standards to follow or studies and reports to be made; nor are there any provisions for enforcement; or review of a public body\u2019s compliance with its terms.\u201d His only function, therefore, was to determine whether the Authority \u201ctook cognizance of \u00a7 61.\u201d Since the Authority\u2019s resolution was conclusive evidence on that question, he ruled that there was no violation of \u00a7 61 and, because there was no violation of a statute, there was no basis under G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 10A, for further review of the Authority\u2019s action. The sole question presented by this ruling is whether the judge should have permitted the plaintiff to offer evidence, extrinsic to the resolution, concerning the adequacy of the Authority\u2019s compliance with the requirements of \u00a7 61. We hold that, in the particular factual circumstances of this case, the judge\u2019s ruling was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">The plaintiff vigorously argues that judicial review of the Authority\u2019s compliance with \u00a7 61 is necessary if the requirements of that section are not to be circumvented by mere recitals of the statutory language unsupported by any actual evaluation of environmental impact.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> To this conten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>tian there are two responses. First, it is not to be presumed that public officials, including members of the Authority, will fail to comply with the law. See <em>Comerford </em>v. <em>Meier, </em>302 Mass. 398, 403 (1939), and cases cited. Second, \u00a7 61 gives assurance that the requirements of \u00a7 62 will receive more than mere lip service. As interpreted by the Executive Office of Environmental Affairs, \u00a7 61 should \u201cbe viewed as the last step of a process designed to lead to the full disclosure of environmental impact through the ... \u00a7 62 procedures and then to the actual avoidance or minimizing of adverse environmental impact by decisions made in compliance with . . . \u00a7 61. Section 61 sets the environmental standards for agency decisions, the section 62 process will provide the evidence for such decisions.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Thus, it is the environmental impact report required by \u00a7 62 which is to provide the data on which \u00a7 61 decisions are to be based and against which such decisions may be evaluated.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">Because of the six month interval between the effective dates of \u00a7\u00a7 61 and 62, the Authority was not required to prepare an environmental impact report for the South Terminal project even though it was subject to the requirements of \u00a761.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> The absence of such a report, of course, deprives a reviewing court of the principal source of data which might be used to review the findings and determinations made by the Authority. The plaintiff suggests that we interpret the two \u201cfinding[s]\u201d required by \u00a7 61 as requiring \u201can explanatory statement of the subsidiary facts and reasons which support the agency\u2019s ultimate determination of environmental impact and steps taken to mitigate this impact.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>Such an interpretation would, of course, almost precisely overlap the requirements of \u00a7 62 that an environmental impact report contain \u201cdetailed statements\u201d of the work to be performed and of its environmental impact plus a statement of \u201call measures being utilized to minimize environmental damage.\u201d But the Legislature quite clearly intended to impose no such requirements until July 1, 1973, at least two months after both this action and construction of the South Terminal project were commenced. In effect, the plaintiff here is asking us to abrogate the effect of the staggered effective dates of the statutes by judicially imposing a requirement that the Authority prove its compliance with \u00a7 61 by presenting virtually the same information which would be required in a \u00a7 62 impact report. We decline to circumvent the clear legislative intent in such a manner. The Authority\u2019s resolution contained assertions that the environmental impact of the South Terminal project had been reviewed, evaluated, and determined, and in addition contained both \u201c finding [s]\u201d required by \u00a7 61. Prior to the effective date of \u00a7 62, there was no basis for requiring any additional evidence of the Authority\u2019s compliance with \u00a7 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">Our resolution of this issue is not inconsistent with our prior decisions concerning the proper scope of judicial review of administrative actions. In <em>Cambridge Elec. Light Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Util. </em>363 Mass. 474 (1973), we summarized those decisions. A court reviewing administrative actions which are adjudicatory in nature \u201cshould search the factual and legal basis of the agency action to see that justice was done, and this is helped by the agency\u2019s furnishing an explanatory statement which the court can examine and criticise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 490. On the other hand, as to administrative actions which are regulatory in nature \u201c[n]o such process is needed, nor would it usually be desirable . . .; for the court to check back on the agency\u2019s \u2018reasons\u2019 and \u2018determination[s]\u2019 of fact and law would have an unhealthy tendency to substitute the court for the agency as policymaker.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Although the Authority\u2019s action in making the findings and determination required by \u00a7 61 is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>properly neither \u201cadjudicatory\u201d nor \u201cregulatory,\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> in terms of the purposes to be served by judicial review it is much closer to the latter. Adjudicatory actions are often \u201cquasi judicial decisions involving particular persons\u201d <em>(ibid.),</em><footnotemark><em>41</em></footnotemark><em> </em>wherein a reviewing court has the strongest interest in seeing that justice was done for each individual whose \u201csubstantial rights\u201d may be prejudiced by such decisions. See <em>Salisbury Water Supply Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Util. </em>344 Mass. 716, 718 (1962). The decisions required by \u00a7 61 clearly are not of this sort. Determinations as to impact on the environment made by a public body under \u00a7 61 usually would not directly affect the rights of private parties. Such determinations, then, are not of the type as to which a reviewing court \u201cshould search the factual and legal basis\u201d or require \u201can explanatory statement which . . . [it] can examine and criticise.\u201d <em>Cambridge Elec. Light Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Util., supra, </em>at 490.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">The plaintiff relies on the opinion in <em>West Broadway Task Force, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dept. of Community Affairs, </em>363 Mass. 745 (1973). That case was similar to the present one in that the administrative action challenged, namely, the operation of a housing project by the Boston housing authority under the supervision of the Department of Community Affairs, was neither regulatory nor adjudicatory. The only statutory basis for judicial review was a general policy statement contained in G. L. c. 121B, \u00a7 32, that \u201ceach housing authority shall manage and operate decent, safe and sanitary dwelling accommodations.\u201d We characterized that case as resembling \u201cthose . . . situations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>in which courts have regularly resisted the temptation to substitute their initiative or judgment for that of agencies charged, as the defendant agencies are here charged, with primary responsibility for discretionary choices.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 751. But we also noted that: \u201cCourts, however, have been keen to override traditional limitations and scrutinize agency action when health or life was at stake . . . and the present bill unmistakably and properly announces this theme.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Because there were alternative procedures available to achieve satisfactory operation of the housing project, however, we held that the plaintiffs had not presented a proper case for judicial relief. Their right to bring a similar suit in the event the alternative procedures proved ineffective was expressly reserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">The present plaintiff contends that judicial review of the Authority\u2019s compliance with \u00a7 61 is appropriate under the exception noted in the <em>West Broadway </em>case, because the public health is \u201cat stake\u201d in the control of air pollution. There is no question that decisions made under \u00a7 61 could have substantial consequences for \u201chealth\u201d and even for \u201clife\u201d (although the relationship between administrative decision and consequence to health is not so immediate here as it was in the situation presented in the <em>West Broadway </em>case). But the plaintiff\u2019s argument ignores the actual holding of the <em>West Broadway </em>case, i.e., that the court would not intervene in the administrative agencies\u2019 discretionary decisions until the plaintiffs had exhausted all alternative procedures. The Legislature has provided in \u00a7 62 procedures both for compliance with and for enforcement of the requirements of \u00a7 61,<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> which procedures certainly constitute an \u201calternative\u201d to judicial review and thus should be ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>hausted before judicial review becomes appropriate.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> If \u00a7 61 stood alone our decision on whether administrative action taken pursuant to it is reviewable might be different. Such is not the case, however, and \u00a7 61 must be interpreted in light of the provisions of its companion section. This result is consistent with our holding in the <em>West Broadway </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">Finally the plaintiff has cited numerous decisions from other jurisdictions, both State and Federal, involving the extent to which reviewing courts may, or must, review administrative interpretations of and compliance with environmental statutes. Several of the cases cited are clearly inapposite in that they involve only the question of when, pursuant to the applicable State or Federal statute, administrative bodies are required to submit environmental impact reports analogous to those required by \u00a7 62.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> No such issue is presented by the case now before us. There is no need for detailed review of the other decisions<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> relied on by the plaintiff. In each case the extent to which administrative compliance with environmental laws is subject to judicial review is largely to be determined from the particular statutory context. No case cited by the plaintiff persuades us that our interpretation of the Massachusetts environmental statutes here under consideration, and especially of the chronology of the effective dates of G. L. c. 30, \u00a7\u00a7 61 and 62, is incor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>reel.

L. c. 231A as well as under \u00a7 10A, the city relies primarily on the latter statute. Reliance on \u00a7 10A is proper, we think, as the city might be unable to meet the requirements of c. 231A that there be an actual controversy between the parties to the suit and that all persons with an interest in the suit must be made parties. See, e.g., <em>Povey </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Medford, </em>333 Mass. 70 (1955).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b657-5\">The fact that \u00a7 142B contains its own provisions for resort to the courts to enforce air pollution control regulations does not exclude the operation of \u00a7 10A.

(1972), in which it is implied that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>petition under \u00a7 10A may be brought to prevent violations of G. L. c. 131, \u00a7 40 (as amended through St. 1971, c. 1020). It is significant that c. 131, \u00a7 40, is entirely \u201cprocedural\u201d in that it prescribes the steps to be taken before any dredging or landfill activities may be conducted in certain wetland areas.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b658-7\">The defendants have entered in this court a \u201cMotion to Dismiss Appeal in Part\u201d in which they ask us to dismiss as moot so much of this appeal as relates to the first of the city\u2019s claims. This motion is apparently based on the Commissioner\u2019s decision, based on the Attorney General\u2019s opinion, not to attempt to enforce the Department\u2019s regulations against the Authority. The defendants did not press this motion during oral argument. Indeed, counsel even urged us at that time to reach the merits of certain aspects of this claim. In any case, the fact that there is no present controversy between the Authority and the Department does not foreclose the plaintiff\u2019s right under G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 10A, to assert these claims. We deny the motion for partial dismissal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b658-8\">The precise basis of the judge\u2019s ruling is not clear. He first considered whether \u00a7 142E might be deemed to have repealed \u00a7 2 of the Authority\u2019s enabling act by implication. After quoting the Attorney General\u2019s opinion that no such repeal was implicit in \u00a7 142E, and after stating the rule of construction disfavoring repeals by implication, the judge then went on to consider whether regulations adopted under \u00a7 142D were intended to apply to public bodies such as the Authority. He concluded that \u00a7 142E on its face showed precisely the opposite intention, and he therefore ruled \u201cthat the existing regulations of the Department of Public Health do not apply to the Massachusetts Port Authority.\u201d We assume that the final ruling rested on both grounds considered by the judge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b659-6\">The judge\u2019s precise statement was: \u201c. . . it is questionable whether the regulations in issue apply by their own terms to the South Terminal parking garage. However, in light of the preceding rulings it is not necessary at this time to rule on that issue.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b659-7\">The judge did state in his rulings: \u201cThe regulations upon which the City relies were adopted pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws c. Ill, \u00a7 142D.\u201d We do not infer from this that he did in fact consider the question of the validity of the adoption of the regulations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b659-8\">The defendants assert that the record before this court is sufficient to permit us to consider, and resolve, all four of their \u201cbroad areas of dispute.\u201d We note, however, that subsequent to the close of evidence in the Superior Court both the plaintiff and the defendants have attempted to supplement the record with additional documentary evidence purportedly relevant to the two issues which we have declined to decide. On the day after the entry of the judge\u2019s findings, rulings, and order for decree, the plaintiff ordered in evidence a copy of the minutes of a meeting of the Public Health Council, which minutes purportedly are relevant to whether regulations were ever adopted for the air pollution control district which encompasses Logan Airport. In addition, the defendants have filed in this court a \u201cmotion ... to supplement the record ...\u201d with documentary evidence purportedly relevant to whether the Department\u2019s regulations by their own terms apply to a parking garage. These efforts by the parties to supplement the evidence suggest to us that the present record is not complete as to these two issues. It is therefore appropriate that we leave for the Superior Court on remand not only the resolution of those two issues on which it has not yet ruled but also the determination of what evidence it will consider in reaching that resolution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b659-9\">The citation of \u00a7 142D is made in a letter forwarding the regulations to the Secretary of the Commonwealth, on the cover and in the foreword of the regulations themselves, and in the same places in a subsequent amendment to the regulations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b660-7\">The citations to the Federal statute are to the sections as originally enacted in 1967 and as they existed in 1969 when the State legislative committee was drafting its proposed legislation.

Each such report must itself be submitted for review by the Secretary of Environmental Affairs; the secretary is to issue a written statement declaring whether or not each such report is in compliance with \u00a7 62.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"44\">\n<p id=\"b674-7\">See, e.g., <em>Lathan </em>v. <em>Volpe, </em>455 F. 2d 1111 (9th Cir. 1971); <em>Save Our Ten Acres </em>v. <em>Kreger, 472 </em>F. 2d 463 (5th Cir. 1973); <em>Silva </em>v. <em>Romney, </em>473 F. 2d 287 (1st Cir. 1973); <em>Students Challenging Regulatory Agency Procedures </em>v. <em>United States, </em>346 F.
