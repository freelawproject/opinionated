L. c. 127, \u00a7 90A, as appearing in St. 1972, c. 777, \u00a7 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">The case comes to us on a reservation and report without decision from a justice of this court on a bill in equity for declaratory and injunctive relief and a statement of agreed facts.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">Section 90A of G. L. c. 127, which appears in its entirety in the margin,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> sets forth those circumstances under which a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>committed offender at any State correctional facility may be permitted to be away from that correctional facility for a specified period or periods of time. Of the purposes for which such a furlough may be granted under \u00a7 90A the only one directly involved here is that set forth in clause (f), authorizing a furlough \u201cfor any other reason consistent with the reintegration of a committed offender into the community.\u201d Each plaintiff is serving a sentence of life imprisonment imposed after conviction of murder in the first degree under G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 1. He, therefore, is not entitled to parole unless and until his sentence is commuted by the Governor and Council. G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 2.* **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">The defendants argue that because a person serving a life sentence for murder in the first degree is not entitled to reentry into the community on parole, there is no authority to grant a clause (f) furlough to prisoners such as the plaintiffs. They say that clause (f) is concerned with furloughs for reasons consistent with reintegration of a committed offender into the community and that, therefore, the Legislature did not intend to authorize furloughs under clause (f) to \u201cfirst degree lifers.\u201d The plaintiffs argue in response that, as often happens, the sentence of a person serving a life term for murder in the first degree may be commuted, and, if that occurs, he or she is then eligible for parole. The plaintiffs further argue that \u00a7 90A contains no explicit restriction on clause (f) furloughs for prisoners serving life sentences for murder in the first degree, and none should be implied.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>The sole question for decision is whether \u00a7 90A authorizes a clause (f) furlough for a \u201cfirst degree lifer.\u201d Under \u00a7 90A the commissioner is authorized to \u201cextend the limits of the place of confinement of a committed offender at any state correctional facility by authorizing such committed offender under prescribed conditions to be away from such correctional facility\u201d for certain limited periods of time. Section 90A continues by stating that \u201cno committed offender who is serving a life sentence,\u201d or a sentence for certain listed of-fences, shall be eligible for temporary release \u201cexcept on the recommendation of the superintendent on behalf of a particular committed offender and upon the approval of the commissioner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Section 90A then continues by listing six purposes for which authorization for temporary releases may be permitted. Clause (a) concerns attendance at a funeral of a relative; clause (b) relates to a visit to a critically ill relative; and clause (c) involves obtaining needed medical or social services available neither at the correctional facility nor through existing statutory provisions for hospitalization. Clause (d) involves a furlough \u201cto contact prospective employers\u201d; clause (e) is concerned with a furlough \u201cto secure a suitable residence for use upon release on parole or discharge.\u201d The parties agree that furloughs may be granted to persons serving life sentences for murder in the first degree for the purposes stated in clauses (a), (b), and (c) but not for the purposes stated in clauses (d) and (e). We come then to the language of clause (f) which authorizes temporary release \u201cfor any other reason consistent with the reintegration of a committed offender into the community.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">The plaintiffs assert that the administrative practice of the department to grant furloughs to \u201cfirst degree lifers\u201d should be given weight in resolving any ambiguity in the intended scope of clause (f). The then commissioner of correction and members of his staff participated in the drafting of St. 1972, c. 777, and particularly in the amendment of G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 90A. From the initiation of the furlough program on November 6, 1972, until it was suspended for \u201cfirst <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>degree lifers\u201d on September 12, 1973, 184 furloughs were granted to forty-nine \u201cfirst degree lifers.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> These furloughs were granted under policies and procedures of the department when the superintendent of the respective institution and the commissioner of correction determined in their discretion that the particular inmate qualified under the relevant criteria and deserved to be granted a furlough.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">The plaintiffs argue that these circumstances justify application of the principle that in resolving an ambiguity in a statute, weight may be given to consistent administrative application of that statute, especially if the interpretation is contemporaneous with its enactment and is long continued. <em>Cleary </em>v. <em>Cardullo\u2019s, Inc. </em>347 Mass. 337, 343 (1964). <em>Assessors of Holyoke </em>v. <em>State Tax Commn. </em>355 Mass. 223, 243-244 (1969). Here the department of correction, which actively participated in the enactment of \u00a7 90A in its present form, made an interpretation contemporaneous with the enactment of \u00a7 90A that clause (f) permits the temporary release of persons serving life sentences for murder in the first degree, and that department has, as far as appears, consistently maintained that position. The department\u2019s interpretation of clause (f), however, although applied in numerous instances in the months following the effectiveness of the amendment to \u00a7 90A, is not one of long standing. In spite of this limiting circumstance, we believe that the department\u2019s construction of \u00a7 90A, a statute whose administration is in its charge, is entitled to some weight in resolving any ambiguity in the scope of clause (f). See <em>School Comm. of Springfield </em>v. <em>Board of Educ. </em>362 Mass. 417, 441 n. 22 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">We hold that clause (f) of \u00a7 90A authorizes the granting of a furlough to a person who is serving a life sentence for murder in the first degree. Clause (f) contains no express lim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>itation as to the committed offenders who may be granted temporary release for the purpose there stated. \u201c[U]nless the context otherwise <em>requires\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied), committed offender means any \u201cperson convicted of a crime and committed, under sentence, to a correctional facility.\u201d G. L. c. 125, \u00a7 1, as appearing in St. 1972, c. 777, \u00a7 8.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The words \u201ccommitted offender\u201d in the context of clause (f) are not required to have a more limited meaning. In fact, the context may suggest that all persons serving life sentences, including persons serving such terms for murder in the first degree, are included in the words \u201ccommitted offender\u201d in clause (f). In an earlier portion of \u00a7 90A the Legislature adverted to persons serving life sentences, set forth a special requirement of recommendation and approval of their temporary release, and did nothing further to limit the rights of persons serving life sentences.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Looked at simply in terms of the words of clause (f), the temporary release of a person serving a life sentence for murder in the first degree could be found by the appropriate superintendent and the commissioner of correction to be \u201cconsistent with the reintegration of . . . [the] offender into the community.\u201d A clause (f) furlough is permitted for <em>any reason consistent </em>with such reintegration. There is no requirement in clause (f) that integration into the community be imminent or certain. In short, clause (f) seems clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>designed to authorize the penal authorities, as experts in the field, to grant furloughs to any committed offender, on a case by case basis and subject to limitations and safeguards, whenever those authorities conclude that such a furlough is deserved and will be consistent with reintegration of the offender into society.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">The defendants urge that the context of clause (f) requires a construction which denies authorization for a clause (f) furlough for any person serving a life term for murder in the first degree. They correctly point out that such a prisoner cannot be paroled until his or her sentence is commuted and that commutation may never occur. However, we know that life sentences for murder in the first degree are from time to time commuted. One plaintiff has had his petition for commutation of sentence approved by the advisory board of pardons and by the Governor and is awaiting action on his petition by the Governor\u2019s Council. Other plaintiffs have filed petitions for commutation of sentence which have not been acted on. The fact that a committed offender who is serving a life sentence for murder in the first degree has an additional legal barrier to clear before he may be paroled may have a bearing on the reasonableness of the granting of a particular furlough. However, because that barrier is not insurmountable,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> we see no justification for concluding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>the temporary release of a \u201cfirst degree lifer\u201d can never be \u201cconsistent with . . . [his] reintegration into the community.\u201d In fact a furlough may produce information, not otherwise obtainable, about the capacity of such an offender to become a law abiding, effective member of the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">The defendants further argue that because of the particular circumstances in which it was rendered, weight should be given to the opinion on the scope of clause (f) which the Attorney General submitted to the House of Representatives on June 21, 1973. On May 29, 1973, the House adopted an order requesting from the Attorney General an opinion whether under clause (f) a furlough was properly given to a \u201cfirst degree lifer\u201d who did not return pursuant to the terms of his furlough. The order recited the pendency of bills proposing changes in \u00a7 90A, one of which would exclude from the benefits of \u00a7 90A a person convicted of murder in the first degree. See 1973 House Bill No. 6788. See also 1973 House Bill No. 6369, \u00a7 2, which would deny furloughs to all persons serving life sentences (and to certain other offenders). The Attorney General concluded in his opinion that \u201ca temporary release of a committed offender serving a life sentence and not eligible for parole ... is not authorized by clause (f).\u201d No action amending \u00a7 90A has since been taken.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The defendants argue that the failure of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>Legislature in 1973 to amend clause (f) to authorize furloughs for \u201cfirst degree lifers\u201d should be interpreted as an indorsement by the Legislature of the Attorney General\u2019s interpretation of the intention of the Legislature in adopting clause (f) in 1972. Legislative nonaction in 1973 with respect to clause (f), however, does not furnish a reliable guide to the intention of the Legislature in enacting clause (f) in 1972. See <em>Helvering </em>v. <em>Hallock, </em>309 U. S. 106, 119-121 (1940); <em>Wong Yang Sung </em>v. <em>McGrath, </em>339 U. S. 33, 47-48 (1950). In any event the legislative circumstances in 1973 fail to disclose a clear indication of the intention of the Legislature during its 1973 session concerning clause (f), even if it were material to the intention of the next prior Legislature. The failure to enact clarifying legislation in the face of a continuing controversy over the scope of clause (f) is at best ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">A decree shall be entered declaring that persons serving sentences of life imprisonment imposed after conviction of first degree murder under G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 1, are eligible for temporary release under clause (f) of G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 90A, as appearing in St. 1972, c. 777, \u00a7 18, in the discretion of the appropriate correctional officials.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We stress, however, the fact that a \u201cfirst degree lifer,\u201d and certain other inmates, may be granted a clause (f) furlough only on recommendation of the appropriate superintendent and on approval of the commissioner, whose approval we take to be nondelegable. In seeking an exercise of that administrative discretion in his or her favor, a \u201cfirst degree lifer,\u201d among all committed offenders, has the heaviest burden to meet.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b446-7\">In September, 1973, the various defendant superintendents stopped accepting furlough applications under clause (i) from persons serving life sentences for murder in the first degree, including applications from the plaintiffs. The department of correction concluded that, until changed by judicial determination or by legislation, it must follow the interpretation of clause (f) which was given by the Attorney General in an opinion to the House of Representatives on June 21, 1973. In that opinion the Attorney General concluded that persons serving life sentences for murder in the first degree are not entitled to furloughs under clause (f) of \u00a7 90A. Rep. A. G., Pub. Doc. No. 12 (1973), p. 150 (Opinions of the Attorney General, No. 47 [June 21, 1973]).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">There is no question here concerning the furlough rights under clause (f) of those committed offenders who were convicted of murder in the second degree and punished by imprisonment for life. Each prisoner serving a sentence for life in a correctional institution in the Commonwealth, except one at the institution in Bridgewater or one \u201cserving a life sentence for murder in the first degree,\u201d is eligible for parole after serving fifteen years of that life sentence. G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 133A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b446-9\">\u201cThe commissioner may extend the limits of the place of confinement of a committed offender at any state correctional facility by authorizing such committed offender under prescribed conditions to be away from such correctional facility but within the commonwealth for a specified period of time, not to exceed fourteen days during any twelve month period nor more than seven days at any one time; provided that no committed offender who is serving a life sentence or a sentence in a state correctional facility for violation of section 13, 13B, 14, 15, 15 A, 15B, 16, 17, 18, 18A, 19, 20, 21, 22, 22A, 23, 24, 24B, 25, or 26 of chapter 265, or section 17, 34, 35 or 35A, of Chapter 272, or for an attempt to commit any crime referred to in said sections shall be eligible for temporary release under the provisions of this section except on the recommendation of the superintendent on behalf of a particular committed offender and upon the approval of the commissioner. The administrator of a county correctional facility may grant like authorization to a committed offender in such facility. Such authorization may be granted for any of the following purposes: (a) to attend the funeral of a relative; (b) to visit a critically ill relative; (c) to obtain medical, psychiatric, psychological or other social services when adequate services are not available at the facility and cannot be obtained by temporary placement in a hospital under sections one hundred and seventeen, one hundred and seventeen A, and one hundred and eighteen; (d) to contact prospective employers; (e) to secure a suitable residence for use upon release on parole or discharge; (f) for any other reason consistent with the reintegration of a committed offender into the community. For the purposes of this section the word \u2018relative\u2019 shall mean the committed offender\u2019s father, mother, child, brother, sister, husband or wife and, if his grandparent, uncle, aunt or foster parent acted as his parent in rearing such committed offender, it shall also mean such grandparent, uncle, aunt or foster parent.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-10\">\u201cA person away from a correctional facility pursuant to this section may be accompanied by an employee of the department in the discretion of the commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>sioner, or an officer of a county correctional facility, in the discretion of the administrator.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-8\">\u201cAny expenses incurred under the provisions of this section may be paid by the correctional facility in which the committed offender is committed. A committed offender shall, during his absence from a correctional facility under this section, be considered as in the custody of the correctional facility and the time of such absence shall be considered as part of the term of sentence.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b447-9\">Information incorporated in the statement of agreed facts covering the period from November 6, 1972, to March 25, 1973, indicates that the 104 persons serving terms for murder in the first degree represented 5.3% of the residents in the Massachusetts State correctional system (excluding mental patients and alcoholics at Bridgewater). Thirty-eight \u201cfirst degree lifers\u201d received approximately 2.4% of the 2,966 furloughs granted during that period. It does not appear how many, if any of these 104 persons listed as having committed murder in the first degree have had their sentences commuted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b449-7\">Only one such person \u201cescaped.\u201d We do not know from the statement of agreed facts how many of these 184 furloughs were granted prior to that \u201cescape.\u201d That \u201cescape\u201d provoked the controversy which led to the order of the House of Representatives requesting the opinion of the Attorney General and ultimately to the filing of this suit. We do know that seventy-one of these furloughs were granted prior to March 25, 1973.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b450-6\">We think it is of some significance in interpreting \u00a7 90A that the definition of \u201ccommitted offender\u201d was added to the General Laws in the same act that adopted \u00a7 90A in its present form.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b450-7\">The failure of the Legislature to make a specific exception in clause (f) for persons serving life sentences for murder in the first degree, where it has done so in other statutes, suggests an intention not to exclude \u201cfirst degrfee lifers\u201d from the benefits of clause (f). See <em>Commissioner of the Dept. of Community Affairs </em>v. <em>Boston Redevelopment Authy. </em>362 Mass. 602, 613-614 (1972). For a statute expressly excluding persons serving life terms for first degree murder from the benefits of legislation, see G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 83B, as amended by St. 1972, c. 172, \u00a7 2, excluding any \u201cprisoner serving a life sentence for first degree murder\u201d from those male prisoners who may be given the opportunity to work on reforestation, maintenance and development of certain State forests; and G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 83A, as amended by St. 1972, c. 172, \u00a7 1, to the same effect. This legislation making explicit reference to those serving a sentence for life for murder in' the first degree in G; L. c. 127 was enacted during the same session of the same Legislature which enacted \u00a7 90A of G. L. c. 127 in its present form. See also G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 133A, as appearing in St. 1965, c. 766, \u00a7 1, for a statute expressly carving out an exception for \u201cfirst degree lifers.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b451-6\">Although not set forth in the statement of agreed facts, the bill alleges circumstances for which one or more of plaintiffs have apparently obtained furloughs. These include: participation in a national symposium on education at the University of Massachusetts; testimony before a committee of the General Court; participation in radio and television programs, such as panel discussions and talk shows; receipt of an award presented by the Massachusetts Council on Crime and Correction; making speeches at schools, colleges and elsewhere; and collecting information and making arrangements in connection with the offender\u2019s commutation petition. Clearly activities such as these (and no doubt others) are consistent with the offender\u2019s reintegration into the community, even if that reintegration may occur only after commutation of the offender\u2019s sentence and a subsequent determination of the parole board.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b451-7\">A 1973 letter of the superintendent of one State correctional institution to the acting commissioner of correction is incorporated in the statement of agreed facts. In that letter he wrote: \u201c[I]t is a historical tradition that we do not allow men to die of old age in prison.

The closest approximation of this probability of parole, based on figures projected from the earlier part of the century, is approximately three-quarters.\u201d Of the thirty-seven individuals whose death sentences were commuted between 1898 and May 15, 1971, seventeen had been paroled, fifteen were still incarcerated and five had died in prison, as of May 15, 1971.
