The issue raised is whether complaints under art. II of the State Sanitary Code may be brought by one who is neither a tenant nor a city or State inspector. We hold that they may.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-15\">The complainant is an inspector of the Neighborhood Association of the Back Bay. He brought complaints against the defendant as the owner of premises in Boston constituting dwellings, charging violations of art. II of the State Sanitary Code with respect to garbage, rubbish or other refuse. The judge held that the association has no official status or enforcement powers, but found the defendant guilty, imposed fines, and denied motions for a new trial and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>set aside the findings. \u201cBeing of the opinion that these cases present questions of such importance as to require the decision of the Supreme Judicial Court,\u201d he reported the questions with the defendant\u2019s consent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">1. The Housing Court of the City of Boston was established by G. L. c. 185A, inserted by St. 1971, c. 843, \u00a7 1. Compare G. L. c. 185B, inserted by St. 1973, c. 591, \u00a7 1, establishing the Housing Court of the County of Hampden. Under G. L. c. 185A, \u00a7 3,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> it has jurisdiction, \u201cconcurrent with the district courts and the superior court,\u201d of certain crimes, including crimes arising under so much of G. L. c. 111, \u00a7 127A, and of any regulation as is \u201cconcerned with the health, safety or welfare of any occupant of any place used, or intended for use, as a place of human habitation.\u201d Criminal proceedings are commenced \u201cby complaint in like manner as in a district court.\u201d G. L. c. 185A, \u00a7 20.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>means, that the clerk \u201cmay receive complaints\u201d and \u201cadminister to complainants the oath required thereto.\u201d G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 33. In general, cases are to be \u201cheard and determined by the housing court sitting without a jury,\u201d but there is to be a jury trial in the Housing Court if constitutionally required and not waived. G. L. c. 185A, \u00a7 23. There is no provision for appeal in criminal cases to the Superior Court. See G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 18; <em>Mann </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>359 Mass. 661, 664-665 (1971). Instead, a party aggrieved by a \u201cfinal judgment of the housing court\u201d may appeal \u201cdirectly to the full court of the supreme judicial court.\u201d G. L. c. 185A, \u00a7 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">\u201cIn all matters within its jurisdiction,\u201d the Housing Court has \u201call the powers of the superior court in actions at law and suits in equity.\u201d See fn. 2. In addition, explicit provision is made for reports to this court when the judge makes \u201can interlocutory order or decree at law or in equity.\u201d G. L. c. 185 A, \u00a7 29. A report is also explicitly authorized after verdict or finding in an action at law. G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 111, as amended by St. 1973, c. 591, \u00a7 11. But the provisions of G. L. c. 278, \u00a7\u00a7 30 and 30A, for reports by judges of the Superior Court in criminal cases have not been expressly made applicable to the Housing Court. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cronin, </em>245 Mass. 163, 164-165 (1923).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">Nevertheless, we think the Legislature has sufficiently indicated its intention that appellate review of decisions of the Housing Court is to be had directly by this court, and that the judge of the Housing Court is to exercise the powers of a Superior Court judge to that end. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Henry\u2019s Drywall, Inc. </em>362 Mass. 552, 555, n. 4 (1972). This is obviously the view taken by the judge of the Housing Court, and no contrary argument has been made to us. The issue presented by the judge\u2019s questions is of public importance; it has been fully argued to us, and even if we had found it necessary to dismiss the report as not properly before us, we should nevertheless have felt warranted in expressing our views. See <em>Wellesley College </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen. </em>313 Mass. 722, 731 (1943); <em>Vautier, petitioner, </em>340 Mass. 341, 344 (1960); <em>Maldonado, petitioner, ante, </em>359, 366.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>2. In general, anyone may make a criminal complaint in a District Court who is competent to make oath to it. General statutes imposing a duty to prosecute on particular public officials are read as directory only, and do not exclude the right of any other citizen to enter complaints for a violation of the law. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tobias, </em>141 Mass. 129, 132 (1886). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carroll, </em>145 Mass. 403, 406 (1888). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>147 Mass. 577, 578 (1888). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gay, </em>153 Mass. 211, 217 (1891). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McDonnell, </em>157 Mass. 407, 409-410 (1892). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mullen, </em>176 Mass. 132, 134 (1900). Although the attendance of the district attorney is required by statute in the Superior Court, his appearance in District Courts within his district is discretionary. G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 27. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Buck, </em>285 Mass. 41, 43 (1933). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Coshnear, </em>289 Mass. 516, 521 (1935).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">Under a statute formerly in effect, certain fines and forfeitures enured to the use of cities and towns and could only be recovered by complaint in the name of the treasurer of a city or town. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fahey, </em>5 Cush. 408, 411 (1850). Authority to make such complaints was subsequently given to a city marshal or other police officer as well as the treasurer, but a constable still lacked the authority. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>111 Mass. 407, 408 (1873). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rawson, </em>183 Mass. 491, 493 (1903); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mekelburg, </em>235 Mass. 383, 385-386 (1920). Compare St. 1904, c. 277, \u00a7 2, extending the authority to town police officers. The statutes on which those decisions were based disappeared in the revision of 1921. See G. L. c. 41, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 36 (1921). Fines and forfeitures under laws relative to health still enure to the use of cities and towns. G. L. c. 111, \u00a7\u00a7 188, 189. Sums received by the clerk of the Housing Court are to be paid to the treasurer of the city. G. L. c. 185A, \u00a7 19. General Laws c. 111, \u00a7 30, continues to provide that a health inspector \u201cmay\u201d make complaint of violations of health laws, but does not prohibit any person not an inspector from making complaint. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>v. <em>Alden, </em>143 Mass. 113,118 (1886), with <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mullen, </em>176 Mass. 132, 134(1900).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">3. The defendant contends that the statute authorizing the State Sanitary Code excludes private complaints. G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 127A, as amended by St. 1971, c. 261.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> That statute provides for enforcement by local boards of health and by the State Department of Public Health. Sections 127C and 127H provide for the filing of petitions by affected tenants. These provisions on their face relate primarily to civil proceedings to enforce the code. They may also impose a duty on certain public officials to seek criminal complaints in appropriate cases, but they do not prohibit other persons from making complaints. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tobias, </em>141 Mass. 129, 132 (1886). The danger of harassment is mitigated by a statutory provision that the person against whom a complaint is made may oppose the issuance of process based on the complaint. G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 35A.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">The primary purpose of the code is to prevent violations rather than to punish past violations as criminal offences. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hadley, </em>351 Mass. 439, 442 (1966). But criminal enforcement by fine is explicitly authorized. In establishing the Housing Court, the Legislature rejected proposed language which would have required proceedings to collect criminal fines to be brought by the Commissioner of Housing Inspection. Compare 1971 House Doc. No. 4202, \u00a7 1, proposing the insertion of G. L. c. 214B, \u00a7 23, and 1971 House Doc. No. 956, \u00a7 1, proposing the insertion of G. L. c. 214A, \u00a7 23, with G. L. c. 185A, \u00a7 20. See 1965 House Doc. No. 4040, p. 61, stating \u201cthat a many-pronged attack is needed to bring about effective enforcement of housing codes, one that provides \u2018carrots\u2019 as well as \u2018sticks.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>4.
