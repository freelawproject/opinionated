In February, 1973, he is removed for failure to attend three consecutive meetings. Is he eligible to be a candidate for selectman at the annual town election held on March 3, 1973? The town counsel said No, relying on our decision in <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Election Commrs. of Cambridge, </em>269 Mass. 67 (1929). A Superior Court judge ruled Yes. We agree with the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">The judge filed a document entitled \u201cFindings, Rulings and Order for Judgment,\u201d and adopted it as a report of material facts. We summarize the facts shown by his findings and the exhibits. The petitioners sought a writ of mandamus to direct the town clerk to place the name of the petitioner Rugg on the town ballot as a candidate for selectman. Donahue, a candidate for selectman, was allowed to intervene. Rugg was appointed to the finance committee on June 10, 1971. Under art. 8, \u00a7 1, of the town by-laws, his term was to expire on the seventh day after the final adjournment of the annual town meeting in 1974. On February 13, 1973, pursuant to art. 8, \u00a7 3, of the town by-laws, he was duly removed from the finance committee for failure to attend three consecutive meetings. He seasonably filed nomination papers and was otherwise duly qualified to run for the office of selectman. If he and another candidate similarly situated were ruled off the ballot, only two candidates would remain for the two selectman positions to be filled.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">An order for judgment was entered on February 20, 1973, directing the town clerk to place the name of the petitioner Rugg on the ballot as a candidate for selectman in the annual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>town election on March 3, 1973, and the intervener Donahue appealed. On February 22, 1973, a single justice of this court suspended the order pending appeal and ordered that the ballots for the election not contain the name of the petitioner Rugg as a candidate for selectman.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">We are informed by counsel that on February 27, 1973, a judge of the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts denied a petition by Rugg for an injunction, stating that it would abstain pending determination of the present case by us. We are also informed that the petitioner Rugg organized a \u201csticker\u201d campaign, and that he received the second highest number of votes of the four candidates for two positions. The intervener Donahue ran fourth. Finally, we are informed that the town clerk, under instructions of the town counsel, does not intend to swear in any of the candidates pending our determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">1. In <em>Wood v. Election Commrs. of Cambridge, </em>269 Mass. 67 (1929), a member of a school committee was denied the right to be a candidate for mayor in circumstances similar to those of the present case. The governing statute, G. L. c. 43, \u00a7 32, as it then read,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> was very similar to the Arlington statute here in issue. It did not appear that the petitioner in the <em>Wood </em>case had ceased to be a \u201cmember\u201d of the school committee, but the court clearly expressed the opinion that termination of membership would not affect the operation of the statute: \u201cA member of the school committee who resigns or otherwise ends his service before the expiration of the term for which he was elected is as completely within its prohibition as one continuing his service to the end of the term.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 68.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">The petitioners seek to distinguish the <em>Wood </em>case on several highly technical grounds, but we have little doubt that those who decided that case would have regarded it as controlling here. Where the Legislature employs language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>which has previously been judicially construed, it is ordinarily presumed to have adopted the judicially declared meaning. <em>See Randall's Case, </em>331 Mass. 383, 386(1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">The Arlington statute, like the <em>Wood </em>statute, is on its face primarily a prohibition against holding two offices at the same time. It may be doubted that it would occur to a legislative draftsman or reader that it would carry the meaning given it in the <em>Wood </em>case. That doubt is reinforced when the provision is but one part of a comprehensive town manager statute for the town. Moreover, the force of the usual presumption is weakened by the fact that the <em>Wood </em>statute was amended to overrule that decision (see fn. 3); amendment in such cases may well be an assertion of the original intention rather than a manifestation of changed intention.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Nevertheless, we should feel uncomfortable in reconsidering matters considered in the <em>Wood </em>case in the absence of the petitioners\u2019 constitutional attack on the <em>Wood </em>case as resulting in a denial of equal protection of the laws. This court in the <em>Wood </em>case held that the statute as interpreted violated no provision of the Massachusetts Constitution. We referred to \u201creasonable regulations imposed by law\u201d and to an office \u201cvoluntarily accepted\u201d upon conditions, and said,</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">\u201cBroad considerations of public policy well may be thought to support such a restriction upon the political activities of those charged with the delicate and important responsibilities of official supervision of the public schools.\u201d 269 Mass, at 69-70. We did not purport to decide any Federal constitutional question.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">Since that time we have been instructed that statutes which tend to produce inequality among voters may not be sustained if they can be shown to have merely \u201csome rational basis,\u201d \u2014 they must rather withstand \u201ca more rigid standard of review,\u201d and that \u201cthe rights of voters and the rights of candidates do not lend themselves to neat separation . . ..\u201d <em>Bullock </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>405 U. S. 134, 142-143 (1972). See <em>Tsongas </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>362 Mass. 708, 722 (1972) (dissenting opinion). The opinion in the <em>Wood </em>case, like other opinions of the time on similar issues, did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>articulate the considerations of public policy thought to support the restriction. See, e.g., <em>Wachter </em>v. <em>McEvoy, </em>125 Md. 399, 408 (1915); annotations, 5 A. L. R. 117 (1920), 40 A. L. R. 945 (1926). Counsel in the present case have been unable to supply any very convincing rationale for the restriction.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">The opinion in the <em>Wood </em>case does suggest that there may have been a legislative purpose to penalize a person who gives up an office before completing its stated period of service. Whether such a purpose satisfies the \u201cmore rigid standard of review\u201d presents a constitutional question sufficiently serious, in our view, to justify reopening what might otherwise be a settled question of interpretation. It is our duty, if reasonably possible, so to interpret the statute as to avoid unnecessary decision of serious constitutional questions. See <em>First Natl. Bank </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen. </em>362 Mass. 570, 577 (1972) (opinion of Tauro, C.J.), <em>id. </em>at 594-596 (opinion of Quirico, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">2. Free of the precedential force of the <em>Wood </em>case, which arose in a different constitutional context, we have little difficulty with the interpretation of the Arlington statute. It forbids a \u201cmember\u201d of the finance committee to \u201chold\u201d the office of selectman. When the officer resigns or is removed, he ceases to be a \u201cmember\u201d and is not subject to the prohibition. Thus the statute is confined to its obvious purpose of preventing one person from holding two of the specified offices at the same time. This reading fits the next sentence of the same section, which permits dual office-holding for other offices.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Contrast art. 65 of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution, which applies to a \u201cperson elected to the general court\u201d rather than to a \u201cmember.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">This interpretation does not deprive of meaning the words \u201cduring the term for which he was elected or appointed.\u201d Compare <em>Wachter </em>v. <em>McEvoy, </em>125 Md. 399, 408 (1915); <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>Lennon, </em>86 Mich. 468, 473-474 (1891). Under G. L. c. 41, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>\u00a7\u00a7 1 and 107, and St. 1952, c. 503, \u00a7 3, members of the board of selectmen or school committee serve during the terms fixed by law and until their successors are qualified. Similarly, under St. 1952, c. 503, \u00a7 33, and art. 8, \u00a7 1, of the Arlington by-laws, members of the finance committee serve for terms of three years and \u201ccontinue to act as such until their successors are appointed.\u201d Thus a member may hold over after his term has expired, but the period of holdover is not \u201cduring the term for which he was elected or appointed.\u201d Hence the statutory ineligibility for other town office does not apply during the period of holdover.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">3. The judge was therefore correct in ruling that the petitioner Rugg was eligible to hold the office of selectman after he was removed from the finance committee, and the order appealed from was correct at the time it was entered. A new judgment must now be entered in the trial court taking account of intervening events. See <em>Vigoda </em>v. <em>Superintendent of Boston State Hosp. </em>336 Mass. 724, 726 (1958); <em>Carilli </em>v. <em>Hersey, </em>303 Mass. 82, 84 (1939); <em>Capp </em>v. <em>Chamberlain Real Estate, Inc. </em>355 Mass. 58, 61-62 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">The case is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b276-8\">\u201c. .No member of the school committee, except the mayor, shall [during the term for which he is elected], hold any other office or position the salary or compensation for which is payable out of the city treasury. . . .\u201d By St. 1949, c. 318, the words in brackets were deleted and the words \u201cwhile a member thereof\u201d were substituted.
