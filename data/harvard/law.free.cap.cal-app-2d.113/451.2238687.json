Luce. Witnessed by Bonnie Hooper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">A witness testified that when the cattle reached Ely, Nevada, they were drawn and gaunt; not in fit condition to be insured. The inference inevitably results that the cattle were not properly handled in transportation, from the Hooper ranch where plaintiff received them, to Ely, Nevada, and therefore supports the trial court\u2019s finding of negligence upon the part of plaintiff in view of the fact there was testimony that cattle ordinarily received were not in such condition, but were in good and insurable condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">Second: <em>Was there substantial evidence to sustain the trial court\u2019s finding that defendant\u2019s damage was $2,3621</em></p>\n<p id=\"b470-10\"><em>Yes. </em>The evidence disclosed that the animals that died as a result of plaintiff\u2019s negligence were worth $800; that a steer which was lost weighed around 800 pounds, and was worth 22 cents per pound, or a total of approximately $176; that the normal shrinkage in shipments of this class is 8 per cent, and that the actual shrinkage due to plaintiff\u2019s negligence was 18 per cent, therefore there was a shrinkage of 10 per cent over the normal in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-11\">The evidence disclosed, predicated upon the foregoing finding, that the difference in the value of the cattle when received by plaintiff and when they reached their destination was $2,980. Since plaintiff was entitled to a credit of $618, the contract price for the shipment, defendant\u2019s damage was $2,362, the sum for which the court gave judgment in favor of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>It is obvious that the questioned finding is supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">Moore, P. J., and Fox, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">A petition for a rehearing was denied October 21, 1952.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b470-12\"> The action was duly transferred to the superior court for trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
