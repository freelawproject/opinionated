J.</author>\n<p id=\"A8E\">In proceedings before the State Board of Equalization on an accusation charging the sale of liquor to a minor the board ordered a 15-day suspension of the liquor license. This proceeding in mandamus was brought by the licensees to review the proceedings before the board. The attack on the suspension order was based on the claim that the evidence was insufficient to support it. The trial court so held.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>The licensees sold a bottle of beer to a 19-year-old member of the Coast Guard on his presentation of an out-of-state motor vehicle driver\u2019s license identifying a party over the age of 21. Soon thereafter two members of the Navy Shore Patrol entered the premises and questioned the purchaser. He admitted that the driver\u2019s license belonged to a friend and that he was a minor. The licensees defend their sale on the provisions of section 61.2(b) of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act [2 Deering\u2019s Gen. Laws, Act 3796] which reads: \u201cIn any criminal prosecution, or any proceeding for the suspension or revocation of any license issued under this act and based upon violation of said Section 61, proof that the defendant licensee or his agent or employee demanded and was shown, before furnishing any alcoholic beverage to a minor, a motor vehicle operator\u2019s license or a registration certificate issued under the Federal Selective Service Act or other bona fide documentary evidence of majority and identity of such person, shall be a defense to such prosecution or proceeding for the suspension or revocation of any license.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b484-3\">At the hearing before the State Board the hearing officer found that the accused \u201cdid not establish a defense to the above proceeding under Section 61.2(b) of the act.\u201d'The trial court held that this finding was not supported \u201cby any substantial evidence\u201d and annulled the order of the State Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">We are inclined to agree with the ruling of the superior court because the statute does not impose upon the licensee the duty of determining at his peril whether the driver\u2019s license is a bona fide license of the party presenting it. Possession of the license is presumptive evidence that the license belonged to the holder. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1963, subd. 11.) To hold otherwise would require the attendant to determine at his peril whether the driver\u2019s license had been legally issued, whether it had not been revoked or suspended, and whether the party presenting it was in truth and fact the legitimate holder of the paper.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">There is really no conflict in the evidence\u2014just a shade of difference in the suspicions the witnesses might have drawn from the personal appearance of the boy. It is conceivable that a member of the Shore Patrol would have more experience in guessing the age of a member of the uniformed service than would one whose daily duties were confined to attending bar. Unless the personal appearance of the holder of the driver\u2019s license demonstrates above mere suspicion that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>he is not the legal owner of the license the bartender is justified in assuming the validity of the driver\u2019s license and in accepting the holder as the legal owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">The hearing officer of the State Board made no finding of fact relating to the presentation and inspection of the driver\u2019s license. He drew the conclusion that a defense was not established under section 61.2(b) of the Control Act. The trial court found that there was no substantial evidence to support that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">In a somewhat similar case <em>(Young </em>v. <em>State Board of Equalization, </em>90 Cal.App.2d 256, 258 [202 P.2d 587]) the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-6\">\u201cAs we read the section (61.2(b)) of the act, a defense was established when the clerk Seahorn demanded identification of Taylor and was shown the registration certificate. The wording of the section indicates that such a registration certificate is bona fide documentary evidence of majority and identity. The clerk, if he acted in good faith and without actual knowledge, gained from the appearance of the purchaser, or otherwise, that the card did not or could not belong to the minor, and if the alteration was with reasonable diligence not discernible or ascertainable, had a right to assume that anyone presenting such a card would not unlawfully possess or use it. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">Goodell, J., and Dooling, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">A petition for a rehearing was denied November 1, 1952, and appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied November 25, 1952.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
