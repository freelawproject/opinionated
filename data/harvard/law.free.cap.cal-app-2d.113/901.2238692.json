L. Harcourt</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b922-10\">\u201cOK</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b922-11\">/s/ W. A. Bundy\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b922-12\">During the period covered by this agreement appellant received daily pack records as well as weekly pack records,  Also during this period while appellant was making sales of respondent's products, the respondent was also on divers occasions selling direct through other outlets. However, during the entire period in question respondent first offered its merchandise to appellant and only sold through other outlets when appellant failed, neglected or was unable to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-13\">It was stipulated that during the course of this relationship the appellant handled other canned goods under his own label as a principal and also as agent for other canners \u201cwhich were directly competitive with the goods produced by respondent.\u201d The evidence indicates that when appellant received an order for canned goods he did not consider himself obligated to sell respondent\u2019s goods in preference to those of other competitive products he was handling.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-14\">The evidence also shows that an officer of the respondent upbraided appellant for not doing a \u201cgood job\u201d under the 1947-1948 agreement and appellant admitted such to be the case, stating he had been occupied with other matters, but promised to do better.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-15\">The appellant was fully paid for all of the goods he himself sold for respondent and made no demands upon respondent for brokerage due on sales made by respondent through other outlets prior to the filing of the instant suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>Prior to the filing of the present suit appellant filed suit on January 3, 1949, in the Superior Court of San Joaquin County, No. 45168 against respondent. The first count was for brokerage allegedly due. On March 16, 1949 this action was dismissed with prejudice. The evidence revealed that this action was settled out of court for a sum in excess of $12,000. \u201cThe attorney for appellant herein stated to the then attorney for respondent herein that the payment of this sum constituted the settlement of all the claims existing between Walter L. Harcourt doing business as Harcourt-Greene Company and Stockton Foods Products, Inc.\u201d Appellant admitted that during this settlement he made no demand for other alleged brokerage due.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-4\">The present action was filed by appellant on October 26, 1949, several months after said settlement. The complaint was in four counts. The second count was dismissed, the fourth count was abandoned. In the remaining counts appellant seeks to recover damages for alleged breaches of written and oral agency contracts, the damages being the brokerage fees allegedly due on sales made by respondent through outlets other than appellant. The prayer limits the recovery to $15,000 on each of the two contractual periods involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">It is appellant\u2019s contention on appeal that the effect of the contracts here in question was to give him the exclusive right to sell respondent\u2019s products. Hence he is entitled to a commission on all sales, including those made by respondent. The essence of such contention is that the evidence is insufficient to support the contrary conclusion reached by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-6\">It is the well settled rule that generally if the agency established is an \u201cexclusive agency\u201d the principal retains the right to dispose of the property by his own efforts, and if a sale be consummated pursuant to such independent efforts by the owner the agent is not entitled to a commission thereon.  On the other hand if the agency established gives the agent the \u201cexclusive right of sale\u201d generally the principal is liable for the agent\u2019s commission whether or not the agent\u2019s services contributed to such sale, since under the terms of such a contract the agent is the only person entitled to sell the property. (See <em>Golden Gate Packing Co. </em>v. <em>Farmers\u2019 </em>Union, 55 Cal. 606; <em>Chamberlin </em>v. <em>Gallucci, </em>110 Cal.App. 71 [293 P. 642]; <em>Hall </em>v. <em>King, </em>100 Cal.App. 70 [279 P. 814]; <em>Faith </em>v. <em>Meisetschlager, </em>45 Cal.App. 7 [187 P. 61]; 1 Cal.Jur. 812, \u00a7 96; 4 Cal.Jur. 607, \u00a7 40.)</p>\n<p id=\"b924-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>The distinction is clearly set forth in <em>Wilck </em>v. <em>Herbert, </em>78 Cal.App.2d 392, where the court at page 413 [178 P.2d 25] said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b924-4\">\u201c. . . \u2018The use of the words \u2018\u2018exclusive agency\u201d or \u2018\u2018exclusive sale\u201d is not conclusive but, as in other cases involving interpretation, all the circumstances must be considered.\u2019 In <em>Snook </em>v. <em>Page, </em>29 Cal.App. 246, the court said, at page 247 [155 P. 107]: \u2018The first question. . . is whether the plaintiffs were constituted the <em>exclusive agents </em>or were they given the exclusive <em>right </em>to sell said property. If the former only, the rule is well settled that \u201cthe owner has the right to sell the same by his own unaided efforts without becoming liable to the broker for commission; that the only effect of such contract is to prevent the owner from placing the property in the hands of another agent and that the owner does not thereby relinquish his right to sell the property independently of the broker.\u201d \u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">Considering then all of the circumstances and the evidence as disclosed by the record in the light most favorable to the ' respondent, we conclude that appellant\u2019s contention is not well founded.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-6\">Furthermore, the conduct of the parties under a contract with knowledge of the terms thereof and prior to any controversy is entitled to great weight in determining its proper construction. <em>(Barham </em>v. <em>Barham, </em>33 Cal.2d 416 [202 P.2d 289].)</p>\n<p id=\"b924-7\">Here it is shown that during the entire period of contractual relationship between the parties Harcourt handled other canned goods under his own label as a principal and also acted as agent for other canners whose products were directly competitive with respondent\u2019s products. In fact, it was appellant\u2019s testimony that he did not consider himself under obligation to sell respondent\u2019s goods in preference to those of competitive products he was handling. Also during this period respondent canning company made sales direct to certain companies handling its products. There is, however, nothing in the record to show that respondent ever appointed or made any sales through a second agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-9\">Van Dyke, J., and Schottky, J. pro tem., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
