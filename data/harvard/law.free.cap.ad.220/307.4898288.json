In 1908 plaintiff married, is now about thirty-eight years of age and has three children. The defendant's principal contention relates to the construction of the language of the trust, in particular the words which I have quoted, to arrive at the intention of the trustor. In -that connection defendant urges, first, that by the language of the instrument an absolute title was conveyed to his wife in the income referred to and that that purpose <em>\u201c </em>will not be restricted or cut down to any less estate by subsequent or ambiguous words,\u201d citing <em>Clarke </em>v. <em>Leupp </em>(88 N. Y. 228), but in that ease there was, as the quoted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>words indicate, first, an absolute gift and subsequently language which the court interpreted \u201c as the mere expression of the testator\u2019s wish as to the use or disposition of the property.\u201d In the present case the language to be construed is a single clause of a sentence in which the limitation for the support of herself and the children is an essential part of the instruction to pay over the net income to the defendant. I am of opinion, therefore, that there was no absolute gift. The same considerations dispose of the defendant\u2019s further contention that the disposition of the income by way of supporting the children was left solely in the power of the defendant, since in my opinion there is no gift here other than a qualified one. Defendant urges also that in any event the clause considered is to be construed as relating to the children only while they are minors. There is, however, no express provision to that effect in the deed of trust, and if reference be made to other clauses of the instrument, as, for example, the 12th, in which the contingency of the death \u201c of all of the children \u201d is provided for, the result of interpreting the word \u201c children \u201d there as minor children only would to my mind lead to absurd results. I think that the situation here pres - ent is governed by the authority of <em>Oberndorf </em>v. <em>Farmers\u2019 Loan &amp; T. Co. </em>(208 N. Y. 367); <em>Woodruff </em>v. <em>Woodruff </em>(54 App. Div. 414); <em>Loring </em>v. <em>Loring </em>(100 Mass. 340) and <em>Hollingsworth </em>v. <em>Hollingsworth </em>(65 Ala. 321); see, also, <em>Rich </em>v. <em>Rogers </em>(14 Gray, 174); and that the children are entitled to a direct and beneficial interest in the income, and that where, as in the present case, the recipient refuses to concede that right or to undertake to exercise her discretion in regard to the amount of the distribution, this court is bound by the same authorities to use its best judgment to that end. In my opinion the plaintiff is entitled, under all the circumstances developed on the trial, to one-third of the annual income. Submit findings and judgment accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
