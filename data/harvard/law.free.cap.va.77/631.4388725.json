Carter, plaintiff, against the administrators and heirs of Griggs Hampton, deceased, defendants. Ezra Nuckolls and seven others executed on 8th August, 1854, their bond for twenty-three hundred dollar's, payable with interest from 2Tth December, 1852, to Griggs Hampton, on or before 2'7\u2019th December, 1862. Griggs Hampton and his son, Andrew Hampton, on 1st November, 1856, for value, by writing under seal, assigned this bond to Thomas W. Carter, and guaranteed the payment thereof without plea or offset whether suit was brought for the collection of the same, or not. Judgment was obtained on the bond, and execution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>issued and returned \u201cno property.\u201d Griggs Hampton having-died, Andrew surviving, in February, 1880, Carter brought his bill against the decedent\u2019s administrators and heirs, praying for a discovery of real and personal assets and an account of the administration, and the subjection of the assets to pay the amount due him on said guaranty, whereon some unascertained sums had been collected from the obligors in the bond. The defendants demurred to the bill, and filed an answer, which they prayed should be treated as a cross-bill, which Carter in turn answered. At the hearing the circuit court sustained the demurrer on the ground that plaintiff had an adequate remedy at law, and dismissed the bill with costs. From this decree Carter obtained from one of the judges of this court am appeal.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b660-5\"><em>JRobert Oroclcet, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b660-6\">In this case we have the common bill of a creditor brought against a decedent for the purpose of administering the assets of decedent, and of having the same applied to the payment of the debt due the creditor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b660-7\">The bill prays for a discovery of both personal and real assets of the decedent, and also for accounts showing what disposition has been made of the same.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b660-8\">The bill may be regarded as brought by the creditor alone, or for himself and the other creditors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b660-9\">There is nothing more required in a creditor\u2019s bill, and it is hard to conceive what more could be incorporated in it. Adams\u2019 Equity, page 257 (side); 1 Story\u2019s Equity Jurisprudence, sections 546-7; 1 Spence\u2019s Equity Jurisprudence, page 579; <em>Duerson </em>v. Alsop, 27 Gratt. 229.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b660-10\">But it is objected that equity has no jurisdiction of this case, because one of the joint guarantors is dead, and the other surviving ; that the appellant had a complete and adequate remedy at law against the surviving guarantor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b660-11\">There might be some show of reason for this objection were it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>not for section thirteen, chapter one hundred and forty-one, Code 1873; for at common law, death of one of several joint obligors discharged his estate even in equity unless he were the principal debtor, and the rest his sureties. But this law is changed by the statute above cited. 2 Minor\u2019s Institute, 751.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b661-5\">It is respectfully submitted in this case that the appellant had a double remedy\u2014the one in equity against the real and personal representatives of Griggs Hampton, deceased, and the other at law against Andrew Hampton (Griggs and Andrew being the two joint guarantors); for no principle of law is more firmly established than that a creditor having two different securities, or two sets of obligors bound for his debt, may proceed against both at the same time, although he is entitled to but one satisfaction. <em>Asberry </em>v. <em>Asberry, </em>33 Gratt. 471.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b661-6\">The cases cited in 2 Robinson\u2019s (old) Practice, that of <em>Linny\u2019s administrator </em>v. <em>Dare\u2019s administrator, </em>2 Leigh, 588, and that of <em>Sale </em>v. <em>Dishman\u2019s executor, </em>3 Leigh, 448, are not in point, and can scarcely be law now. Is not the law of these cases changed by statute before cited? If not, there is nothing in them by which the demurrer in this bill can be sustained. <em>Linny </em>v. <em>Dare, </em>and the other case, simply establish that the liability of the estate of a deceased partner is not absolute and immediate, but contingent merely, depending upon the results of proper efforts to collect the debt from the surviving partner, or his ascertained insolvency. <em>See Jackson v. King, </em>12 Gratt. 505, 514 and 515.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b661-7\">It was unnecessary to allege the insolvency of Andrew Hampton, because, by <em>Asberry </em>v. <em>Asberry, </em>he might be sued at law, while the assets of Griggs Hampton were being administered in a court of equity for the payment of appellant\u2019s debt.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b661-8\">Appellant\u2019s bill correctly omits any allegation of due diligence to proceed against the obligors of the bond, or his inability to make the debt out of the obligors therein, or their insolvency. The demurrer admits as true the contract of assignment and guarantee between appellant and the two Hamptons, as stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>in the bill. By the fair and just interpretation of that contract, the two Hamptons were liable thereon as soon as default was made by the obligors of the bond. 2 Daniel\u2019s Nego.

Bolling, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b662-6\">This is not a creditor\u2019s bill. There is no allegation of a lack or want of personal assets in the hands of the administrators, nor prayer for settlement of administration accounts. The plaintiff only asks that his may be considered a creditor\u2019s bill, \u201cif he should he compelled to resort to the real estate of Griggs Hampton for payment of his debt.\u201d <em>Duerson </em>v. <em>Alsop, 27 </em>Gratt. 229; Story\u2019s Eq. Pl., section 98 a, 104, 185; 1 Bar. Ch. Pr. 271\u201472. There is no proper case made for an account. To give equity jurisdiction of a bill for an account, there must be mutual demands or a series of transactions on one side and of payments on the other, or there must be a discovery sought and obtained in aid of an account. 1 Dan. Ch. P. 610, (side) and note; 1 Story Eq. Jur., section 458-59; <em>Hickman </em>v. <em>Stout, </em>2 Leigh, 6, 9.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b662-7\">For the rules and principles upon which a court of equity has or will assume jurisdiction, exclusive and original, or concurrent, see 1 Pom. Eq. Jur., page 119 a, 125, section 136 a, 141, and page 128 a, 148, sections 146-41-48-49-50, 168-69.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b662-8\">For the Virginia practice, see 1 Rob. Pr. (old ed.), 166; <em>Linney </em>v. <em>Dare, </em>2 Leigh, 588; <em>Sale </em>v. <em>Dishman\u2019s executor, </em>3 Leigh, 448, 550-52-54 a, 561.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b662-9\">The demurrer should be sustained for the following additional reasons:</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b662-10\"><em>\u201ca.\u201d </em>The bill does not allege the insolvency of Andrew Hampton, the surviving assignor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b662-11\">\u201c6.\u201d It fails to allege that the plaintiff has used any diligence, or his inability to make his debt out of the obligors or their insolvency. If we admit that the assignment to Carter is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>genuine (\u2022which we deny) in the form that he claims, page ten of record, we maintain that it fixes no greater nor larger liability on the assignors as guarantors than the law fixes and determines, nor does it relieve the assignee of the duty to use all diligence in making the debt out of the obligors in the bond, nor of the necessity to make it out of the obligors, if he can, before he can claim it either in a court of law or equity from the assignors. If, on the merits of the case, the court should hold that this covenant acquits Carter, the assignee, of gross neglect and want of diligence and of laches.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b663-5\">\u201c c.\u201d The bill discloses the fact that the plaintiff has, pending, a bill in equity against \u201csome of the obligors.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b663-6\">If he has his remedy in this court, why not in that cause ?</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b663-7\">Fauntleroy, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ACC\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">Thomas W. Carter, on the 26th of February, 1880, instituted a chancery suit in the circuit court of Grayson county, and filed his bill (which was intended and prayed to be taken as a creditor\u2019s bill) averring that Ezra Nuckolls and seven other persons, made their single bill, dated August 8th, 1854, binding themselves, jointly and severally, to pay to Griggs Hampton $2,300 on or before December 21th, 1862, with interest thereon from the 21th of December, 1852; that November 1st, 1856, the said single bill being unpaid, the same was, on that day, assigned to the said Thomas W. Carter for value in full received by the said. Griggs Hampton, and that the payment of the said single bill was guaranteed to the said Thomas W. Carter, or bearer \u201cwithout plea or offset always, whether suit is brought for the collection of the same or not,\u201d by a writing under the hands and seals of both, the said Griggs Hampton and his son, Andrew Hampton, at the said date of the assignment. That the said Thomas W. Carter did institute suit and recover judgment on said single bill, at the maturity thereof, against the obligors thereof; that execution of <em>fi. fa. </em>was duly issued on said judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>ment, which was unavailing and was duly returned \u201cno property.\u201d That the said single bill was then still wholly unpaid, but that proceedings had been instituted by complainant in the circuit court of Oarroll county against some of his said judgment debtors, by which he expected to realize something, but certainly not enough to pay more than the interest, due upon said single bill. That the said Griggs Hampton was dead, and the said Andrew Hampton survived; that the said Griggs Hampton had died intestate, leaving assets, real and personal, but what and how much the said complainant did not know; and the bill prayed for an account, for a discovery of the real and personal estate of the decedent, Griggs Hampton, and what disposition had been made of it by his administrators, who, with his son, the said Andrew Hampton, and other children and heirs, were made defendants to the bill; and the bill prayed to be taken and treated as a creditor\u2019s bill, and for general relief. The bill was demurred to by the said Andrew Hampton and Alexander Hampton, both individually and as administrators of the estate of Gi\u2019iggs Hampton, deceased, chiefly on the ground of a want of equity in the bill, and that the complainant had a remedy at law. And on the 4th day of October, 1881, the circuit court of Grayson county sustained the demurrer and dismissed the bill, with costs, in a decree which set forth the sole ground of opinion \u201cthat the plaintiff has a complete and full remedy in his action at law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">We think that the circuit court of Grayson erred in sustaining this demurrer and in dismissing complainant\u2019s bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">The suit was brought to administer the estate of the intestate, Griggs Hampton, and of having the assets of decedent first ascertained and then applied, by a court of equity, to the payment of a debt due to his creditor, and it was a creditor\u2019s bill in intention and in fact; such a bill is maintainable in equity. 1 Spence Eq. Juris. 519 and 432.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">The bill in this case prays for discovery of both real and personal assets, and for accounts showing what disposition has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>made of them, and it may he brought by the creditor complainant alone, or for himself and the other creditors of decedent. Adams\u2019 Equity, 257; 1 Story Equity Juris., sections 546-7; 1 Spence Eq. Juris. 579; <em>Duerson\u2019s adm\u2019r </em>v. <em>Alsop et als., </em>27 Gratt. 229.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">But it is objected, by the appellees, that the appellant could not go into equity because one of the joint and several guarantors is dead, and the other surviving, and that the appellant had a complete and adequate remedy at law against the living guarantor. Yet, in this case the appellant had a double resort, the one in equity against the personal representatives of Griggs Hampton, the dead\u2019 guarantor, and the other, at law, against Andrew Hampton, the living guarantor. Code of Virginia, 1873, section 13, chapter 141; 2 Minor\u2019s Ins. 751 and cases there cited; <em>Asberry\u2019s adm\u2019r </em>v. <em>Asberry\u2019s adm\u2019r, </em>33 Gratt. 471.

And this court being further of opinion, for the reasons hereinbefore referred to, that the decree aforesaid of the said circuit court is wholly erroneous, it is therefore decreed and ordered that the said decree be reversed and annulled, and that the appellant recover against the appellees his costs by him expended in the prosecution of his appeal aforesaid here. And this court proceeding to enter such decree as the circuit court should have entered, it is adjudged, ordered and decreed, that the demurrer to the plaintiff\u2019s hill he overruled, and the defendant pay to the plaintiff his costs hy him expended in the prosecution of his cause in the said circuit court. And this cause is remanded to the said circuit court of Grayson county for further proceedings to he had therein in conformity with the foregoing opinion, and the directions herein contained.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Which is ordered to be certified to the said circuit court of Grayson county.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">Decree reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
