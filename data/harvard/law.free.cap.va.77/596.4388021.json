Board of <em>Education\u2014District school </em>trustees.\u2014Prior to nth January, 1877, the duty of appointing and removing district school trustees was devolved on the state board of education by Code 1873, chapter 78, section 7, clause 4.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"ApC\">2. <em>Idem\u2014Idem\u2014School trustee electoral </em>board.\u2014By Acts 1876-77, ch. 12, p. 9,\u2014clause 4, section 7, chapter 78, Code 1873, was repealed, and the power of appointing and removing district school trustees was vested in a \u201c school trustee electoral board,\u201d to be composed of the county superintendent of schools, the county judge, and the attorney for the commonwealth in each county.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b624-11\">3. <em>Evansham school </em>district\u2014is not a city of the first or second class mentioned in section 2, chapter 79, Code 1873, but is a mere school district in a county, or a separate school district, such as is contemplated by the act approved 13th February, 1877.

Whereupon McT. and his associates presented to this court their petition for a rule against C. and his associates, to show cause why a peremptory <em>mandamus </em>should not issue to compel them to deliver the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>said books, &amp;c., to petitioners.

McTeer, Henry E. Me Wane and Paschal Buford\u2014who claim to be the legal and rightful school trustees for Evansham school district, in Wythe county, Virginia, for a peremptory writ of <em>mandamus </em>to compel John H. Caldwell, Charles L. Fox and Thomas J. Newman, who are now acting as school trustees for that school district, to transfer and deliver to them all the books, records, papers, and property belonging to that school district.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-17\">In their petition they allege that they wei\u2019e appointed school trustees of Evansham district by the \u201cboard of education\u201d of Virginia; that they have been duly commissioned by the governor, and have qualified to their commissions; and then they proceed to set forth various matters going to show that the said Caldwell, Fox and Newman are mere usurpers, which, in the view we take of the case, it is not necessary to mention.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-18\">To this petition the respondents\u2014Caldwell, Fox and Newman\u2014demur, and this demurrer raises the question whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>petitioners are the legal and rightful school trustees for said school district. That this (Evansham school district) is not a city of the first or second class, mentioned in section two of chapter seventy-nine of the Oode of 1873, seems too plain to need discussion. It must, therefore, be a mere school district in a county, such as are in all the counties of the state, or it may he a separate school district, such as is contemplated by the act of assembly approved February 13, 1877, entitled \u201can act to amend and reenact section thirty-six, chapter seventy-eight, Oode of 1873, in relation to the appointment of school trustees in incorporated towns of less than five thousand inhabitants.\u201d Acts 1876-77, chapter eighty-six, page sixty-nine.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">Now, prior to January 11, 1877, the duty of appointing and removing district school trustees was, by the express terms of the fourth clause of the seventh section of chapter seventy-eight, Oode 1873, devolved upon the state hoard of education. But as is pointed out in the opinion of Bichardson, J., in the case of <em>Childrey and others </em>v. <em>Rady and others, ante </em>page 518, and familiarly known as the \u201cBichmond School Case,\u201d this power was taken away from the board of education by an act passed on that day, and entitled \u201c an act to provide for the appointment and removal of district school trustees, and to repeal the fourth clause of the seventh section of the seventy-eighth chapter of the Code of 1873,\u201d Acts 1876-77, chapter twelve, page nine, and vested in a hoard to be known as \u201cTheSchool Trustee Electoral Board,\u201d to he composed of the county superintendent of schools, the county judge, and the attorney for the commonwealth in each county. So that, if Evansham school district he regarded not as a separate school district, such as is contemplated by the act of assembly approved February 13, 1877, but as a mere ordinary county school district, then the' petitioners, not being appointees of the \u201cSchool Trustee Electoral Board,\u201d have no title to the offices which they claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">And if on the other hand this Evansham school district he considered as a separate school district, within the purview of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>the aforesaid act of assembly, approved February 13, 1871, then by the provisions of that act the town council of Wytheville alone has power to appoint the school trustees for such district.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Eow there is no pretence that the petitioners received their appointments from either of these sources, on the contrary, it is distinctly averred that they were appointed by the hoard of education. It is clear, therefore, that they are not the legal school trustees for Evansham school district, and are not therefore entitled to the care and custody of the school property of the district.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">The demurrer to the petition must therefore he sustained, the rule heretofore awarded in this case be discharged, and the petition he dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">Mandamus denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
