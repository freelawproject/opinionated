H. was carrying on business as a general merchant, and had become largely involved in debt; that at this time he had a stock of goods on hand worth about $2,000 in cash, which he assigned to Adam White and Royal Lyon to secure them as sureties on a bank note given by said Goo. H. for the sum of $1,500 ; that said White and Lyon took possession of said goods and the store of said Geo. II., under said assignment, and put the oratrix into the store as their agent to sell the goods; that she proceeded to sell the goods and apply the proceeds in payment of the bank note, and that on or before January 1, 1880, she had fully paid the same ; that there then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>remained remnants, from $500 to $700 worth ,of the goods, which the said White and Lyon afterwards turned over to said Geo.

The hill \u25a0also alleged that subsequent to the return of the goods, \u201con or about March, A. I). 1880, it was agreed between your oratrix and said Geo.

IL, being extremely hostile to the oratrix, took possession of the store and stock of goods, and claimed to own them; that the said store and homestead of said Geo. H. were encumbered by a mortgage for all or nearly all they were worth ; that the oratrix with the approval of said Gro'. LI., entered into an arrangement with the mortgagee, defendant Hidden, by which .she was to pay the mortgagee, and that the mortgagee was to assign to her such part\u2019 of the mortgage debt .and mortgage as she should pay; and that she paid seveial hundred dollars. The prayer was that the oratrix be protected in her interest in the mortgage debt so paid by her, and that the said Geo. ,IL. be enjoined from interfering with the said goods.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b697-4\">The answer denied that the oratrix was doing business in her own right; denied the arrangements alleged to have been entered into \u201c on or about March, A.

that the said Hidden further agreed, in said writing, that he would give said oratrix receipts for all sums paid by her towards said mortgage, and that when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>the amount of said mortgage was paid, lie would assign to her said mortgage and note or such part of said mortgage and note as such oratrix should pay; that said oratrix then and there accepted said agreement in writting, and paid said sum of $162 and verbally agreed to run said store and keep it open during the time covered by said payments, and the said Hidden then and there gave up and' delivered to said oratrix said note for $200, which she now holds, and which on the 10th day of January, 1883, amounted to the sum of $238.16'.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b699-5\">The master further finds, that, from July 28, 1879, until September 7, 1879, and from October 30,1879, until on or about March 20, 1880, the defendant Keniston was away in Maine and New Hampshire, selling pills and patent medicines, and that he had no knowledge when said bank debt was paid, or of the manner in which the oratrix was conducting the business in said store, or of the agreement with said Hidden-as to said mortgage, until his return home on or about March 20, 18S0, when at the request of the oratrix he was informed by said White, who was present when said agreement between said Hidden and the oratrix was made, executed and delivered, that 'said bank debt was paid, and of the agreement betwen said oratrix and said Hidden, and that defendant Keniston, upon receiving this information, expressed himself well pleased at what the oratrix had done in those matters.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b699-6\">The master further finds, that said defendant Keniston remained at home at this time from on or about said March 20, 1880, until June 24, 1880, taking no part in the management of said store, selling no goods, and in no way asssisting in keeping the books that were used in connection with said store business, but doing more or less of the freighting necessary to be done in said bnsines during that time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b699-7\">The master further finds, that although said White and Lyon ceased to have any management and control of said store and the business carried on therein after December 31, 1879, they did not reassign said goods to anyone until May 21, 1880, at which time the master finds they reassigned the goods then in the store to said defendant Keniston, and at the same time took from said defendant and the said oratrix a receipt in full for rent of store and services of said oratrix, and also at the same time the said White took from said defendant a note for the sum of $175, it being the amount still remaining unpaid of $200 borrowed of said White by the said oratrix .with which to pay the said Hidden the said sum of $162, upon said mortgage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>indebtedness;

JT. 1 hovnpson, </em>for the oratrix.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b701-9\">This suit is brought by the oratrix against her husband, defendant Keniston, and defendant Hidden, to determine and protect her rights and equities in and to the stock of goods, and in the mortgage held by Hidden. The contract with Hidden was exclusively for the benefit of the oratrix; and the husband expressed himself as <em>\u201c </em>well pleased \u201d with it. While the master failed to find ' a <em>special </em>arrangement, a <em>special </em>agreement between the husband and wife as to the goods, the report taken as a whole shows that the husband consented that she might have vand use the residue returned by White and Lyon. The defendant acquiesced in the conduct of his wife. No other inference can be drawn from the facts reported only that both parties understood that the wife was the sole owner of the goods <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>returned after paying the bank debt, and also what she paid on the mortgage. The courts protect the rights of the wife, and recognize an understanding between her and her husband as to her separate property. <em>Child </em>v. Pearl, 43 Vt. 229 ; <em>Delano </em>v.

When the husband permits his wife to take and have her own personal earnings, or personal property belonging to him, to use, to hold, or dispose of, for her own benefit under an understanding, either <em>express </em>or <em>implied </em>between them that she is to have, and may have the same as her own separate property, or where the husband acquiesces in the wife\u2019s taking and using such property as and for her own separate estate, equity will treat the same as her separate estate, as between herself and husband.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b702-5\"><em>l^inney </em>v. <em>Fellows, </em>15 Vt. 585; <em>Porter v.

To establish the fact of a gift of a chattel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>from husband to wife there must be clear and distinct evidence \u25a0corroborative of the wife\u2019s testimony.' 1 Lead.

The master fails to find that any such agreement as to her services was then made, or that anything was then said as to how the oratrix was to bo paid for^her services, or that her husband then abandoned any interest or property in said goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>The oratrix further claimed before the master that she acquired title to said goods by virtue of the agreement with her husband of about March 20, 1880, set up in the bill. 'But the master says he fails to find that any such arrangement was made, or that any arrangement was made at that or any other time whereby the oratrix was to have said goods as her sole and separate estate. By this we think the master means that ho fails to find <em>any </em>arrangement, express or implied. This construction of the report is conclusive against the oratrix.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">But it is contended in her behalf that the master means only to say that he fails to find any <em>express </em>agreement, and that the report shows that Keniston in effect consented that his wife might take said goods as her own property and carry on the business in her own name and for her own benefit and that she had a right so to understand the matter from about the 20th of said March. But if she had a right so to understand, it is nowhere found that she did so understand, nor-how otherwise she understood the matter. It is not found what the understanding between her and her 'husband was in this behalf, nor whether there was any understanding between them.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">While courts of equity give full effect as between the parties-to gifts by husband to wife, they require clear and incontrovertible\" evidence to establish such gifts as a matter of intention and fact. 2.Story Eq. s. 1375 <em>; </em>Schoul. Husb. <em>&amp; </em>Wife, s. 385. But here the master has found neither a gift nor an intention to give. Nor was the case tried before him on the theory of an implied gift or transfer to the wife, but on the ground of an express agreement and understanding. There are no facts found of sufficient legal significancy to warrant us in saying that the oratrix has in any way become the owner of this property. It is true that many facts are reported that tend strongly to support her claim of an implied gift or other transfer, but they are largely countervailed by other facts \u2014 such, for instance, as the reassignment of the goods to Keniston by White and Lyon on May 21,. 1880, and the inventorying of them by Keniston in 1S81, in the presence of his wife, as his own for the purposes of taxation, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>offsetting the store debts, as well as debts that were undispntedly his, and also the Hidden mortgage. All this was evidence from which the master might have found what the understanding and expectation of the parties were, and whether or not they regarded the goods as the property of the oratrix ; but there is no finding upon the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"AOf\">The result is we hold that there are not sufficient findings to warrant a decree in favor of the oratrix but we think she ought not to be made to pay costs, and as the decree is strictly <em>pr'o</em>forma, the case will be remanded with directions that the decree be so far modified as to dismiss the bill without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">Ordered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
