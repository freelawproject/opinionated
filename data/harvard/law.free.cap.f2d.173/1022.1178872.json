In the upper panel appears the word \u201cAuto,\u201d while in the lower panel there appears the expression \u201cAero-Groom.\u201d The words \u201cAuto\u201d and \u201cAero\u201d were disclaimed apart from the mark, and the goods to which the trade-mark is applied is a preparation for shining finished surfaces.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-19\">The appellee \u2014 owner of two registered marks, one \u201cAutobrite,\u201d as applied to automobile polish, and \u201cAerowax,\u201d as applied to wax polish \u2014 filed its opposition to the granting of registration of appellant\u2019s mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-20\">It appears that the goods of the parties possess identical descriptive properties, and that the use by appellee of its marks is earlier than any date of which appellant may avail itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-21\">The notice of opposition relates to the confusion-in-trade clause of section 5 of the Trade-Mark Act of February 20, 1905, 33 Stat. 725, as a statutory ground for denying the right of registration claimed by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-22\">In the ex parte prosecution of its case, appellant was required to disclaim the terms \u201cAuto\u201d and \u201cAero,\u201d as being descriptive of the goods to which the mark was applied. The Examiner of Interferences in this proceeding stated that such requirement did not necessarily demand that the term should not be given substantial weight in comparing the marks in issue, citing National NuGrape Company v. Judge &amp; Dolph, Ltd., 154 F.2d 521, 33 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1032, and J. Greenebaum Tanning Co. v. Respro, Inc., 94 F.2d 818, 25 C.C.P.A., Patents, 899.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-23\">The examiner held that appellee\u2019s mark, \u201cAerowax,\u201d was more pertinent to the issue than its mark, \u201cAutobrite,\u201d and set out the dictionary definition of the expression \u201caero,\u201d which is common to both marks as \u201cpertaining to or concerned with aeronautics or airplanes.\u201d The examiner thought, and properly so we think, that the literal meaning of the expression \u201caero\u201d was scarcely sufficient to explain its selection in the marks of either party. In this connection he said as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-24\">\u201c * * * The products of both as described in the application and registration 'and as indicated in specimen labels of record are polishing materials of general utility. The directions for use printed on applicant\u2019s label refer only to furniture and painted surfaces. The opposer\u2019s label simi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1023\">*1023</page-number>larly indicates that its \u2018Aerowax\u2019 polish is designed for general household purposes and the like. The relationship between the actual trade appeal of these goods and the dictionary meaning of \u2018aero\u2019 hence is deemed to be remote at best; and it consequently is believed that purchasers would rely to a considerable degree on this feature of the marks in identifying the goods as to source.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-4\">Holding that in his opinion the marks, \u201cAero-Groom\u201d and \u201cAerowax,\u201d are so nearly alike as to be reasonably calculated to cause confusion in trade, the examiner sustained the notice of opposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-5\">In his decision, the Commissioner of Patents noted that the Examiner of Interferences did not consider the \u201cAutobrite\u201d mark of appellee, but he sustained the holding of the examiner.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-6\">The commissioner commented upon disclaimer by the appellant of the words \u201cauto\u201d and \u201caero,\u201d and in that connection stated that, if the expression \u201caero\u201d is descriptive, the appellee\u2019s registration of \u201cAerowax\u201d is invalid, and appellant\u2019s mark, therefore, is not registerable for the reason that the \u201cgroom\u201d portion is just as descriptive as the \u201cwax\u201d portion in opposer\u2019s mark. The commissioner held that the expression \u201caero\u201d is not descriptive or suggestive of the goods of either party. With that holding we agree. He was of the opinion that such expression is the dominant feature of both marks, for the reason that it is the only word occurring in either which could be properly considered as capable of trademark significance. He further stated that \u201cthe question is not free from doubt, and it is well established that doubts must be resolved in favor of the prior user.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-7\">Counsel for appellant correctly alleges in his brief that its mark is not merely \u201cAero-Groom.\u201d However, it seems to us that the mind of the purchasing public would not be concerned with the name of appellant\u2019s goods as \u201cAuto and Aero-Groom.\u201d It is-more reasonable to suppose that, in accordance with the usual shortened manner of speech in this country, the goods of the parties would be called for by purchasers as \u201cAero-Groom\u201d and \u201cAerowax.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-9\">It does not seem to us to be material what may have been done by the Primary Examiner in the ex parte prosecution of appellant\u2019s application during which he required a disclaimer of the words \u201cauto\u201d and \u201caero.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-10\">The tribunals of the Patent Office and this court are not concerned with the disclaimer with respect to the word \u201cauto,\u201d and we see no reason why appellant should be concerned in that respect for the reason that it appears to be the owner of a registered mark, \u201cAutogroom.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-11\">Both of the expressions, \u201cAero-Groom\u201d and \u201cAerowax,\u201d are marks composed of dictionary terms of the English language. We do not think it is of substantial moment that the \u201caero\u201d expression in appellant\u2019s mark is hyphenated with the word \u201cgroom\u201d and that no hyphen appears in the mark of appellee between \u201caero\u201d and \u201cwax.\u201d Those two terms, as applied to goods of the respective parties which possess the same descriptive properties, are in our opinion likely to cause confusion as to origin in the mind of the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-12\">We have considered with care all of the contentions made by counsel for appellant, but in view of what has been said, we deem it unnecessary to further prolong this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-13\">The decision of the commissioner is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
