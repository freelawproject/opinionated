Massaging of the scalp with Brace helps keep the scalp clean and lubricated and dresses the hair, imparting a lustrous brilliance. As a dressing, apply sparingly to the wet or dry hair. As a scalp massage, apply liberally direct to the scalp.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b326-23\">It appears from the record that the involved trade-mark was passed for publication and published in the Official Gazette on April 27, 1943, in.which, as it is customary, the Commissioner of Patents stated that any person who believed that he would be damaged by the registration of appellant\u2019s mark might oppose the same by filing a notice of opposition. Prior thereto, the Leonard James Company, owner of the registration \u201cBracine,\u201d for use on an \u201cAntiseptic Liniment and Veterinary Liniment Preparation,\u201d which company had been successful in the cancellation proceeding brought against appellant', McKesson &amp; Robbins, Inc., v. Leonard James Co., 129 F. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>2d 563, 564, 29 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1137, hereinafter more particularly referred to, filed with the Commissioner of Patents a letter in which it was stated that in its opinion there would be no confusing similarity between appellant\u2019s trade-mark \u201cBrace\u201d for use on a preparation for the hair and scalp, and appellee\u2019s registered trade-mark \u201cBra-cine\u201d ; that the goods of the parties did not possess the same descriptive properties; and that it, therefore, consented to the registration of appellant\u2019s trade-mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">In the cancellation proceeding herein-before referred to, the Leonard James Company claimed that its mark \u201cBracine,\u201d registered March 27, 1934, registration No. 311,576, for an \u201cAntiseptic Liniment and Veterinary Liniment Preparation,\u201d was confusingly similar to the trade-mark \u201cBrace\u201d of McKesson &amp; Robbins, Incorporated, registered June 14, 1938, registration No. 357,713, for use on a variety of articles; to wit, \u201ctooth paste, hair and scalp preparations, powders and talcs for the face and skin, lotions for the skin and face, sunburn lotions and preparations, including antiseptic oils for sunburn.\u201d We there affirmed the Commissioner of Patents, holding that \u201c * * * in part at least, the goods named in appellant\u2019s registration are of the same descriptive properties as those to which appellee\u2019s mark is applied. That \u2018antiseptic oils for sunburn,\u2019 for example, one of the products named in appellant\u2019s certificate of registration, are of the same descriptive properties as a liniment for human use, * * * \u201d and that the trademarks of the parties were confusingly similar.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">In the cancellation proceeding the First Assistant Commissioner of Patents stated that \u201cthe goods to which these marks are respectively applied, in part at least, possess the same descriptive properties within the meaning of the statute. Clearly this is true, for example, as to respondent\u2019s \u2018antiseptic oils for sunburn\u2019 and petitioner\u2019s \u2018antiseptic liniment\u2019 for human use.\u201d The First Assistant Commissioner further stated\u00bb in his decision in that case that \u201c * * * <em>the fact that respondent\u2019s registration may include additional items, of different descriptive properties, has no hearing on the issue here presented.\u201d </em>(Italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">It is evident that neither the First Assistant Commissioner of Patents nor this court held that McKesson &amp; Robbins\u2019 goods, \u201c * * * hair and scalp preparations * * * \u201d and the Leonard James Company\u2019s \u201cAntiseptic Liniment and Veterinary Liniment Preparation\u201d possessed the same descriptive properties, nor was it held that the trade-marks of the parties as to such goods were confusingly similar. The First Assistant Commissioner properly held, as did this court, that one of the items included in the McKesson &amp; Robbins\u2019 registration, that is, antiseptic oils for sunburn, possessed the same descriptive properties as the Leonard James Company\u2019s liniment for human use, and that the trademarks of the parties, as applied to those items, were confusingly similar.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-11\">It will be observed, furthermore, that \u201cHair and scalp Preparations,\u201d involved, among other things, in the cancellation proceeding, is much broader in its terminology and might include preparations not covered by a \u201cPerfumed Toilet Preparation for the purpose of cleansing the Scalp and Hair, imparting a Lustre to the Hair and keeping it well groomed and in place,\u201d involved in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-12\">Subsequent to our decision in the cancellation proceeding, supra, appellant attempted to disclaim all of the articles contained in his previous registration except the trade-mark \u201cBrace\u201d for hair and scalp preparations. That was the only issue presented by appellant\u2019s attempted disclaimer, and the First Assistant Commissioner properly held that he had no authority to permit such a disclaimer. However, in denying appellant\u2019s attempted disclaimer, the assistant commissioner further held that appellant\u2019s toilet preparation for the scalp and hair, which he referred to as a hair tonic, and the Leonard James Company\u2019s liniment for human use, possessed the same descriptive properties and that the marks of the parties were confusingly similar. Leonard James Company v. McKesson &amp; Robbins, Incorporated, 54 U.S.P.Q. 333.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-13\">In view of our decision in the cancellation proceeding, supra, there was nothing left for the First Assistant Commissioner of Patents to do but to reject appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>lant\u2019s disclaimer and to cancel the McKes-son &amp; Robbins\u2019 registration of its trademark \u201cBrace,\u201d although some of the articles covered by that registration might not have possessed the same descriptive properties as antiseptic oils for sunburn, covered by that registration, and the Leonard James Company\u2019s liniment for human use. Accordingly, the assistant commissioner in his rejection of McKesson &amp; Robbins\u2019 attempted disclaimer had no authority to determine whether the toilet preparation for the scalp and hair, covered by the McKes-son &amp; Robbins\u2019 registration, possessed the same descriptive properties as the liniment for human use, included in the registration of the Leonard James Company, and that the marks of the parties were confusingly similar. That portion of his decision, therefore, was obiter dictum and is not a proper basis for the decision of the examiner of Trade-Marks and of the First Assistant Commissioner of Patents that the issue here presented is res adjudicata. Furthermore, the issue as to \u201cA Perfumed Toilet Preparation for the purpose of cleansing the Scalp and Hair, imparting a Lustre to the Hair and keeping it well groomed and in place,\u201d under consideration in the instant case, was not involved in the cancellation proceeding, and it was not held by this gourt nor by the First Assistant Commisioner of Patents that hair and scalp preparations involved in the cancellation proceeding possessed the same descriptive properties as liniment for human use or that the marks of the parties as to such goods were confusingly similar. Accordingly, our decision in the cancellation proceeding is not res adjudicata of the issue presented in the instant case. See Last Chance Mining Co. v. Tyler Mining Co., 157 U.S. 683, 687, 15 S.Ct. 733, 39 L.Ed. 859, and Carter Medicine Co. v. Barclay, 36 App.D.C. 123, 128.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">The First Assistant Commissioner of Patents held in the instant case that the goods of the parties possessed the same descriptive properties and that their respective marks were confusingly similar. We are not of that opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">It clearly appears from the record that appellant\u2019s product here involved is merely a toilet preparation and is not advertised or used as a medicinal preparation, whereas, the liniment covered by the Leonard James Company\u2019s registration is a medicinal preparation and is advertised and used for its medicinal properties. It may be that in some instances a so-called toilet preparation may contain medicinal properties and might possess the same descriptive properties as a medicinal preparation, but that is not so in the instant case. See Dag-gett &amp; Ramsdell v. Samuel Bonat &amp; Bro. 166 F.2d 151, 35 C.C.P.A., Patents, 937. We are of opinion, therefore, that appellant\u2019s preparation for the scalp and hair, being merely a toilet preparation, does not possess the same descriptive properties as a medicinal preparation and that appellant\u2019s mark \u201cBrace,\u201d used on its goods, and the registered mark of the Leonard James Company, \u201cBracine,\u201d used on liniment, are not confusingly similar.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">For the reasons stated, the decision is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">\u00abReversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
