That the defendants are in default has been established by a declaratory judgment of the district court; they have been adjudged wrongdoers because, although they agreed to be employees, they refuse to carry out the contract of employment. The only question is as to the employers\u2019 remedies for this breach of contract. That they may recover judgment from the defendants for damages is undoubted; that they may recover a similar judgment against the union is conceivable; that they could have procured an injunction in some form before the Norris-La Guardia Act<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> we will assume, although, even before that act was passed, it would not have been possible to get all the relief here asked. But all this is beside the point. Their position is that, because Knox, J., decided the issues against the defendants, their refusal to obey that judgment did not raise a \u201clabor dispute,\u201d as that term is defined in \u00a7 113(c) of the act. The defendants\u2019 position is that, in spite of the declaratory judgment, the refusal raised a \u201ccontroversy concerning the terms \u25a0 .and conditions of employment,\u201d which by definition is a \u201clabor dispute.\u201d We agree with the defendants. If the plaintiffs were right, it would follow that, as soon as any controversy was decided by a court, it would cease to be a \u201ccontroversy,\u201d and an injunction would be.proper. It would therefore follow that the NorrisLaGuardia Act only applies to a \u201clabor dispute\u201d before it had been decided; in short, an employer could not get a temporary injunction, but he could always get a permanent injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"Arf\"> \u00a7\u00a7 101-115, Title 29 \u00dc.S.O.A.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
