As the Board said, \u201can employer violates the good faith requirement of the collective bargaining mandate when, throughout the negotiations, he persistently takes the position that he will not enter into a signed agreement.\u201d See, e. g., H. J. Heinz Co. v. N.L.R.B., 311 U.S. 514, 525-526, 61 S.Ct. 320, 85 L.Ed. 309; Art Metals Construction Co. v. N.L.R.B., 2 Cir., 110 F.2d 148, 150; N.L.R.B. v. Register Publishing Co., 9 Cir., 141 F.2d 156, 160. Since the company\u2019s absolute and unyielding \u201cprinciple\u201d was at variance with the obligations imposed on it by the Act, the Board\u2019s order that it cease and desist was proper. The moral is that \u201chard-and-fast lines ever cut the fingers of those who draw them\u201d.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b755-13\">As the evidence amply supports the finding that the union did not waive its right to a signed contract, there is no need to consider the legal consequences of such a waiver. We think the evidence also sufficiently supports the finding that th\u00e9 company \u201cadditionally interfered with, restrained and coerced its employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in Section <em>7 </em>of the Act <em>[29 </em>U.S.C.A. \u00a7 <em>157].\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b755-14\">The Board had discretion, which it did not abuse, to deny the intervening petition filed on January 7, 1947, by a majority of the employees. Franks Bros. Co. v. N.L.R.B., 321 U.S. 702, 704-705, 64 S.Ct. 817, 88 L.Ed. 1020; N.L.R.B. v. A. Sartorius &amp; Co., Inc., 2 Cir., 140 F.2d 203, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>207. The company contends th\u00e1t enforcement of the Board\u2019s order should be denied because the Board waited from October 4, 1946 until January 23, 1948, to seek enforcement through a court order. We cannot agree. The company could have sought prompt judicial review of that order, under 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 160(b). Not having done so, and having failed to comply with that order, it is in no position to complain of any change of circumstances during the period of non-compliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">Enforcement will be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b755-7\"> N.

On a later occasion, Price told 'Shulman that the respondent could shut down the department which the Union represented or transfer the work to other plants. Still later Price informed Shulman that the respondent\u2019s priorities would probably be terminated because of its opposition to the Union\u2019s demands, but that Walter Todd preferred that to signing a contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-16\">\u201cAll these statements constituted threats of reprisals against the Union and the employees, respectively, as a consequence of the Union\u2019s insistence upon a signed contract. Whether or not Price was authorized to so express himself is beside the point. As the representative of the respondent, armed with authority to negotiate on its behalf, superintendent of its printing division, and possessed of apparent authority to interpret and state the respondent\u2019s policies, his declarations are imputable to the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-17\">\u201cIt is therefore found that by this conduct the respondent additionally interfered with, restrained and coerced its employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in Section 7 of the Act.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
