The petition is based on a general allegation of violation of the \u201cBill of Rights, Articles Four and Six,\u201d and \u201cBill of Rights, Amendment Fourteen, \u2018No State shall make and enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.\u2019 \u201d It also quoted, \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense,\u201d and states that \u201che was denied the right of counsel for his defense.\u201d It does not appear whether there was a jury trial, or a plea, whether the applicant for the writ is old or young, experienced or not, that he was intimidated or friendless. The procedural law relied on is inapplicable to a State court trial. The quotation from the Fourteenth Amendment as to abridging privileges and immunities does not abolish State court prosecutions. The facts are so vaguely stated as not to demand interference by the federal courts with a State convict. We cannot say the district judge erred in refusing the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-26\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
