The Examiner of Interferences denied the motion to amend, refused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>to consider other marks than the one originally pleaded, and excluded all evidence concerning the other marks. That ruling was affirmed by the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Rule 15(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A., reads in part as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">\u201cRule 15. Amended and Supplemental Pleadings</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">\u201c(b) Amendments to Conform to the Evidence. When issues not raised by the pleadings are tried by express or implied consent of the parties, they shall be treated in all respects as if they had been raised in the pleadings. Such amendment of the pleadings as may be necessary to cause them to conform to the evidence and to raise these issues may be made upon motion of any party at any time, even after judgment; but failure so to amend does not affect the result of the trial of these issues. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">Appellant contends that because appel-lee did not object to testimony taken by appellant regarding the marks \u201cZino-Pads,\u201d \u201cZin-Ox Pads,\u201d and \u201cZino,\u201d or to the notice of amendment until it came to the taking of appellant\u2019s rebuttal testimony, more than six months later; and that because appellee took testimony and introduced exhibits in answer to the testimony of appellant with respect to the marks \u201cZin-Ox Pads,\u201d \u201cZino-Pads,\u201d and \u201cZino,\u201d \u201cThe \u2018issues not raised by the pleadings\u2019 as originally filed were, therefore, \u2018tried by express or implied consent\u2019;\u201d and that \u201cAny objections which might have been made were, therefore, waived by appellee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-10\">We do not agree with that contention. The taking of testimony and the introduction of exhibits during the taking of the testimony did not constitute a trial of the issues. The issues were tried before the Examiner of Interferences at final hearing. At the final hearing, appellee expressly objected to the proposed amendments and to the evidence relating thereto. The examiner properly sustained those objections. Section 6 of the Trade-Mark Act of February 20, 1905, as amended, providing that \u201cAny person who believes he would be damaged by the registration of a mark may oppose the same by filing notice of opposition, stating the grounds therefor, in the Patent Office within thirty days after the publication of the mark sought to be registered,\u201d precludes any amendment setting up new grounds of opposition if filed more than thirty days after publication of the mark sought to be registered. Hannis Distilling Co. v. George W. Tor-rey Co., 32 App.D.C. 530. There a motion asking leave to amend the notice of opposition was filed after the thirty days allowed by statute had expired, and in affirming the decision of the examiner and commissioner denying the motion, the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia, which then had jurisdiction in appeals in opposition proceedings, held: \u201cWe think the Examiner of Interferences properly denied the motion upon the following statement: \u2018If the amendment does not contain matter constituting new grounds of opposition, no advantage can result to the opponent from its admission, and the amendment should be denied; if it does set out new grounds of opposition, it is brought too late, and cannot be allowed.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-13\">The Hannis Distilling Co. case, supra, is conclusive on the point of bringing an amendment after the statutory limit has passed.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-14\">Because appellant\u2019s motions to amend were denied by the examiner, he also refused to give further consideration to the question of confusing similarity insofar as the notations \u201cZino,\u201d \u201cZin-Ox Pads,\u201d and \u201cZino-Pads\u201d were concerned. Appellant, in his appeal to the commissioner, assigned as error the refusal of the examiner to consider those marks and determine without reference to the precise issues raised by the pleadings that applicant was not entitled, ex parte, to registration of his mark. The commissioner held that opposer was not entitled to be heard on evidence in support of grounds not specifically pleaded, citing Goldsmith Brothers v. Atlas Supply Co., 148 F.2d 1016, 32 C. C.P.A., Patents, 1001. In that case, ap-pellee-applicant\u2019s mark \u201cColdex\u201d was held not to be confusingly similar to appellant-opposer\u2019s mark \u201cGoldex.\u201d Appellee-appli-cant sought registration of \u201cColdex\u201d as applied to an automobile antifreeze com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>pound, whereas appellant-opposer\u2019s mark \u201cGoldex\u201d had been registered for use on chemicals, medicines, and pharmaceutical preparations, and toilet preparations. The opposer introduced evidence of the use of his mark \u201cGoldex\u201d on a can of motor oil and a can of polishing wax, and urged that in the natural extension of its business (that of a mercantile establishment operating a store with a drug department and a department for automobile accessories) it should be able to apply its mark to an antifreeze preparation of its own. One of the registrations introduced in evidence by opposer there concerned the use of its mark in the sale of pure glycerin and rubbing alcohol, but this court rejected opposer\u2019s contention that its glycerin and alcohol were goods of the same descriptive properties as applicant\u2019s antifreeze, holding that opposer\u2019s registration was restricted in scope to pharmaceuticals. The court then held that the extension of the opposer\u2019s mark from pharmaceuticals into antifreeze would be an extension into an unrelated field, citing Pratt &amp; Lambert, Inc., v. Chapman &amp; Rodgers, Inc., 136 F.2d 909, 913, 30 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1228, where this court held that a liberal interpretation of the \u201cmerchandise of the same descriptive properties\u201d language of section 5 of the Trade-Mark Act of February 20, 1905, would not permit a holding that paints and varnishes, etc. possess the same descriptive properties as insecticides and medicinal preparations. In the Goldsmith case, supra, this court held, as quoted by the commissioner in justification of his position that appellant here was not entitled to be heard on the issue that the registration of appellee\u2019s mark should have been denied ex parte, that [32 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1001, 148 F.2d 1018]</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">\u201c * * *. Since appellant did not plead the use of its mark on motor oil or its registration for polishing wax that might be used on automobiles, the evidence with respect thereto cannot be deemed pertinent to the issue and the Examiner of Interferences and Commissioner of Patents properly refused to consider it. * * * If appellant intended to rely upon its registered mark as applied to polishing wax it should have pleaded it the same as it did others.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">The commissioner stated in his opinion that although he considered appellant not entitled to be heard on the issue, he had given careful consideration of appellant\u2019s contention that the opposed application should be refused registration ex parte.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">The issue of whether the applicant\u2019s mark should have been rejected ex parte over the opposer\u2019s registered marks \u201cZino,\u201d \u201cZin-Ox Pads,\u201d and \u201cZino-Pads\u201d is not before us on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">-As between \u201cSolvex\u201d and \u201cZindex,\u201d both applied to preparations for athlete\u2019s foot, those marks are easily distinguished, as they neither look nor sound alike. Appellant argues, through his' witness in the record, and before us in his brief, that the trade does not buy his products by the manufacturer\u2019s name, \u201cDr. Scholl\u2019s,\u201d but by the trade-mark under which the product is advertised and sold. It follows then that an intended purchaser of an athlete\u2019s foot preparation would not become so confused in asking for \u201cSolvex\u201d that he would say \u201cZindex\u201d or any name similar in sound; nor if \u201cZindex\u201d were offered to him by a clerk, through error or otherwise, would a purchaser intending to buy \u201cSolvex\u201d be persuaded that \u201cZindex\u201d is so similar in appearance and sound that he must have confused the names. .</p>\n<p id=\"b296-10\">The pertinent portion of section 5 of the Trade-Mark Act of February 20, 1905, reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b296-11\">\u201cThat no mark by which the goods of the owner of the mark may be distinguished from other goods of the same class shall be refused registration as a trademark on account of the nature of such mark * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b296-12\">\u201c(b) * * * Provided, That trademarks * * * which so nearly resemble a registered or known trade-mark owned and in use by another, and appropriated to merchandise of the same descriptive properties, as to be likely to cause confusion or mistake in the mind of the public, or to deceive purchasers, shall not be registered : * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>The essential elements of the proviso are: (1) Trade-marks which so nearly resemble a known trade-mark; (2) used on merchandise of the same descriptive properties ; (3) as to be likely to cause confusion in the mind of a purchaser or the public generally. All three elements must be present before bringing the proviso into operation in a particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">Finally, with regard to appellant\u2019s contentions respecting applicant\u2019s use of \u201cAid-011\u201d on its \u201cZindex\u201d label, and appellant\u2019s trade-mark \u201cEase-All,\u201d it is sufficient to point out that the record discloses that \u201cEase-All\u201d is the trade-mark for an orthopedic device and does not appear on the label of any of the appellant\u2019s products here in issue. The similarity thought to exist by appellant between \u201cAid-011\u201d and \u201cEase-All\u201d as elements tending to cause confusion in trade, for that reason merits no further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">The decision of the Commissioner of Patents dismissing the opposition is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">HATFIELD, Judge, dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
