In Drittel v. Friedman, 2 Cir., 154 F.2d 653, this court held that an appeal will not lie from such an order. It is \u2022 purely interlocutory, inasmuch as it does no more than would an order under earlier practice overruling a demurrer. In other words, it leaves the issues raised by the defendant\u2019s first counterclaim and the reply thereto to be tried. We may add that this disposition by Judge Kaufman of the above issues seems to have been wise. Disputes between parties as to trade-mark validity and infringement can rarely be determined satisfactorily on a motion for summary judgment. The record makes it clear that such was the situation in the case at bar. In any event as the order was not final no appeal from it was permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-19\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
