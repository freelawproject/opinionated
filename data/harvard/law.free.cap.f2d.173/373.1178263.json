The method of plasticizing scorched stock which comprises admixing therewith acidic material and a substantially non-accelerating, plasticizing organic sulfur compound, permitting the resulting admixed material to stand and subsequently subjecting the same to a refining treatment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">\u201c3. The method of plasticizing scorched stock which comprises mechanically working the same under oxidizing conditions with admixed acid material and a plasticizing sulfide having the formula RSxR\u2019 where R and R\u2019 represent radicals selected from the class consisting of hydrocarbon radicals and hydrocarbon radicals substituted by a non-accelerating functional group and where x is an integer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">The references relied upon are:</p>\n<p id=\"b422-10\">Shepard et al., 1,957,298, May 1, 1934.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-11\">Seaman et al., 1,996,001, Mar. 26, 1935.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-12\">Williams et al., 2,191,266, Feb. 20, 1940.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-13\">Garvey, 2,193,624, Mar. 12, 1940.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-14\">Castello, 2,211,592, Aug. 13, 1940.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-15\">Appellants state in their brief:</p>\n<p id=\"b422-16\">\u201cThe invention of the appealed claims provides a method for cool working of scorched rubber stock in the presence of an acidic material and a non-accelerating platicizing organic sulfur compound followed by standing and/or cooling to \u2018age\u2019 the mixture and a final reworking refining step. The result is a reconverted product closely approximating the properties of properly mixed and compounded rubber. The process is characterized by the use of an organic sulfur compound, which is <em>not </em>an accelerator, under process conditions of <em>acidity </em>and low temperature. The process is further characterized by a period of standing <em>i. e., </em>cooling, to allow the added agents to become distributed before final refining.\u201d [Italics quoted.]</p>\n<p id=\"b422-18\">The plasticizing agents disclosed by appellants for use in their process are \u201cnon-accelerating and nitrogen-free sulfides and thio compounds of hydrocarbons and substituted hydrocarbons or hydrocarbon derivatives such as thiophenols or mercaptans, thio ethers or sulfides, etc.\u201d The acid materials disclosed by appellants for use in their process are \u201cthe higher fatty acids such as oleic and stearic acids,\u201d but the appellants state that rosin acids may also be used.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-19\">The Shepard et al. patent provides for a process of treating scorched rubber, and teaches that processes heretofore used in treating vulcanized rubber to obtain reclaimed rubber can be used to treat scorched rubber; also, that scorched rubber stocks \u201chave been salvaged by the usual alkali or acid digestion processes or other so-called devulcanization methods of the reclaiming industry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-20\">The Seaman et al. patent discloses the use of organic sulfides of the type employed by appellants for the softening or reclaiming of vulcanized rubber. It teaches that the vulcanized rubber may also be macerated and then treated directly with disulfides, and that this treatment may be accelerated by the use of elevated temperatures.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-21\">The Williams et al. patent provides for mixing the rubber with small amounts of acidic material and salts of thio acids. The salts include organic sulfides of the type described and claimed by appellants. The patent states that the compounds used will be effective at room temperature, although higher temperatures are preferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-22\">The Garvey patent shows a process for reclaiming vulcanized rubber by mixing the rubber with para thiocresol, one of the sulfur compounds used in appellants\u2019 process. It also shows other ingredients, including lauric acid, as being used, and that the composition is cured at 275\u00b0 F. (135\u00b0 C.)</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>The Castello patent shows a method of reclaiming vulcanized rubber in which the rubber is mixed with an organic sulfur compound and an organic acid, including stearic acid, \u201cat low or medium mill temperatures.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">The examiner rejected all of the claims as unpatentable over Seaman et al., Williams et al., Garvey, or Castello, as well as Seaman et al., Garvey, or Castello in view of Shepard et al.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">Claims 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 were further rejected as being broader than the invention alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">The examiner additionally rejected claims 1, 2, 5, 6, and 7 as being too broad and indefinite; however, the board in its decision held that the examiner\u2019s rejection of those claims as too broad and indefinite as to \u201cnon-accelerating plasticizing organic sulfur compound\u201d was based on the allegation that some of the compounds \u201cmay\u201d be inoperative, and it did not affirm that i rejection, citing Ex parte Johnson, 40 USPQ 576, and Ex parte Rintleman, 43 USPQ 283, which held that rejections on ' mere suspicion of inoperativeness are untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">It will be noted that appellants\u2019 process provides for mixing scorched rubber with a higher fatty acid and a suitable plasticizing agent. Numerous suitable plasticizing agents are mentioned, all of which are organic sulphur compounds, but excluding organic sulphur compounds containing nitrogen, which would be regarded as accelerators.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">The Castello patent states:</p>\n<p id=\"b423-10\">\u201c * =:= Organic materials which have the property of accelerating the vulcanization of rubber are all peptizing agents and the activity of the material as a peptizing agent seems to be directly proportional to its accelerating activity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b423-11\">That indicates the use of these compounds as accelerators.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-12\">We do not agree with the board that the appellants\u2019 limitation of their plasticizers to non-accelerating organic sulphur compounds, in view of Castello\u2019s accelerating organic compounds, is \u201cpurely arbitrary.\u201d The Castello patent is chiefly of interest here, however, because of its teaching that a fatty acid (stearic acid) and organic sulphur compounds may be used in the reclamation of vulcanized rubber. Castello also teaches the use of relatively low temperatures (100\u00b0 F.) in his reclaiming process.,</p>\n<p id=\"b423-14\">The Garvey patent discloses the use of \u201ca thiophenol\u201d (the term being defined in the patent as being used in a generic sense to include aromatic mercaptans) as a reclaiming agent, together with a softener such as \u201coils\u201d in the manufacture of reclaimed rubber. The examiner held that \u201coils\u201d customarily used in the art are \u201cfatty oils consisting essentially of fatty acids.\u201d Appellants contend that the term \u201coils\u201d as part of the Garvey teaching is too nebulous to be used against them. However, we take notice of the fact that the chemical meaning of \u201coils\u201d is as expressed at page 204, Karrer\u2019s Organic Chemistry, Elsevier Publishing Co. Inc., Third English Edition, Amsterdam, 1947:</p>\n<p id=\"b423-15\">\u201cFats and oils. The fats and oils are entirely glycerides, i. e. esters of the trihydric alcohol glycerol with <em>higher and middle fatty acids. </em>* * * \u201d [Emphasis added.]</p>\n<p id=\"b423-16\">Therefore, it will be seen that Garvey\u2019s disclosure embraces certain of the very materials upon which appellants\u2019 method is based; viz., thiophenol, aromatic mer-captans, used in connection with fatty acids.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-17\">Appellants\u2019 basic contentions before us are: (1) That none of the patents cited teaches the equivalence of scorched rubber and vulcanized rubber as the subject matter of the reclaiming art directed to vulcanized rubber scrap; (2) that none of the patents cited incorporates the appellants\u2019 step of a waiting period following the preliminary mixing treatment of the stock, and preceding the refining of the product, which appellants\u2019 application asserts is advantageous in promoting the plasticizing action of the added fatty acid and plasticizer.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-18\">As to the first contention, appellants in their brief state: \u201cThe phenomenon of scorching may be considered a premature partial vulcanization but scorched stocks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>are in general distinguished in the rubber industry from vulcanized rubber.\u201d The solicitor in his brief states: \u201cScorched</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">rubber, therefore, is intermediate in its nature between raw rubber and completely vulcanized rubber, and is more closely related to each of these two than they are to each other.\u201d Appellants\u2019 application states: \u201cDuring the mixing, calendering or tubing of rubber compounds, and particularly of compounds containing active accelerators, it sometimes happens that the heat generated or applied during the mixing, calendering or tubing operation is sufficient to start or cause vulcanization and to produce what is known as scorched stocks, which are unsuitable for use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A7b\">It is our view that scorched rubber is prematurely or partially vulcanized rubber, and there is no invention in applying to scorched rubber (prematurely or partially vulcanized rubber) methods or compounds old to the art as useful in reclaiming vulcanized rubber. We are of the opinion that the case of In re Evans, 164 F.2d 621, 35 C.C.P.A., Patents 776, is controlling on that issue, and we agree with the board that it is not inventive to try the treatments of Garvey or Castello on scorched rubber.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">With regard to the appellants\u2019 second contention, while it is true, as they state, that none of the references discloses an intermediate waiting step between the mixing and the refining steps, nevertheless we do not believe that appellants have distinguished their process from the others in a patentable way merely'because of the introduction of the interval wherein the mixture is allowed to \u201cstand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">Shepard et al. suggest the possible equivalence of vulcanized rubber reclamation and scorched rubber reclamation; Williams et al. teach the mixing of raw rubber with acidic material and organic sulfides, In re Evans, supra, extends this to the plasticizing of rubber generally; Seaman et al. teach the- use of organic sulfides on vulcanized rubber to soften and reclaim it; Castello teaches the use of relatively low temperatures in reclaiming vulcanized rubber stock with a mixture of organic sulphur compounds (albeit accelerating) and an organic acid; and Garvey teaches the use of certain of the very softeners and plasticizers specified in appellants\u2019 application. In the face of all of this, will the appellants, in using what seems to be the fruits of those teachings, be heard to say that they are entitled to a patent .because their application alone specifies a waiting period intermediate the processing of the scorched rubber stock? Where appellants have failed to establish clearly and conclusively a basis for the need of such a waiting period, its suggested desirability is not sufficient to distinguish the appellants\u2019 process as patentable over the prior art. As held by the board, \u201cno basis has been laid * * * for a need for waiting. Mere standing for an unspecified time is practically meaningless.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b424-10\">For the foregoing reasons we agree with the finding of the tribunals of the Patent Office that all of the claims of appellants\u2019 application are unpatentable over the cited prior art. It is unnecessary for us to consider additional grounds of rejection. The decision of the Board of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
