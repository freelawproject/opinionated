The detention arose out of process issued by a State court of California. The District Court entered a final order denying the petition. Appellant has filed a notice of appeal and has applied to this court for leave to prosecute the appeal in forma pauperis. No certificate of probable cause has been issued. See 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2253. Instead, the District Judge has certified that there is no probable cause. Therefore the ap-. plication is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
