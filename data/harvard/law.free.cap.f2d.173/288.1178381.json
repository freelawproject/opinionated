The findings may be summarized as follows: The song \u201cL\u2019Annee Passee\u201d was an original musical composition composed by Lionel Belasco in Trinidad in 1906. Belasco never published the song nor dedicated it to the public, the only performances of it, so far as he knew, being at private gatherings of his friends. In October 1943 he assigned his property in the song to the plaintiff, who duly copyrighted it about December 31, 1943 as an original musical composition composed by Belasco and arranged by the plaintiff. The defendant\u2019s song \u201cRum and Coca Cola\u201d is a mere copy of the plaintiff\u2019s copyrighted song. The individual defendants have \u201cdeliberately and wilfully in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>fringed\u201d and the corporate defendant \u201chas infringed upon plaintiff\u2019s said copyright\u201d by publishing, printing, selling and making, or permitting to be made, mechanical reproductions of a copy of the song \u201cL\u2019An-nee Passee\u201d under the title \u201cRum and Coca Cola.\u201d Accordingly an interlocutory decree for damages and an accounting of profits was awarded the plaintiff. By this appeal the corporate defendant (1) challenges the finding of fact that the song \u201cL\u2019Annee Passee\u201d was an original musical composition created by Belasco; (2) contends that the plaintiff\u2019s registration of copyright is only for his arrangement of the song, not for the alleged original melody by Belasco; and (3) asserts error in the denial of a motion for a new trial on newly discovered evidence. In addition the appellant Jeri Sullavan challenges the finding that she infringed the copyright.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">It would serve no useful purpose to set forth again the evidence so fully discussed in Judge Rifkind\u2019s opinion reported in D.C., 78 F.Supp. 686, together with the reasons which impelled him to find the facts as he did. The story is indeed remarkable that Belasco composed the song in 1906, taught it to four young musicians, and then forgot about it until Massie Patterson communicated with him regarding \u201cCalypso\u201d songs some 35 years later; but it is not an impossible story. Three of the four young musicians \u2014 one having died\u2014 corroborated Belasco. They had attained positions of some importance in the intervening years and made a favorable impression upon the trial judge as witnesses. While the reference in the \u201cForeword\u201d to Miss Patterson and Mr. Belasco as \u201ccollectors of these authentic \u2018Calypso\u2019 songs from the lips of the Lesser Antilles natives\u201d and the absence in the copyright application of any claim that Belasco was the composer tend to raise doubts as to his having composed the song in 1906, testimony explaining how the \u201cForeword\u201d and the copyright application were prepared satisfied Judge Rifkind. We are by no means convinced that the finding that Belasco created the song in 1906 was \u201cclearly erroneous,\u201d and nothing short of that will suffice for the reversal of the finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">The appellants contend that the plaintiff cannot maintain an action for infringement of Belasco?s original melody because the registration of copyright was only for Maurice Baron\u2019s arrangement of the song. The application signed by Baron was on Form E which the Copyright Office provides for use \u201cfor new music now first published.\u201d Line- (3) of the printed blank calls for \u201cName of composer\u201d with a space following for his signature.\u2019 The word \u201ccomposer\u201d was stricken out and the words \u201carranger-transcriber\u201d were written above it. A similar change was made in line (4) which calls for \u201cCountry of which composer is a citizen.\u201d In line (6), calling for \u201cAuthor of words,\u201d the following was inserted : \u201cCreole lyrics collected by Massie Patterson (U. S. A.) and Lionel Belasco (Trinidad, B. W. I.) \u2014 English version by Olga Paul (U. S. A.).\u201d In line (7) which calls for \u201cTitle of musical composition\u201d was written \u201cCalypso Songs of the West Indies (list of 12 songs attached).\u201d One of these twelve was entitled</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">\u201cL\u2019Annee Passee Last Year</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">A \u2018Calypso\u2019 by Massie Patterson and Lionel Belasco</p>\n<p id=\"b337-10\">English Version by Free transcription by Olga Paul Maurice Baron\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-11\">At the bottom of the page was the statement : \u201cCopyright, 1943, by M. Baron -Co., New York. All rights reserved.\u201d The certificate of copyright registration certified \u201cthat two copies of the musical composition named herein have been deposited * * * and that registration of a claim to copyright has been duly made in the name of M. Baron Co. * * * Title: Calypso Songs of the West Indies. Tinga Layo (Donkey Song; Pack She: Back to She Ma) [and 9 others] Creole lyrics collected by Massie Patterson, of United States, and Lionel Belasco, of Trinidad, B. W. I. English version by Olga Paul, of United States. Free transcription by Maurice Baron, of United States, arranger.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-12\">It is true that the copyright application did not name Belasco as the author of the melodies of the published songs, copies of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>which accompanied the application. But neither the statute nor the rules of the Copyright Office require that the author be named. Both the melodies and Baron\u2019s arrangements were \u201cnew music now first published\u201d; consequently Baron was entitled to claim copyright of both and Form E was the proper blank to use for that purpose. The worst that can be said of the application is that it was defective in form in not making clearer that copyright was claimed for the melodies as well as arrangements. The appellants urge that there has been a \u201cdedication to the public of that which was not claimed,\u201d and cite in support of this contention Sontag Chain Stores Co. v. National Nut Co., 310 U.S. 281, 293, 60 S.Ct. 961, 84 L.Ed. 1204. That was a patent infringement suit whose applicability to the case at bar is misconceived in our opinion. The printed copies of the songs filed in the Copyright Office described the songs as Calypso Songs \u201cby Massie Patterson and Lionel Belasco,\u201d and gave notice of copyright by Baron with \u201cAll rights reserved.\u201d No one who examined the record in the Copyright Office would be justified, we think, in believing that the melodies had been dedicated t\u00f3 the public. Nor is there any contention that the appellants were misled by the certificate of registration. We therefore reject the argument based on section 12, 17 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 12, that the plaintiff .cannot maintain an action for infringement of Bela-sco\u2019s original melody.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">Moreover it is impossible to see how the appellants could _ escape an accounting even if Belasco\u2019s melody were not properly copyrighted. Their brief asserts that there is no finding that Baron\u2019s arrangement was infringed. Finding 9 appears to be directly to the contrary:</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">\u201c9. The extraordinary great similarities \u2014 which approximate identity' \u2014 between plaintiff\u2019s copyrighted song \u2018L\u2019Annee Pas-see\u2019 and defendants\u2019 infringing song, \u2018Rum and Coca Cola,\u2019 in melody, uninterrupted sequence of identical notes, rhythm, construction, harmony, identity of unusual dissonant chords, and other respects, are so great as to preclude the inference of coincidence, and they constitute sufficient internal evidence of copying, even in the absence of the direct extrinsic proof of copying.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">And it cannot he doubted that Baron\u2019s piano transcription and arrangement was copyrightable' under section 6, 17 U.S.C. A. \u00a7 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">The corporate appellant\u2019s complaint that error was committed in denying its motion for a new trial is wholly without merit. It was not made until ten weeks after the appeal was taken. See Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, as amended, \u00a7\u00a7 59(b) and 60(b) (2), 28 U.S.C.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">The appellant Jeri Sullavan contends that the record shows that she had no part in the writing of the infringing composition \u201cRum and Coca Cola.\u201d She is a singer of popular songs. Morey Amsterdam offered her the lyrics of \u201cRum and Coca Cola\u201d; she took them to Paul Baron. She testified by deposition that \u201cWe sat down at the piano and he worked out a melody to fit the pattern of the lyrics. I made a number of changes and suggestions to suit my style of singing. * * * I can\u2019t pick out the parts of the music I suggested because the notes are too mixed up with Mr. Baron\u2019s for me to separate them.\u201d She also made some suggestions about the lyrics. Leo Feist, Inc., published the song, listing Miss Sullavan and Paul Baron as co-authors of the music and Amsterdam as author of the lyrics; and a contract was entered into which split the royalties between the three individual defendants. We think the record supports the finding that she infringed the plaintiff\u2019s copyright.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-10\">The interlocutory decree is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
