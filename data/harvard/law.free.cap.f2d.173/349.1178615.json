The application for the writ was properly denied since application for habeas corpus on practically the same grounds was denied by the Maryland courts, Goodman v. Warden of Maryland Penitentiary, Md., 60 A.2d 527, and certiorari was denied by the Supreme Court, Goodman v. Swenson, 335 U.S. 847, 69 S.Ct. 58. There are no allegations which would justify the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus by the lower federal courts under such circumstances. See 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2254 and Wade v. Mayo, 334 U.S. 672, 68 S.Ct. 1270.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-22\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
