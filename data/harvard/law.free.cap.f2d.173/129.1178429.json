Two questions are before us: (1) The sufficiency of the evidence to take the case to the jury ; and (2) Whether the court properly charged the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-21\">Stinnett, during the tax-years in question, was engaged primarily in the second-hand furniture business in Richmond, Virginia, and, for a time, was in the business of furnishing bail bonds. For 1942, the return filed by Stinnett showed a tax liability of $71.13; this tax, as computed by the Government, amounted to $10,041.-88. Similar serious discrepancies existed as to the years 1943 and 1944.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-22\">The case of the Government was built largely on the testimony of Special Agent McClanahan. McClanahan arrived at his computation of Stinnett\u2019s tax liability primarily by using the total amount of the bank deposits made by Stinnett as his gross receipts, and then allowing Stinnett all deductions claimed by him for the years in question. Thus, for the year 1942, Stinnett\u2019s bank deposits amounted to $46,753.28, yet he reported gross receipts of only $25,000.00 and a net income of only $1,574.43.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-23\">Even if such a gross discrepancy between bank deposits and gross receipts, without any adequate explanation by the taxpayer, be not sufficient in itself to take the case to the jury, see Gleckman v. United States, 8 Cir., 80 F.2d 394, cert. den. 297 U.S. 709, 56 S.Ct. 501, 80 L.Ed. 996, further corroboration was furnished in the evidence. Stin-nett admitted that he deposited business receipts in his bank accounts. In each of the years in question, Stinnett purchased United States Savings Bonds in amounts substantially in excess of the net income reported in his returns. And, in 1944, he purchased cashier\u2019s checks out of funds not withdrawn from his bank accounts, in amounts far exceeding even the gross receipts reported by him for that year. Mc-Clanahan gave detailed testimony as to his examination of Stinnett\u2019s bank deposits and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>checks. There was further testimony of inventory discrepancies.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">Stinnett could offer no adequate explanation of these gross discrepancies and introduced no documentary evidence whatever. The excuse given for Stinnett\u2019s failure to produce his books was that these had been destroyed by the purchaser when Stinnett sold his second-hand furniture business. But the purchaser of the business, H. G. Moss, was asked: \u201cAt the time you purchased the defendant\u2019s furniture store did you at any time see any records of any nature pertaining to the furniture store ?\u201d and replied: \u201cNo, Sir, we didn\u2019t see anything of any records.\u201d And Special Agent Mc-Clanahan testified: \u201cQ. Did you inquire about any books that Mr. Stinnett may have left there? A. No, I did not because Mr. Stinnett had told me that his books were burned.\u201d Stinnett, when asked what had become of these books, testified: \u201cI will tell you, Mr. Allen: In selling out I don\u2019t know what became of the books. I was questioned at the Internal Revenue later about the books but I only had information. I didn\u2019t have any information from Mr. and Mrs. Moss that they had taken them. I only had people working around \u2014 grapevine information \u2014 that the books had been destroyed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">Isolating one sentence of the charge from its context, Stinnett- complains of the judge\u2019s charge to the jury. This sentence reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">\u201cIf you believe from the evidence, all the evidence before you, considering all the circumstances and facts known to you, that the defendant received income during these respective years in an amount or amounts greater than the amount which he stated in his-return as being income, then you shall find him guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">But this sentence to which objection is made shows clearly that it was not intended as a complete statement in itself of all the elements of the crime charged. Even if the sentence, standing by itself, might be construed as telling the jury that the defendant must be found guilty if, during the respective years, he received income exceeding the amount stated in his returns, any possible ambiguity was immediately cleared up in the succeeding sentences in the same paragraph, which read:</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">\u201cIt is not necessary that the Government prove the precise amount. You may believe that it was less than the amount the Government claims but if you believe that he received an amount greater than the amount which he returned and you further believe that in making out his returns he knew that he was reporting less than the true amount of his income, that he made out the return knowing that and with the purpose of defrauding the Government by making that return, then you shall find him guilty. Unintentional or inadvertent mistakes on the part of the defendant are not sufficient to convict. You must believe that he knew that he intentionally and deliberately filed a return for an amount less than he' actually received, and if you believe that with re^ spect to any one of those returns for the years 1942, \u201943 or \u201944, you should find him guilty for such year or years as you believe that he deliberately and intentionally misstated his income.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-10\">\u201cUpon the other hand, unless you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt, as I have undertaken to define it, that he intentionally and deliberately misstated the amount of his income in filing these returns, then you should find him not guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b178-11\">We think there was ample evidence to take the case to the jury and that there was no prejudicial error in the charge .to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-12\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
