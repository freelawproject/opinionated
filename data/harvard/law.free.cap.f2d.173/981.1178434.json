That mark was applied to \u201cprepared mustard, India relish, salad dressing, chili sauce, cane and maple syrup,\u201d and, as described by the Examiner of Interferences, the registration discloses:</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-5\">\u201c * * * a mark consisting of the letters \u2018BAR\u2019 within concentric circles having a bar or line bisecting the whole and having very small letters \u2018c\u2019 and \u2018o\u2019 inscribed between the legs of the \u2018A\u2019. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-7\">The mark \u201cBordo\u201d was adopted by appellant either because some of the products which the firm sold came from the city of Bordeaux, France, or because that city was the former residence of a person associated with appellant. \u201cBarco\u201d is derived from the initials of the name B. A. Railton plus the abbreviation Co. When thus combined, appellee\u2019s mark is pronounced \u201cBarco.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-8\">The volume of sales in dollars for the products sold under appellee\u2019s trade-mark \u201cBarco\u201d since 1916 amounted to more than $100,000,000 and the amount expended for advertising the goods sold under that mark was more than $100,000. The volume of sales in dollars for the products sold under the trade-mark \u201cBor-do\u201d had substantially increased since 1924 and likewise increased sums of money were spent by appellant in advertising its trademark and the goods sold thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-9\">Appellee\u2019s notice of opposition was filed pursuant to section 6 of the Trade-Mark Act of February 20, 1905, 33 Stat. 726, as amended, and involves the confusion in trade clause of section 5 of that act, 33 Stat. 725, as amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-10\">The principal questions at issue are whether \u201cBordo\u201d and \u201cBarco\u201d are confusingly similar; whether appellant has proved a date of first use prior to the use of any of appellee\u2019s trade-marks; and whether the conduct of appellee was such as to constitute an equitable defense in behalf of appellant in view of sections 19 and 47 of the Trade-Mark Act of 1946, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1069, 1051 note.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-11\">There are certain specific differences in the goods upon which the marks of the respective parties are used. Nevertheless, there can be no dispute that the goods are clearly of the same descriptive properties. Therefore, the primary question to be determined is whether the involved marks when considered as a whole so nearly resemble one another in sound, meaning, and appearance as to be likely to cause confusion or mistake in the mind of the public or to deceive purchasers as to the origin of the goods when the two marks are concurrently used in the sale of the goods by the respective parties. Rice-Stix Dry Goods Company v. Industrial Undergarment Corporation, 152 F.2d 1011, 33 C.C.P.A., Patents, 813.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-12\">The two marks here involved consist of two five-letter words wherein the first, third, and fifth letters of each word are the same, and both marks consist of words of two syllables which are pronounced with the accent on the first syllable of each word. The two marks differ from each other in significance and somewhat in appearance from the mark of appellee\u2019s original registration but the two expressions \u201cBordo\u201d and \u201cBarco\u201d when pronounced are, beyond any reasonable doubt, confusingly similar.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-13\">Similarity of sound is of itself sufficient to constitute confusing similarity of marks under the law when the marks are applied to merchandise of the same descriptive properties. See Marion Lambert, Inc., v. O\u2019Connor, 86 F.2d 980, 24 C.C.P.A., Patents, 781; Traders Oil Mill Company v. Lever Brothers Company, 100 F.2d 249, 26 C.C.P.A., Patents, 899; Skol Company, Inc., v. Olson, 151 F.2d 200, 33 C.C.P.A., Patents, 715.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-14\">Appellant concedes priority of use of ap-pellee\u2019s trade-mark \u201cBarco\u201d as originally used by appellee in medallion form and renewed in registration No. 121,208. Appellant contends, however, that \u201cBordo\u201d is not confusingly similar to appellant\u2019s mark in the medallion form. The examiner in sustaining appellant\u2019s contention in that respect pointed out that the letters \u201cc\u201d and \u201co\u201d in the original registration of appellee\u2019s mark as printed \u201care very in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>significant and in fact are almost illegible,\u201d and that therefore such registration did not establish priority of use with respect to the notation \u201cBarco\u201d written out in substantially the same size letters, as in certain subsequent registrations such as registration No. 162,870.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-4\">The commissioner, however, in reversing the examiner correctly pointed out that in the drawings of appellee\u2019s application and in the specimens filed therewith those two letters are distinct. Moreover, the reproductions of the drawings in appellee\u2019s earliest application, as illustrated by appel-lee\u2019s Exhibits 12B, 12C, and 12D, show that the medallion or monogram insignia clearly spell out the word \u201cBarco,\u201d and the corrobative testimony of at least three of appellee\u2019s employees shows that appel-lee\u2019s original registration No. 121,208 and its subsequent registrations were received at all times by the trade and spoken of as \u201cBarco.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-5\">The record discloses that appellant filed a petition for reconsideration by the commissioner in which petition it was alleged, among other things, that appellee\u2019s trademark could not have been pronounced \u201cBarco\u201d prior to appellant\u2019s date of first \u2022use of July 13, 1916, in view of the decision rendered subsequent to that date by the Examiner of Interferences in the case of California Packing Corp. v. B. A. Railton Co., Opposition No. 2423, decided October 13, 1917. The commissioner, however, adhered to his original decision, and denied appellant\u2019s petition with respect to making any change in the commissioner\u2019s \u2022original decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-6\">The denial of appellant\u2019s petition for reconsideration, as hereinbefore described, does not constitute grounds for \u2022reversal of the commissioner\u2019s decision. The law is well settled that the citation of cases involving other trade-marks has little value in an opposition proceeding for the reason that each case must rest \u2022upon its own distinctive facts. McKesson &amp; Robbins, Inc., v. American Foundation, etc., 150 F.2d 420, 32 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1235; Magitex Company, Inc., v. John Hudson Moore, Inc., 154 F.2d 177, 33 C.C.P.A., Patents, 956.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-8\">The examiner and Commissioner of Patents found continuity of use of the trade-mark \u201cBordo\u201d since July 13, 1916, the fiiing date of registration No. 119,722. That registration, however, was subsequently allowed to expire. In the application for such registration, it was alleged \u25a0that appellant\u2019s trade-mark had been used in its business since March 9, 1916. Without passing upon the question of whether the expiration and nonrenewal of the registration of July 13, 1916, eliminates it as corroborative proof of continuing use since the date of its filing, it is clear, in view of the record, that the alleged continuous use of appellant\u2019s mark from March 9, 1916 had not been established.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-9\">In view of that conclusion, and in view of the further fact that appellant has conceded prior use of appellee\u2019s original trademark in its medallion form, it is deemed unnecessary from what has been hereinbe-fore stated to further discuss the question as to which of the parties was first to use its involved mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-10\"> Appellant\u2019s contention that since appellee \u201cacquiesced\u201d in the use by appellant of the trade-mark \u201cBordo\u201d for a number of years, the equitable factors thereby involved should be given full weight in appellant\u2019s favor in accordance with the provisions of the Trade-Mark Act of 1946. Appellant in its answer to the notice of opposition did not allege that appellee\u2019s action was barred by the equitable principles of laches, estoppel, or acquiescence, and the court is not convinced, in view of the record, that any such principles are applicable to the subject matter of this appeal or that any other relief in behalf of appellant is specifically provided for under the Trade-Mark Act of 1946. See Willson v. Graphol Products Co., Inc., 165 F.2d 446, 35 C.C.P.A., Patents, 857.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-11\">For the reasons hereinbefore stated, the decision of the Commissioner of Patents is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
