In these circumstances, the heirs claimed the property by reason of a failure of the trust. However, the District Court held that the devise was supported by a general charitable intent; that the dominant purpose was to establish a playground, rather than use the designated site; therefore, that the trust should be applied as nearly as might be to effect the charitable scheme. Accordingly the court approved a plan whereby the trust income would be applied towards the maintenance of a playground on public space, to be known as the Mary Force Stead Playground, with an appropriate memorial tablet.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-20\">In our opinion the District Court was right. The judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b698-21\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
