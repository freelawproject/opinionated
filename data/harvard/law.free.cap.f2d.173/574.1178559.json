He complains that he was intimidated by his own counsel to to admit that of which he was not guilty, and that his counsel refused to use witnesses who would show an alibi; and that it all adds up to a denial of due process of law contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment. An exhibited affidavit of W. L. Bur-kett tends to show that' Burkett\u2019s counsel the day before the trial advised him to admit sexual relations with the prosecutrix and claim that they were with her consent, and said if he did not do this he would get life imprisonment or the electric chair, and the counsel would drop the case; and that Burkett consented so to do. There are several other affidavits of witnesses that they saw Burkett elsewhere than at the home of the prosecutrix when and where she claimed she was raped.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-20\">Whether his attorney\u2019s advice was good or bad, whether the testimony given under it was true or false, Burkett did not get life imprisonment nor the electric chair. The State of Florida and its officers have contributed in no way to what he complains of. The federal courts are not charged with the review of the strategy of defense adopted between an accused and his own counsel before trial in a State court.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-21\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
