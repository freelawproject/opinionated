Murray, of Cincinnati, Ohio, of counsel), for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b1056-14\">Before GARRETT, Chief Judge, and HATFIELD, JACKSON, O\u2019CONNELL, and JOHNSON, Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1056-15\">JOHNSON, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b1056-16\">This is an appeal from the decision of the Commissioner of Patents affirming the decision of the Examiner of Interferences dismissing appellant\u2019s notice of opposition to appellee\u2019s application for registration of the notation \u201cGlobrite\u201d as applied to a'powdered cleaning compound, and holding that appellee was entitled to register the'mark under section 5 of the Trade-Mark Act of February 20, 1905, 33 Stat. 725.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-17\">It is alleged in appellee\u2019s application for registration that appellee has used its mark on its goods since June 16, 1944.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-18\">In its notice of opposition, appellant alleges that it is the owner of the trade-mark registration No. 330,255 of November 26, 1935, and of the prior registrations therein referred toj including registration No.. 80,287 \u25a0 of November 29, 1910, renewed (both being for the mark \u201cOakite\u201d); that it has used its mark on its goods ever since about February 2, 1909, and that it would, be damaged by the registration of the mark \u201cGlobrite\u201d to appellee; that the mark sought to be registered so nearly resembles opposer\u2019s trade-mark \u201cOakite\u201d as to be-likely to cause confusion or mistake in the mind of the public or to deceive purchasers; that the powdered cleaning compound for which appellee seeks to register the-mark \u201cGlobrite\u201d and the compounds sold by appellant under its trade-mark \u201cOakite\u201d' constitute merchandise of the same descriptive properties, and are sold in direct competition with each other for identical purposes ; that many persons would fail to notice the slight difference between the marks-\u201cGlobrite\u201d and \u201cOakite\u201d and would thus be likely to buy applicant\u2019s powdered cleaning-compound as and for a cleaning compound' placed on the market by appellant, and that this would result in loss of sales to appellant; and, that any fault or defect found in appellee\u2019s \u201cGlobrite\u201d powdered cleaning-compound would seriously injure the reputation which appellant has established.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-19\">The case was submitted on a stipulation-of facts and the stipulated testimony of H.. Liggett Gray, vice-president of appellant, corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-20\">Both parties filed briefs and were represented by counsel at the hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-21\">In his decision, the examiner held that the opposer is the prior user, the goods are-of the same descriptive properties, and that confusion is not likely to arise by reason of the use of the mark \u201cGlobrite\u201d on the goods, in question; and he dismissed the notice of opposition, and held that appellee is entitled to the; registration for which it has made-application.-</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-22\">The commissioner sustained -the decision of - the examiner.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1009\">*1009</page-number>The stipulated facts show that appellee has used the mark \u201cGlobrite\u201d on its goods since 1944, and that appellant has used its trade-mark \u201cOakite\u201d on . its goods since 1909; that appellant\u2019s sales of \u201cOakite\u201d products have amounted to the total wholesale value of approximately $67,000,000; that appellant lias spent approximately $7,000,000 for advertising its \u201cOakite\u201d products; that appellant has frequently been involved in litigation, before the Patent Office tribunals and the courts, and has usually Succeeded in its efforts to enjoin infringements and to prevent or cancel the registration of marks which it opposed; and, that appellee, under its mark \u201cGlo-brite\u201d has sold goods of the wholesale value of $15,000 and has spent for advertising approximately $1,100.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-5\">Appellant in its brief says, \u201cThe only real issue, under the circumstances, is the question whether the simultaneous use of the trade-marks Oakite and Globrite, as applied to competing cleaning compounds, is likely to lead to confusion in trade.\u201d Appellant contends that \u201cthe similarity between these two marks is striking, particularly in sound,\u201d and in its brief says, \u201cThe question of similarity between appellant\u2019s Oakite mark to marks of other parties has twice before been considered by this Court\u201d and cites Buckeye Soda Company v. Oakite Products, Inc., 56 F.2d 462, 19 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1034, and Oakite Products, Inc., v. H. Kirk White &amp; Co., 107 F.2d 590, 27 C.C.P.A., Patents, 712.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-6\">In the case of Buckeye Soda Company v. Oakite Products, Inc., supra, the court held that the mark \u201cNovite\u201d was confusingly similar to the trade-mark \u201cOakite.\u201d. In the case of Oakite Products, Inc. v. H. Kirk White &amp; Co., supra, the court held that there was no likelihood of confusion between the trade-mark \u201cOakite\u201d and the trade-mark \u201cSo-White.\u201d The court there said [107 F.2d 592]:</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-7\">\u201cIn the instant case we see practically no physical resemblance' between the contesting marks, each considered as a whole, nor is there any resemblance in the per se meaning of the terms. \u2018Oakite\u2019 appears to be a purely arbitrary term. It is not suggestive of any quality of appellant\u2019s hand cleaner nor of any result obtained frojn its use. \u2018So-White\u2019 may be somewhat suggestive of quality or result, but, as was said below in substance, it consists of a combination of two ordinary English words and its meaning is hardly capable of being misunderstood.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-9\">The commissioner considered the Oakite Products, Inc., v. H. Kirk White &amp; Co. case, supra, as controlling in the instant case, and in his decision said:</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-10\">\u201cSo here, applicant\u2019s mark is made up of \u2018two ordinary English words.\u2019 For in relation to a cleaning preparation \u2018Globrite' obviously is a contraction of the words \u2018glow bright,\u2019 and I think that is the significance it would convey to the public. In their brief on appeal, as before the examiner of interferences, applicant\u2019s counsel have suggested that to purchasers who are familiar with applicant\u2019s name it might also mean \u2018globe right.\u2019 But the suggestion is farfetched, and the opinion of counsel is gratuitous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-11\">We see practically no physical resemblance between \u201cOakite\u201d and \u201cGlobrite,\u201d each considered as a whole, and there is no resemblance in the per se meaning of the terms. \u201cOakite\u201d seems to be an arbitrary term. It does not suggest any quality of appellant\u2019s goods or any result to be attained from its use. \u201cGlobrite\u201d seems to be suggestive of quality and result, and as the commissioner said in his decision, \u201capplicant\u2019s mark is' made up of \u2018two ordinary English words\u2019 * * * \u2018Globrite\u2019 obviously is a contraction of .the words \u2018glow bright,\u2019 * * * \u201d and its meaning is not likely to be misunderstood.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-12\">This court has taken note of phonetic spelling in many cases where it appeared that the conflicting words might be confused in pronunciation, but we see no reason for believing that confusion might be expected in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-13\">For the reasons stated, the decision of the Commissioner of Patents is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-14\">\u25a0 Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
