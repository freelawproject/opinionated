H. Heckett giving the company, its successors and assigns, the right to the free use of Heckett\u2019s patents and whether the court erred in , refusing to grant petitioner\u2019s motion for rehearing so as to permit the introduction of additional, but not after-discovered, evidence on. this point. Our examination of the record satisfies us that the Tax Court\u2019s finding in question was not clearly erroneous and that the Court\u2019s refusal to' grant a rehearing did not constitute reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-10\">Accordingly the decision of the Tax Court will be affirmed</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
