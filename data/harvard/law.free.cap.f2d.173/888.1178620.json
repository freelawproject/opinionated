The peanuts were destroyed by fire while in the possession of the appellant as purchas- \u25a0 er, and under certain provisions of the contract between the parties it is alleged that appellant, Pelham Oil &amp; Fertilizer Company, is liable for the contract price regardless of the loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-12\">We consider it unnecessary to comment at length upon all the facts and circumstances surrounding the execution of the contract in question, or to present any detailed analysis of its various provisions. It is sufficient to observe that the decision of the trial court is amply supported by the evidence and well established contractual principles. The contract before us is clear and unambiguous, and plain to the effect that both parties con-templated appellant was bound, within the limits of its government allocation from the War Food. Administrator, to repurchase the peanuts for shelling purposes as soon as it acquired them from the producers for. the account of the Commodity Credit Corporation. Under such circumstances, the resale of the peanuts to appellant had been fully consummated prior to the time of their loss by the fire, and appellants are therefore liable for their contract purchase price, plus interest from the date it was due.
