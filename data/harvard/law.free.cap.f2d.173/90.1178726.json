In 1940 Quickwork Company sold all of its assets to Whiting Corporation in exchange for cash and the right to receive 10% of the gross sales price of machinery to be manufactured and sold by Whiting Corporation, pursuant to patents theretofore held by Quickwork Company. Following this transaction Quickwork Company liquidated and dissolved. The distribution in liquidation netted the taxpayer $39,204.26 in cash and the assignment of the contract under which Whiting Corporation was required to make future royalty payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-15\">Since the adjusted basis of the taxpayer\u2019s stock on the date of liquidation was $34,000, she paid a capital gain tax on the $5,204.26 cash profit. While the contractual right she held had a very substantial value, there was, owing to future business contingencies, no way of ascertaining its fair market value. Thus, no value was assigned to it in the liquidation distribution. When payments were made by Whiting Corporation to the taxpayer in 1941 and 1943 under the contract, such payments were treated as ordinary income and income tax payments were made accordingly. Taxpayer contends that the receipt of moneys from Whiting Corporation was an integral part of the liquidation distribution, and therefore such sums are to be treated as payments in exchange for stock under \u00a7 115(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, and taxed as a capital gain in the amount determined pursuant to \u00a7 111 of the Internal Revenue Code.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b139-16\">Doubtless the value of the contract would be computed as a capital gain were it found to have an ascertainable market value at the time of Quickwork Company\u2019s liquidation. The taxpayer insists that the rule is the same in the present situation, where the value of the contract depends on uncertain future payments; that the transaction remains open until all payments are completed. Burnet v. Logan, 283 U.S. 404, 51 S.Ct. 550, 75 L.Ed. 1143, is cited. The Supreme Court of the United States, in that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>case, dealt with the sale of stock for cash plus a contractual right given by the purchaser to receive unascertainable amounts payable annually based on future production of iron ore. The cash consideration was less than the taxpayer\u2019s stock investment. It was held that the amounts received under the contract were not to be taxed until the taxpayer\u2019s capital investment had been paid off. The transaction was not a closed one because, as the Supreme Court of the United States said, \u201cAs annual payments on account of extracted ore come in they can be readily apportioned first as return of capital and later as profit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">Appellant seeks to distinguish the Logan case in that it involved a direct sale and not a corporate distribution, as here. It is pointed out that \u00a7 115(c) of the Internal Revenue Code states, \u201cAmounts distributed in complete liquidation of a corporation shall be treated as in full payment in exchange for the stock, * * * \u201d and that in the instant case the taxable sums were not distributed in liquidation, but were paid because of the obligation of a third party. Hence, it is argued, the facts of this case do not permit the money received to be treated as a sale or exchange, which is the statutory foundation for the rule in Burnet v. Logan, supra. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">As we have pointed out, if the contract in question had an ascertainable value, that amount would certainly be an \u201camount distributed in complete liquidation\u201d. The payments in this case arose directly out of the contract, which had a substantial value, and may be said to be \u201camounts distributed\u201d within the purview of \u00a7 115(c), thus falling squarely within the holding in Bur-net v. Logan, 283 U.S. 404, 51 S.Ct. 550, 75 L.Ed. 1143. Distributions under \u00a7 115(c) are treated in the same manner as sales. In any event, it is clear that the contract itself was a distribution under \u00a7 115(c). Its taxable valuation is its fair market value, according to \u00a7 111(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. Although there was no ascertainable fair market value at the time of liquidation, we find nothing in the statute requiring the market value to be measured immediately. In such a situation the only practicable and accurate method of measuring the contract\u2019s value is through the application of money to such valuation as it is received. The alternatives are to ascribe a fictitious or speculative value to the property, which was condemned in the Logan case, or to allow it no value, as urged by appellants: Such methods result in inaccuracies and inequities. We think the proper procedure is to measure the value of the contract as payments are received.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">In Commissioner v. Carter, 2 Cir., 170 F.2d 911, a case which presents a factual situation almost identical with that of the instant case, the second circuit held that payments received under circumstances similar to payments made pursuant to the contract in question here should be taxed as capital gain. We think the payments in question here should be so treated and affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b139-11\"> Relevant portions of tile Code are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b139-12\">\u201c\u00a7 115.
