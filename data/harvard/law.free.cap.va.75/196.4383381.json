C. Humphreys, against John S. Benson, to enforce the specific execution of. a contract for the sale of . a tract of land by the plaintiffs to the defendant. Benson was in possession of the land, and had made all but the last payment. The only question was whether he was bound to pay for an additional number of acres, it appearing that there was that much more in the tract than was mentioned in the contract, and that depended upon the questien whether it was a purchase in gross or by the acre.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b226-9\">It appears that the contract was not reduced to writing until the cash and first deferred payment had been made. A paper was then prepared and signed by the Humphreys, in which they recite the contract, and the payments made and the amount yet due. The contract states that whereas, heretofore, to-wit: on the 6th day of May, 1874, John S. Benson, of Washington city, &amp;c., entered into a contract for the purchase of, and did purchase, certain real estate situated at or near Mills\u2019 cross-roads, in Fairfax county, &amp;c., containing fifty-three and a half acres, more or less, with the improvements thereon, with and from Guy Humphreys, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>Newton Humphreys and G. C. Humphreys, all of said county, the same being the eastern half or portion of a tract of land conveyed by the said Humphreys to one A. H. Grinnan by deed dated the 28th day of April, 1869, in trust to secure the payment, &amp;c., for the sum of one thousand eight hundred and seventy dollars and fifty cents, payable as follows: Three hundred and seventy-two dollars and fifty cents to be paid in hand, and the balance in two equal instalments at one and two years from the 6th of May. And then reciting the payments made, and how, it is added\u2014leaving the second payment of $750, with legal interest thereon from the 6th day of May, 1875, now due, which said sum is a lien upon the land contracted to be sold, and is to be paid on the 6th of May, 1876. And they covenant to warrant the title generally. This paper is dated July 24th, 1875.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-5\">The plaintiffs in their bill insisted it was a sale of the land at $35 per acre, and that they were entitled to compensation at the same rate per acre for all over the 53-\u00a1-acres specified in the contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-6\">Benson, in his answer, denied that it was a sale by the acre, and insisted it was a sale in gross, and that he was entitled to all the land within the boundaries at the price of $1,872.50, which he had contracted to pay.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-7\">The circuit court directed a survey of the land; which was made, and showed that there was in the tract 61 acres 1 rood and 9 poles.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-8\">The cause came on to be heard on the 16th of November, 1877, when the court held that the sale was a sale of the land by the acre, and that the plaintiffs were entitled to compensation for the excess\u20147 acres 1 rood and 9 poles\u2014 over the 53| acres, which the tract was supposed to contain, at the price of $35 per acre, the same amounting to $273.25. And the decree was for the $750, with interest from the 6th of May, 1876, and for the $273.25, with interest from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>the 26th of August, 1876, the time of the commencement of the suit, and costs. And on failure to pay, &amp;c. From this decree Benson applied to this court for an appeal and <em>supersedeas ; </em>which was awarded.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b228-5\"><em>S. F.

AVhen these terms are used it rather repels the idea of a contract of hazard, and implies that there is no considerable difference in quantity.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-12\"><em>Third. </em>AYhile contracts of hazard are not <em>invalid, </em>courts of equity do not regard them with favor. The presumption is against them, and while such presumption may be repelled, it can only be effectually done by clear and cogent proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-13\"><em>Fourth. </em>The burthen of proof is always upon the party asserting a contract of hazard; for the presumption always being in favor of a sale per acre, a sale in gross, or contract of hazard, must be <em>clearly established by the facts.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number><em>Fifth. </em>Where the parties contract for the payment <em>of a gross sum </em>for a tract or parcel of land upon the estimate of a given quantity, the presumption is that the quantity influences the price to be paid, and that the agreement is not one of hazard.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\"><em>Sixth. </em>Whether it be a contract in gross or for a specific quantity depends, of course, upon the intention of the contracting' parties, to be gathered from the terms of the contract and all the facts and circumstances connected with it. But in interpreting such contracts the court, not favoring contracts of hazard, will always construe the same to be contracts of sale <em>per acre, </em>wherever <em>it does not dearly appear </em>that the land was sold by <em>the trad, </em>and not <em>by the acre. </em>See <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Hoy, </em>28 Gratt. 698, where all the cases decided by this court and many others are carefully collected in the elaborate opinion of Judge <em>Burks.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Applying these rules of law to the case before us, our conclusion is that the sale to Benson was a sale <em>per acre, </em>and not a sale <em>in gross, </em>and that the court below was plainly right, upon the evidence in the cause, in holding him responsible to pay to the appellees the sum of $35 per acre (the contract price) for the excess in quantity as shown by the survey. The decree of the circuit court of Fairfax county must therefore be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">Decree aefirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
