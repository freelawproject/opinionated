J. S. A. </em>2A:138-1) and attempted robbery. His motion for a new trial was denied, and he was sentenced to State Prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-10\">On this appeal defendant contends that the trial judge erred in allowing the State to call as a witness on its direct case a handwriting expert who had been engaged solely by the defense. Defendant\u2019s attorneys had given Donald C. Greenwood, the expert witness, letters previously written by defendant so that Greenwood could determine whether defendant\u2019s handwriting was on a note which the victim claimed had been written by her assailant. It was Greenwood\u2019s opinion, before trial and given under oath at trial, that defendant had written the note. Defendant now contends that Greenwood was his attorney\u2019s agent and that per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>mitting Greenwood to testify violated defendant\u2019s attorney-client privilege embodied in <em>Evid. B. </em>26 <em>(N. J. 8. A. </em>2A: 84A-20).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">We disagree. The letters were used solely as exemplars of defendant\u2019s handwriting. Their contents were not offered for testimonial purposes, that is to say, the purpose was not to place in evidence the statements contained in the letters or their meaning. The contents were offered solely as physical evidence, to show the shape and style of the handwriting. As such they are not protected by the privilege against self-incrimination <em>(Gilbert v. California, </em>388 <em>U. S. </em>263, 87 <em>S. Ct. </em>1951, 18 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 1178 (1967); <em>State v. Carr, </em>124 <em>N. J. Super. </em>114 (Law Div. 1973); see <em>Fisher v. United States, </em>\u2014 <em>U. S. </em>\u2014, \u2014, 96 <em>S. Ct. </em>1569, 1579-1580, 48 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 39, 54-56, (1976)), any more than voiceprints and blood samples. <em>Evid. R. </em>25 <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>2A:84A-19 (a)); <em>State v. Cary, </em>49 <em>N. J. </em>343 (1967); <em>State v. King, </em>44 <em>N. J. </em>346, 357 \u2014 358 (1965). Nor were they \u201ccommunications\u201d to defendant\u2019s attorney which the attorney-client is designed to protect. Eevealing the physical characteristics of the handwriting would not infringe defendant\u2019s right to consult and communicate freely with his attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">Thus, allowing Greenwood to testify for the State did not violate defendant\u2019s attorney-client privilege. See <em>People v. Smith, </em>318 <em>Ill. </em>114, 125, 149 <em>N. E. </em>3, 8 (Sup. Ct. 1925). Since handwriting exemplars are nontestimonial, <em>State v. Kociolek, </em>23 <em>N. J. </em>400 (1957), and <em>United States v. Alvarez, </em>519 <em>F. </em>2d 1036 (3 Cir. 1975), upon which defendant relies, are inapplicable. And nothing contained in <em>State v. Montague, </em>55 <em>N. J. </em>387, 402 (1970), which defendant has cited, precludes the use of Greenwood\u2019s testimony at trial; the handwriting examination is not within the protection accorded by <em>R. </em>3 :13-3 (c) to an attorney\u2019s work product.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b436-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>We note that Greenwood did not object to testifying when called by the State, and we need not decide whether he would have had the right to refuse to testify in the face of defendant\u2019s exercise of discovery rights under <em>R. 3:13-3. Cf. Hull v. Plume, </em>131 <em>N. J. L. </em>511, 517 (E. &amp; A. 1944); <em>Stanton v. Rushmore, </em>112 <em>N. J. L. </em>115 (E. &amp; A. 1933); <em>Rogotzki v. Schept, </em>91 <em>N. J. Super. </em>135 (App. Div. 1966); Annotation, \u201cCompelling expert to testify,\u201d 77 <em>A. L. R. </em>2d 1182 (1961). Nor has any question been raised as to Greenwood\u2019s right to payment for his services from the party who called him as a witness. See <em>Stanton v. Rushmore, supra </em>112 <em>N. J. L. </em>at 117-118.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">Defendant also contends that the victim\u2019s out-of-court identifications of defendant, from photographs and in person, were impermissibly suggestive and violated defendant\u2019s rights. Considering all the circumstances we find no abuse of the trial judge\u2019s discretion in admitting this evidence. <em>Cf. Neil v. Biggers, </em>409 <em>U. S. </em>188, 93 <em>S. Ct. </em>375, 34 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 401 (1972); <em>Simmons v. United States, </em>390 <em>U. S. </em>377, 88 <em>S. Ct. </em>967, 19 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 1247 (1968). Moreover, the victim had ample opportunity to observe her assailant before and during the assault, and the trial judge was justified in concluding that the victim\u2019s in-court identification was not tainted by any alleged impropriety in the out-of-court identification procedures. <em>State v. Thompson, </em>59 <em>N. J. </em>396, 418-419 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Lastly, there is no merit to defendant\u2019s contention that the prosecutor\u2019s statements in his opening and in summation warrant reversal of his conviction. The trial judge\u2019s rulings and instructions to the jury appropriately rectified any alleged improprieties, and we note that the prosecutor withdrew the objectionable remarks made in his opening statement and apologized for them. The principle of cumulative error (see <em>State v. Orecchio, </em>16 <em>N. J. </em>125, 129 (1954)) is not pertinent here.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b435-8\"> The \u201cwork product\u201d rule does not shield reports of \u201cphysical examinations\u201d or \u201cscientific tests.\u201d They are made discoverable by the express provisions of <em>R. </em>3:13-3(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
