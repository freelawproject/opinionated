Salerno, principals in an accounting firm known as Schuhalter, Salerno &amp; Co., P.C., (S &amp; S) entered into an agreement for dissolution of the firm and apportionment of its assets and business. The agreement designated certain firm clients as' Salerno\u2019s and the remainder as Schuhalter\u2019s, and restricted each of the principals from soliciting or serving the other\u2019s clients. Schuhalter brought this action in 1989, alleging, among other matters, that Salerno had breached the agreement by soliciting and serving Sehuhalter\u2019s clients. Schuhalter also joined as defendants Howard R. Berlly, Dennis A. Cannon and Herbert Weber, former S &amp; S employees who joined Salerno following the dissolution. The defendants asserted a number of counterclaims, including a claim that Schuhalter had wrongfully withheld monies due under the agreement. All the claims and counterclaims were dismissed before or at trial, except for two: the jury awarded Schuhalter $8000 in fees due under the agreement and found no cause for action on Salerno\u2019s claim for wrongful withholding of fees by Schuhalter. Schuhalter appeals, and Salerno cross-appeals, both asserting errors in the dismissal of the claims not submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">\n<em>I</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b536-10\">Sehuhalter\u2019s central contention is that the Law Division wrongly held \u201cthat the parties\u2019 arms-length agreement was void as against public policy to the extent it conditioned, in any respect, the ability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>of a former accounting partner to work for former clients of the partnership.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">The dissolution agreement named particular S &amp; S clients as Salerno\u2019s; the remaining clients were regarded as Schuhalter\u2019s. The parties agreed to \u201ccooperate with the other to avoid placing a client of the other in a position of embarrassment or discomfort in continuing to engage [Schuhalter] or Salerno as that client\u2019s accountant.\u201d If a client of one \u201cexpress[es] discomfort and/or dissatisfaction to the other,\u201d ... the recipient \u201cshall promptly notify the other of the tenor and substance of the conversation(s).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A39\">Section 4.7a of the agreement then provided that if the client</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-7\">nevertheless expresses a desire to engage the other as that client\u2019s accountant, the other may, at ... his option, accept such engagement from the client after giving notice to the other party, and in the event of acceptance of such engagement, ... he shall pay to the other party (the former accountant) a sum equal to the billings of fees to such client by the other party (the former accountant) for the last full year, consisting of the 12 months immediately preceding, in sixty (GO) consecutive equal monthly installments, without interest, the first installment being due and payable on the first day of the month following the date on which the party (the new accountant) accepting such client renders services to that client.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">Finally, in Sections 12.1 and 12.2, Salerno and Schuhalter mutually covenanted that for two years after the dissolution neither would solicit or serve the other\u2019s clients except as allowed by Section 4.7a.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">The First Count of Schuhalter\u2019s complaint alleged that Salerno violated the agreement by soliciting and serving Schuhalter\u2019s clients. Salerno denied those allegations and asserted that the restrictive provisions of the agreement were \u201cunenforceable as violative of the public policy of the State of New Jersey.\u201d After some discovery, Salerno moved for partial summary judgment dismissing the First Count. A Law Division judge denied that application with the following explanation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-10\">With respect to the question of the validity of the so-called restrictive covenant, however, it does not appear that summary judgment can be granted at this posture of the ease. There is no question but that the clients of the accountants have the absolute right to choose the firm which shall be responsible for their accounting needs. The question, however, appears to be as to whether or not there was any active solicitation as to some of them or one of them as the case may be. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>Consequently, partial summary judgment with respect to that aspect of the case shall be denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">Some months later, Salerno again moved to dismiss the First Count. That motion was heard by a second judge, who interpreted the prior denial as a holding that \u201cthe restrictive covenants [are] unenforceable except as to solicitation.\u201d The second judge found that to be the law of the case, although he frankly acknowledged that \u201cI\u2019m not so sure that if the issue were before me afresh, without a prior ruling by [the first judge], that I would come to the same result.\u201d Based on that ruling<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and on a finding that there was no proof of Salerno\u2019s actual solicitation of Schuhalter\u2019s clients, the judge dismissed the First Count.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">The record supports the finding of no actual solicitation. But we conclude that the restrictive covenants are enforceable even in the absence of actual solicitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">\n<em>II</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">The modern New Jersey view of noncompetitive agreements was stated in <em>Solari Industries, Inc. v. Malady, </em>55 <em>N.J. </em>571, 576, 264 A.2d 53 (1970):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-9\">Though noncompetitive agreements were at one time flatly outlawed, it is now well recognized that they do have a proper place and are enforceable under appropriate circumstances. Thus a seller\u2019s incidental noncompetitive covenant, which is designed to protect the good will of the business for the buyer, is freely enforceable in the courts. And while a covenant by an employee not to compete after the termination of his employment is not, because of the countervailing policy considerations, as freely enforceable, it will nonetheless be given effect if it is reasonable in view of all the circumstances of the particular ease. It will generally be found to be reasonable where it simply protects the legitimate interests of the. employer, imposes no undue hardship on the employee, and is not injurious to the public.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-10\">Here Salerno and Schuhalter can be regarded as both sellers and buyers of portions of the partnership business. Salerno does not contend otherwise, nor does he suggest that enforcement of the covenants should be restricted because of any unequal bargaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>power or other \u201ccountervailing policy considerations\u201d associated with employer\u2014employee covenants. <em>See, e.g., Foti v. Cook, </em>220 <em>Va. </em>800, 263 S.E.2d 430, 433 (1980) (restrictive covenant of partners of accounting firm are unlike employees\u2019 covenants). Salerno argues, rather, and the Law Division appears to have agreed, that he \u201cfall[s] within that class of professionals whose services, like those of lawyers and doctors, are so personal and confidential in nature as to prohibit restrictive covenants which impinge on the public\u2019s right to free access to the professional of its choice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Salerno relies on a series of New Jersey cases assertedly holding that \u201cagreements between professionals whose services entail personal, confidential, and fiduciary relationships with their clients must not serve to restrict the public\u2019s rights of free choice of such professionals.\u201d We find no such principle in our case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">The earliest of the modern New Jersey cases is <em>Dwyer v. Jung, </em>133 <em>N.J.Super. </em>343, 336 A.2d 498 (Ch.Div.), <em>aff'd </em>137 <em>N.J.Super. </em>135, 348 A.2d 208 (App.Div.1975). There a law partnership was dissolved pursuant to an agreement parcelling out named clients to specific partners and providing that \u201call partners shall be restricted from doing business with a client designated as that of another partner for a period of 5 (five) years.\u201d <em>Id. </em>133 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 345, 336 A.2d 498. The court refused to enforce those restrictions, finding \u201c[s]trong public policy considerations\u201d against anything \u201cwhich restricts the right of the client to repose confidence in any counsel of his choice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 346-47, 336 A.2d 498. Importantly, the court relied on the disciplinary rules promulgated by the American Bar Association and adopted in New Jersey declaring unethical any contractual restriction on the right of a lawyer to practice law. <em>Id. </em>at 347-49, 336 A.2d 498.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">The narrow scope of the <em>Dwyer </em>holding is made clear in the subsequent cases. In <em>Karlin v. Weinberg, </em>77 <em>N.J. </em>408, 390 A.2d 1161 (1978), the Supreme Court refused to invalidate a post-employment restrictive covenant ancillary to an employment contract between physicians. The Court held that, like post-employment covenants in commercial settings, a restraint on a physician <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>is enforceable \u201cto the extent that it protects a legitimate interest of the employer, imposes no undue hardship on the employee, and is not injurious to the public.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 412, 390 A2d 1161. The Court specifically rejected the argument that <em>Dwyer </em>rendered restrictive covenants among professionals unreasonable <em>per se. Id. </em>at 418, 390 A.2d 1161. Rather, <em>Dwyer </em>\u201crepresents an exercise by the judicial branch of its unique constitutional responsibility for regulating the conduct of attorneys.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 419, 390 A2d 1161.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\"><em>Jacob v. Norris, McLaughlin &amp; Marcus, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>10, 607 A.2d 142 (1992), again confirmed that \u201cany [contractual] provision, whether direct or indirect, that operates so as to restrict a lawyer\u2019s post-termination practice will contravene the ethical rule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 18, 607 A 2d 142. The Court held that \u201cfinancial disincentive provisions, like direct prohibitions, are unenforceable\u201d under the rule. <em>Id. </em>at 23, 607 A2d 142. Nothing in the Court\u2019s opinion suggests the broad right of public access to professionals that Salerno urges here.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Salerno\u2019s principal reliance is on <em>Mailman, Ross, etc. v. Edelson, </em>183 <em>N.J.Super. </em>434, 444 A.2d 75 (Ch.Div.1982). Edelson, a certified public accountant, had been employed by Mailman, an accounting firm, under an agreement that he would not \u201caccept, solicit or offer\u201d accounting services from or to Mailman clients for a period of two years after termination of his employment. <em>Id. </em>at 436, 444 A.2d 75. On Mailman\u2019s application for a preliminary injunction enforcing that covenant, the trial judge granted interim relief prohibiting only Edelson\u2019s \u201cinterference with [Mailman\u2019s] existing professional relationships.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 444, 444 A2d 75. The trial judge acknowledged that lawyers and doctors were treated differently in <em>Dwyer </em>and <em>Karlin, </em>but eschewed any attempt \u201cto determine if accountants are more similar to doctors than to lawyers, or vice versa.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 440, 444 A.2d 75. Rather, he evaluated Edelson\u2019s covenant under the three-part <em>Sola\u00f1 </em>test. The judge accepted, first, that \u201c[a]n employer\u2019s ongoing professional relationship with its clients is generally recognized as a legitimate business interest which may be protected through a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>restrictive covenant.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>He acknowledged, second, that a covenant duration of two years is \u201cgenerally held to be reasonable,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 441, 444 A.2d 75, and that no geographic limitation was necessary since the covenant sought to protect existing client relationships rather than a territorial sphere of influence. <em>Id. </em>at 441-42, 444 A.2d 75. But with respect to the third <em>Solari </em>criterion\u2014whether the covenant was \u201cinjurious to the public\u201d\u2014the judge found that the \u201cconsensual and fiduciary\u201d relationship between accountant and client made it unreasonable \u201cto preclude [Mailman\u2019s] present clients from unilaterally exercising their free choice\u201d to seek out Edelson. <em>Id. </em>at 444, 444 A.2d 75.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\"><em>Mailman </em>can be read as holding that accountants\u2019 covenants should be tested, like all other (except lawyers\u2019) covenants, by the <em>Solan </em>rules. To that extent, we agree with <em>Mailman. See also La Porte v. Bott, </em>173 <em>N.J.Super. </em>590, 414 A.2d 1363 (App.Div.1980) (finding that proper proofs could warrant enforcement of a non-competition clause of an agreement dissolving an accounting partnership). However, <em>Mailman </em>also implies that covenants restricting professionals in their practice are necessarily so \u201cinjurious to the public\u201d that they should rarely, if ever, be enforced. That implication is at odds with <em>Karlin. </em>In <em>Karlin, </em>where the employee doctor was contractually barred from practicing dermatology for five years within ten miles of his former employer\u2019s office, the Supreme Court not only found no <em>per se </em>invalidity, but did not even presume a public injury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-6\">Significant here is the demand for the services rendered by the employee and the likelihood that those Services could be provided by other physicians already practicing in the area. If enforcement of the covenant would result in a shortage of physicians within the area in question, then the court must determine whether this shortage would be alleviated by new physicians establishing practices in the area. It should examine also the degree to which enforcement of the covenant would foreclose resort to the services of the \u201cdeparting\u201d physician by those of his patients who might otherwise desire to seek him out at his new location. If the geographical dimensions of the covenant make it impossible, as a practical matter, for existing patients to continue treatment, then the trial court should consider the advisability of restricting the covenant\u2019s geographical scope in light of the number of patients who would be so restricted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-7\">[77 <em>N.J. </em>at 424, 390 A.2d 1161].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>To be sure, the nature of the covenantor\u2019s occupation always bears on the evaluation of the public impact of the restraint. But the fact that Salerno is a professional accountant does not render his covenant unenforceable as a matter of law. <em>See, generally, </em>Stuart L. Pachman, <em>Accountants and Restrictive Covenants: The Client Commodity, </em>13 <em>Seton Hall L.Rev. </em>312, 313 (1983) (\u201cCourts have repeatedly rejected the argument that the application of a restrictive covenant to an accountant is void as against public policy or that it is unreasonable <em>per se\u201d); </em>Serena L. Kafker, <em>Golden Handcuffs: Enforceability of Non-Competition Clauses in Professional Partnership Agreements of Accountants, Physicians, and Attorneys, </em>31 <em>American Business L.J. </em>31, 37 (1993) (\u201cCourts have decided the validity of non-competition clauses in accounting partnership agreements according to the traditional standard applied to any business or occupation\u2014whether it is reasonable in the circumstances.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">\n<em>Ill</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Although New Jersey ease law does not support Salerno\u2019s broad assertion of invalidity of restrictive covenants that \u201cimpinge on the public\u2019s right to free access to the professional of its choice,\u201d enforcement of his covenant is appropriate only \u201cif it is reasonable in view of all the circumstances of the particular case.\u201d <em>Solari, </em>55 <em>N.J. </em>at 576, 264 A.2d 53. We have no difficulty in finding the restrictions in the dissolution agreement to be reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">Salerno does not dispute that the parties\u2019 mutual covenants protected their legitimate interests in maintaining their respective client relationships, the most significant assets of their partnership. The agreement made by each\u2014to recompense the other for an asset ostensibly \u201cbought\u201d but in fact captured by the other within two years\u2014is a reasonable means to assure the value of such assets for the \u201cbuyer.\u201d <em>Karlin, </em>indeed, suggests that such a covenant is a necessity: \u201conly if the [former employee\u2019s] restrictive covenant is given effect can [the employer-physician] hope to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>protect in some measure his legitimate interest in preserving his ongoing relationship with his patients.\u201d 77 <em>N.J. </em>at 417, 390 A.2d 1161. <em>See also Jacob, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>at 28-29, 607 A.2d 142 (recognizing \u201cthe importance of \u2018goodwill\u2019 as an element of the value of a partner\u2019s interest\u201d and the propriety of compensating for \u201cthe potential detrimental effect of the departure or a partner or partners on those remaining.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">Nor does Salerno urge that his covenant imposes an undue hardship on him. Its term was only two years, a modest imposition. <em>Mailman, </em>183 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 441, 444 A.2d 75. Unlike other covenants sustained in our courts, Salerno\u2019s commitment did not require him to forego or limit his professional activities, nor did it restrict his activities geographically. The covenant did create a financial disincentive to Salerno\u2019s servicing of Schuhalter\u2019s clients during the two-year period. But Salerno does not suggest\u2014nor is there any reason to conclude\u2014that an amount equal to one year\u2019s billings, paid over five years without interest, is an unreasonable price to acquire the business of an accounting client. <em>Compare Jacob, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>at 28, 607 A.2d 142 (finding a \u201cpenalty\u201d where a single service for a single former client would forfeit \u201cthe entire compensation package\u201d). Certainly the financial disincentive cannot be regarded as an undue hardship when weighed against Schuhalter\u2019s legitimate interest in retaining the business allocated to him under the dissolution agreement. As the court noted in <em>Fuller v. Brough, </em>159 <em>Colo. </em>147, 411 P.2d 18, 21 (1966), upholding a restrictive covenant in the dissolution of an accounting partnership, a partner\u2019s claim of undue hardship \u201closes its appeal when it is remembered that he sought to [impose] the same burden on [his former partner].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">Those same considerations also refute Salerno\u2019s claim that his covenant is an undue burden to the public. The public is not deprived of Salerno\u2019s services, nor is the public even required to seek Salerno out at a distant location. Salerno\u2019s covenant has an impact, at most, on a identified handful of clients that have historically aligned themselves with Schuhalter in any event. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>Even those clients are not foreclosed from obtaining Salerno\u2019s services: they face only the possibility that Salerno will elect\u2014for two years\u2014not to service them rather than pay the client-acquisition cost fixed in the dissolution agreement. That short-term and narrow-scope inhibition, self-imposed by Salerno as part of the parties\u2019 mutual effort to preserve their professional goodwill, hardly qualifies as an excessive imposition on the public at large. <em>Cf. A.T. Hudson &amp; Co., Inc. v. Donovan, </em>216 <em>N.J.Super. </em>426, 432-33, 524 A.2d 412 (App.Div.1987) (holding that employer\u2019s interest in protecting customer relationships outweighs public interest in \u201can unrestricted choice of management consultants.\u201d) Pachman, <em>supra, </em>states the analysis well:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-5\">By restricting the accountant covenantee from rendering professional services to clients of his or her former firm, the court is within the ambit of the traditional rules of restrictive covenant law although there may be some adverse effect on the public; that is, those clients who would prefer to enjoy the continued services of the accountant leaving the firm. That effect, however, is avoided or lessened if instead of granting injunctive relief, the court requires the former employee or partner to pay for the clients \u201ctaken.\u201d By providing the purchase price and terms in the agreement, the court's task is made easier and the likelihood of enforcement is enhanced. Thus, the legitimate interest of the employer is protected without imposing undue hardship on the employee or being overly injurious to the public.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-6\">[13 <em>Seton Hall L.Rev. </em>at 322].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">Our conclusions are supported by a significant body of case law in other jurisdictions. Illustrative is <em>Holloway v. Faw, Casson &amp; Co., </em>319 Md. 324, 572 A.2d 510 (1990), where an accounting firm sued a withdrawing partner to enforce his promise not to service firm clients for five years and to pay the firm</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVb\">100% of the prior year\u2019s fee for any clients that were [the firm\u2019s] who engage the services of the withdrawing partner during the five-year period [of his covenant not to service such clients].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">The Maryland Court of Appeals analyzed the provisions as restrictive covenants, <em>id. </em>572 A.2d at 515, and applied the same three-part test described in <em>Solari. Id. </em>572 A.2d at 516. The court sustained the covenants, noting that they did not prohibit competition but simply obliged the withdrawing partner, in effect, to purchase from the former firm the account of any firm client he serviced. The agreement thus</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6N\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>ties the restriction closely to |the firm\u2019s] interest in its client base, inhibits [the withdrawing partner\u2019s I practice of accountancy only with respect to that client base, and gives the general public, outside of that client base, the benefit of unfettered competition. The reasonableness of the provision is further reinforced by its ready analogy to the purchase of an accounting practice, or of part of an accounting practice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 520. The court also found that the \u201cfee equivalent provision is a valid liquidated damage clause,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 526, noting the expert testimony \u201cthat accounting practices ... are purchased at prices determined by multiplying annual billings by a factor in a range which comfortably includes the factor ... utilized in the Agreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 520.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">Another exemplar, <em>Perry v. Moran, </em>109 Wash.2d 691, 748 P.2d 224 (Wash.1987), <em>judgment modified on reconsideration, </em>111 Wash.2d 885, 766 P.2d 1096 (1989), involved an accountant\u2019s agreement not to provide services to his former employer\u2019s clients for a period of five years; if the employee violated that undertaking, the employer had the option to require the employee to pay \u201cfifty percent (50%) of the actual fees billed or billable to such Client Accounts by Employee each year for a period of three (3) years commencing with the date Employee first renders services to such Client Accounts.\u201d Upholding the covenants, the Washington Supreme Court rejected the suggestion that a prohibition on soliciting or diverting clients would be sufficient protection for the employer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-8\">A covenant that merely prohibits solicitation or diversion places upon the employer the burden of proving (1) that the former employee performed some act or acts which had the potential of enticing clients away from the employer, and (2) that those acts were the cause of the client\u2019s decision to leave the employer and seek accounting services from the former employee. If this burden were placed upon an employer, the process would be difficult and expensive. The employer would be required to invest time and money in litigating the nature of the former employee\u2019s actions toward the clients. In many cases the employer would have to bring those clients into the litigation as witnesses to prove that solicitation occurred. Particularly where, as here, those clients are doctors, clinics and business corporations, an attempt to involve the clients in litigation would damage the goodwill existing between those clients and the employer, and would damage the reputation of the employer with potential clients. A prudent employer could not rely on such a covenant to protect its client base. It is reasonable for the employer to preclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>the employee from servicing those who were clients of the employer during the period of employment and for a period after the cessation of employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">In evaluating the reasonableness of the payment obligation, the <em>Perry </em>court relied on an earlier Washington ease, <em>Knight, Vale &amp; Gregory v. McDaniel, </em>37 <em>Wash.App. </em>366, 371, 680 P.2d 448, 452, <em>review denied, </em>101 Wash.2d 1025 (1984), where an accountant covenanted not to service his employer\u2019s former clients for three years. The contract provided that, if the employee breached, he would pay the employer 35% of fees billed or billable to those clients within the three-year period. The court found that provision to be appropriate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-6\">Harm resulting to one business from the competition of another business is difficult to estimate accurately. Here, however, there was an expert\u2019s uncontroverted affidavit that the damages sought of 35 percent of any fees collected reflect no more than a reasonable forecast of the harm to the employer occasioned by a breach of the covenant. Because the formula is based upon a percentage of competing business actually occurring it is directly linked to the actual damage to goodwill experienced by the employer. In addition, the 35 percent figure is based upon a general formula in the accounting field for purchase of an ongoing practice. In short, the clause is not an arbitrary estimate of damages, is not a penalty and is enforceable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-7\"><em>See also, e.g., Criss v.
