Plaintiff claimed that defendants violated its rights under the federal and state constitutions by imposing an arbitrary, discriminatory and excessive property tax assessment on its automobile assembly plant in Linden. By an amended complaint, plaintiff claimed that Chaiken negligently valued its property and therefore is also liable under common law tort principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">The Law Division concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over plaintiffs \u00a7 1983 claims because they relate to a tax assessment. Despite holding that it lacked jurisdiction, the Law Division also ruled that the individual defendants.have absolute immunity from suit under \u00a7 1983 for an alleged violation of constitutional rights relating to a tax assessment and that Linden cannot be held responsible for any constitutional violation which its tax assessor may have committed. In addition, the Law Division, citing <em>J.H. Becker, Inc. v. Marlboro Township, </em>82 <em>N.J.Super. </em>519, 530, 198 A.2d 463 (App.Div.1964), dismissed plaintiffs common law negligence claim against Chaiken on the ground that his valuation of plaintiffs property was \u201cnot binding upon the tax assessor.\u201d The trial court subsequently denied defendants\u2019 motions for counsel fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Plaintiff has appealed from the summary judgment in defendants\u2019 favor and defendants have cross-appealed from the denial of their applications for counsel fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">Initially, we note that the order from which this appeal has been taken is not a final judgment appealable as of right because it does not include a final determination of defendants\u2019 applications for counsel fees and costs. Defendants argued in support of their applications for .attorney fees that even if they did not enjoy absolute immunity from suit under \u00a7 1983, plaintiffs proofs were \u201cwoefully inadequate and could not sustain a cause of action.\u201d In denying defendants\u2019 applications, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>[Defendants also base their request for attorney fees on the assertion that General Motor\u2019s lawsuit lacked any basis in fact____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-7\">Plaintiff responds that it would be unfair for this Court to grant attorney fees ... because discovery has been stayed and therefore, the facts have not been disclosed....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-8\">[P]laintiff argues that it has sufficient proofs, or will through discovery obtain sufficient proofs to show that the defendant\u2019s assessment was the result of discrimination or retaliation....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-9\">Plaintiff argues that it should not be stalled from developing further proofs of a conspiracy and that, under the circumstances, a motion for attorney fees at this time is premature. General Motors argues that it should be given the opportunity to have discovery and to brief and argue the facts which it alleges demonstrates a conspiracy and bad faith.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-10\">This Court accepts the plaintiffs argument at this time thereby denies the defendants\u2019 request for attorney fees. But I note once again that the proofs submitted to date are inadequate and insufficient as a basis for a 1983 claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-11\">In light of my decision regarding attorney fees, the issue of costs will be held in abeyance until such time as the issue of attorney fees is resolved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-12\">Thus, the trial court\u2019s denial of defendants\u2019 applications for counsel fees was without prejudice to their later renewal, because that denial was based in part on plaintiffs request to be allowed to conduct additional discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-13\">This decision was memorialized by a \u201cfinal order,\u201d entered on June 30, 1998, which stated in part that \u201cdefendants\u2019 motions to include reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees as part of their costs are hereby denied, and that the issue of defendants\u2019 court costs shall be held in abeyance.\u201d Considered in light of the court\u2019s prior oral opinion, we read this order to deny defendants\u2019 applications for attorney fees without prejudice to their renewal after General Motors completes discovery. See <em>Church of Scientology of Cal. v. Cazares, </em>638 F.2d 1272, 1290 (5th Cir.1981) (indicating that even though a \u00a7 1983 action presents \u201cnovel legal issues,\u201d it nevertheless may be \u201cgroundless\u201d and thus warrant an award of counsel fees to a defendant if plaintiffs claims have no substantial factual foundation). In addition, this order expressly held defendants\u2019 application for costs in abeyance.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-14\">An appeal as of right may be taken to this court only from' a final judgment, which requires a final disposition of all claims as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>to all parties. <em>Hudson v. Hudson, </em>36 <em>N.J. </em>549, 553, 178 A.2d 202 (1962). Consequently, an order which holds an application for attorneys\u2019 fees or costs in abeyance or which denies the application pending the completion of further discovery is not a final judgment. <em>See In re Estate of Johnson, </em>240 <em>N.J.Super. </em>134, 136, 572 A.2d 1163 (App.Div.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">Although the order from which this appeal has been taken is interlocutory, the appeal has been fully briefed and argued. Moreover, we are satisfied that the interests of justice will be served by a decision of this court with respect to certain of the issues presented. Therefore, we grant plaintiff leave to appeal <em>nunc pro tunc. </em>See <em>R. </em>2:4-4(b)(2). However, since the denial of defendants\u2019 applications for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs were without prejudice and contemplated further proceedings before the trial court, we dismiss defendants\u2019 cross appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">We conclude that the trial court erred in holding that it lacked jurisdiction, over this matter. The court also erred in its further holding that defendants enjoy absolute immunity from a suit under \u00a7 1983 alleging a denial of federal constitutional rights in connection with a tax assessment. Since the trial court did not decide and the parties have not addressed whether plaintiffs allegations state a cause of action under \u00a7 1983, we do not pass upon this question. Finally, we agree with the trial court\u2019s holding that Chaiken may not be held liable under common law tort principles for negligence in rendering an opinion to Linden regarding the fair market value of plaintiffs property.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">A plaintiff in a \u00a7 1983 action may recover both compensatory and punitive damages against any municipal official or employee responsible for a deprivation of federal constitutional rights, <em>Smith v. Wade, </em>461 <em>U.S. </em>30, 35-36, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>1625, 1629, 75 L.Ed.2d 632, 638-39 (1983); <em>Carey v. Piphus, </em>435 <em>U.S. </em>247, 254-57, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>1042, 1047-49, 55 L.Ed.2d 252, 259-60 (1978), and also may recover compensatory, but not punitive, damages against a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>municipality. <em>Newport v. Facts Concerts, Inc., 453 U.S. 247, </em>101 <em>S.Ct. </em>2748, 69 L.Ed.2d 616 (1981). In addition, a prevailing party in an action under \u00a7 1988 may recover attorneys\u2019 fees. 42 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 1988; <em>see Farrar v. Hobby, </em>- <em>U.S. </em>-, 113 <em>S.Ct. </em>566, 121 L.Ed.2d 494 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">\u201cState courts as well as federal courts have jurisdiction over \u00a7 1983 cases,\u201d <em>Howlett v. Rose, </em>496 <em>U.S. </em>356, 358, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>2430, 2433, <em>110 </em>L.Ed.2d 332, 342 (1990), and \u201c[t]he existence of this jurisdiction creates an implication of duty to exercise it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 369-70, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2439-40, 110 L.Ed.2d at 349 (quoting <em>Mondou v. New York, N.H. &amp; H.R. Co., 223 U.S. </em>1, 58, 32 <em>S.Ct. </em>169, 178, 56 <em>L.Ed. 327, </em>349 (1912)). \u00a7 1983 is enforceable in state courts \u201cnot because Congress has determined that federal courts would otherwise be burdened or that state courts might provide a more convenient forum ... but because the Constitution and laws passed pursuant to it are as much laws in the States as laws passed by the state legislature.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 367, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2438, 110 L.Ed.2d at 347. Therefore, New Jersey is required to provide a forum in which a party may seek the full range of remedies authorized by \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-9\">However, in exercising jurisdiction over \u00a7 1983 claims, \u201c[t]he States ... have great latitude to establish the structure and jurisdiction of their own courts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 372, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2441, 110 L.Ed.2d at 351. Relying upon this principle, the Law Division held that it lacked jurisdiction over plaintiffs \u00a7 1983 claims because they relate to a tax assessment and thus are within the Tax Court\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-10\">The legislation creating the Tax Court, <em>L. </em>1978, c. 33, conferred jurisdiction upon that court \u201cto hear and determine all tax appeals of such character as [had previously been] heard and determined by the Division of Tax Appeals,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:3A-3 (repealed by <em>L. </em>1993, c. 74, \u00a7 3), formerly an administrative agency in the executive branch of government, <em>L. </em>1978, c. 33, \u00a7 3. The Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction was limited under this legislation to the \u201c[rjeview of actions ... of the county board of taxation or the Director of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>Division of Taxation.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:3A-4.1(a) (repealed by <em>L. </em>1993, c. 74, \u00a7 3). This legislation also provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-4\">The tax court, in all causes within its jurisdiction, and subject to law, may grant legal and equitable relief so that all matters in controversy between the parties may be completely determined.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-5\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>2A:3A-4(a) (repealed, now <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2B:13-3(a).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">In <em>Alid, Inc. v. Township of North Bergen, </em>180 <em>N.J.Super. </em>592, 436 A.2d 102 (App.Div.1981), we narrowly construed <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:3A-4(a) as only authorizing the Tax Court to hear \u201cequitable defenses and counterclaims\u201d in cases otherwise within its jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>at 601, 436 A.2d 102 (quoting <em>Donnelly v. Ritzendollar, </em>14 <em>N.J. </em>96, 103, 101 A.2d 1 (1953)). Consequently, we held that the Tax Court had no jurisdiction over an action in lieu of prerogative writs even if it related to a tax matter. The Supreme Court dismissed an appeal from our decision as moot, but impliedly approved our interpretation of <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:3A-4(a) by ordering that \u201cwhen relief In lieu of prerogative writ is sought with respect to any matter then pending in the Tax Court involving a state or local tax, including enforcement of an order or judgment of the Tax Court or county board of taxation, the action shall be transferred to the Superior Court, Law Division.\u201d <em>Alid, Inc. v. Township of North Bergen, </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>388, 388-89, 446 A.2d 126 (1981).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">Given the limitations upon its jurisdiction imposed by <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:3A-3 and <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:3A-4.1(a), the Tax Court lacked the authority to award the full range of remedies authorized by \u00a7 1983. Although the Tax Court could correct an assessment made in violation of federal constitutional rights, <em>see Township of West Milford v. Van Decker, </em>120 <em>N.J. </em>354, 576 A.2d 881 (App.Div.1990), thereby providing a taxpayer with part of the equitable relief available in a \u00a7 1983 action, its jurisdiction would not extend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>to awarding compensatory and punitive damages against a tax assessor or other public official who had violated a taxpayer\u2019s constitutional rights or granting equitable relief broader in scope than the simple correction of an erroneous tax assessment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">Defendants argue that plaintiff is precluded in any event from maintaining a \u00a7 1983 action in a state court because an appeal to the Tax Court seeking the correction of the alleged erroneous tax assessment constitutes an adequate remedy. Defendants rely upon a line of state court decisions which hold that a \u00a7 1983 action for an alleged violation of federal constitutional rights relating to a tax assessment is not maintainable in a state court if the state provides a \u201cplain, speedy and efficient\u201d remedy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>for the erroneous assessment. <em>See, e.g., Zizka v. Water Pollution Control Auth., </em>195 <em>Conn. </em>682, 490 A.2d 509, 513-14 (1985); <em>Vann v. DeKalb County Bd. of Tax Assessors, </em>186 <em>Ga.App. </em>208, 367 S.E.2d 43 (1988); <em>Stufflebaum v. Panethiere, </em>691 S.W.2d 271 (Mo.1985); <em>State v. Quill Corp., </em>500 N.W.2d 196 (N.D.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>-, 114 <em>S.Ct. </em>173, 126 L.Ed.2d 132 (1993); <em>Linderkamp v. Bismarck Sch. Dist. No. 1, </em>397 N.W.2d 76 (N.D.1986); <em>L.L. Bean v. Bracey, </em>817 S.W.2d 292, 294-97 (Tenn.1991). These cases are based upon the Federal Anti-Injunction Act, 28 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1341, which provides that \u201c[t]he [federal] district courts shall not enjoin, suspend or restrain the assessment, levy or collection of any tax under State law where a plain, speedy and efficient remedy may be had in the courts of such State,\u201d and the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Fair Assessment in Real Estate Ass\u2019n v. McNary, </em>454 <em>U.S. </em>100, 116, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>177, 186, 70 L.Ed.2d 271, 283 (1981) that even when \u00a7 1341 does not directly apply, \u201ctaxpayers are barred by the principle of comity from asserting \u00a7 1983 actions against the validity of state tax systems in federal courts.\u201d These cases reason that although \u00a7 1341 and <em>McNary </em>only impose limitations upon the power of federal district courts, \u201ca \u00a7 1983 challenge which could not be brought in federal court should not be allowed in a state court,\u201d in order to maintain uniform results in federal and state courts. <em>Linderkamp v. Bismarck Sch. Dist. No. 1, supra, </em>397 N.W.2d at 78-79.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">We reject this reasoning and hold that neither the Tax Injunction Act nor the comity rationale of <em>McNarry </em>apply to a \u00a7 1983 action in state court. The Tax Injunction Act only limits the authority of a federal district court to grant injunctive relief regarding the \u201cassessment, levy or collection\u201d of a tax imposed under state law. It does not in any way limit the power of a state court. Likewise, nothing in <em>McNary </em>suggests that a taxpayer is precluded from maintaining a \u00a7 1983 action in state court based on a state tax official\u2019s alleged violation of federal constitutional rights. To the contrary, the maintainability of a \u00a7 1983 action in state court was an essential premise of the Court\u2019s holding in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number><em>McNary </em>that a federal district court should not hear a taxpayer\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims: \u201cSuch taxpayers must seek protection of their federal rights by state remedies, provided of course that those remedies are plain, adequate and complete, and may ultimately seek review of the state decisions in this Court.\u201d <em>Fair Assessment in Real Estate v. McNary, supra, </em>454 <em>U.S. </em>at 116, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 186, 70 L.Ed.2d at 283. In fact, the Court noted that \u201cthe Missouri Supreme Court has expressly held that plaintiffs such as petitioners may seek a \u00a7 1983 claim in state court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 116, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 186, 70 L.Ed.2d at 284, <em>see also Pennhurst State Sch. &amp; Hosp. v. Halderman, </em>465 <em>U.S. </em>89, 122, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>900, 919, 79 <em>L.Ed.</em>2d 67, 92 (1984) (\u201cChallenges to the validity of state tax systems under 42 <em>U.S.C. \u00a7 </em>1983 ... must be brought in state court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Moreover, if we were to hold that a \u00a7 1983 action is not maintainable in a state court solely because an alleged deprivation of constitutional rights relates to a tax assessment, it would mean that a tax assessor could engage in a practice of racially discriminatory tax assessments without being subject to personal liability under \u00a7 1983. Since the prevention of racial discrimination by state officials was the essential reason for the enactment of \u00a7 1983, see <em>Mitchum v. Foster, </em>407 <em>U.S. </em>225, 238-242, 92 <em>S.Ct. </em>2151, 2160-62, 32 L.Ed.2d 705, 715-17 (1972), we are unwilling to read a limitation into the scope of its operation which would prevent a state court from granting complete relief, including compensatory and punitive damages, for such a violation of constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">Our conclusion that a state must provide a forum for a \u00a7 1983 action alleging a denial of federal constitutional rights relating to a tax assessment is supported by the decisions of other state courts, <em>see, e.g., Beverly Bank v. Board of Review, </em>117 <em>Ill.App.3d </em>656, 72 <em>Ill.Dec. </em>791, 453 N.E.2d 96 (1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>466 <em>U.S. </em>951, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>2153, 80 L.Ed.2d 539 (1984); <em>Murtagh v.

In <em>Murtagh v.

McNary, supra, </em>454 <em>U.S. </em>at 113, 115, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 184, 185, 70 L.Ed.2d at 281, 283. However, these dangers are not a sufficient basis for denying the remedies afforded by \u00a7 1983 to a party whose constitutional rights have been violated. Instead, the possibility of vexatious use of this kind of litigation can be substantially ameliorated by effective case management and the award of counsel fees to defendants in appropriate cases. To facilitate effective case management and avoid possible conflicting decisions, a \u00a7 1983 action in the Law Division relating to a tax assessment ordinarily should be assigned to the same Tax Court judge hearing a related tax assessment appeal. Such an assignment can be made pursuant to the Chief Justice\u2019s annual order assigning all Tax Court judges to the Superior Court. <em>See, e.g., </em>137 <em>N.J.L.J. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>1570 (Aug. 8, 1994).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In addition, the trial judge may stay proceedings in the \u00a7 1983 action until a related tax assessment appeal has been completed. <em>Cf.

Since we conclude that the Law Division has jurisdiction, we also address the court\u2019s further holding that defendants enjoy absolute immunity from suit under \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-10\">\u201cThe presumption is that qualified rather than absolute immunity is sufficient to protect government officials in the exercise of their duties.\u201d <em>Burns v. Reed, </em>500 <em>U.S. </em>478, 487, 111 <em>S.Ct. </em>1934, 1939, 114 L.Ed.2d 547, 558 (1991). Consequently, an official seeking absolute immunity from suit under \u00a7 1983 \u201cbears the burden of showing that such immunity is justified for the function in question.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>\u201cNot surprisingly,\u201d the Supreme Court has been \u201c \u2018quite sparing\u2019 in recognizing absolute immunity for state actors in this context.\u201d <em>Buckley v.

White, </em>484 <em>U.S. </em>219, 224, 108 <em>S.Ct. </em>538, 542, 98 L.Ed.2d 555 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>The threshold question in determining whether an official is entitled to absolute immunity under \u00a7 1983 is whether that immunity was recognized \u201cat common law when the Civil Rights Act was enacted in 1871.\u201d <em>Tower v. Glover, </em>467 <em>U.S. </em>914, 920, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>2820, 2825, 81 L.Ed.2d 758, 765 (1984). The prevailing view in the nineteenth century was that tax assessors enjoyed only qualified rather than absolute immunity from \u2022 suit. <em>See, e.g., Bailey v. Berkey, </em>81 <em>F. </em>737, 738 (N.D.Cal.1897) (\u201c[T]he greater and better weight of authority supports the doctrine that while assessors are not liable to private suits for mere errors or mistakes of judgment ..., they will be held liable in damages for making an excessive assessment with a malicious, corrupt, or other sinister motive.\u201d); <em>Ballerino v. Mason, </em>83 <em>Cal. </em>447, 23 <em>P. </em>530, 530 (1890) (county assessor not liable for property assessment in absence of allegation that \u201che acted maliciously, or with intent to wrong or injure the owner\u201d); <em>Rowe v. Friend, </em>90 <em>Me. </em>241, 38 <em>A. </em>95, 96 (1897) (statute accords tax assessors immunity except for want of \u201cpersonal faithfulness or integrity\u201d); <em>E. &amp; T. Fairbanks &amp; Co. v. Kittredge, </em>24 <em>Vt. </em>9, 12 (1850) (\u201clisters\u201d that act as property appraisers and assessors incur no personal liability unless \u201cactuated by malice\u201d). Therefore, defendants have not established the firmly recognized immunity at common law required to support a claim of absolute immunity from suit under the Federal Civil Rights Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">The trial court nevertheless concluded that a tax assessor is entitled to absolute immunity under \u00a7 1983 because he acts as \u201can arm of the legislature,\u201d thus qualifying for the absolute immunity of a legislator, see <em>Tenney v. Brandhove, </em>341 <em>U.S. </em>367, 71 <em>S.Ct. </em>783, 95 <em>L.Ed. </em>1019 (1951), and uses \u201chis own independent judgment,\u201d thereby qualifying for the absolute immunity of a judge and other officials who act in a quasi-judicial capacity; see <em>Pierson v. Ray, </em>386 <em>U.S. </em>547, 87 <em>S.Ct. </em>1213, 18 L.Ed.2d 288 (1967). However, a tax assessor\u2019s responsibilities are neither legislative nor judicial in nature and hence neither of these immunities applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>Legislative immunity only extends to official acts which are both \u201c \u2018proeedurally\u2019 legislative, that is, passed by means of established legislative procedures,\u201d and \u201c \u2018substantively\u2019 legislative,\u201d that is, acts \u201cwhich involve policy-making deeision[s] of a general scope.\u201d <em>Ryan v. Burlington County, </em>889 F.2d 1286, 1290-91 (3rd Cir.1989); <em>accord Acierno v. Cloutier, </em>40 F.3d 597, 610-12 (3d Cir.1994). The assessment of plaintiffs property did not satisfy either of these tests because it did not involve public debate or a majority vote by a multi-member body, and it applied solely to plaintiff. Although a tax assessor performs official duties pursuant to legislative standards, the same is true of other <em>executive </em>officials who perform administrative functions beyond the protective umbrella of absolute legislative immunity. <em>See, e.g., Cleavinger v. Saxner, </em>474 <em>U.S. </em>193, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>496, 88 L.Ed.2d 507 (1985) (prison disciplinary committee members); <em>Wood v. Strickland, </em>420 <em>U.S. </em>308, 95 <em>S.Ct </em>992, 43 L.Ed.2d 214 (1975) (school board members); <em>Scheuer v. Rhodes, </em>416 <em>U.S. </em>232, 94 <em>S.Ct </em>1683, 40 L.Ed.2d 90 (1974) (state executive officials, including governor and university president).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">Judicial immunity only extends to the process of \u201cresolving disputes between parties who have invoked the jurisdiction of a court,\u201d <em>Forrester v. White, supra, </em>484 <em>U.S. </em>at 227, 108 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 544, 98 L.Ed.2d at 565 (1988), or a quasi-judicial tribunal performing an analogous function. <em>Butz v. Economou, </em>438 <em>U.S. </em>478, 511\u201414, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>2894, 2913-15, 57 L.Ed.2d 895, 919-21 (1978). A tax assessment does not involve any of the usual hallmarks of an adjudicatory proceeding; there is no presentation of evidence by affected parties, examination or cross-examination of witnesses, or findings of fact and conclusions of law. Instead, a tax assessor acts unilaterally based on his own examination of properties and public records in much the same fashion as executive officials who review applications for licenses and permits.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">Our conclusion that tax assessors are not entitled to absolute immunity from suit under \u00a7 1983 is also supported by the decisions of other courts. In <em>Fulton Mkt. Cold Storage Co. v. Culler</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number><em>ton, </em>582 F.2d 1071, 1080 (7th Cir.1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 <em>U.S. </em>1121, 99 <em>S.Ct. </em>1033, 59 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>82 (1979), the court held that a tax official would be liable for damages under \u00a7 1983 \u201cif he violated the plaintiffs clearly established constitutional rights intentionally or with reckless disregard of those rights.\u201d The court also stated that \u201c[qjuite clearly, if a county or state tax official intentionally and unjustifiably raised an individual\u2019s property tax assessment merely because of the individual\u2019s race, ethnic background or political affiliation, the official could be liable for damages under \u00a7 1983 for the misuse of his authority.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1079. Similarly, in <em>Werch v. City of Berlin, </em>673 F.2d 192, 195 (7th Cir.1982), the court indicated that municipal officials exercising taxing authority were entitled to \u201cqualified immunity.\u201d <em>See also Ludwin v. City of Cambridge, </em>592 F.2d 606, 610 n. 1 (1st Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">Since the absolute immunity of defendant Chaiken, the consultant retained by Linden to assist in the assessment of plaintiffs property, was derivative of the tax assessor\u2019s claimed absolute immunity, see <em>Dennis v. Sparks, </em>449 <em>U.S. </em>24, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>183, 66 L.Ed.2d 185 (1980), which we have now rejected, we also conclude that the trial court erred in dismissing plaintiffs \u00a7 1983 claim against Chaiken on the basis of absolute immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">The tax assessor argues in the alternative that even if he does not have absolute immunity from suit under \u00a7 1983 for any action relating to an assessment, the summary judgment in his favor should be affirmed on the ground of qualified immunity. However, the trial court did not pass upon this argument. Although the court stated in a single conclusionary sentence in its written decision of February 22, 1993, that \u201ceven if this suit were maintainable because Frangella'and Chaiken had only qualified immunity, this court is of the opinion that the plaintiffs proofs are nevertheless woefully inadequate and could not sustain a cause of action,\u201d the court subsequently characterized this statement as \u201cdicta, unnecessary to its holdings which rested.on legal insufficiency,\u201d that is, the court\u2019s lack of jurisdiction, and defendants\u2019 absolute immunity, rather than \u201cfactual insufficiency.\u201d Therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>although the individual defendants may be entitled to prevail on the basis of qualified immunity, we do not believe that this court should decide the availability of this defense summarily without the trial court first reviewing the relevant evidence. The trial court\u2019s consideration of this defense should be governed by the principles set forth in <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 <em>U.S. </em>800, 815-19, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>2727, 2736-38, 73 L.Ed.2d 396, 408-11 (1982), <em>Mitchell v. Forsyth, </em>472 <em>U.S. </em>511, 526, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>2806, 2816, 86 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>411, 425 (1985), <em>Malley v. Briggs, </em>475 <em>U.S. </em>335, 344-45, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>1092, 1098, 89 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>271, 280-81 (1986) and <em>Anderson v. Creighton, </em>483 <em>U.S. </em>635, 639-40, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>3034, 3038-39, 97 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>523, 530-31 (1987); <em>see also Kirk v. City of Newark, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>173, 536 A.2d 229 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">We turn next to plaintiffs \u00a7 1983 claim against Linden. Although a municipality may not be held vicariously liable under the doctrine of <em>respondeai superior </em>for a claim under \u00a7 1983, it may be liable for a violation of constitutional rights committed by one of its officers or employees pursuant to official policy. <em>Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Servs., </em>436 <em>U.S. </em>658, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978). The Supreme Court in a plurality opinion identified \u201cseveral guiding principles\u201d to determine whether a deprivation of constitutional rights by a municipal official or employee was committed pursuant to municipal policy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-8\">First, ... municipalities may be held liable under \u00a7 1983 only for acts for which the municipality itself is actually responsible, \u201cthat is, acts which the municipality has officially sanctioned or ordered.\u201d Second, only those municipal officials who have \u201cfinal policymaking authority\u201d may by their actions subject the government to \u00a7 1983 liability. Third, whether a particular official has \u201cfinal policymaking authority\u201d is a question of <em>state law. </em>Fourth, the challenged action must have been taken pursuant to a policy adopted by the official or officials responsible under state law for making policy in <em>that area </em>of the city\u2019s business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-9\"><em>[St. Louis v. Praprotnik, </em>485 <em>U.S. </em>112, 123, 108 <em>S.Ct. </em>915, 924, 99 L.Ed.2d 107, 118 (1988) (quoting <em>Pembaur v. Cincinnati, </em>475 <em>U.S. </em>469, 480, 483, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>1292, 1298, 1300, 89 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>452, 463, 465 (1986) (Brennan, J., plurality opinion).!</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-10\">The Court also indicated that \u201can unconstitutional governmental policy [may] be inferred from a single decision taken by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>highest officials responsible for setting policy in that area of the government\u2019s business.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 123, 108 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 924, 99 L.Ed.2d at 117; <em>accord Pembaur v. Cincinnati, supra, </em>475 <em>U.S. </em>at 480, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1298, 89 L.Ed.2d at 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">A tax assessor\u2019s deprivation of constitutional rights in assessing property may be found to constitute the official policy of the municipality which appointed the assessor. <em>N.J.S.A </em>54:4-23 confers plenary authority upon a tax assessor to \u201cdetermine the full and fair value of each parcel of real property situate in the taxing district\u201d and to \u201ccompute and determine the taxable value of such real property at the level established for the county pursuant to law.\u201d After the assessor makes an assessment, the municipality collects taxes based on that assessment and defends the assessment on any appeal to the county board of taxation or Tax Court. Thus, for purposes of property tax assessments, the acts of the tax assessor are the acts of the municipality. Consequently, a tax assessor has \u201cfinal policymaking authority\u201d with respect to municipal tax assessments and his violation of federal constitutional rights in making a tax assessment would constitute \u201ca policy adopted by the official ... responsible under state law for making policy in <em>that area </em>of the city\u2019s business.\u201d <em>St. Louis v. Praprotnik, supra, </em>485 <em>U.S. </em>at 123, 108 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 924, 99 L.Ed.2d at 118. Moreover, plaintiff has alleged that the Mayor of Linden, the municipality\u2019s chief executive official, participated in the violation of its constitutional rights. Therefore, the trial court erred in dismissing plaintiffs complaint against Linden.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">We turn finally to plaintiffs common law negligence claim against Chaiken, the professional real estate appraiser retained by Linden to assist its tax assessor in valuing plaintiffs property. The Tort Claims Act confers broad immunity upon public entities and public employees from liability for them actions relating to the assessment and collection of taxes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-7\">Neither a public entity nor a public employee is liable for an injury caused by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number><em>a. </em>Instituting any judicial or administrative proceeding or action for or incidental to the assessment or collection of a tax.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-6\">b. An act or omission in the interpretation or application of any law relating to a tax.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-7\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>59:7-2.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">Therefore, plaintiff could not maintain a tort action against either the tax assessor or Linden for negligence in the assessment of its property. Instead, plaintiffs only remedy to correct an error in its assessment would be an appeal to the Union County Board of Taxation or the Tax Court. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:3-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">Although the Tort Claims Act does not directly apply to Chaiken because he is not a public employee, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:1-3, the same policy considerations which underlie the immunity provided by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:7-2 also preclude a taxpayer from maintaining a negligence action against an outside consultant retained by a taxing authority to assist in a property appraisal. Our courts have recognized that the negligent performance of contractual services may provide a basis for tort liability to a third party. <em>See, e.g., Rosenblum v. Adler, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>324, 461 A.2d 138 (1983). However, before a court recognizes such a cause of action, it must weigh \u201cthe relationship of the parties, the nature of the risk, and the public interest in the proposed solution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 341, 461 A.2d 138 (quoting <em>Goldberg v. Housing Auth. of Newark, </em>38 <em>N.J. </em>578, 583, 186 A.2d 291 (1962)). When contractual services are performed for a governmental entity which is itself immune from tort liability for that activity, the courts should proceed with particular caution in recognizing a cause of action against a private contractor which may undermine the governmental immunity. <em>Cf. Vanchieri v. New Jersey Sports &amp; Exposition Auth., </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>80, 85, 514 A.2d 1323 (1986) (\u201c[[Independent contractors do, under well-recognized principles, share to a limited extent the immunity of public entities with whom they contract.\u201d); <em>see also Ornes v. Daniels, </em>278 <em>N.J.Super. </em>536, 541-42, 651 A.2d 1040, 1043 (App.Div.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-10\">A taxpayer has a readily available and adequate means of correcting an erroneous tax assessment by appealing to the county <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>board of taxation and the Tax Court. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:3-21; <em>see Union City Assoc. v. City of Union, </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>17, 556 A.2d 769 (1989). Indeed, that is a taxpayer\u2019s only remedy when an assessor makes an assessment without the assistance of an outside appraiser. Consequently, a taxpayer has no substantial need to maintain a tort action against a private appraiser. On the other hand, the consultants who perform these kinds of services and the public entities whieh retain them have a substantial interest in maintaining immunity from suit outside the framework of normal tax appeals. A municipality\u2019s tax assessments involve numerous properties and very substantial amounts of money. Consequently, if outside consultants who assist in the performance of this duty were subject to suit for negligence, them exposure would be substantial. This undoubtedly would cause such experts to increase the fees they charge to municipalities, thereby increasing the cost of municipal tax assessments and also discouraging municipalities from using outside experts in circumstances where their services may be needed. Therefore, the trial court correctly held that a taxpayer may not maintain a tort action against an appraiser who is negligent in advising a tax assessor as to the value of a taxpayer\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">Accordingly, we affirm the dismissal of plaintiffs common law negligence claim against Chaiken, but reverse the dismissal of plaintiffs \u00a7 1983 claims. Defendants\u2019 cross appeals are dismissed. We remand to the Law Division for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion and direct that the case be assigned to the Tax Court judge who is hearing plaintiffs tax assessment appeals.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b488-9\"> We note that a taxpayer may challenge the validity of a state tax under the United States Constitution in the New Jersey courts without proceeding under the Federal Civil Rights Act. <em>See, e.g., Salorio v. Glaser, </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>482, 414 A.2d 943, <em>cert. denied, </em>449 <em>U.S. </em>874, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>215, 66 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>94 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b489-7\"> Subsequent to the trial court\u2019s decision in this case, the Legislature expanded the Tax Court's jurisdiction to include the review of any action or regulation of any state, county or municipal official relating to a \u201ctax matter,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2B:13-2(a), as well as \u201cactions cognizable in the Superior Court which raise issues as to which expertise in matters involving taxation is desirable,\u201d <em>NJ.S.A. </em>2B:13~2(b); L. 1993, <em>c. </em>74, \u00a7 1. These provisions may now provide the requisite authorization for the Tax Court to entertain a \u00a7 1983 action and to award the full range of remedies available in such an action, including compensatory and punitive damages. However, the trial court did not have the opportunity to pass upon the effect of this new legislation and the parties have not even cited <em>NJ.S.A. </em>2B:13-2 in their appellate briefs. Furthermore, this legislation does not provide lor the transfer to the Tax Court of pending actions which were beyond the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction under the former <em>NJ.S.A. </em>2A:3A-3 and <em>NJ.S.A. </em>2A:3A-4.1(a) but are now subject to its jurisdiction under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2B: 13-2. <em>Compare N.J.S.A. 2A:3A-26, </em>part of the legislation creating the Tax Court, which transferred all cases then pending in the former Division of Tax Appeals to the Tax Court. Therefore, our decision is based solely on the legislation which governed the Tax Court's jurisdiction at the time of the trial court\u2019s decision. <em>See Sutherland Stat. Const. </em>\u00a7 41.08 (5th ed. 1993) (\u201c[Cjourts do not favor interpretations of jurisdictional statutes which give them retroactive effect.\u201d).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-8\">We note that even if <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2B:13-2 were applicable to this action, the only consequence would be that the Tax Court judge to whom we have ordered the case assigned would hear the matter as a Tax Court rather than a Superior Court judge. We also note that the validity of defendants' argument that a \u00a7 1983 action for an alleged violation of federal constitutional rights relating to a tax assessment is not maintainable in a state court, discussed on pp. 459-63 of this opinion, does not turn on the scope of the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction as a matter of state law.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b493-14\"> If the Tax Court now has jurisdiction under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2B:13~2 to entertain a \u00a7 1983 action relating to a tax assessment, see <em>n. 2 supra, </em>such an assignment may be made without reliance upon the Chief Justice's order.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
