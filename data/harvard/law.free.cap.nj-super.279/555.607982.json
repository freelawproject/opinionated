Counts two and three were merged with count one. A life term with a thirty-year parole disqualifier was imposed, as well as a $30 Violent Crimes Compensation Board penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-13\">On appeal, defense counsel contends reversible error in the admission of the hearsay statement of Robin Austell through the testimony of Tracy Edwards who recounted an alleged conversation he had with defendant while both were incarcerated in the Mercer County Detention Center and while defendant was awaiting trial. In return for his disclosure to the prosecutor of the alleged conversation, Edwards received a substantially reduced sentence on his pending second degree charge. Allegedly included in that conversation was the Austell statement. In his supplemental <em>pro se </em>brief, defendant contends that out-of-court identifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>cations were the result of an unduly suggestive photographic lineup, that he was denied due process because he was not able to fully disclose the fact that Robin Austell and Tracy Edwards were represented by the same attorney at the time of both her alleged police statement and defendant\u2019s alleged conversation with Edwards, that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence, that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct in his summation, and that the cumulative effect of the trial errors requires a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">We are confident that all of these contentions are without merit, except the admission of Robin Austell\u2019s statement coupled with the peculiar circumstances surrounding the dual representation of Austell and Edwards. Before discussing the statement, however, we comment briefly on the identification procedures. Both eyewitnesses who identified defendant through the photographic lineup, admitted during the <em>Wade </em><footnotemark>1</footnotemark> hearing and during the trial that defendant\u2019s photograph was the only one that fit all of the descriptive characteristics they had given to the police. But our own independent review of the photographs, of the transcript of the <em>Wade </em>hearing and of the trial judge\u2019s findings, convinces us that the trial judge did not err in concluding that the line-up was not \u201cso impermissibly suggestive as to give use to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.\u201d <em>State v. Clausell, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>298, 324-326, 580 A.2d 221 (1990) (quoting <em>Simmons v. United States, </em>390 <em>U.S. </em>377, 384, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>967, 971, 19 L.Ed.2d 1247, 1253 (1968)).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">In affirming the trial judge\u2019s <em>Wade </em>determination, however, we do not mean to suggest that there were not, nonetheless, serious problems with the identification, as well as the jury conviction, of defendant as the perpetrator of the murder. Suffice it to say, the State\u2019s case was riddled with problems. In addition to the admission by the eyewitnesses that only defendant\u2019s photograph contained all of the identifying characteristics, one of them, Willie Harris, when first shown the line-up, proclaimed an inability to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>identify anyone. Shortly after the second witness, David Munn, identified defendant as the perpetrator, Mr. Harris was shown the line-up again. He then identified defendant\u2019s photograph. Interestingly, however, both Mr. Harris and Mr. Munn, as well as a third eyewitness, Jeffrey Rock, who all claimed to have had a good look at the perpetrator\u2019s face, said he was cleanshaven. Defendant, however, not only had a mustache at the time, but it was a Fu Manchu mustache which, from his photograph taken the day after the murder, appeared to be quite distinctive. The third eyewitness, Mr. Rock, could not identify defendant from the lineup at all.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Moreover, the identification of defendant\u2019s two-door, white Pontiac Sunbird as the vehicle used in the shooting was not without substantial question. The vehicle that all three witnesses identified initially was a four-door, white Chevrolet Cavalier. Indeed, the day after the killing a vehicle matching that description was discovered in the area. Hure Benson, the owner of that vehicle, a seemingly impartial individual, told the jury that that vehicle had been stolen from his home not far from where the murder occurred on the night of the murder and was recovered the following day. The police conducted no investigation, however, of this vehicle.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>Finally, there was what for all appearances was a totally impartial fourth eyewitness, Inez Houston, who went to the police the day after the shooting. She gave a description of the perpetrator that was completely different from that of Harris and Munn. She was shown the same line-up previously shown to Harris and Munn and told the police the perpetrator was not in it. She adamantly testified in court that defendant was not the killer, and that his two-door Pontiac was not the vehicle that was used. That vehicle, she said, was a four-door white Chevrolet Cavalier, similar to the vehicle initially described by Harris and Munn and similar to Benson\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">In assessing the eyewitness evidence and observing the various deficiencies in it, we are not unmindful of the discovery of glass in defendant\u2019s vehicle when it was found the day after the incident, presumably from a broken window. According to the State\u2019s expert, and based upon laboratory analysis of that glass and glass found at the scene of the murder, as well as some information received from the FBI, unsuccessfully objected to by counsel as not contained in the expert\u2019s report, there was more than a ninety-nine percent chance that the glass found at the scene came from defendant\u2019s car. However, although the eyewitnesses saw bottles being thrown at the car just prior to the shooting, none of them hit any of the windows or broke any of them. According to defendant\u2019s testimony, and consistent with the presence of a brick found inside the rear of the car along with the glass, the window was broken at the time the car was stolen from the Seven-Eleven where defendant said he had left it after locking his keys in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">We do not point out these weaknesses to suggest any merit to defendant\u2019s <em>pro se </em>claim that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence. We do so only to emphasize the weaknesses of the State\u2019s evidence of guilt insofar as those weaknesses bear upon the harm that any trial error could cause. This was, after all, primarily an issue of credibility, for there was little corroborative evidence of the witnesses\u2019 identification and not only defendant\u2019s denial, but substantial alibi evidence as well. <em>E.g. State v. W.L., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>278 <em>N.J.Super. </em>295, 301, 650 A.2d 1035 (App.Div.1995) (\u201c[t]he question of defendant\u2019s guilt was, at best, exceedingly-close. It is, therefore, clear that any error that could have appreciably tipped the credibility scale would have to be regarded as plain error having the capacity to have affected the outcome of the trial.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">And that takes ,us to defendant\u2019s alibi. The murder occurred at 8 p.m. Defendant said he left his home at 7:30 p.m., drove to a Seven-Eleven not far from the killing, arriving there around 7:55. When he got out of his car, he inadvertently locked the keys inside. He asked the Seven-Eleven owner if he had a coathanger. When that effort was unsuccessful, he walked the 15 or 20 minute distance to where his wife was working at the Mercer County Detention Center because she had an extra set of keys. There were two other employees on duty, both saw him on that evening and both testified that he came in between 8:15 and 8:30 and left shortly thereafter. Defendant returned to the Seven-Eleven to discover his car gone and broken glass on the ground where it had been parked. Thinking that it had been stolen, he called his wife from a pay phone. She told him to go home, obtain the insurance papers and call the police. He arrived home at 9:00 p.m. and made three calls to the three surrounding police stations, Hamilton, Ewing and Trenton. All three phone calls were recorded on the police station tapes and played to the jury. Defendant was told to report the theft in person and at 9:30 p.m. he went to the Trenton Police Station. They took his photograph and thence, according to defendant, began the nightmare.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">In addition to his testimony, he presented the testimony of his wife, her two co-workers and the owner of the Seven-Eleven. It was defendant, as well, who presented the owner of the four-door white Cavalier, Hure Benson, and the fourth eyewitness, Inez Houston. To be sure, the testimony of all of these witnesses, as well as defendant, may well have been considered by the jury to have been no better than that of the State\u2019s witnesses. Indeed, a reading of the entire transcript leaves one with a sense of unease with any of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>But this only, to our view, heightens the error that we think occurred with the admission of Robin Austell\u2019s hearsay \u201cstatement,\u201d if statement it was. And we say this because of all the evidence the jury heard as to the happening of the crime, her\u2019s was the only evidence that was heard without her appearance for cross-examination and any sense of who she was or how she fit into the picture. According to Tracy Edwards, who might be viewed either as an old friend of defendant\u2019s or as a jail-house stoolie who got himself a terrific deal on his pending second degree charge in return for his story (or both), Robin was defendant\u2019s girlfriend. Unknown to the jury, she was also a relative of a cousin of Edwards\u2019 attorney. It was that attorney who appeared on her behalf at the Trenton police station while she was giving a statement shortly after the shooting.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> She later recanted and neither the statement nor she was presented to the jury. The State, however, was able to present to the jury the full flavor of what it contended was its inculpatory content through the Edwards testimony, strengthened by the admission of \u201crebuttal\u201d evidence of the detective who took her statement that in fact she had given a statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Here is what Edwards told the jury. During December 1989 and January 1990, he and defendant, whom he had known for 17 years, were both in the Mercer County Detention Center. Although he admitted he already knew, he asked defendant why he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>was in jail. Defendant told him that it was for killing a man on Hoffman Avenue.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> According to Edwards, defendant told him the police had \u201cpicked him and his girlfriend up, and his girlfriend had told them everything.\u201d Further elaborating, Edwards stated</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AG-\">I said, well, what she told the police, told what happened, that I had shot him, and I asked him was it true, and he said, well, she going to change her statement, \u25a0 just like that, my lawyer going down there with her and she going to change her statement around____ She going to say that they scared her, she didn\u2019t know what she was doing, they threatened to take her kids away from her.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">The State argued to the jury and contends here that the reference to Robin\u2019s \u201ctelling everything to the police, that I did it,\u201d constitutes an admission inculpating defendant and which defendant adopted in his alleged responses to Edwards\u2019 inquiries. And it says this is clearly reflected by what defendant allegedly also confessed to Edwards\u2014that he killed the victim with a .22 handgun but had not meant to and that it was an accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">The issue we must concern ourselves with is whether the included hearsay was properly admitted as an adoptive admission pursuant to <em>Evid.R. </em>63(8)(b) (now <em>N.J.E.R. </em>803(b)(2)). We think the beginning and end of that concern is the trial judge\u2019s observation that \u201cBriggs has said Robin told them everything, and that\u2019s a judgment call on his part on what telling him everything is. And again, you could talk about what does that mean. It\u2019s very ambiguous, really.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">The extreme caution that must be exercised when dealing with a hearsay statement as an adoptive admission has long been recognized. <em>Greenberg v. Stanley, </em>30 <em>N.J. </em>485, 498, 153 A.2d 833 (1959). <em>See also, Burbridge v. Paschal, </em>239 <em>N.J.Super. </em>139, 154-55, 570 A.2d 1250 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>122 <em>N.J. </em>360, 585 A.2d 369 (1990). Critical to such admission is the requirement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>that the defendant disclose, or be made aware of, the content of that which he is allegedly admitting to. <em>Greenberg, supra, </em>30 <em>N.J. </em>at 498, 153 A.2d 833. Moreover, it must be clear that the defendant \u201cunderstood and unambiguously assented\u201d to the statement. <em>United States v. Beckham, </em>968 F.2d 47, 52 (D.C.Cir.1992); <em>United States v. Coppola, </em>526 F.2d 764, 769 n. 2 (10th Cir.1975); <em>Commonwealth v. MacKenzie, </em>413 <em>Mass. </em>498, 597 <em>N.E.</em>2d 1037, 1042\u201444 (1992) (\u201c[ejvidence of [adoptive admissions] is to be received with caution, especially in criminal cases, due to the fact that the meaning of a defendant\u2019s response, or lack thereof, to an accusatory statement is often ambiguous.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Here the actual content of the statement was never disclosed. The State contends the included statement was that defendant shot the victim and that was what Robin was going to recant. But that is hardly the same as \u201ctelling everything.\u201d Edwards\u2019 further testimony that \u201cI said, well, what she told the police, told what happened, that I shot him....\u201d is less than clear in terms of who told who what. The same can be said for the reference to \u201cmy lawyer going down there with her____\u201d Contextually, the reference is to Edwards\u2019 lawyer, but it could just as well refer to defendant\u2019s lawyer. Moreover, assuming that it could be inferred that Robin told the police that defendant shot the victim, defendant\u2019s response when asked if it was true that Robin was going to change her story is hardly an expression of admission or belief in its truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">Relying upon <em>State v. Thompson, </em>59 <em>N.J. </em>396, 283 A.2d 513 (1971), the State argues that defendant\u2019s additional, own alleged admissions may be ingrafted upon Robin\u2019s statement to not only give it the missing contents but establish its unambiguous adoption as well. Defendant in <em>Thompson </em>was charged with murder. He did not testify. A critical part of the State\u2019s case was a telephone conversation he had with his sister-in-law shortly after he had been identified in the newspapers as the murder suspect. During the conversation, defendant asked her if she had seen the paper. She said \u201cI hope to tell you I saw the paper ...\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>asked \u201c[y]ou didn\u2019t do that, did you____\u201d? His response was \u201c[n]o comment.\u201d She explained the contents of the article and said that it had a picture of defendant and reported that the police were looking for him as a suspect. During the telephone conversation, when she asked him why he did not just hit the victim instead of killing her, he replied \u201c[wjell, it\u2019s just one of those things.\u201d She also asked him if the police had any clues and his response was \u201cno.\u201d She said \u201cwell, what about the pocketbook\u201d and he said \u201cUnh-Unh, no good.\u201d When she said \u201cwhat about the mace,\u201d his reply was \u201cunh-unh, very little effect.\u201d Obviously the references to the details of the murder were from the newspaper article.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Defendant argued that that information was included hearsay and that his responses were evasive, at best, and could not be considered to have adopted or expressed agreement with that information. In rejecting this contention, the Court noted that defendant\u2019s responses to the sister-in-law\u2019s questions gave the information \u201clegitimate life as evidence\u201d because \u201c[o]verall his answers or comments revealed a personal knowledge of events associated with the murder, and constituted either actual or inferential admissions or declarations against interest with respect to its commission by him....\u201d, 59 <em>N.J. </em>at 408, 283 A.2d 513, and said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-7\">The ... conversation between Thompson and liis sister-in-law, whether considered in its entirety or in its individual parts, clearly bespeaks an adoption by him of her references to the crime as factual. Moreover, his answers and comments thereon in context indicate the kind of acknowledgment of them truth that would justify a jury in finding that they would be made only by the perpetrator of the crime----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-9\">[59 <em>N.J. </em>at 409-410, 283 A.2d 513].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-10\">The point is, the substance of the included hearsay in <em>Thompson </em>was clearly disclosed during the conversation and defendant\u2019s responses directed to that disclosure plainly reflected acceptance of the included information. Thus, while it is true that \u201cthe total exchange\u201d must be considered, 59 <em>N.J. </em>at 410, 283 A.2d 513, the critical question is, total exchange as to what? Here, it is the admission of Robin\u2019s statement, not defendant\u2019s own alleged separate inculpatory statements, that is at issue. Though included in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>the same conversation, they are distinct and unlike the integrated sister-in-law\u2019s news report references in <em>Thompson. </em>We do not think the context of defendant\u2019s own alleged admissions, under the particular circumstances here, can breathe life into the included statement. Had Edwards\u2019 testimony been that defendant had said \u201cRobin told everything and that everything was that I killed him and I used a .22 handgun,\u201d clearly the additional details would then have been supplied through the remainder of defendant\u2019s own statement and his own admissions would have provided unambiguous assent. But that was not the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">We add that even if the prior statement were admissible, defendant should have had the opportunity to fully flesh out the existence of the dual representation of Robin and Edward by the same attorney.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See Johnson v. Malnati, </em>110 <em>N.J.Super. </em>277, 281, 265 A.2d 394 (App.Div.1970). We acknowledge that trial counsel did not so request following the attorney\u2019s Rule 8 testimony. But we take note of defendant\u2019s <em>pro se </em>assertion that he was not present at the Rule 8 hearing and was not aware of the attorney\u2019s testimony until after the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">We conclude that admission of the included hearsay was error and because of the weaknesses in the evidence was such as to have \u201cappreciably tipped the credibility scale----\u201d <em>State v. W.L., supra, </em>278 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 301, 650 A.2d 1035. Moreover, because the improper admission of hearsay evidence implicates the confrontation clause, we consider whether it was \u201charmless beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d. <em>Delaware v. Van Arsdall, </em>475 <em>U.S. </em>673, 684, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>1431, 1438, 89 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>674 (1986). We do not think so. Clearly, the statement was a critical piece of evidence to the State and was not cumulative\u2014there is no other evidence establishing the alleged Robin police statement. As we have said, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>because of its ambiguous nature, the State was able to argue that it was inculpatory. There was, obviously, no ability to cross-examine on it other than through Edwards and the ability to cross-examine on a statement that someone \u201ctold everything\u201d is limited at best. Finally, as we have noted, the evidence of guilt was anything but overwhelming. <em>Cf. State v. Bankston, </em>63 <em>N.J. </em>263, 272-73, 307 A.2d 65 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Reversed and remanded for a new trial consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b587-8\"> <em>United States v. Wade, </em>388 <em>U.S. 218, 87 S.Ct. </em>1926, 18 L.Ed.2d 1149 (1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b588-6\"> Although Mr. Rock did identify defendant in court, it is clear that his ability to do so was the product of defense counsel's investigator showing him a photograph of defendant prior to trial. One may well question the strategy of that maneuver, or the admission of the obviously tainted in-court identification, albeit tainted by counsel\u2019s own doing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b588-7\"> After Mr. Benson testified, the State presented a police report indicating his vehicle was stolen almost a year before the shooting. The theory was that Benson was mistaken as to the timing of the theft of his car. But the fact remains, it was indeed found by the police the day after the shooting and returned to Benson as a stolen vehicle. Moreover, at the least, the rebuttal report should have been presented to Benson during his testimony so that the jury could have had the benefit of his response. <em>See Evid.R. </em>22(b) (now <em>N.J.E.R. </em>613(b)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b591-7\"> When it was disclosed that the same attorney who appeared at the police station on behalf o\u00ed Robin also represented Edwards and was instrumental in the disclosure of defendant's alleged \u201cjail-house confession\"\u2014much to the advantage of Edwards\u2014the trial judge expressed a concern over an appearance of a conflict of interest. A Rule 8 hearing was conducted at which the attorney testified as 10 his role in Robin\u2019s statement and Edwards' disclosure. He said his involvement was minimal and denied knowing of the contents of either. The record, however, suggests that he may indeed have read Robin\u2019s statement. Moreover Edwards' testimony can be interpreted as indicating that Edwards discussed with the attorney what Edwards had to tell the prosecutor<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>. In any event, the trial judge determined no further inquiry into the relationship was necessary. Neither the prosecutor nor defense counsel objected or expressed a different view.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b592-10\"> On cross-examination, it was brought out that Edwards initiated the conversation with defendant by asking him \"if he was down here for the body on Hoffman Avenue and he said yes, and I asked him if they had anything on [him] ...\u201d Edwards knew about the \"body on Hoffman\u201d from rumors in the law library at Mercer County Detention Center.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b595-10\"> We are aware that Edwards told the jury who his attorney was and the detective also told the jury who Robin's attorney was. The evidence as to this was isolated and fleeting. The potential significance of the dual representation, or even that there was dual representation, was plainly lost on the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
