After a hearing, the Appeal Tribunal reversed the Division\u2019s determination, reinstating petitioner\u2019s benefits and vacating the order requiring her to refund past benefits. Respondent employer then appealed to the Board of Review, which affirmed the Appeal Tribunal \u201c[o]n the basis of the record below.\u201d That decision of the Board of Review is the subject of this appeal by the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">The record before us is incomplete in that the transcript of the Appeal Tribunal hearing, which is based upon an apparently poor-audio tape, depicts only the direct testimony of petitioner, then appearing <em>pro se. </em>The transcript contains the following notation from the transcriber:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-7\">NOTE: This tape contained several parts that were difficult to discern. There was [sic] only two microphones in use. Many speakers were unidentified generally, or at the time of a particular statement when they were not near a microphone. Additionally, the transcript ends at the point at which the available tape ended. The subsequent tape was not available.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">There is no dispute that the hearing also included cross-examination of petitioner by the employer\u2019s attorney as well as testimony from the employer herself. As far as we are able to discern, the record before the Board of Review was no more complete than is the record before us. '</p>\n<p id=\"b680-9\">On appeal, the employer argues that the Board of Review erred as a matter of law in holding petitioner eligible for unemployment benefits. This argument is based upon \u201cuncontroverted evidence\u201d that the employer contends required a conclusion that petitioner was ineligible. The employer argues, further, that if a favorable determination on the merits as a matter of law is not made, the case must be remanded because of the incomplete record. Peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>tioner argues that she is entitled to unemployment compensation benefits as a matter of law and that the record is adequate to support the decision on the administrative level.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">We do not reach the legal question because of the state of the record. Without a reasonably complete transcript of the evidentiary hearing, we are unable to make a confident ruling concerning the legal rights of the parties, which are unavoidably linked to factual elements of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">In the absence of a complete record, the Board of Review could not validly discharge its function with respect to the Appeal Tribunal\u2019s decision. When the Board of Review is called upon to consider a decision of the Appeal Tribunal it</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-8\">may on its own motion affirm, modify, or set aside any decision of an appeal tribunal <em>on the basis of the evidence previously submitted in such case, </em>or direct the taking of additional evidence, or may permit any of the parties to such decision to initiate further appeals before it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-9\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:21-6(e) (emphasis supplied)]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-10\">This expression of the Board\u2019s authority connotes a <em>\u201cde novo </em>on the record\u201d standard of review, <em>ie., </em>the Board is required to <em>reach </em>independent findings of fact based upon the record made before the Appeal Tribunal, or it may supplement that record by \u201cdirectfing] the taking of additional evidence.\u201d <em>Ibid.; N.J.A.C. </em>12:20-Appendix <em>1:12-14.3. See also Softexture Yarns, Inc. v. Board of Review, </em>59 <em>N.J.Super. </em>57, 157 A.2d 142 (App.Div.1960); <em>Charles Headwear; Inc. v. Board of Review, </em>11 <em>N.J.Super. </em>321, 78 A.2d 306 (App.Div.1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-11\">Manifestly, a reviewing body employing the <em>\u201cde novo </em>on the record\u201d standard is in no position to make independent determinations of fact in the absence of a record substantially reflecting what transpired at the required evidentiary proceeding, unless further steps are taken to flesh out the <em>record. </em>Under the statute spelling out its functions, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:21-6(e), the Board of Review had several choices in this regard. It could have remanded to the Appeal Tribunal for a new or supplemental hearing; it could have held its own hearing to create an adequate record or to supplement the existing record; it could even have ordered the Appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>Tribunal and the parties to reconstruct the missing portions of the record, <em>see, e.g., State v. Izaguirre, </em>272 <em>N.J.Super. </em>51, 639 A.2d 343 (App.Div.1994). The one thing the Board of Review could not do was to affirm \u201con the basis of the record below\u201d when the record before it was patently and basically deficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Even if the Board of Review were called upon to apply an appellate standard of review, without a reasonably complete record it could hardly make a qualitative or principled determination whether the decision of the Appeal Tribunal was or was not supported by substantial evidence in the record. <em>See Softexture Yarns, supra, 59 N.J.Super. </em>57, 157 A.2d 142. Nor can we.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">Because we view the existing record as deficient, the decision of the Board of Review based thereon must be vacated. The matter is remanded for such proceedings as the Board of Review may direct for producing an adequate record and a decision based thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
