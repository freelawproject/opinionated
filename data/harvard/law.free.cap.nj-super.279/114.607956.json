On his way home from the doctor\u2019s office petitioner sustained injuries as a result of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>an automobile accident. The judge of compensation concluded that the accident arose out of and in the course of petitioner\u2019s employment because petitioner \u201cwas following the direction of his superiors\u201d by reporting to the doctor\u2019s office for medical clearance to return to his job.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We disagree and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">Petitioner was diagnosed as suffering from multiple sclerosis in 1978. In January 1992, he began experiencing blurry vision. When he reported to the state trooper barracks for work, he complained about his vision problem. He was placed off duty and was directed to report to Dr. Vivona, a cardiologist assigned by the State Police to examine troopers who are placed on sick leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">A written State Police \u201cS.O.P.\u201d requires any trooper who is absent from work for three consecutive working days because of a medical condition to submit to a physical examination by a \u201cDivision Physician.\u201d The Division thereupon places the trooper on full-duty status, temporary-duty status, or temporary off-duty status based on his or her condition. The Division physician determines, upon subsequent examination, when the trooper is able to resume full-duty status.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">Petitioner resides in Manahawkin, a township located in southern Ocean County. On January 15,1992, Dr. Vivona, whose office is in Brick Township, Ocean County, examined petitioner and certified in a \u201cDivision Physician\u2019s Report\u201d that petitioner was suffering from a physical condition which temporarily prevented him from performing \u201cin any capacity within the organization.\u201d Dr. Vivona also referred petitioner to another physician, Dr. Bhat, who prescribed Prednisone as a method of controlling petitioner\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>multiple sclerosis symptoms. Dr. Vivona also referred petitioner to Dr. Cook, a specialist in the treatment of multiple sclerosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">In adherence to State Police policy, petitioner reported to Dr. Vivona periodically for the purpose of examination to determine if he was capable of returning to work. On December 21,1992, after examining petitioner, Dr. Vivona filed another \u201cDivision Physician\u2019s Report\u201d stating that petitioner was not yet capable of returning to work because of his condition. Dr. Vivona directed that petitioner return for further examination in \u201cthree weeks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">Petitioner was driven by his wife to Dr. Vivona\u2019s office on January 18,1993. He was still on off-duty status and continued to have problems with his eyes. Because of personal problems, Dr. Vivona was unable to examine petitioner on that date. His office instructed petitioner to return later in the week. On the way home from Dr. Vivona\u2019s office, petitioner was involved in the automobile accident which caused his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">The issue before us is whether petitioner\u2019s visit to Dr. Vivona\u2019s office arose \u201cout of and in the course of\u201d petitioner\u2019s employment with the State Police. <em>N. J.S.A. </em>34:15-7. In resolving that issue, we begin by noting that the visit was not for the purpose of treatment for a prior work-related injury. Dean Larson, in his treatise, explains that \u201c[w]hen an employee suffers additional injuries because of an accident in the course of a journey to a doctor\u2019s office <em>occasioned by a compensable injury, </em>the additional injuries are generally held compensable.... \u201d 1 Larson, <em>The Law of Workmen\u2019s Compensation </em>\u00a7 13.13 at 3-564 (1990) (emphasis added). This view is bottomed on Dean Larson\u2019s \u201cquasi-course of employment\u201d concept, that is, activities undertaken by the employee:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-10\">following upon his injury which, although they take place outside the time and space limits of the employment, and would not be considered employment activities for usual purposes, are nevertheless related to the employment in the sense that they are necessary or reasonable activities that would not have been undertaken but for the compensable injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-11\">[Larson, \u00a7 13.11(d) at 3-542.1</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AM4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>We adopted Dean Larson\u2019s view in <em>Camp v. Lockheed Electronics, Inc., </em>178 <em>N.J.Super. </em>535, 543-44, 429 A.2d 615 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>87 <em>N.J. </em>415, 434 A.2d 1090 (1981), where petitioner was injured in an automobile accident returning home from a physician who was treating her for a prior work-connected injury. A majority of jurisdictions have also embraced the concept. <em>See e.g. Southern California Rapid Transit Dist., Inc. v. Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Bd., </em>23 <em>Cal.3d </em>158, 151 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>666, 668-69, 588 P.2d 806, 808-09 (1979); <em>Telcon, Inc. v. Williams, </em>500 So.2d 266, 269-70 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1986), <em>review denied, </em>508 So.2d 15 (Fla.1987); <em>Charles N. Clark Assocs. Ltd. v. Dependents of Robinson, </em>357 So.2d 924, 928-29 (Miss.1978). The rationale uniformly applied by these cases is that the employee\u2019s trip to the doctor\u2019s office is necessitated by the employer\u2019s statutory duty to provide medical treatment for the prior work-related accident, and the employee\u2019s concomitant duty to submit to such reasonable treatment. <em>Southern California Rapid Transit Dist., Inc. v. Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Bd., </em>151 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>at 669, 588 P.2d at 809.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">Here, the \u201cquasi-course of employment\u201d concept is not applicable because petitioner was not being treated by Dr. Vivona for a prior work-connected injury. It is undisputed that petitioner was suffering from multiple sclerosis, a condition neither related to nor aggravated by his work duties. Therefore, he was under no statutory duty to undergo treatment. <em>See Anderson v. Chatham Elecs., </em>70 <em>N.J.Super. </em>202, 205-06, 175 A.2d 256 (App.Div.1961), <em>certif. denied, </em>36 <em>N.J. </em>303, 177 A.2d 489 (1962) (injury not compensable where petitioner\u2019s accident occurred while she was on the way home from doctor\u2019s visit to obtain clearance for return to work for a medical condition not work-connected).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Nevertheless, petitioner argues that he was on a \u201cspecial mission\u201d when he traveled to the State Police-appointed physician for his physical examination. The argument must be examined in the context of the 1979 amendment to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, P.L.1979, c. 283, which for the first time provided a definition of \u201cemployment,\u201d as commencing \u201cwhen an employee arrives at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>the employer\u2019s place of employment to report for work and [terminating] when the employee leaves the employer\u2019s place of employment____\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-36. The definition was added to sweep away the judicially-created exceptions to the going and coming rule, a rule which precludes an award of compensation for injuries sustained during routine travel to and from an employee\u2019s regular place of work. <em>Zelasko v. Refrigerated Food Express, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>329, 334-35, 608 A.2d 231 (1992). The definition \u201csharply curtailed\u201d compensation for off-premises accidents and removed \u201cfrom compensability certain cases heretofore held compensable where special hazards existed en route to the employer\u2019s premises, [and] off-premises injuries sustained during lunch hour.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 335, 608 A.2d 231 (quoting Alfred J. Napier, <em>Impact of the Reform Act of 1980, </em>96 <em>N.J. Lawyer </em>17, 18 (Summer 1981)).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">Since the 1979 amendment, our courts have been uniformly obedient to the legislative will in imposing the time and space \u201cpremises rule,\u201d as defined by the statute. Generally the cases involve employees injured beyond the outer limits of the work place, before getting to or after leaving the job site. <em>See Novis v. Rosenbluth Travel, </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>92, 96, 649 A.2d 69 (1994); <em>Zelasko v. Refrigerated Food Express, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>at 338-39, 608 A.2d 231; <em>but see, Livingstone v. Abraham &amp; Straus, Inc., </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>89, 104-06, 543 A.2d 45 (1988) (injury compensable when occurring on parking lot controlled by employer). Others have denied compensability because the employee is injured while involved in personal activities unrelated to his or her direct employment duties as part of a job-related journey. <em>See Walsh v. Ultimate Corp., </em>231 <em>N.J.Super. </em>383, 390-91, 555 A.2d 731 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>92, 563 A.2d 849 (1989); <em>Ohio Casualty Group v. Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>213 <em>N.J.Super. </em>283, 289-90, 517 A.2d 166 (App.Div.1986); <em>Mangigian v. Franz Warner </em>Assoc., <em>Inc., </em>205 <em>N.J.Super. </em>422, 428, 501 A.2d 179 (App.Div.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">Petitioner contends that the statutory \u201cpremises rule\u201d does not apply because his trip to Dr. Vivona\u2019s office was mandated by a term and condition of his employment. Thus, he argues, it falls <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>within the \u201cspecial mission\u201d exception to the going and coming rule. Dean Larson defines the \u201cspecial mission\u201d or \u201cspecial errand\u201d rule as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-4\">When an employee, having identifiable time and space limits on his employment, makes an off-premises journey which would normally not be covered under the usual going and coming rule, the journey may be brought within the course of employment by the fact that the trouble and time of making the journey, or the special inconvenience, hazard, or urgency of making it in the particular circumstances, is itself sufficiently substantial to be viewed as an integral part of the service itself. '</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-5\">[Larson, \u00a7 16.11 at 4-204 (footnotes omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">Prior to the 1979 amendment to the statute, the \u201cspecial mission\u201d exception to the going and coming rule was firmly in place in New Jersey. <em>See Briggs v. American Biltrite, </em>74 <em>N.J. </em>185, 192, 376 A.2d 1231 (1977) (injury while en route to work a Sunday overtime shift); <em>Mikkelsen v. N.L. Indus., </em>72 <em>N.J. </em>209, 218, 370 A.2d 5 (1977) (injury while en route home from union meeting); <em>Binet v. Ocean Gate Bd. of Educ., </em>90 <em>N.J.Super. </em>571, 573, 218 A.2d 869 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>47 <em>N.J. </em>243, 220 A.2d 115 (1966) (teacher killed while returning home after P.T.A. meeting).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">Although <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-36 narrowly defines employment in the context of time and space limitations, the \u201cspecial mission\u201d exception survives the 1979 amendment. <em>See Zelasko, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>at 336, 608 A.2d 231. The statutory exception is derived from the proviso \\in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>35:15-36 which states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-8\">when the employee is required by the employer to be away from the employer\u2019s place of employment, the employee shall be deemed to be in the course of employment when the employee is engaged in the direct performance of duties assigned or directed by the employer____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">In interpreting this statutory exception, we must keep in mind the overriding purpose of <em>N.J.S.A </em>34:15-36: \u201cto impose upon off-site accidents a more restrictive standard of compensability.\u201d <em>Ehrgott v. Jones, </em>208 <em>N.J.Super. </em>393, 397, 506 A.2d 40 (App.Div.1986). Indeed, the specific language of the exception itself suggests an intention to narrow the reach of the pre-amendment cases, or at least to caution against expansion in a manner which conflicts with the legislative intent to curtail sharply compensability for off-site accidents. <em>See Livingstone v. Abraham &amp; Straus, Inc., </em>111 <em>N.J. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>at 101 n. 4, 543 A.2d 45 (statutory exceptions under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-36 \u201cwere derived from, and in some cases may have narrowed, pre-1979 case law exceptions to the going and coming rule\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">In view of the legislative mandate, we cannot conclude that petitioner\u2019s visit to Dr. Vivona\u2019s office was a \u201cspecial mission.\u201d We recognize, as petitioner has argued, that he was required by respondent to make the trip in order to obtain medical clearance to return to full-time duty. However, in our view, this fact alone does not place the trip within the special mission exception. It cannot be argued, at least persuasively, that when respondent placed petitioner on sick leave, petitioner was \u201crequired by the employer to be away from the employer\u2019s place of employment\u201d as intended by <em>N.J.S.A </em>34:15-36. More importantly, petitioner was not \u201cengaged in the direct performance of [state trooper] <em>duties </em>assigned or directed by the employer.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(emphasis added). He was simply directed to be examined by Dr. Vivona to determine if his medical condition, not work related, required him to remain on sick leave or allowed him to return to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">Moreover, respondent did not dictate, nor did it have any control over the course of petitioner\u2019s travel, or manner by which he was transported to Dr. Vivona\u2019s office. Petitioner was free to drive himself, if able, or to request a friend or family member to drive him. The record also suggests that there was some flexibility as to the exact time for petitioner\u2019s appointments with Dr. Vivona so as to accommodate petitioner\u2019s personal activities. For example, on petitioner\u2019s December 21, 1992 visit, Dr. Vivona\u2019s office told him to return in \u201cthree weeks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">Further, although the trip from Manahawkin to Brick Township may have been an inconvenience, there was no particular \u201chazard\u201d attending the trip. <em>See </em>Larson, \u00a7 16.11 at 4-204. Thus, the facts are readily distinguishable from <em>Nemchick v. Thatcher Glass Mfg. Co., </em>203 <em>N.J.Super. </em>137, 495 A.2d 1372 (App.Div.1985), cited by petitioner. In <em>Nemchick, </em>the employee was involved in the \u201cdirect performance of [his] assigned duties\u201d when, after his regular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>eight-hour shift, he was unexpectedly requested by his supervisor to journey fifty miles to an unfamiliar place to perform a work-connected task. <em>Id. </em>at 143, 495 A.2d 1372. The off-site job required ten hours to accomplish. <em>Ibid. </em>The employee was injured on his homeward journey after approximately twenty-seven sleepless hours. <em>Ibid. </em>In holding that the trip was a \u201cspecial mission,\u201d we observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-4\">The inconvenience, disruption of petitioner\u2019s normal daily routine, and, no doubt, enhanced exposure to hazard because of weariness and fatigue would not have ensued but for the work-related assignment, the benefits of which inured exclusively to respondent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-5\">\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">No such \u201cenhanced exposure to hazard\u201d due to \u201cweariness and fatigue\u201d is implicated here.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">Finally, the benefits of the examination by Dr. Vivona did not \u201cinure[ ] exclusively to respondent.\u201d Concededly, the mandatory examination procedure permits the Superintendent of the State Police to monitor troopers on sick leave to assure their speedy return to full-time work, and to prevent the premature return of a physically incapacitated trooper to the vigors of his or her duties. But these benefits are too remote to turn petitioner\u2019s compliance with the directive into a \u201cspecial mission.\u201d <em>See Anderson v. Chatham Elecs., </em>70 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 208, 175 A.2d 256. Moreover, the medical examination procedure benefits the state trooper as well, since it allows his or her continuance on sick leave if his or her condition persists, or accelerates the return to full-time duty if the condition has diminished. Indeed, here petitioner benefitted personally from Dr. Yivona\u2019s examination, since the doctor referred him to private specialists for treatment of his multiple sclerosis condition despite the fact that the condition was not related to petitioner\u2019s work. In short, the inconvenience in making the trip to Dr. Vivona\u2019s office was not \u201csufficiently substantial to be viewed as an integral part of the service itself.\u201d Larson, \u00a7 16.11 at 4-204.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b146-7\"> After deciding the compensability issue, the judge bifurcated the issue of partial permanent disability and, as of the date of oral argument, had not entered a final award. Since there is no final judgment as to all issues, respondent had no appeal as of right. <em>See R. </em>2:2-3(a). However, for purposes of judicial expediency, we grant leave to appeal <em>nunc pro tunc </em>to respondent and address the issues. <em>See Tennis Club Assocs. v. Planning Bd., </em>262 <em>N.J.Super. </em>422, 427, 621 A.2d 79 (App.Div.1993). <em>But cf. Della Rosa v. Van-Rad Contracting Co., </em>267 <em>N.J.Super. </em>290, 293-94, 631 A.2d 557 (App.Div.1993) (award of temporary benefits by judge of compensation is appealable as of right).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
