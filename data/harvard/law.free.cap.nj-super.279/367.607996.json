(A &amp; S) developed a leak that ultimately spilled some 600 gallons of oil into the Museonetcong River. A &amp; S was required to contain and remediate the spill, which it did at a cost <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>of approximately $75,000. A &amp; S submitted a claim for indemnification to defendant Royal Indemnity Company, Inc., which insured A &amp; S under a commercial automobile liability policy. Royal Indemnity disclaimed coverage and A &amp; S filed this action. On cross-motions for summary judgment, a Law Division judge held that the policy covered the spill. He subsequently entered judgment against Royal Indemnity for $95,411.75, including prejudgment interest, and dismissed A &amp; S\u2019s remaining claims. Royal Indemnity appeals from the judgment against it; A &amp; S cross-appeals from the denial of its demand for counsel fees and from the dismissal of its claim for bad-faith denial of coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">The policy provided insurance for \u201cproperty damage to which this insurance applies, caused by an accident and resulting from the ownership, maintenance or use of a covered auto.\u201d However, it excluded certain damage that Royal Insurance \u201cwill not cover,\u201d including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-6\">9. Bodily injury or property damage caused by the dumping, discharge or escape of irritants, pollutants or contaminants. This exclusion does not apply if the discharge is sudden and accidental.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">Royal Indemnity acknowledges that the loss resulted from a \u201csudden and accidental\u201d discharge of a \u201cpollutant.\u201d Under the quoted language, then, Royal Indemnity would be liable. But the policy incorporated a three-page endorsement, CA 00 25, bearing the following heading in large capital letters:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-8\">THIS ENDORSEMENT CHANGES THE POLICY. PLEASE READ IT CAREFULLY.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-9\">CHANGES IN BUSINESS AUTO AND TRUCKERS POLICIES-MOBILE EQUIPMENT, CONTRACTUAL LIABILITY AND POLLUTION.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-10\">Among the provisions of the endorsement is the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-11\">B. CHANGES IN LIABILITY INSURANCE WE WILL NOT COVER\u2014EXCLUSIONS is changed as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-12\">^ <em>% %</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-13\"><em>5. </em>The exclusion relating to the dumping, discharge or escape of irritants, pollutants or contaminants is changed to read:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-14\">This insurance does not apply to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>a. Bodily injury or property damage arising out of the actual, alleged or threatened discharge, dispersal, release or escape of pollutants:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-5\">(1) That <em>are </em>or that are contained in any property that is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-6\">(a) Being transported or towed by, or handled for movement into, onto or from, the covered auto.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-7\">(b) Otherwise in the course of transit; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-8\">(c) Being stored, disposed of, treated or processed in or upon the covered auto;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-9\">(2) Before the pollutants or any property in which the pollutants are contained are moved from the place where they are accepted by the insured for movement into or onto the covered auto; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-10\">(3) After the pollutants or any property in which the pollutants are contained are moved from the covered auto to the place where they are finally delivered, disposed of or abandoned by the insured.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-11\">A &amp; S acknowledges that the fuel spill constituted \u201cproperty damage arising out of the actual ... discharge, dispersal, release or escape\u201d of a \u201cpollutant.\u201d A &amp; S argues that it nevertheless had coverage because (1) the endorsement changes the \u201cWE WILL NOT COVER\u2014EXCLUSIONS\u201d provision of the policy, (2) the policy coverage for \u201csudden and accidental\u201d spills is not an \u201cexclusion\u201d but is an exception to an exclusion and (3) that exception accordingly survives as an exception to the exclusion described in the endorsement.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-12\">The motion judge adopted that reasoning. He acknowledged that the broad exclusionary language of the endorsement \u201cis at some variance from that in the original [policy].\u201d However, the endorsement \u201cdoesn\u2019t say anything about the sudden and accidental.\u201d Because of that perceived gap and \u201cthe philosophy of our courts that [an] ... insurance contract should be construed more strictly against the person who drafted it,\u201d the judge held that A &amp; S was entitled to coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-13\">We reject that analysis. The endorsement states that the exclusions provision of the policy \u201cis changed as follows:\u201d and that the exclusion specifically relating to the dumping, discharge or escape of pollutants \u201cis changed to read: ____\u201d The reasonable and, in our view, unavoidable interpretation is that the endorsement replaced, in its entirety, the policy\u2019s pollution exclusion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>including its \u201csudden and accidental\u201d limitation. A contrary reading is, of course, conceivable: A &amp; S has conceived one. Our case law, however, does not require that we credit every conceivable deconstruction of contractual language. As Justice Clifford said in <em>Weedo v. Stone-E-Brick, Inc., </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>233, 405 A.2d 788 (1979), the \u201cdoctrine of ambiguity\u201d should be invoked only to resolve \u201cgenuine\u201d ambiguities, not \u201cartificial\u201d ambiguities created by \u201csemantical ingenuity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 246-47, 405 A.2d 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">There can be no doubt\u2014indeed, we do not understand A &amp; S to dispute\u2014that the endorsement was designed to assure an absolute pollution exclusion, and that the language of the endorsement unambiguously states such an absolute exclusion. Volumes of caselaw from around the country so hold. <em>See, e.g., U.S. Bronze v. Commerce &amp; Industry Ins. Co., </em>259 <em>N.J.Super. </em>109, 117-18, 611 A.2d 667 (Law Div.1992); <em>Vantage Development Corp., Inc. v. American Environment Technologies Corp., </em>251 <em>N.J.Super. </em>516, 524-30, 598 A.2d 948 (Law Div.1991); <em>Western World Ins. Co. v. Stack Oil, Inc., </em>922 F.2d 118, 120-22 (2nd Cir.1990); <em>Union Mutual Fire Ins. Co. v. Hatch, </em>835 <em>F.Supp. </em>59, 63-65 (D.N.H.1993); <em>LaSalle National Trust v. Schaffner, </em>818 <em>F.Supp. </em>1161, 1167-68 (N.D.Ill.1993); <em>Alcolac Inc. v. California Union Ins. Co., </em>716 <em>F.Supp. </em>1546, 1549 (D.Md.1989); <em>Guilford Industries, Inc. v. Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., </em>688 <em>F.Supp. </em>792, 794 (D.Me.1988), aff<em>'d, </em>879 F.2d 853 (1st Cir.1989); <em>Budofsky v. Hartford Insurance Co., </em>147 Misc.2d 691, 556 N.Y.S.2d 438, 440-41 (N.Y.Sup.1990); <em>Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice </em>(Berdal ed.), \u00a7 4525 (1993); <em>G. Kenny, F. Lattal, N.J. Insurance Law </em>\u00a7 9.39, at 343-44 (1993). The only ambiguity proffered by A <em>&amp; </em>S is the endorsement\u2019s failure to state that it replaces the policy exclusion \u201cin its entirety\u201d or that the \u201csudden and accidental\u201d exception is no longer in effect. Hindsight can always suggest language that might have resolved a purported ambiguity. But the absence of such language does not prove a genuine ambiguity. As other courts have found, the endorsement\u2019s absolute and unlimited pollution exclusion must fairly and reasonably be read as eliminating any policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>coverage for sudden and accidental discharge. <em>See Stack Oil, </em>922 F.2d at 122; <em>Budofsky, </em>556 N.Y.S.2d at 440-41.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">That determination moots A &amp; S\u2019s challenges to the denial of its demand for counsel fees and to the dismissal of its claim for bad faith denial of coverage. The judgment against Royal Indemnity is reversed; the August 5, 1993 order for judgment is otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b402-11\"> We recognize that the reported cases all involve comprehensive general liability policies, while here we interpret a motor vehicle policy. Although it might be argued that \"a motor vehicle policy generates broader expectations in the policyholder, we see no reason or basis to interpret an attached pollution endorsement any differently.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
