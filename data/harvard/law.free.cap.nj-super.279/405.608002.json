We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-11\">Although complicated to some extent by an investigation in Virginia of a claim of sexual abuse involving the child and her mother and the mother\u2019s recently disclosed lesbianism, the critical jurisdictional facts are not difficult. The parties were married in New York in 1987. They moved to New Jersey in 1989. The child was born on October 20,1989. In the fall of 1992, the parties agreed to separate and agreed to joint legal and physical custody of the child. <em>Beck v. Beck, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>480, 487-88, 432 A.2d 63 (1981). Defendant was going to live in Virginia. A written separation agreement was signed December 7, 1992. Pursuant thereto, the child was to reside with defendant from January 1, 1993 to June 30, 1993 and thereafter with plaintiff from July 1, 1993 to December 31, 1993. Her residency would then be reevaluated. There was a factual dispute as to when defendant actually left New Jersey and began to reside in Virginia with the child. Both parties provided testimony; plaintiff asserted the date was December 12, 1992, defendant claimed November 2, 1992. The trial judge resolved that dispute and found that defendant left New Jersey with the child on November 2, 1992, although he returned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>briefly in the middle of November to allow visitation with plaintiff during Thanksgiving.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Plaintiff visited the child in Virginia over the Memorial Day weekend. Following that visit, on June 1, 1993 defendant filed a custody complaint in the Virginia Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court. On June 11, 1993, plaintiff filed a divorce complaint in New Jersey, with a notice of motion for pendente lite relief seeking custody.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In opposition thereto, defendant filed a cross-motion to dismiss the custody matter on jurisdictional grounds. The jurisdiction issue was heard on August 6, 1993 during which proceeding both parties testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">Both New Jersey and Virginia have adopted the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act and pursuant thereto the trial judge conferred with the Virginia Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court judge both before and after the proceeding. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-34; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-35; <em>Benda v. Benda, </em>236 <em>N.J.Super. </em>365, 565 A.2d 1121 (App.Div.1989). Although we cannot tell from the record what the substance of these discussions was, the outcome was an agreement that New Jersey would defer to Virginia\u2019s jurisdiction. In so concluding, the trial judge said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8B_\">The primary legislative purpose of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act is to assure that litigation concerning the custody of a child takes place ordinarily in the state within which the child and his family have the closest connection and where significant evidence concerning his care, protection, training and personal relationships is most readily available, and that Courts of this State decline the exercise of jurisdiction when the child and his family have a closer connection with another state. See <em>Neger v. Neger, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>15 [459 A.2d 628], 1983. In the case at bar, the child has been attending school in Virginia and is in therapy in Virginia. There is currently an investigation ongoing in Virginia as to the allegations of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>sexual abuse against the child.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Additionally, it is the intent of the plaintiff to relocate to the State of New York within a short period of time. At the present time there is a minimum connection between the State of New Jersey and the child for determining the issue of custody.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-6\">The Court further finds that it was the parties\u2019 expressed intent, pursuant to their Separation Agreement, that the child reside equally with both parents an equal period of time in Virginia and an equal period of time, <em>not necessarily in the </em>State of New' Jersey.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-7\">This Court further finds that it is in the best interest of the State of Virginia to hear this case as more significant evidence is available to the courts of Virginia to make the appropriate findings as to the best interest of this child. The child is currently in school in Virginia and is currently in therapy in the State of Virginia. See <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-31. Additionally, Virginia can be said to be the home state of this child at the time of the commencement of both the New Jersey and Virginia proceeding. This court specifically finds no wrongful conduct on behalf of the Defendant herein with respect to holding the child in Virginia pending the outcome of various litigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">An order declining jurisdiction was entered August 23, 1993. Although we have not been fully advised as to the proceedings in Virginia, it is evident that the jurisdictional issue, including a claim of lack of <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction, was resolved against plaintiff. It further appears that in September 1993 plaintiffs Virginia counsel filed a motion \u201cfor a new trial relative to the matter of jurisdiction.\u201d We were told during oral argument that presently all of the jurisdictional issues raised <em>by </em>plaintiff have <em>been resolved </em>and the entire custody issue is now proceeding <em>de novo </em>in a Virginia court of record.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Plaintiff states in her brief that custody was awarded defendant in August 26, 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">Meanwhile, in New Jersey, plaintiffs motion for reconsideration was denied on November 16, 1993. In his written decision, the trial judge said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>... this Court has conferred with Judge Hoover of the Domestic Relations Court in Virginia. He informed this Court that the Motion for Reconsideration was disposed of several weeks ago and that that motion was denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-5\">After reviewing all of the Affidavits and Arguments by legal counsel, this Court determines that the Motion for Reconsideration will be dismissed. This Court did not overlook any of the facts or circumstances, as they existed at the time, in making its determination that jurisdiction was appropriately within the State of Virginia.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-6\">Almost a year has now passed since the child first went to Virginia and many of the reasons upon which the decision was initially based at the time still exist. Although this Court admits that facts have changed, somewhat, this Court finds that jurisdiction is appropriately within the State of Virginia. Consequently, Plaintiffs Motion for Rehearing or Reconsideration seeking to amend an Order is hereby dismissed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">Under the particular circumstances here, we cannot conclude that the trial judge abused his discretion in declining jurisdiction and denying plaintiffs motion for reconsideration. At the heart of plaintiffs contention that he did is her claim that if Virginia obtained jurisdiction, it was only through defendant\u2019s \u201cmisconduct\u201d in taking and then keeping the child in Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">But the fact is the parties agreed to an equal, joint custody arrangement envisioning two separate residential jurisdictions for the child. This is not a \u201cchild-snatching\u201d case. <em>Compare Stevens v. Stevens, </em>177 <em>N.J.Super. </em>167, 425 A.2d 1081 (App.Div.1981) <em>with Marcrum v. Marcrum, </em>181 <em>N.J.Super. </em>361, 437 A.2d 725 (App.Div.1981), <em>appeal dismissed </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>232, 460 A.2d 645 (1982). Neither is it a situation of a failure of a parent to return a child to his or her residence following visitation in another state. <em>Compare Pozzi v. Pozzi </em>210 <em>N.J.Super. </em>522, 510 A.2d 123 (Ch.Div.1986) and <em>Middleton v. Middleton, 227 Va. </em>82, 314 S.E.2d 362, 369 (1984). The parties consented to the establishment of two separate places of residence for the child and consented to the child\u2019s removal to Virginia in November 1992. <em>See Bowden v. Bowden, </em>182 <em>N.J.Super. </em>307, 311-12, 440 A.2d 1160 (App.Div.1982). Moreover, at the time defendant filed his Virginia action, the initial six-month residency in Virginia under the written agreement was still in effect, although he and the child had lived there for a little more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>than six months. There was, thus, ample basis for the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that defendant had not engaged in misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">Virginia, then, was correctly considered by both judges to be the child\u2019s \u201chome state\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> at the time of the initial Virginia filing. We recognize, however, that the designation of one state as \u201chome state\u201d is not necessarily dispositive. <em>See Neger v. Neger, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>15, 28, 459 A.2d 628 (1983) (\u201cAlthough more than one state may potentially have initial jurisdiction, the litigation involving original jurisdiction should ordinarily commence in the state with which the child and his family have the closest connection and where significant evidence concerning the welfare of the child is more readily available.\u201d); <em>E.E.B. v. D.A., </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>595, 609, 446 A.2d 871 (1982), <em>cert. denied sub nom, </em>459 <em>U.S. </em>1210, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>1203, 75 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>445 (1983) (\u201c[t]he courts of the child\u2019s home state have jurisdiction, but if there is no home state or if the child and his family have equal or stronger ties with another state, the courts in the latter state have jurisdiction under the UCCJA\u201d); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:84-34, -29(c). <em>But see Matter of Adoption of Child by T.W.C., </em>270 <em>N.J.Super. </em>225, 233, 636 A.2d 1083 (App.Div.1994) (\u201cwhile the UCCJA permits jurisdiction to be exercised by the \u2018home state\u2019 <em>or </em>a state having a \u2018significant connection\u2019 with the child or one of the contestants, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:34-81, the PKPA Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act] allows \u2018significant connection\u2019 jurisdiction only if no state qualifies as the home state.... The jurisdictional requirements of the PKPA, of course, preempt those of the UCCJA if the acts are in conflict.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">In <em>T.W.C., </em>we observed that more than one state may be regarded as having sufficient connection with the parent and child to support its own original jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>at 236, 636 A 2d 1083. But we also noted that \u201cneither the UCCJA nor the PKPA requires that one state\u2019s \u2018substantial contacts\u2019 be weighed against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>another state\u2019s \u2018substantial contacts\u2019 in order to entrust a single state with jurisdiction____ More than one state may have connections sufficient to support original jurisdiction; the PKPA specifically contemplates that possibility, prohibiting a state from exercising jurisdiction where another state \u2018is exercising jurisdiction consistently with the provisions [of the PKPA].\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid.; </em>28 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 1738A(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">Regardless of the home state issue, then, and assuming the trial court could have exercised original jurisdiction, the UCCJA accords the trial court the discretion to decline jurisdiction if it finds another state to be a more appropriate forum. <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:34-31a(4)(i), -35; 28 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1738A(e)(2)(D); <em>E.E.B., supra, </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>at 610-12, 446 A.2d 871. As we have previously said, Virginia was the home state at the time defendant filed his custody proceeding as the trial judge found. But even if not, the trial judge considered the child\u2019s connection with Virginia and found it to be substantial. That conclusion is rationally premised upon the particular facts here. Although unquestionably New Jersey has had a close connection with the child and the parties, Virginia is the child\u2019s most recent residence where \u201csubstantial evidence concerning the child\u2019s present or future care, protection, training and personal relationships is more readily available.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-35e(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">We have carefully considered plaintiffs various contentions. We reject them but briefly address the contentions concerning \u201cemergent jurisdiction\u201d and whether Virginia\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction is consistent with the UCCJA.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">As to the first, plaintiff contends that Virginia\u2019s initial exercise of jurisdiction was predicated upon the \u201cemergent circumstances\u201d exception to the UCCJA arising from the sexual abuse allegation. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-31a(3)(ii); <em>Va.Code, </em>\u00a7 20-126(A)(3)(ii). Thus, claims plaintiff, when the investigation of that allegation was terminated, that jurisdiction ceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>There is no question that emergent jurisdiction under the UCCJA can only be temporary and would not have continued after the completion of the Department of Social Services\u2019 investigation. But nowhere does the record reveal that that was the basis for the Virginia court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction. Indeed, the original pleading appears to be a straightforward petition for custody. There is no reference to any emergent circumstances. And, as we have previously concluded, the trial judge correctly determined that Virginia was a \u201chome state\u201d at the time that petition was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">This conclusion resolves, as well, plaintiffs additional contention that Virginia could not properly exercise jurisdiction under the UCCJA consistent with the Act. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-34; 28 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1738A(d). In this regard, plaintiff claims Virginia had neither subject matter jurisdiction nor <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction over plaintiff. She has unsuccessfully raised these issues in the Virginia courts and asks us to reach a different view. Because Virginia is a \u201chome state\u201d and, further, has substantial connection with the child and defendant, it has subject matter jurisdiction. As to <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction, although plaintiff disputes ever being properly served and contends the summons is defective because it contains an incorrect address, she has appeared throughout the Virginia proceedings and has been fully represented by counsel in those proceedings. It is evident plaintiff has received \u201cactual notice\u201d of the proceeding. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-33; <em>Va.Code </em>\u00a7 20-128. <em>See Middleton v. Middleton, supra, </em>227 <em>Va. </em>82, 314 S.E.2d at 371 (England exercised jurisdiction substantially in conformity with the UCCJA even though complaint had not been served).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">We are not insensitive to plaintiffs concerns relating to her particular sexual preference and its potential impact in the custody proceeding. But we reject the assertion that she will be any more or less at a risk in Virginia for having that sexual preference treated as a disqualifying factor <em>per se. </em>While Virginia considers as an important factor the moral climate in which a child is to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>raised, including a parent\u2019s sexual preference if substantially exposed to the child, <em>Roe v. Roe, </em>228 <em>Va. </em>722, 324 S.E.2d 691 (1985), it also recognizes that lesbianism is not a disqualifying factor <em>per se. See Doe v. Doe, 222 Va. </em>736, 284 S.E.2d 799 (1981); <em>Bottoms v. Bottoms, </em>444 <em>S.E.2d </em>276 (Va.App.1994). It is the best interest of the child that is paramount in both states.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b438-7\"> Pursuant to our order, plaintiff was permitted to supplement the record with copies of attendance records of the day care facility in New Jersey which the child had attended. She claimed the records showed that the child did not leave New Jersey until December 12, 1992. We have reviewed these records. They show attendance only on November 18, 19, 23, 24 and 25, not inconsistent with the judge\u2019s findings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b438-8\"> Aside from the issue of custody, the parties have settled the divorce issues and a judgment of divorce has been entered.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b439-10\"> Subsequent to the trial judge's decision, the Virginia Department of Social Services terminated its investigation, concluding \"sexual abuse suspected, perpetrator unknown.\u201d It further concluded that the claim that plaintiff was the abuser was unfounded.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b439-11\"> We are told the initial custody proceedings in the Virginia Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court were not recorded since that court is \"not a Court of record.\u201d <em>See Va.Code </em>\u00a7 16.1-69.5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b441-8\"> As defined by the UCCJA, home, state means \"the state in which the child immediately preceding the time involved lived with ... a parent ... for at least 6 consecutive months ...
