The Law Division upheld the decision of the local zoning board of adjustment denying the use variance and six bulk variances essentially because of off-site traffic conditions. We now affirm substantially for the reasons expressed by Judge Menza in his oral and written opinions of March 31, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">We add the following comments. Denial of the variance application does not mean the property has been zoned into substantial economic inutility. Here, the alleged economic inutility is the consequence of a deteriorating and aging structure situated in the midst of other thriving industrial businesses rather than the zoning ordinance. Functional obsolescence is not synonymous with economic inutility.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-11\">We are also persuaded that unlike a planning board which at times acts in a ministerial capacity, a local zoning board of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>adjustment acts as a quasi-judicial body. As such, it is called upon to become involved in a weighing process, much like a court, before determining whether the positive and/or negative criteria have been met. In determining whether the negative criteria have been satisfied, a board of adjustment must determine the impact approval of a requested use variance will have on the surrounding neighborhood and zoning plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">The judgment under review is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
