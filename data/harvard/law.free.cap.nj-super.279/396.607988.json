The Law Division held there was no such duty in the case presented and granted summary judgment in favor of defendant Rose Cordasco. We agree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-11\">On appeal, plaintiff Andre Rodriguez argues that the motion judge erred in granting summary judgment<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> because there were material issues of fact in dispute. In addition, he argues that the judge erred in concluding that as a matter of law a defendant-homeowner who makes a practice of attracting stray dogs by repeatedly feeding them and allowing them access to her property, is not liable to passersby who are injured by the action of the animals. Finally, Rodriguez argues that Cordasco, as the owner and occupier of property abutting a negligently maintained sidewalk, is liable to him for injuries sustained as a result of a fall on that sidewalk while attempting to run from the dogs.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-12\">The underlying facts may be briefly stated. At about 4:00 p.m. on March 1,1993, Rodriguez was walking on the sidewalk in front of Cordasco\u2019s one-family, two-story residence on Seventh Avenue in Newark. He was on his way to a bus stop and claims that as he passed Cordasco\u2019s residence two or three dogs came from Cordas<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>co\u2019s unfenced yard and began to chase him. Rodriguez quickened his pace to avoid the dogs, but tripped and fell on a raised portion of the sidewalk abutting Cordasco\u2019s residence, injuring his right knee.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">Rodriguez does not dispute that Cordaseo did not own the dogs, but asserts that she was a \u201ckeeper\u201d of the dogs and should bear responsibility for injuries he sustained when he fell.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">In his deposition Rodriguez testified that he had been walking past the Cordaseo house daily for about eight months and that the stray dogs which chased him \u201calways\u201d eat in the back of Cordasco\u2019s house. However, he did not know what they were eating nor did he know if it was Cordaseo who was feeding them. After the motion judge granted summary judgment in favor of Cordaseo, Rodriguez made a motion for reconsideration and indicated that he could obtain a statement from a witness who would corroborate his assertion that Cordaseo left food out for stray dogs on several occasions. The judge, in denying the motion for reconsideration, held that even if Cordaseo fed the stray dogs, she did not owe a duty of care to the public to protect against the.actions of those dogs.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">Cordaseo acknowledged in her deposition that stray dogs occasionally came onto her property and would often approach her as she tried to enter her ear. She indicated that she would sometimes throw them biscuits to \u201cbribe\u201d them away from the car, but she asserted that she never left food out for them. She also stated that she called a Newark agency on several occasions trying to rid the neighborhood of the stray dogs.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">In granting summary judgment in favor of Cordaseo the motion judge appropriately gave Rodriguez the benefit of all of the reasonable inferences. <em>See Judson v. Peoples Bank &amp; Trust Co. of Westfield, </em>17 <em>N.J. </em>67, 74, 110 A.2d 24 (1954); <em>R. </em>4:46-2. For <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>the purpose of this appeal we also resolve all factual disputes in his favor. <em>Antheunisse v. Tiffany &amp; Co., </em>229 <em>N.J.Super. </em>399, 402, 551 A.2d 1006 (App.Div.1988), <em>certif. denied, </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>59, 556 A.2d 1206 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">New Jersey\u2019s <em>\u201cdog </em>bite\u201d statute <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>4:19-16) imposes liability on dog owners in certain instances. That statute is inapplicable here and affords no basis for Rodriguez\u2019s claim. There was no \u201cbite\u201d inflicted on Rodriguez and the dogs apparently did not make contact with or physically touch him in any fashion. <em>Hayes v. Mongiovi, </em>121 <em>N.J.Super. </em>272, 275, 296 A.2d 567 (Cty.Ct.1972), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>125 <em>N.J.Super. </em>413, 311 A.2d 207 (App.Div.1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">A common law cause of action in strict liability against Cordasco is likewise unavailable here. To establish such liability Rodriguez would have to show that Cordasco owned the dog (or perhaps was its \u201ckeeper\u201d) and had knowledge of its mischievous or vicious propensities. <em>Jannuzzelli v. Wilkens, </em>158 <em>N.J.Super. </em>36, 41, 385 A.2d 322 (App.Div.1978); Prosser and Keeton, <em>The Law of Torts, </em>\u00a7 76, at 542 (5th ed. 1984). The record does not indicate any basis for holding Cordasco strictly liable due to any knowledge of mischievous propensities of the stray dogs.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Hence, Rodriguez is left with a potential claim based on negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">An owner or keeper of an animal may be liable for negligence in controlling it. <em>DeRobertis v. Randazzo, </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>144, 156, 462 A.2d 1260 (1983); 3A <em>C.J.S. Animals </em>\u00a7 188, at 690 (\u201cA dog\u2019s owner or keeper who has been negligent with respect to its keeping or control may be liable for injuries proximately resulting therefrom irrespective of whether there was a known vicious propensity____\u201d); 4 <em>Am.Jur.2d Animals </em>\u00a7 89, at 337 (\u201cThe owner or keeper of a domestic animal is charged with knowledge of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>natural propensities of animals of the particular class to which this animal belongs, and, if these propensities are of the kind that might cause' injury he must exercise the care necessary to prevent such injuries as may be anticipated.\u201d). Rodriguez must therefore establish that Cordasco was either the owner of the stray dog or dogs or responsible for their care. Rodriguez must also establish that Cordasco was negligent in failing to control the stray dogs that caused the injury. <em>DeRobertis v. Randazzo, supra, </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>at 156, 462 A.2d 1260. Rodriguez has made no showing that Cordasco was an \u201cowner\u201d or even a \u201ckeeper\u201d of the offending stray dogs, and, therefore, his negligence cause of action fails. <em>Cf. Mascola v. Mascola, </em>168 <em>N.J.Super. </em>122, 126-127, 401 A.2d 1114 (App.Div.1979) (\u201cone not an owner of a vicious dog may be liable as a keeper, if he is in fact such and has knowledge of its vicious disposition\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">In <em>Linebaugh v. Hyndman, </em>213 <em>N.J.Super. </em>117, 516 A.2d 638 (App.Div.1986), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>106 <em>N.J. </em>556, 524 A.2d 1255 (1987), a \u201cdog bite\u201d case, we held that there was sufficient basis for a negligence action against a landlord where the landlord was aware that a dog with vicious propensities was kept on the property. <em>Linebaugh </em>based liability on the maintenance of an \u201cartificial [dangerous] condition on the property\u201d which resulted from the landlord\u2019s failure to protect the tenants and their invitees from the known danger of a vicious animal. <em>Id., </em>213 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 121, 516 A.2d 638. This case is distinguishable from <em>Linebaugh </em>because the incident occurred off Cordasco\u2019s property and there was no indication that she had knowledge of any vicious propensities of the stray dog or dogs. <em>See also Steinberg v. Petta, </em>114 <em>Ill.2d </em>496, 103 <em>Ill.Dec. </em>725, 501 N.E.2d 1263 (1986) (involved the liability of a landlord under a local statute; an action at common law, unlike that under the statute, required proof that the dog was vicious and that defendant had knowledge thereof).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">No New Jersey case supports plaintiffs claim of liability. Thus, Rodriguez relies on authorities from other jurisdictions. These eases, however, are inapposite. For example, <em>Verrett v. Silver, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>309 <em>Minn. </em>275, 244 N.W.2d 147 (1976), involved a five-year-old boy who was bitten by a dog which ran from defendant\u2019s yard and returned there after the incident. It was undisputed that the dog was staying at defendant\u2019s home. <em>Id., </em>244 N.W.2d at 148. Plaintiff successfully established defendant\u2019s liability under that state\u2019s \u201cdog bite\u201d statute which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-5\">If a dog, without provocation, attacks or injures any person who is peaceably conducting himself in any place where he may lawfully be in any urban area, the owner of the dog is liable in damages to the person so attacked or injured to the full amount of the injury sustained. <em>The temo \u201cowv.er\u201d includes any person harboring or keeping a </em>dog....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-6\"><em>[Id. </em>n. 1 (emphasis supplied).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">In interpreting the statute, the <em>Verrett </em>court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-8\"><em>Harboring or keeping a dog means something more than a meal of mercy to a, stray doy or the casual presence of a dog on someone\u2019s premises. </em>Harboring means to afford lodging, to shelter or to give refuge to a dog. Keeping a dog, as used in the statute before us, implies more than the mere harboring of the dog for a limited purpose or time. One becomes the keeper of a dog only when he either with or without the owner\u2019s permission undertakes to manage, control, or care for it as dog owners in general are accustomed to do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-9\"><em>[Id. </em>at 149 (emphasis supplied).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-10\"><em>Christie v. Anchorage Yacht Haven, Inc., </em>287 So.2d 359 (Fla.Ct.App.1973), and <em>Hampton v. Hammons, </em>743 P.2d 1053 (Okl.1987), are equally inapplicable and unpersuasive. As in <em>Verrett, supra, </em>local \u201cdog bite\u201d statutes were implicated. <em>Christie </em>noted that to define the statutory term \u201cowner\u201d as \u201cthe possessor, keeper, or custodian of the animal,\u201d was \u201cnot without supporting authority.\u201d The <em>Christie </em>court, however, declined to decide the issue because in that case it was clear that none of the defendants were keepers of the dog. 287 So.2d at 360.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-11\">In <em>Hampton </em>the statute specifically defined \u201cowner\u201d as \u201ca person with a legal right to possession but also includes anyone who cares for, has custody of, keeps or maintains any dog, cat, or domestic animal.\u201d 743 P.2d at 1055-1056. Moreover, in <em>Hampton </em>the defendant was clearly at least the keeper of the dog that defendant was watching for her son and had chained in her yard. <em>Id. </em>at 1055.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number><em>Williams v. Pohlman, </em>146 <em>Ind.App. </em>523, 257 N.E.2d 329 (1970) (animal hospital that housed dog could be liable as a \u201ckeeper\u201d for injury caused by dog\u2019s known vicious propensities), and <em>Papke v. Tribbey, </em>68 <em>Mich.App. </em>130, 242 N.W.2d 38 (1976) (owner of domestic animal with knowledge of its vicious propensities strictly hable for injury), are also inapposite. The defendants in those cases actually housed and cared for the offending animals and had knowledge of their vicious propensities.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\"><em>McEvoy v. Brown, </em>17 <em>Ill.App.2d </em>470, 150 <em>N.E.2d </em>652 (1958), also relied on by plaintiff, involved an Illinois statute similar to that in <em>Verrett v. Silver, supra. McEvoy </em>held that under that statute, a person who is either attacked or injured by the dog may maintain a cause of action against its owner. <em>Id., </em>150 <em>N.E.</em>2d at 654. The question of whether the defendant was a \u201charborer or keeper\u201d was one for the jury. However, \u201c[t]he casual act of feeding or watering the dog is not such an act that would constitute keeping or harboring.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">A stray dog, by definition, is not owned or controlled by anyone. The proposition that one can be liable as a keeper of a stray dog is logically inconsistent; sporadic feeding of a stray animal does not create ownership -responsibility for it. As noted, <em>McEvoy, </em>which Rodriguez relies on to support his theory of liability, specifically rejected the argument that the casual feeding of an animal constitutes \u201ckeeping\u201d it. We also reject that argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">Rodriguez also appears to argue that by feeding the stray dogs, Cordasco maintained a public nuisance.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This argument was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>not raised below nor was it delineated as such as required by <em>R. </em>2:6-2. Rodriguez urges for the first time on appeal that by feeding stray dogs Cordasco has maintained an \u201cunreasonable\u201d condition on her real property. Since it was not raised below, we need not address the issue. <em>R. </em>2:10-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">Rodriguez acknowledges that under current New Jersey law, residential property owners cannot be held liable for defects in the abutting sidewalk absent negligent construction or repair of it. <em>See Borges v. Hamed, </em>247 <em>N.J.Super. </em>295, 589 A.2d 169 (App.Div.1991), <em>affirming </em>247 <em>N.J.Super. </em>353, 589 A.2d 199 (Law Div.1990) (refusing to impose sidewalk liability on owner of three-family house where two of three apartments were occupied by family members, because it was not a \u201ccommercial property\u201d); <em>Stewart v. 104 Wallace St., Inc., </em>87 <em>N.J. </em>146, 432 A.2d 881 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">Nevertheless, Rodriguez argues that we should extend the <em>Stewari </em>rule to residential landowners. This court is bound by the decisions of our Supreme Court. Such a drastic change in the law is a matter for that Court or the Legislature and we decline the invitation to institute a change in established law.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b429-13\"> At the time of the hearing of the summary judgment motion the parties had exchanged interrogatories and Cordasco and Rodriguez had been deposed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b430-9\"> Cordaseo apparently does own a nine-year old Doberman Pinscher that she keeps indoors. It was not involved with Rodriguez\u2019s fall.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b431-11\"> The record does not reflect that these stray dogs possessed any vicious propensities. They may have been playful or curious. Rodriguez\u2019s injuiy was caused by his trip and fall on the sidewalk. There is no indication in the record that the dogs bit, scratched, or touched him even after he fell.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b434-8\"> In support of this proposition, Rodriguez cites the wholly inapposite case of <em>Rhabb </em>v. <em>New York City Housing Authority, </em>41 <em>N.Y.2d </em>200, 391 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>540, 359 <em>N.E.2d </em>1335 (1976). <em>Rhabb </em>did not involve the theory of public nuisance, but rather the duty of a municipality to maintain its playground facilities in a safe condition. <em>Id., </em>391 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>at 542, 359 <em>N.E.2d </em>at 1335. The <em>Rhabb </em>court held that the municipality could be liable for a dog attack which occurred on its property where the dog belonged to a municipal employee and had attacked children on the playground on numerous occasions. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
