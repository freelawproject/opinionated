The principal issue involves the effect of 1974 amendments to the Legislators\u2019 Retirement Law (Gov. Code, \u00a7 9350 et seq.) which replaced a \u201cfluctuating\u201d system of computing retirement benefits with a \u201cfixed\u201d system. We conclude that petitioner is entitled to the relief he seeks and will therefore issue a peremptory writ of mandate. (All statutory references are to the Government Code unless otherwise indicated.)</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">Petitioner held the office of Treasurer from January 5, 1959, to January 2, 1967. As an elected constitutional officer, being eligible, he chose to participate in the Legislators\u2019 Retirement Fund (Fund) while holding office (\u00a7 9355.4).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">At all times during petitioner\u2019s incumbency, the basic retirement benefit available to retired members of the Fund was governed by section 9359.1, subdivision (b), which then provided, in pertinent part: \u201cThe retirement allowance for [a nonlegislative member] ... is an annual amount equal to five percent (5%) of the compensation payable at the time payments of the allowance fall due, <em>to the officer holding the office which the retired member last held </em>prior to his retirement, <em>or </em>five percent (5%) of the highest compensation <em>fixed for such office </em>during the member\u2019s last term or any subsequent term prior to his retirement, whichever is greater, multiplied by [years of service credit] . . . .\u201d (Italics added.) Under this \u201cfluctuating\u201d system, a retired member\u2019s monthly allowance would be adjusted periodically throughout the term of the pension to reflect changes in the salary payable to the <em>current </em>incumbent of the elective office the member had previously held.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">In 1974, after petitioner had left office but before his retirement and application for benefits, the Legislature changed the method of benefit computation. Under amended section 9359.1, the basic benefit allowance became \u201can annual amount equal to five percent (5%) of the highest compensation received <em>by the officer </em>while serving in such [nonlegislative elective] office,\u201d multiplied by years of service credit. An additional allowance was provided in certain cases for persons with 24 or more years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>of credited service; these provisions do not apply to petitioner. (\u00a7 9359.1, subd. (b).) The amendment was expressly made inapplicable to members who had \u201cretired\u201d on its effective date.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-4\">The effect of the 1974 amendment was to substitute a \u201cfixed\u201d system of benefit computation for the prior \u201cfluctuating\u201d system. Under the new law, the basic benefit payable to a member retiring after October 7, 1974, is computed only on the basis of the highest salary he himself received while serving in a constitutional office covered by the Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">The highest annual salary received by petitioner as Treasurer was $21,499. In 1969, after petitioner left office, the Treasurer\u2019s salary was raised to $35,000 per year, the current level.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">In 1976, petitioner retired on the basis of total disability and applied for his benefits from the Fund. He was advised that his allowance would be computed under the 1974 amendment, on the basis of petitioner\u2019s highest salary in office, $21,499. Petitioner requested an administrative hearing. The administrative judge found that petitioner was entitled to benefits computed on the basis of the current $35,000 salary, under the law as it existed in 1967, when petitioner left elective office. The Board reversed the determination of the administrative judge and this petition followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">Petitioner\u2019s principal contention is that application of the 1974 amendment to him interferes with his vested contractual right to an earned pension. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-8\">A long line of California decisions has settled the principles applicable to the problems herein presented.  A public employee\u2019s pension constitutes an element of compensation, and a vested contractual right to pension benefits accrues upon acceptance of employment. Such a pension right may not be destroyed, once vested, without impairing a contractual obligation of the employing public entity. <em>(Kern </em>v. <em>City of Long Beach </em>(1947) 29 Cal.2d 848, 852-853 [179 P.2d 799].) The employee does not obtain, prior to retirement, any absolute right to fixed or specific benefits, but only to a \u201csubstantial or reasonable pension.\u201d <em>(Wallace </em>v. <em>City of Fresno </em>(1954) 42 Cal.2d 180, 183 [265 P.2d 884].) Moreover, the employee\u2019s eligibility for benefits can, of course, be defeated \u201cupon the occurrence of a condition subsequent.\u201d <em>(Kern, supra, </em>at p. 853.)</p>\n<p id=\"b894-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>However, there is a strict limitation on the conditions which may modify the pension system in effect during employment. We have described the applicable principles as follows: \u201cAn employee\u2019s vested contractual pension rights may be modified prior to retirement for the purpose of keeping a pension system flexible to permit adjustments in accord with changing conditions and at the same time maintain the integrity of the system. [Citations.] Such modifications must be reasonable, and it is for the courts to determine upon the facts of each case what constitutes a permissible change. To be sustained as reasonable, alterations of employees\u2019 pension rights must bear some material relation to the theory of a pension system and its successful operation, <em>and changes in a pension plan which result in disadvantage to employees should be accompanied by comparable new advantages. </em>[Citations.] ...\u201d <em>(Allen </em>v. <em>City of Long Beach </em>(1955) 45 Cal.2d 128, 131 [287 P.2d 765], italics added.) We recently reaffirmed these principles in <em>Miller </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1977) 18 Cal.3d 808, 816 [135 Cal.Rptr. 386, 557 P.2d 970].</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">In <em>Allen, supra, </em>we explained why the substitution of a \u201cfixed\u201d system of benefit computation for a \u201cfluctuating\u201d system constitutes a disadvantage to affected employees: \u201cPayment of a fixed amount freezes the benefit at a figure which is based on salary scales preceding retirement, thus the longer an employee is retired on a fixed pension the more likely it is that the amount of his pension will not accurately reflect existing economic conditions, whereas a retired employee receiving a fluctuating pension based on the salaries that active employees are currently receiving can maintain a fairly constant standard of living despite changes in our economy.\u201d (45 Cal.2d at p. 132.) In inflationary times, we observed, the resulting disadvantage of a \u201cfixed\u201d system is obvious; but the very unpredictability of economic cycles also \u201cindicates the advantage of a plan for fluctuating benefits which attempts, however roughly, to reflect the actual purchasing power of the dollar . . . .\u201d (45 Cal.2d at p. 132; see also <em>Abbott </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1958) 50 Cal.2d 438, 448 [326 P.2d 484]; <em>Chapin </em>v. <em>City Commission </em>(1957) 149 Cal.App.2d 40, 44-45 [307 P.2d 657].)</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">Judicial attention has also been given to the subject of \u201ccomparable new advantages.\u201d The comparative analysis of disadvantages and compensating advantages must focus on the particular employee whose own vested pension rights are involved. <em>(Abbott </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, supra, </em>50 Cal.2d at pp. 449-453; <em>Frank </em>v. <em>Board of Administration </em>(1976) 56 Cal.App.3d 236, 245 [128 Cal.Rptr. 378]; <em>see Abbott </em>v. <em>City of San Diego </em>(1958) 165 Cal.App.2d 511, 518 [332 P.2d 324].) It has been said that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>offsetting improvement must also \u201crelate generally to the benefit that has been diminished.\u201d <em>(Frank, supra, </em>at p. 244; <em>Stork </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1976) 62 Cal.App.3d 465, 471 [133 Cal.Rptr. 207].)</p>\n<p id=\"b895-4\">The Board urges that 1963 amendments to the pension plan provide the necessaiy offsetting advantage in this case. In that year, the Legislature added section 9360.9, which requires automatic annual adjustment of pension benefits to reflect upward changes in the cost of living. Each January 1, under this statute, the previous year\u2019s benefit is multiplied by that year\u2019s average increase in the Bureau of Labor Statistics cost-of-living indices for San Francisco and Los Angeles, respectively, using 1954 as the base year. The product of this calculation becomes the basis of the benefit payable for the ensuing year.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">Thus, the Board argues, one \u201ccost of living\u201d formula was simply replaced by another; petitioner, it urges, had no reasonable expectation when he left office that he would enjoy the \u201cdouble windfall\u201d of the cost-of-living index formula provided by section 9360.9 <em>plus </em>the \u201cfluctuating\u201d benefit adjustment, the increasing salary scale, mandated by the pre-1974 version of section 9359.1. Under the circumstances of this case, the Board\u2019s contention cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">In asserting that termination of the \u201cfluctuating\u201d system was reasonable here, the Board relies heavily on <em>Lyon </em>v. <em>Flournoy </em>(1969) 271 Cal.App.2d <em>774 </em>[76 Cal.Rptr. 869]. The Court of Appeal in <em>Lyon </em>faced an unusual fact situation which was historically unique. Petitioner\u2019s decedent in that case had retired from the Legislature in 1955 and commenced drawing a monthly allowance from the Fund. At the time of decedent\u2019s retirement and for more than 10 years thereafter, the salaiy for members of the Legislature was $500 per month. Decedent\u2019s allowance and, after his death, that of petitioner, his widow, were computed on the basis of this salary.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">Meanwhile, repeated attempts to liberalize legislative salaries by constitutional amendment were rejected by the voters; referendum propositions of this kind were defeated in 1958, 1960 and 1962. In 1966, however, a broader partial constitutional revision was successful at the polls. This measure (Proposition 1-A) repealed the $500 per month salary, authorized the Legislature to set its own salaries, and validated a 1966 statute fixing members\u2019 salaries at $16,000 per year, beginning with the 1967 term. (See Cal. Const., art. IV, \u00a7 4, and former art. XXII, \u00a7 6, as adopted Nov. 8, 1966; Gov. Code, \u00a7 8901.)</p>\n<p id=\"b896-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>However, the 1966 amendments also included a clause prohibiting any member who had retired prior to 1967 from receiving retirement benefits computed on the basis of the new salaries and limited computation of the retirement benefits of such members to the pre-1967 salary of $500 per month. (Cal. Const., <em>supra, </em>art. IV, \u00a7 4.) The Legislature incorporated this requirement into the Legislators\u2019 Retirement Law itself. (\u00a7 9359.11.)</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">Petitioner Lyon contended that her husband had earned a \u201cvested right\u201d to computation of benefits on the basis of the salary provided by the 1966 constitutional amendments, under the \u201cfluctuating\u201d system in effect at his retirement. The appellate court concluded that the purpose of a \u201cfluctuating\u201d pension system was to provide retirees some insulation against normal variations in the cost of living; the substantial increase in salary from $500 per month ($6,000 per year) to $16,000 per year, it said, had no relation to this purpose. Rather, it was simply the result of long-term legislative frustration over voter resistance to increased salaries. The Legislature, observed the <em>Lyon </em>court, had already compensated retirees for the hardship caused by the 12-year salary \u201cfreeze\u201d by its 1963 adoption of the cost-of-living adjustment established in section 9360.9. Petitioner\u2019s decedent, said the court, had no \u201creasonable expectation\u201d while in office that he would enjoy a <em>double </em>cost-of-living formula\\ particularly where his contributions to the Fund had been based on the pre-1967 salary he received. The Legislature, the court concluded, properly forestalled such a \u201cwindfall\u201d by replacing one \u201ccost-of-living\u201d factor\u2014the \u201cfluctuating\u201d system of benefit computation based on variations in current salaries\u2014with another\u2014a formula adjustment based directly on increases in the cost of living. (271 Cal.App.2d at pp. 783-786.)</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">In <em>Lyon, </em>accordingly, <em>after the member\u2019s retirement, </em>the cost-of-living formula in effect during his active service was replaced by another. The Court of Appeal was therefore entirely correct in saying that the decedent had earned no contractual expectation <em>while in office </em>that he would receive the benefit of <em>both </em>systems. In contrast to <em>Lyon, </em>in the instant case, the 1963 enactment of section 9360.9 occurred <em>during </em>petitioner\u2019s term as Treasurer, which ran from 1959 to 1967; the \u201cfluctuating\u201d system of benefit computation was also in effect during this entire period.  An employee\u2019s contractual pension expectations are measured by benefits which are in effect not only when employment commences, but which are thereafter conferred during the employee\u2019s subsequent tenure.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>Thus, in <em>Abbott </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, supra, </em>50 Cal.2d 438, the city argued that pension benefits added during 1923 had the effect of offsetting the detriments incurred by public safety employees as a result of 1925 and 1927 amendments to the city\u2019s pension plan. Rejecting this contention, we said, \u201cthe member plaintiffs and the husbands of the widow plaintiffs rendered services to the city after January of 1923 and prior to the amendments of 1925 and 1927, and therefore . . . had earned and vested rights in the retirement benefits already provided by the city charter <em>during that period of time. </em>[Citations.] It follows that advantages added prior to <em>or during </em>1923 have no bearing upon the reasonableness of the detriments resulting from the 1925 and 1927 amendments.\u201d (50 Cal.2d at p. 449, italics added.) Furthermore, \u201cThe benefits conferred under a pension system by changes which are made from time to time prior to the adoption of an amendment imposing a detriment \u2018have no bearing upon the reasonableness\u2019 of the detriment so imposed [citing <em>Abbott </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, supra]; </em>such benefits become a part of the vested rights of the employees when conferred.\u201d <em>(Abbott </em>v. <em>City of San Diego, supra, </em>165 Cal.App.2d 511, 518; see also <em>Santin </em>v. <em>Cranston </em>(1967) 250 Cal.App.2d 438, 441 [59 Cal.Rptr. 1].)</p>\n<p id=\"b897-4\">From application of the foregoing principles to the case before us we conclude that the prior version of section 9359.1 together with section 9360.9, enacted in 1963, form the basis by which petitioner\u2019s reasonable pension expectations must be measured. For four years, petitioner provided his services under a statutory scheme which <em>simultaneously </em>included both computation methods. Under these circumstances, the 1963 enactment cannot be deemed a \u201ccomparable new advantage\u201d offsetting the detriment represented by amendment of section 9359.1 in 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">We fully recognize that the effect of our holding is that petitioner thereby receives the benefit of a <em>double </em>increment of increase, a troubling result. We can only observe that the Legislature must have intended to provide such benefits to constitutional officers serving between 1963 and 1974 because it left in effect both of the formulae during that 11-year period.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">We therefore conclude that the 1974 amendment to section 9359.1 cannot constitutionally be applied to petitioner, because the amendment withdraws benefits to which he earned a vested contractual right while employed. No \u201ccomparable new advantages\u201d to petitioner appear in the plan which can offset the detriment he has suffered by replacement of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>\u201cfluctuating\u201d system of benefit computation with a \u201cfixed\u201d system. Petitioner is therefore entitled to have his basic retirement allowance computed on the basis of section 9359.1 as it read when he left office in 1967. Under the formula therein provided, petitioner\u2019s basic pension benefit is to be determined periodically on the basis of the current Treasurer\u2019s salary, now $35,000 per year.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">The result we reach herein makes it unnecessary to consider petitioner\u2019s additional contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">Let a peremptory writ of mandate issue, directing the Board to vacate and set aside its decision applying the 1974 amendments to petitioner, and to compute petitioner\u2019s basic retirement allowance from the Fund according to the formula provided in section 9359.1 as it appeared on January 2, 1967, when he left the office of Treasurer. Petitioner shall recover his costs of suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">Bird, C.
