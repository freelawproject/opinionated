The trial court found, inter alia, that in refusing to reappoint plaintiff, the trustees denied plaintiff the benefit of university rules and regulations and violated plaintiff\u2019s right to the exercise of his First Amendment rights. Holding that plaintiff had improperly been denied reappointment, the court ordered plaintiff reinstated to his teaching position and awarded him damages in the amount of lost benefits and net loss of pay from the time of the improper denial of reappointment to the date of reinstatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-10\">On appeal, defendant trustees challenge both the trial court\u2019s findings and the court\u2019s order as to reinstatement and damages. As we shall explain, however, we have concluded that the trial court\u2019s judgment was proper and should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-11\">In September 1967 plaintiff Stanley Ofsevit was appointed lecturer in the graduate department of social work education at San Francisco State University<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for the academic year 1967-1968. In February 1968 plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>one-year contract was renewed for the academic year 1968-1969. In November 1968 plaintiff was reappointed for the academic year 1969-1970 \u201cbased on the salaiy rank of Associate Professor, Class I, Step 3.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">While he was an employee of the university, plaintiff was a member of Local 1352 of the American Federation of Teachers, AFL-CIO, and, by his own account, actively participated in that organization\u2019s activities. The members of plaintiff\u2019s department were apparently deeply divided over the propriety of union representation in the university setting. In April 1969 a special committee of faculty members studying the department of social work education reported that the \u201cbreakdown of the usual interpersonal stability and communication\u201d within the department was so acute that continuance of the entire graduate training program was in jeopardy. Subsequently the department director was not reappointed, and in November 1969 Acting Dean Einhom of the school of behavioral and social sciences informed plaintiff that his \u201cpresent assignment at San Francisco State [University would] end with the close of the Spring, 1970 semester.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">The university later determined to continue the graduate program despite the program\u2019s defects, and a new director was appointed. In March 1970, with the concurrence of the new director, the department\u2019s hiring, retention and tenure committee recommended that plaintiff be reappointed. On April 7, 1970, however, the acting dean recommended to the vice president of the university that plaintiff not be retained. In May 1970 the hiring committee reaffirmed its recommendation and protested the fact that the acting dean had overridden its recommendation. The vice president of the university did not reappoint plaintiff for 1970-1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-9\">Pursuant to the \u201cInterim Grievance and Disciplinary Action Procedures\u201d in effect at the time<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> plaintiff filed a timely grievance protesting his nonreemployment. Discussions and conciliation efforts followed, but as a result of circumstances not attributable to plaintiff, a formal hearing did not take place until January 17, 1972. In February the grievance committee rendered a decision in favor of plaintiff, and \u201crespectfully and unanimously recommend[ed] that Mr. Ofsevit be reappointed by [the university] immediately.\u201d The committee concluded that no evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>supported the administration\u2019s decision to deny reappointment to plaintiff.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">On March 14, 1972, President Hayakawa rejected the grievance committee\u2019s results, indicating that, in his opinion, plaintiff\u2019s \u201cactivities and, hence, his possible contribution to polarization within the department . . . was an element which lessened his overall value to the department.\u201d President Hayakawa concluded that \u201cthere is no inherent reemployment right prior to tenured status,\u201d and that the \u201conly right that inheres in the employment situation of a probationary faculty member is that of insuring that he has been evaluated without bias or capriciousness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">Plaintiff then appealed to Glenn S. Dumke, Chancellor of the California State University and Colleges.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The chancellor advised him that the Interim Grievance Procedures would govern review of his case, except that under regulations adopted by the board of trustees on September 23, 1970, the decision of the chancellor\u2019s review panel would be advisory, rather than \u201cbinding on all parties.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">On June 12, 1972, the chancellor\u2019s review committee considered the evidence in plaintiff\u2019s case and advised the chancellor of its unanimous recommendation in support of plaintiff. The committee noted that plaintiff had suffered \u201cprofessional damage\u201d which reappointment could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>repair,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and recommended that plaintiff be reappointed at a rank consistent with his background and experience. The committee concluded its report by acknowledging its \u201cserious responsibility here, since [section 7.4 of the Interim Procedures] which was in effect at the time this grievance was filed, provides that this Committee\u2019s decision \u2018shall be binding on all parties.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">On June 16, 1972, the chancellor, purporting to exercise the authority conferred by the trustees\u2019 action of September 23, 1970, refused to accept the committee\u2019s decision, which he referred to as \u201cfindings and recommendations.\u201d He concluded that plaintiff, as a lecturer, could not invoke the procedures available to one with \u201cregular full-time probationaiy class and rank,\u201d and found \u201cno basis\u201d to agree with the recommendation that plaintiff be reemployed.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">On December 5, 1973, plaintiff filed the present suit against the trustees and chancellor of the California State University and Colleges and against the president of San Francisco State University, seeking reinstatement and damages. Plaintiff contended \u201cthat as a matter of law, the grievance procedure, which terminated in his favor, should be enforced,\u201d and \u201cthat his dismissal was in violation of the First Amendment guarantees of free speech, since ... his termination was due to his political and personal beliefs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">The trial court found, inter alia, that the trustees had denied plaintiff the \u201cbenefits of the rules and regulations in effect at San Francisco State University at the time of [plaintiff\u2019s] employment,\u201d and that the \u201ctermination of Stanley Ofsevit was an expression of official dissatisfaction with Stanley Ofsevit\u2019s political alignments as they related to the structure and organization of the Department of Social Work Education and a denial of rights guaranteed under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.\u201d The court thereafter issued a writ of mandate ordering reinstatement and payment of lost salary and benefits \u201cattributable to the period beginning with the 1970-1971 school year through and including the date of [plaintiff\u2019s] reinstatement as a Lecturer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>. . .; said salaiy being reduced by the earnings otherwise accrued by [plaintiff]. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">Defendant trustees appeal from the trial court judgment. The trustees contend that plaintiff was not entitled to the benefit of the university\u2019s grievance procedure; that there is no substantial evidence that the university\u2019s failure to reappoint plaintiff was in retaliation for plaintiff\u2019s exercise of his First Amendment rights; and that the trial court erred both in ordering plaintiff\u2019s reinstatement and in awarding plaintiff more than one year\u2019s lost salary. We turn first to the propriety of the trial court\u2019s findings with respect to the grievance procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">1.  <em>The university procedures pursuant to which plaintiff filed his grievance provided in part that the decision of the chancellor\u2019s review committee was to be binding on all parties. Because the chancellor improperly refused to adopt the recommendation of the chancellor\u2019s review committee that plaintiff be reinstated, plaintiff has wrongfully been denied reappointment.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">Plaintiff contends that at the time he filed his grievance, university regulations clearly provided that any decision by the chancellor\u2019s review committee would be final and binding on defendant trustees. The trustees argue, however, that because plaintiff had no right to file a grievance, the decision of the review committee lay beyond the committee\u2019s jurisdiction and thus did not bind the parties. The trial court in the instant case found that the chancellor\u2019s review committee was formed \u201cpursuant to rules and regulations recognized by [plaintiff] and [defendants],\u201d and that the defendants\u2019 failure to abide by the review committee\u2019s recommendation that plaintiff be reappointed \u201cdenied to [plaintiff] the benefits of the rules and regulations in effect at San Francisco State University at the time of [plaintiff\u2019s] employment.\u201d We agree with the trial court\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-8\">On April 17, 1970, pursuant to powers vested in them by statute and regulation,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> defendant trustees promulgated \u201cInterim Grievance and Disciplinary Action Procedures\u201d to apply to grievances initiated after that date. The preamble to the grievance procedures recites in part, \u201cFor all matters in which a member of the faculty or administrative staff may believe that an injustice has been done with regard to his rights and privileges, he shall have the prerogative of availing himself of the procedures set forth herein.\u201d Defendants contend that according to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>uniform university policy, a lecturer has no right to continued employment, and thus plaintiff was not entitled to pursue his alleged \u201cgrievance\u201d under the provided procedures. Nevertheless, the matter of plaintiff\u2019s procedural entitlement is not controlled by rigid categorization of \u201crights\u201d and \u201cprivileges,\u201d but by examination of all the terms and conditions of plaintiff\u2019s employment.  As the court stated in <em>American Federation of Teachers </em>v. <em>Oakland Unified School District </em>(1967) 251 Cal.App.2d 91, 97 [59 Cal.Rptr. 85], \u201cRules and regulations adopted by a board of education are, in effect, a part of a teacher\u2019s employment contract and the teacher is entitled to their enforcement.\u201d  As we shall explain, plaintiff is entitled to enforcement of the Interim Grievance Procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">Section 1.3(a) of the grievance procedures defines \u201cthe faculty\u201d to include lecturers serving on annual appointment in the university. (See Interim Grievance and Disciplinaiy Action Procedures, \u00a7 1.3(a), incorporating by reference S. F. State U. Const., May 26, 1965, \u00a7 2.) Section 2.0 provides as to the initiation of a grievance: \u201cIf any member of the faculty or administration\u2014hereafter referred to as \u2018the aggrieved\u2019\u2014believes that an injustice has been done to him in connection with his individual rights, benefits, working conditions, appointment, <em>reappointment, </em>tenure, promotion and reassignment, he may initiate a grievance procedure by submitting his request to the Chairman of the Council.\u201d (Italics added.) Thus despite the fact, as defendants contend, that plaintiff\u2019s employment was to expire without any contractual right to renew, the terms of plaintiff\u2019s employment expressly gave him the right to a review of the trustees\u2019 administrative decision as to his nonreappointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">The grievance procedures prescribed the duties of President Hayakawa with respect to the findings and recommendations of the hearing committee. As we have noted, his decision did not concur with the judgment of the hearing committee. Under section 7.1 of the procedures, however, \u201cThe decision of the President on each case is final on the campus.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">Plaintiff was thereupon remitted to his right of appeal to the chancellor. Section 7.4 of the university grievance procedures provides in pertinent part, \u201cThe aggrieved may appeal to the Chancellor after the President\u2019s decision has been reached if the President does not concur with the recommendations of the hearing committee. ... If the ag<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>grieved appeals, the Chancellor shall appoint a Chancellor\u2019s Review Committee .... This committee shall review the case and arrive at <em>a decision which shall be binding on all </em>parties. . . .\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">The trustees assert, however, that under the rules in effect at the time the matter was referred to the Chancellor\u2019s Review Committee, the decision of that committee was not binding, but only advisory and subject to the final decision of the chancellor. The trustees on September 23, 1970, did purport to authorize such a change by both a general and an emergency resolution, and on September 30, 1970, the chancellor issued an executive order so providing. (See <em>Poschman </em>v. <em>Dumke </em>(1973) 31 Cal.App.3d 932, 939-943 [107 Cal.Rptr. 596], hg. den., June 28, 1973.) While the chancellor\u2019s office acknowledged plaintiff\u2019s request for review with a reference to \u201cregulations adopted by the Board of Trustees on September 23, 1970, [under which] the Chancellor\u2019s Review Panel is now advisory to the Chancellor and his decision is now final . . . ,\u201d the findings and recommendations of the panel itself specifically referred to the panel members\u2019 responsibility in making a <em>binding </em>decision as provided in the Interim Grievance Procedures. In any event, this issue was raised in the trial court, at which point the trustees conceded that if plaintiff were entitled to the protection of the grievance procedures, those procedures in effect prior to the purported change of September 23, 1970, would govern. The trustees do not now seriously question that concession.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">We therefore affirm the trial court\u2019s finding that the trustees denied plaintiff the benefit of the university rules and regulations. Plaintiff is entitled to relief in order to enforce the binding decision of the chancellor\u2019s review committee under the university grievance procedures applicable to his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">2.  <em>The trial court\u2019s conclusion that plaintiff\u2019s reappointment was denied on the basis of his political activities and in violation of his First Amendment rights is supported by substantial evidence, and thus the court properly held the trustees\u2019 action invalid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b802-9\">The trial court\u2019s determination that plaintiff was improperly denied reappointment is further supported by the court\u2019s finding that defendants failed to reappoint plaintiff in retaliation for conduct within the protection of the First Amendment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Although defendants contend that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>substantial evidence does not support the trial court\u2019s finding, we believe that the <em>record </em>sustains the conclusion that defendants have denied plaintiff the exercise of his First Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">We have heretofore expressed our insistence, in the context of review of administrative decisions, that the courts retain the ultimate responsibility for insuring that fundamental constitutional rights not be abridged in the absence of a sufficiently compelling public interest. <em>(Bekiaris </em>v. <em>Board of Education </em>(1972) 6 Cal.3d 575, 592 [100 Cal.Rptr. 16, 493 P.2d 480].) As we have explained, \u201c[unquestionably, a broad discretion reposes in governmental agencies to determine which provisional employees they will retain. . . . Nevertheless, when the record in a given case clearly establishes that unconstitutional conditions have been imposed upon the retention of public employment, we cannot permit the deference which we would otherwise accord administrative determinations to bar us from discharging our obligation to protect overriding constitutional rights.\u201d <em>(Rosenfield </em>v. <em>Malcolm (1967) 65 </em>Cal.2d 559, 562-563 [55 Cal.Rptr. 505, 421 P.2d 697].)</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">Thus we have held that a dismissed public employee is entitled to a judicial determination of the true reason for his dismissal when he seeks to show that he was dismissed because of his exercise of constitutional rights. In reviewing such a dismissal the trial court not only examines the administrative record for errors of law, but also exercises its independent judgment upon the evidence disclosed. <em>(Bekiaris </em>v. <em>Board of Education, supra, 6 </em>Cal.3d 575, 593.) Once the trial court has resolved the constitutional issue by an independent assessment of the factual elements, the appellate court reviews the record to determine whether the trial court\u2019s findings find support in substantial evidence* *******<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> in light of the entire record. <em>(Bekiaris </em>v. <em>Board of Education, supra, 6 </em>Cal.3d at p. 592, fn. 11; <em>Bixby </em>v. <em>Pierno (1971) </em>4 Cal.3d 130, 143-144, fn. 10 [93 Cal.Rptr. 234, 481 P.2d 242].)</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>A review of the record in the present case discloses substantial evidence to support the trial court\u2019s finding that plaintiff\u2019s outspoken \u201cpolitical alignments\u201d triggered his dismissal. Initially, plaintiff presented testimony at trial that defendants dismissed him in response to his membership in and active support of Local 1352 of the American Federation of Teachers, AFL-CIO.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> While defendants\u2019 affidavits attest to defendants\u2019 ignorance of the extent of plaintiff\u2019s political activities, and describe the decision not to reappoint plaintiff as based solely on academic considerations,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the evidence indicates otherwise. Acting Dean Einhorn admitted his anticipation that plaintiff\u2019s nonreappointment \u201cwould be\u2014likely be taken as discriminatory because of [plaintiff\u2019s] union membership.\u201d The vice president for academic affairs, whose final decision not to reappoint plaintiff gave rise to plaintiff\u2019s grievance, acknowledged \u201cthe fact that the Department of Social Work Education was suffering from considerable strife and was in a state of disarray,\u201d and explained his \u201cfeeling that [plaintiff] was one of those persons contributing to the problems of interpersonal relationship that were hindering the efficient functioning of the Department.\u201d President Hayakawa himself cited plaintiff\u2019s \u201cactivities and, hence, his possible contribution to polarization within the department\u201d as a basis for dismissing plaintiff. Finally, plaintiff presented evidence that several of his colleagues had circulated a letter falsely accusing him of \u201cmilitant pro-union[ism]\u201d; the chancellor\u2019s review committee found that this letter, \u201cwith its unsubstantiated comments,\u201d had affected plaintiff\u2019s nonreappointment and had caused him \u201cprofessional damage.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">On the basis of this record, the trial court appropriately exercised its independent judgment to find that the decision not to reemploy plaintiff turned on considerations of plaintiff\u2019s political activities, rather than on academic and professional reasons. Consequently, we uphold the trial court\u2019s decision that plaintiff\u2019s nonreappointment violated plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">3.  <em>In light of our holding that the trustees violated plaintiff\u2019s First Amendment rights by denying him reappointment, plaintiff is entitled to immediate reinstatement and to payment of damages in the amount of lost benefits and net loss of salary from the date of the improper denial of reappointment, to the date of his reinstatement.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">The trial court in the instant case held that plaintiff was \u201centitled to the issuance of a Peremptory Writ of Mandate directing that he be reinstated and made whole for all lost wages and benefits from the 1970-1971 school year through and including the date of his reinstatement as a lecturer at San Francisco State University.\u201d The trustees dispute plaintiff\u2019s right to reinstatement, and contend further that in any event the trial court erred in awarding plaintiff more than one year\u2019s salary. As we explain, however, we believe that under the circumstances of this case both the order of reinstatement and the back pay award were proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">The trustees argue initially that because plaintiff was a lecturer who worked under an annual contract, plaintiff had no expectation of continued employment beyond the one-year period ending at the close of the 1970-1971 school year. Since the one-year period of his contract has long since expired, the trustees contend that plaintiff is not presently entitled to reinstatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-9\">The trustees, however, may not defeat plaintiff\u2019s claim to reinstatement by invoking the fact that plaintiff cannot assert either \u201ctenure\u201d or a statutoiy right of reemployment. As the United States Supreme Court has made clear, even a temporary employee who has no reasonable expectation of continued employment, who \u201ccould [be] discharged for no reason whatever, . . . may nonetheless establish a claim to reinstatement if the decision not to rehire him was made by reason of his exercise of constitutionally protected First Amendment freedoms. <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Sindermann, </em>408 U.S. 593 (1972).\u201d <em>(Mt. Healthy City Board of Ed. </em>v. <em>Doyle </em>(1977) 429 U.S. 274, 283-284 [50 L.Ed.2d 471, 481, 97 S.Ct. 568].) In the present case, of course, we have upheld the trial court\u2019s finding that defendants rendered their decision not to reappoint plaintiff because of plaintiff\u2019s exercise of constitutionally protected First Amendment rights, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>and thus it follows that the trial court properly ordered plain tiff\u2019s reinstatement.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">Similarly, the applicable authorities fully support the trial court\u2019s back pay award. Although the trustees contend that in light of his one-year contract plaintiff enjoyed no reasonable expectation of reemployment beyond the 1970-1971 academic year and consequently should receive only one year\u2019s salary in back pay, the relevant constitutional decisions are to the contrary. Those decisions establish that both tenured and nontenured teachers who have been discharged in violation of their First Amendment rights are entitled to full back pay from the time of their unconstitutional dismissal to the date of their reinstatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">In <em>Gieringer </em>v. <em>Center School District No. 58 </em>(8th Cir. 1973) <em>477 </em>F.2d 1164, cert. den., 414 U.S. 832 [38 L.Ed.2d 66, 94 S.Ct. 165], for example, the school board employed John Gieringer for the 1969-1970 school year as a nontenured elementary school teacher. In October 1969 Gieringer delivered an impromptu report at a meeting of the teachers association concerning the ability of the school district to raise teachers\u2019 salaries. Gieringer\u2019s superintendent received word of Gieringer\u2019s critical report and subsequently recommended that Gieringer\u2019s contract not be renewed. In March 1970 the school board voted unanimously to adopt the superintendent\u2019s recommendation, and declined to renew Gieringer\u2019s contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-7\">When Gieringer sought reinstatement and compensatory damages for the alleged infringement of his constitutional rights, the court of appeals held that his report related to a matter of public concern, and was protected within the boundaries of the First Amendment. Because Gieringer was dismissed for a constitutionally impermissible reason, the court ordered Gieringer reinstated, and awarded him loss of back pay to the date of his reinstatement, subject to mitigation by his earnings since his dismissal. (477 F.2d at p. 1167.) The courts in <em>Stolberg </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees for State Col. of Conn. </em>(2d Cir. 1973) 474 F.2d 485 and <em>Johnson </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number><em>Butler </em>(W.D.Va. 1977) 433 F.Supp. 531 ruled likewise that nontenured teachers dismissed in violation of their First Amendment rights were entitled to reinstatement and back pay from the time of the unlawful termination of their contracts until the date of their reinstatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">Because the trial court in the instant case found that defendants had terminated plaintiif\u2019s contract in retaliation for plaintiff\u2019s exercise of his First Amendment rights, the trial court properly granted plaintiff a back pay award as comprehensive as that granted to teachers Gieringer, Stolberg, and Johnson.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In the instant case, this full back pay award will serve not only to make plaintiff whole, but also to discourage similar unconstitutional dismissals in the future.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>Thus we cannot conclude that plaintiff\u2019s eight-year struggle for vindication should yield him reappointment with only one year\u2019s back pay. Such a \u201cvictory\u201d would be Pyrrhic indeed. His reemployment is for a coming single one-year entitlement; for further employment he must prove his competence in accordance with lawful university procedures. His loss of earnings, however, encompasses seven years, and upon a proper showing he should recover the whole appropriate damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">Bird, C.

The right of reinstatement in no way precludes defendants from inquiring into plaintiff\u2019s present professional qualifications or performance or from ordering his dismissal if it is properly determined that there are grounds to justify his discharge. (Cf. <em>Monroe </em>v. <em>Trustees </em>(1971) 6 Cal.3d 399, 412 [99 Cal.Rptr. 129, 491 P.2d 1105].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b807-6\">We note that a plethora of statutory provisions both in California and elsewhere demonstrates a general policy in favor of full back pay awards even in the absence of constitutional violations. Thus, for example, under the National Labor Relations Act, even an at-will employee who is improperly dismissed is entitled to an award of full back pay from the date of the improper dismissal to the date of his reinstatement. (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(c).) As the United States Supreme Court explained in <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Rutter-Rex Mfg. Co. </em>(1969) 396 U.S. 258, 263 [24 L.Ed.2d 405, 410, 90 S.Ct. 417]; \u201c[T]he purpose of the remedy is clear. \u2018A back pay order <em>is </em>a reparation order designed to vindicate the public policy of the statute by making the employees whole for losses suffered on account of an unfair labor practice.\u2019 [Citation omitted.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">Numerous California statutes in the Education Code and in other areas provide for similarly comprehensive back pay remedies. Thus, for example, section 89540, former section 24310, of the Education Code provides that with respect to both tenured permanent teachers and untenured probationary teachers, \u201c[i]f the dismissal, suspension, or demotion ... [of the teacher for cause] is revoked or modified ... the employee shall be restored to his position in accord with the decision, and shall be paid back salary <em>equal to that which the employee would have earned if continuously employed in accord with the decision.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)

Code, \u00a7\u00a7 13439, 13516.5, now \u00a7\u00a7 44946, 45037 (certificated employee of school district); \u00a7\u00a7 13408, 13409, 13411, now \u00a7\u00a7 87735, 87736, 87738 (regular and certificated employees of community college district); Gov.

Both cases are distinguishable from the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-9\">In <em>Zimmerer, </em>the court found a nontenured teacher\u2019s dismissal improper only because of the defendants\u2019 failure to provide the teacher with a hearing to which she was entitled. Finding \u201cthat the [defendant] Board\u2019s reasons for its actions were valid, and . . . that the controversy was intractable and recognized by the parties to be such,\u201d the court concluded that \u201cas a practical consequence . . . the most Dr. Zimmerer lost was one year\u2019s pay.\u201d (485 F.2d 176, 179.) In the instant case, by contrast, the record does not in any way reveal that plaintiff\u2019s performance would inevitably have led to his termination after one additional year of teaching.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-10\">The <em>Frost </em>decision is also distinguishable from the present case. In <em>Frost </em>the court upheld the chancellor\u2019s decision to reinstate a probationary academic employee, but to deny him back salary. The claim in <em>Frost </em>for payment of back salary, however, was not based on an alleged violation of constitutional rights, as in the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
