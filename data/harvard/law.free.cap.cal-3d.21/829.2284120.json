Defendant had originally intended to call the expert as a witness at trial, and hence, under the relevant statute and case law, the expert\u2019s report would normally have been discoverable by plaintiff. In return for a codefendant\u2019s promise of indemnification, however, the defendant who employed the expert subsequently withdrew him as a witness,  This case therefore presents the question whether the withdrawal of the expert witness on the basis of such an indemnification agreement reestablishes the privilege against disclosure enjoyed by defendant or leaves the plaintiff free to discover the content of the report. Although the trial court denied plaintiff access to the report, we have concluded that under the circumstances of this case plaintiff is entitled to discover the contents of the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">In September 1971, plaintiff George Williamson filed suit against defendants Shell Oil Company (Shell), Firestone Tire and Rubber Company (Firestone), and Big Four Automotive Equipment Corporation (Big Four), seeking damages for personal injuries which he sustained in Shell\u2019s employ while using a tire-changing machine manufactured by Big Four to install a Firestone tire. Plaintiff alleged defects in both the tire and the tire-changing machine.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">During the course of discovery proceedings, Big Four employed O. Edward Kurt to investigate the accident and to submit a report. Following his investigation, Kurt submitted a report which stated that in his opinion the cause of the accident was Firestone\u2019s defective tire, and not any defect in the Big Four machine. After receiving this report, which, of course, was quite favorable to its case, Big Four designated Kurt as an expert witness to testify at trial. Plaintiff arranged to take Kurt\u2019s deposition and thereby to learn the results of Kurt\u2019s investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">Plaintiff, however, never learned the results of the investigation. On the eve of Kurt\u2019s scheduled deposition, and following a meeting with Firestone\u2019s counsel, Big Four withdrew Kurt\u2019s designation as expert witness. Plaintiff states without contradiction that at the meeting between defendants\u2019 counsel, Big Four discussed Kurt\u2019s findings with Firestone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>and turned over copies of Kurt\u2019s report to Firestone.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After examining the report, Firestone\u2019s counsel, who naturally preferred the nondisclosure of Kurt\u2019s adverse findings, entered into an agreement with Big Four which provided that if Big Four withdrew Kurt as a witness, withheld his report from plaintiff\u2019s counsel, and refused to permit plaintiffs counsel to depose him, Firestone would indemnify Big Four against any liability Big Four might incur arising from plaintiff\u2019s injuries. In other words, Big Four agreed to silence its expert and withhold the information contained in his report from plaintiff in return for valuable consideration\u2014indemnification\u2014from Firestone.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-4\">Big Four thereafter complied with its promise to Firestone, withdrawing Kurt as a prospective witness and rebuffing plaintiff\u2019s attempt to depose Kurt or to obtain a copy of Kurt\u2019s report. Plaintiff sought an order of the trial court to compel Kurt\u2019s deposition and production of his report. Although the trial court authorized the deposition, it substantially limited the areas of plaintiff\u2019s inquiry, precluding plaintiff from discovering the results of Kurt\u2019s investigation and his analysis of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">Plaintiff then filed a petition for writ of mandate in the Court of Appeal, seeking relief from the trial court\u2019s order. Although recognizing that extraordinary writs should not issue routinely in discovery cases, the Court of Appeal concluded that because the case presented \u201c. . . questions of first impression that are of general importance to the trial courts and to the profession . . .\u201d <em>(Oceanside Union School Dist. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1962) 58 Cal.2d 180, 185-186, fn. 4 [23 Cal.Rptr. 375, 373 P.2d 439]; see also <em>Pacific Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 161, 169-171 [84 Cal.Rptr. 718, 465 P.2d 854]), an alternative writ should issue. After a hearing, the Court of Appeal ultimately determined that a peremptory writ of mandate should issue; we granted a hearing in order to resolve the novel issue of work product doctrine which this case presents.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">Code of Civil Procedure section 2016, subdivision (b) provides in pertinent part, \u201cThe work product of an attorney shall not be discoverable unless the court determines that denial of discovery will unfairly prejudice the party seeking discovery in preparing his claim or defense or will result in an injustice, and any writing that reflects an attorney\u2019s impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal research or theories shall not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>be discoverable under any circumstances.\u201d Accordingly, subdivision (b) affords a conditional or qualified protection for work product generally, and an absolute protection as to an attorney\u2019s impressions and conclusions. As subdivision (g) of the same section explains, \u201cIt is the policy of this state (i) to preserve the rights of attorneys to prepare cases for trial with that degree of privacy necessary to encourage them to prepare their cases thoroughly and to investigate not only the favorable but the unfavorable aspects of such cases and (ii) to prevent an attorney from taking undue advantage of his adversary\u2019s industry or efforts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">Section 2016 contains no definition of work product beyond extending protection to \u201c. . . any writing that reflects an attorney\u2019s impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal research or theories . . . .\u201d the cases indicate generally, however, that \u201cmaterial of a derivative character, such as diagrams prepared for trial, audit reports, appraisals, and <em>other expert opinions, developed as a result of the initiative of counsel in preparing for trial,\u201d </em>are also to be protected as work product. (Italics added.) <em>(Mack </em>v. <em>Superior Court (1968) </em>259 Cal.App.2d 7, 10 [66 Cal.Rptr. 280]; accord, <em>Southern Pacific Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1969) 3 Cal.App.3d 195, 198-199 [83 Cal.Rptr. 231].) In <em>San Diego Professional Assn. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1962) 58 Cal.2d 194, 204-205 [23 Cal.Rptr. 384, 373 P.2d 448, 97 A.L.R.2d 761], for example, we held that expert engineers\u2019 \u201cevaluation and opinions\u201d commissioned by an attorney for the purpose of preparing for trial was work product. \u201cWhatever the extent of the concept of an attorney\u2019s work product may be, it is clear that. . . it is . . . the attorney\u2019s work, or that of his agents or employees, that is involved . . . .\u201d (Italics omitted.) <em>(Wilson </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 715, 724 [38 Cal.Rptr. 255] [hg. den., May 27, 1964].)  Thus as an expert opinion, developed as a result of the initiative of counsel in preparing for trial, Kurt\u2019s report clearly constitutes the work product of Big Four\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">The issue before us, however, is whether Kurt\u2019s report, as work product of Big Four\u2019s counsel, should be protected against disclosure under section 2016.  While it may be appropriate to give broad immunity from discovery to an expert <em>consultant\u2019s </em>report developed at the initiative of counsel in preparation for trial, the courts agree that the initial status of the expert as consultant changes once the expert becomes a designated prospective witness. As the court stated in <em>Swartzman </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1964) 231 Cal.App.2d 195, 203 [41 Cal.Rptr. 721], hg. den., Feb. 10, 1965, \u201c[w]hen it becomes reasonably certain an expert will give his professional opinion as a witness on a material matter in dispute, then his opinion has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>become a factor in the cause. At that point the expert has ceased to be merely a consultant and has become a counter in the litigation, one to be evaluated along with others. Such evaluation properly includes appropriate pretrial discovery.\u201d (See also <em>Mize </em>v. <em>Atchinson, T &amp; S. F. Ry. Co. </em>(1975) 46 Cal.App.3d 436, 449 [120 Cal.Rptr. 787]; <em>Bolles </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1971) 15 Cal.App.3d 962, 963 [93 Cal.Rptr. 719]; <em>Dow Chemical Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1969) 2 Cal.App.3d 1, 10 [82 Cal.Rptr. 288]; <em>Scotsman Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1966) 242 Cal.App.2d 527, 530-532 [51 Cal.Rptr. 511].) While good cause normally must be shown to compel discovery of expert opinions in advance of trial, good cause includes a showing that the expert may be called as a witness. (See <em>Sanders </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1973) 34 Cal.App.3d 270, 279 [109 Cal.Rptr. 770].)</p>\n<p id=\"b865-4\">In the present case, the expert consultant did not long retain his initial status as advisor, for after learning the favorable nature of Kurt\u2019s report, Big Four designated Kurt as an expert witness to testify at trial. Indisputedly at this point plaintiff was entitled to discover Kurt\u2019s report; if Big Four had used Kurt\u2019s testimony at trial, the report would surely have remained discoverable. Before Kurt\u2019s scheduled deposition took place, however, Big Four withdrew Kurt\u2019s designation as a witness. Big Four argues that its withdrawal of Kurt as witness restored the immunity from discovery which Kurt\u2019s report originally enjoyed. As Big Four contends, an attorney acting in the best interest of his client must be free to make whatever use of an expert\u2019s opinion will be most likely to insure a good result for the client at trial; thus an attorney may properly decide not to call as a witness even an expert whose opinion is favorable to the client, if, in the attorney\u2019s judgment, the client\u2019s interests will otherwise be better served.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">While a party may, indeed, enjoy the right to withdraw an expert witness at any time prior to disclosure of that witness\u2019 proposed testimony,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the record in the present case demonstrates that Big Four did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>not decide unilaterally to withdraw Kurt as a matter of trial tactics or personal litigation strategy. Big Four\u2019s decision stemmed rather from the agreement with Firestone: Firestone offered to pay Big Four to withdraw Kurt, in order to eliminate Kurt\u2019s potentially damaging testimony from the trial. Thus it was under Firestone\u2019s influence and in response to an offer of payment of indemnification that Big Four secured Kurt\u2019s withdrawal.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">We do not accept defendants\u2019 argument that their action merely represents the sharing of information between two nonadversaiy codefendants, and therefore constitutes proper cooperation between parties sharing a common interest. The court in <em>Gorman Rupp Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1971) 20 Cal.App.3d 28, 31 [97 Cal.Rptr. 377], explained that the fact that two parties are both defendants in no sense assures that they are not adversaries: \u201cEach codefendant seeks to disclaim any responsibility for the alleged injuries, and argues that if there is responsibility for the alleged injuries it is due to the failure of the other. Certainly, there exists that relationship which suggests a conflict of interest. Petitioner [codefendant] has a vital interest in not relying solely on its lack of negligence or other avoidance of liability. Petitioner seeks to meet plaintiff\u2019s claim by showing the liability, if any, is that of another defendant. This clearly falls within the [rule] that an \u2018adverse\u2019 party includes one who may likely strive to win a point at issue at the expense of the other.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">With respect to the issue toward which the Kurt report was directed\u2014defects in Firestone\u2019s tire\u2014the interests of Big Four and Firestone unquestionably conflicted. Big Four\u2019s interest lay in finding no negligence on its own part and in discovering a defect responsible for the accident in someone else\u2019s product\u2014here, Firestone\u2019s. On the other hand, Firestone\u2019s interest lay in finding <em>no </em>defect in its product. Because Kurt was about to testify in favor of Big Four and against Firestone, only Firestone\u2019s offer of indemnification could have induced Big Four not to call its favorable witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">Moreover, the agreement between Big Four and Firestone is not as benign as \u201cnormal cooperative action\u201d between codefendants bound by a common interest. Agreements to suppress evidence have long been held void as against public policy, both in California and in most common law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>jurisdictions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (See <em>Valentine </em>v. <em>Stewart </em>(1860) 15 Cal. 387, 404, in which this court invalidated a contract to withdraw depositions taken in connection with litigation, as \u201caffected with a fatal taint of illegality\u201d; Rest., Contracts, \u00a7 554; 6A Corbin, Contracts, \u00a7 1430, at p. 380: \u201cA bargain for the concealment or suppression of . . . evidence is of course illegal.\u201d) The agreement at issue in the present case is clearly of such a nature. In return for Firestone\u2019s promise to pay consideration, Big Four has agreed to suppress highly relevant evidence which, if revealed at trial, would be harmful to Firestone. Defendants do not nullify the agreement\u2019s insidious effect by attaching to it the seemingly innocuous label of \u201ccontract of indemnification.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b867-4\">The court in <em>Petterson </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1974) 39 Cal.App.3d 267 [114 Cal.Rptr. 20], anticipating the potential for encouraging just such illegal bargains, declared unequivocally that discovery should be allowed in order to deter similar suppression of evidence. In <em>Petterson, </em>counsel for one claimant under a holographic will disclosed to the executor the opinion of a handwriting expert that the will was a forgery. Subsequently, when the executor\u2019s attorney sought to depose the expert, counsel for another claimant under the holographic will objected on the ground that he had hired the expert as a consultant, and did not propose to call him as a witness at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">The court rejected the assertion of work product privilege, and held that the privilege was waived with respect to the handwriting expert\u2019s opinion by virtue of the disclosure of the expert\u2019s observations and conclusions by the first heir\u2019s attorney to the executor\u2019s attorney.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In the course of its analysis, the court stated, \u201cIf we were to declare that petitioners now may prevent real parties from taking [the expert\u2019s] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>deposition, we would be setting a precedent which eventually could lead to subtle but deliberate attempts to suppress relevant evidence. The rule predicated on fairness articulated in the decisions is a shield to prevent a litigant from taking undue advantage of his adversary\u2019s industry and effort, not a sword to be used to thwart justice or to defeat the salut[a]iy objects of the Discovery Act.\u201d (39 Cal.App.3d at p. 273.)</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">The <em>Petterson </em>court\u2019s reasoning is instructive: although the work product rules are designed explicitly to protect a party\u2019s expense and industry in seeking out expert testimony,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> no policy underlying the work product doctrine justifies defendants\u2019 conduct in the present case. If we were to hold otherwise, nothing would preclude a party in a multi-party case from in effect auctioning off a witness\u2019 testimony to the highest bidder. Although the present record does not disclose whether Big Four offered to retain Kurt as a witness if plaintiff bid more for his testimony than Firestone, we point out that in the absence of compelled disclosure such competitive bidding would remain a grim possibility. One of the principal purposes of discovery is to \u201c \u2018make a trial less a game of blindman\u2019s buff and more a fair contest with the basic issues and facts disclosed to the fullest practicable extent.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Greyhound </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1961) 56 Cal.2d 355, 376 [15 Cal.Rptr. 90, 364 P.2d 266].) We will not sanction the \u201cgamesmanship\u201d involved in the suppression of evidence by permitting Big Four to withhold an expert report which would have been discoverable but for the payment of consideration by one of the parties to this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">The agreement between Firestone and Big Four clearly indicates the very real potential for \u201csubtle but deliberate attempts to suppress relevant evidence.\u201d The inevitable effect of the trial court\u2019s order would be to condone defendants\u2019 concealment of evidence, in direct contravention of this court\u2019s insistence that neither party to such an agreement should receive the aid of a court in effectuating such an illegal scheme. (See <em>Tappan </em>v. <em>Albany Brewing Co. </em>(1889) 80 Cal. 570, 572 [22 P. 257].) This court cannot place its imprimatur upon planned stratagems of purchased suppression of evidence. Because Big Four\u2019s withdrawal of Kurt directly flows from the illegal agreement to repress evidence, surely under section 2016, subdivision (b) \u201cdenial of discovery . . . [would] result in an injustice.\u201d We therefore must order full disclosure of Kurt\u2019s report to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>prevent Big Four and Firestone from reaping any untoward benefit from their attempted illegal agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-4\">Let a peremptory writ of mandate issue as prayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">Bird, C. J., Mosk, J., and Manuel, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b863-7\">The inadequacy of the record prevents our consideration of the effect of any alleged disclosure between Big Four and plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b865-6\">Compare Evidence Code section 413: \u201cIn determining what inferences to draw from the evidence or facts in the case against a party, the trier of fact may consider, among other things, the party\u2019s failure to explain or to deny by his testimony such evidence or facts in the case against him, or his willful suppression of evidence relating thereto, if such be the case.\u201d As the court held in <em>Breland </em>v. <em>Traylor Engineering &amp; Mfg. Co. </em>(1942) 52 Cal.App.2d 415, 426 [126 P.2d 455], \u201cThe rule of [present Evidence Code section 413]. . . is predicated on common sense, and public policy. The purpose of a trial is to arrive at the true facts. A trial is not a game where one counsel safely may sit back and refuse to produce evidence where in the nature of things his client is the only source from which that evidence may be secured. <em>A defendant is not under a duty to produce testimony adverse to himself, but if he fails to produce evidence that would naturally have been produced he </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number><em>must take the risk that the trier of fact will infer, and properly so, that the evidence, had it been produced, would have been adverse.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b867-6\">Compare Penal Code section 136, subdivision (a): \u201cEvery person who willfully and unlawfully prevents or dissuades any person who is or may become a witness, from attending upon any trial, proceeding, or inquiry, authorized by law, is guilty of a misdemeanor\u201d; and section 136'/2: \u201cEvery person who gives or offers or promises to give to any witness or person about to be called as a witness, any bribe upon any understanding or agreement that such person shall not attend upon any trial or other judicial proceeding, or every person who attempts by means of any offer of a bribe to dissuade any such person from attending upon any trial or other judicial proceeding, is guilty of a felony.\u201d Although Firestone dealt exclusively with Big Four in attempting to silence Kurt, the effect of Firestone\u2019s agreement with Big Four is certainly analogous to an agreement directly with Kurt that Kurt \u201cnot attend upon . . . trial.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b867-7\">In the present case we do not reach plaintiff\u2019s argument that Big Four waived any work product privilege through disclosure to Firestone.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b868-6\">Contrary to defendants\u2019 suggestion, our decision does not in any way prevent plaintiffs or defendants from arranging in advance jointly to engage and consult a single expert, to promote economy of litigation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b869-6\">RICHARDSON, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AsF\">I respectfully dissent. As the majority opinion explains, it is well established that work product protection must be afforded to an experts\u2019 reports and communications to an attorney employing him in preparation for trial at least until the expert has been designated as an actual trial witness. (See <em>Mize </em>v. <em>Atchison, T. &amp; S. F. Ry. Co. </em>(1975) 46 Cal.App.3d 436, 449 [120 Cal.Rptr. 787]; <em>Petterson </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1974) 39 Cal.App.3d 267, 271-272 [114 Cal.Rptr. 20]; <em>Sanders </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1973) 34 Cal.App.3d 270, 278-279 [109 Cal.Rptr. 770]; <em>Bolles </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1971) 15 Cal.App.3d 962, 963 [93 Cal.Rptr. 719]; <em>Dow Chemical Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1969) 2 Cal.App.3d 1, 9-10 [82 Cal.Rptr. 288]; <em>Mack </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1968) 259 Cal.App.2d 7, 10-11 [66 Cal.Rptr. 280]; <em>Scotsman Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1966) 242 Cal.App.2d 527, 529-532 [51 Cal.Rptr. 511]; <em>Swartzman </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1964) 231 Cal.App.2d 195, 202-203 [41 Cal.Rptr. 721].)</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">Under the foregoing rule, the Kurt report would have been protected from discovery by reason of Big Four\u2019s announcement, prior to Kurt\u2019s scheduled deposition, that Kurt would not be called to testify. The majority holds, however, that Big Four forfeited its work product protection because it agreed with Firestone to withdraw Kurt as a trial witness in return for Firestone\u2019s promise of indemnification. The majority questions the legality of an agreement whereby one party \u201csells\u201d his silence to another regarding potentially relevant evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-8\">It does appear to be the general rule that \u201cA bargain that has for its object or consideration the suppression of evidence ... is illegal.\u201d (Rest., Contracts, \u00a7 554; see 6A Corbin, Contracts, \u00a7 1430, at p. 380; see also <em>Tappan </em>v. <em>Albany Brewing Co. </em>(1889) 80 Cal. 570 [22 P. 257].) It is not as clear, however, that actual \u201csuppression\u201d of evidence is involved here. The work product rules, by very definition, in effect sanction a \u201csuppression\u201d of an expert\u2019s report unless and until the decision is made to call the expert as a trial witness. Furthermore, assuming that the alleged agreement between Big Four and Firestone was illegal and unenforceable <em>as between those parties, </em>and that appropriate sanction might have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>imposed, no compelling reason exists for our holding that the making of such an agreement resulted in a waiver by Big Four of its work product protection <em>vis-a-vis the plaintiff. </em>Certainly, no such waiver was intended by Big Four who, having engaged Kurt, should retain the right to decide <em>for itself </em>whether or not to call him as a witness. The record discloses that at the present time he will not be called. Accordingly, under the authorities cited above, the Kurt report remains <em>conditionally </em>protected from disclosure to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">Under section 2016, subdivision (b), the Kurt report would be discoverable upon a showing of prejudice or injustice. Yet the trial court herein declined to enter such a finding of prejudice or injustice, possibly reflecting the fact that plaintiff had hired his own experts to investigate the accident. The underlying evidence, upon which Kurt\u2019s expert conclusions were reached, presumably is fully accessible to plaintiff\u2019s experts; at least it is not alleged that this evidence is not so available. If, in fact, Firestone\u2019s tire was defective and caused or contributed to the accident, no reason whatever appears in the record why plaintiff\u2019s experts cannot reach the same conclusion as a result of their independent efforts.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">Subdivision (g) of section 2016 announces a policy of this state to prevent an attorney from taking undue advantage of his adversaiy\u2019s efforts, as well as to protect his adversary\u2019s privacy which, it must always be borne in mind, is for the overriding protection of the lawyer\u2019s client. \u201cUnder such a policy a party cannot substitute the wits of his adversaiy\u2019s expert for wits of his own in analyzing the case.
