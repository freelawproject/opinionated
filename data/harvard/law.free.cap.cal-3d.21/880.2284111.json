We affirm dismissal of the complaint against the individual defendants, but reverse the summary judgment granted to defendant County of Sacramento (County).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-9\">The individual defendants are two police officers who, while acting within the scope of their employment, were driving separate police vehicles in high speed pursuit of a suspected felon. Deputy Boyd had been alerted by radio that a bank robbery had occurred and that the armed suspect was believed to be driving in his vicinity. Deputy Erwin joined the pursuit in response to an assistance request.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-10\">Both patrol cars hit a vehicle in the intersection of the Power Inn and Elder Creek Roads, and Deputy Boyd\u2019s car careened into plaintiffs\u2019 pickup truck which was in the left turn lane adjacent to the northbound lanes of Power Inn Road. Estimates of the speeds of the cars involved in the chase indicated the suspect\u2019s automobile was traveling at 80-90 miles per hour when it approached the intersection. Deputy Erwin later stated that he was uncertain of the speed of his own patrol car, but doubted that it exceeded 80 miles per hour. Deputy Boyd thought he was going 90 miles per hour at his highest rate of speed during the pursuit. Both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>officers had previously been involved in high-speed vehicle chases without incident and both had received formal training in emergency driving techniques.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-4\">Before discovery was completed, defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment were granted on the grounds that the officers were immunized from liability as public employees acting in the line of duty, and that the County was therefore derivatively immune.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">Section 17004 of the Vehicle Code provides: \u201cA public employee is not liable for civil damages on account of personal injury to . . . any person or damage to property resulting from the operation, in the line of duty, of an authorized emergency vehicle while responding to an emergency call <em>or when in the immediate pursuit of an actual or suspected violator of the law, </em>. . .\u201d (Italics added.) Since at the time of the accident, Deputies Boyd and Erwin were in their patrol cars<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in active pursuit of a suspected bank robber, under this section of the Vehicle Code they were immunized from liability, and the complaint was properly dismissed against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">Defendant County argues that since the individual defendants were immune, being peace officers lawfully pursuing a suspect, it cannot be liable because Government Code section 815.2, subdivision (b), provides derivative immunity for the public entity employer of an immune employee. Defendant County\u2019s assertion of nonliability is in error. Government Code section 815.2, subdivision (b), states: <em>\u201cExcept as otherwise provided by statute, </em>a public entity is not liable for an injury resulting from an act or omission of an employee of the public entity where the employee is immune from liability.\u201d (Italics added.) The question, therefore, is whether liability is \u201cotherwise provided by statute.\u201d It must be answered in the affirmative. Vehicle Code section 17001 makes a public entity liable for its employee\u2019s negligence in the operation of a motor vehicle. That section provides: \u201cA public entity is liable for death or injury to person or property proximately caused by a negligent or wrongful act or omission in the operation of any motor vehicle by an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>employee of the public entity acting within the scope of his employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">The Law Revision Commission comments to sections 17001 and 17004 indicate that these sections in article 1 of chapter 1 of the Civil Liability Division of the Vehicle Code, are in their present alignment as a result of the commission\u2019s recommendations made while that body was studying government tort liability. (See Cal. Law Revision Com. coms. to Veh. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 17001 to 17004, 66A West's Ann. Veh. Code (1971 ed.) pp. 91, 101, 103; Deering's Ann. Veh. Code (1972 ed.) pp. 137, 147, 148.) Unquestionably, the Legislature understood the interrelationship between the liability of the public entity contained in section 17001, and the exemption of the employee from liability contained in section 17004, when it drafted Government Code section 815.2. (Cf. <em>Hohreiter </em>v. <em>Garrison </em>(1947) 81 Cal.App.2d 384, 397 [184 P.2d 323].)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">Indeed, 20 years prior to the enactment of section 815.2 in the Tort Claims Act, this court noted in <em>Raynor </em>v. <em>City of Arcata </em>(1938) 11 Cal.2d 113, 118-120 [77 P.2d 1054], that the predecessors to sections 17001 and 17004 were signed into law on the same day, and were to be read together with each provision to be given full effect. We held therein that Vehicle Code section 400 (later \u00a7 17001) imposed liability upon a public employer even though under Vehicle Code section 401 (later \u00a7 17004) the public employee might be immune. <em>(Id., </em>p. 118-119.) It was further observed that \u201c. . . in the situation before us the exemption of the employee does not rest on an adjudication of his [the employee\u2019s] freedom from negligence, but on the statutory declaration that he should be free from personal liability for his negligent acts.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>p. 121.) These precursor statutes also have been treated as consents to sue as well as the basis for the establishment of liability. <em>(Brindamour </em>v. <em>Murray </em>(1936) 7 Cal.2d 73, 78 [59 P.2d 1009].)</p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">Government Code section 815.2 was adopted in this statutory and decision context and was enacted at the same time as Government Code section 815. (Stats. 1963, ch. 1681, \u00a7 1, p. 3268.) The Senate Judiciary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>Committee in the note to section 815 commented: . .In the following [portion] of this division there are many sections [e.g., \u00a7\u00a7 815.5-815.6.] providing for the liability of governmental entities under specified conditions. In other codes there are a few provisions providing for the liability of governmental entities, e.g., Vehicle Code section 17001, et seq. . . .\u201d (2 Sen. J. (1963 Reg. Sess.) pp. 1886-1887.) Although section 815.2 is generally an exemption provision, the same committee did state, in its comment to the section, that: \u201cThe exception appears in subdivision (b) because under certain circumstances it appears to be desirable to provide by statute that a public entity is liable even when the employee is immune. . . .\u201d (2 Sen. J. (1963 Reg. Sess.) pp. 1887-1888.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, the Legislature extended governmental liability while it sustained employee immunity.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">We conclude, therefore, that section 17004 defined only a limited immunity, i.e., an employee immunity, and that section 17001 \u201cotherwise\u201d provides for public entity liability. Vehicle Code section 17001, therefore, is cognizable under the exception of section 815.2, subdivision (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">On this showing, the County is not immunized simply because Deputies Erwin and Boyd were immune. Vehicle Code section 17001 provided for entity liability and the trial court erred in granting the County summary judgment on the grounds of statutory immunity. In so ruling, it failed to consider whether Deputies Boyd and Erwin were negligent so as to create liability on the part of the county. Had the court properly applied the law, it would have assessed whether there were triable issues of fact and may have ultimately denied the County summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-7\">Although it is clear on the record before us that the deputies were lawfully engaged in \u201c. . . the immediate pursuit of a suspected [law] violator, . . .\u201d plaintiffs claim correctly that the law does not permit the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>police to drive with impunity from the moment they activate their sirens and flashing lights. <em>(Peerless Laundry Serv. </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1952) 109 Cal.App.2d 703, 707 [241 P.2d 269].) Section 21055 of the Vehicle Code sets out a minimum standard of due care when it states that the drivers of authorized emergency vehicles are exempt if \u201c. . . the vehicle sounds a siren . . . and . . . displays a lighted red lamp ... as a warning to other drivers. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> *7Vehicle Code section 21056, however, provides that \u201cSection 21055 does not relieve the driver of a vehicle from the duty to drive with due regard for the safety of all persons using the highway . . . .\u201d Accordingly, section 17004 relieves Deputies Boyd and Erwin of liability since they were in immediate pursuit with the sirens and flashers on so as to satisfy section 21055. Yet for the County to avoid liability, Boyd and Erwin must have acted with due care as required by section 21056.  The cases defining this standard state that an exempt driver must observe that degree of care imposed by common law to immunize his public entity employer from liability under Vehicle Code section 17001. In <em>Torres </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1962) 58 Cal.2d 35, 47 [22 Cal.Rptr. 866, 372 P.2d 906], it was held that such driver, operating his vehicle in the line of duty, must nonetheless drive in such a manner as would not impose upon others an unreasonable risk of harm. The court said \u201cThe question to be asked is what would a reasonable, prudent emergency driver do under all of the circumstances, including that of emergency.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 51.)</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">There is uncontradicted evidence in the record indicating that Deputies Boyd and Erwin were traveling between 80 and 100 miles per hour as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>they approached the intersection. Deputy Erwin acknowledged in his deposition that this rate of speed was so excessive that effective evasive maneuvers were not possible. Deputy Boyd stated that he did not step on his brakes at all, even though other vehicles were in the intersection, and Deputy Erwin conceded he was unaware of the color of the traffic signal when he entered the intersection. Deputy Boyd stated, furthermore, that police practices advised \u201cif there was a problem\u201d with chasing a suspected felon, the officers were to cease pursuit, and that he understood this to refer to traffic conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-3\">Due care as an element of negligence presents a question of fact for the jury. (4 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (8th ed. 1974) Torts, \u00a7 492, p. 2755.) If the circumstances permit a reasonable doubt whether defendants\u2019 conduct violated the boundaries of due care, the doubt must be resolved as an issue of fact by the jury rather than of law by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-4\">Based upon the evidence in the record concerning the speed of the officers\u2019 cars, the vehicular traffic at the time of the accident, one officer\u2019s lack of awareness of the color of the light at the intersection, and their instructions on when to discontinue pursuit, there existed sufficient evidence of the officers\u2019 negligence to require that a jury weigh the facts <em>(Dillenbeck </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 472, 478 [72 Cal.Rptr. 321, 446 P.2d 129]; <em>Peerless Laundry Serv. </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, supra, </em>109 Cal.App.2d 703, 707; <em>Grant </em>v. <em>Petronella </em>(1975) 50 Cal.App.3d 281 [123 Cal.Rptr. 399]; <em>Torres </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, supra, </em>58 Cal.2d 35), and any doubts as to the propriety of granting a summary judgment should have been resolved in favor of the party opposing the motion. <em>(Blaustein </em>v. <em>Burton </em>(1970) 9 Cal.App.3d 161, 176 [88 Cal.Rptr. 319]; <em>Stationers Corp. </em>v. <em>Dun &amp; Bradstreet </em>(1965) 62 Cal.2d 412 [42 Cal.Rptr. 449, 398 P.2d 785].)</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">The judgment for defendant County of Sacramento is reversed and judgment for the individual defendants is affirmed. Plaintiffs shall recover their costs from the County of Sacramento; the individual defendants shall recover their costs from plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">Bird, C.
