We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>The action was brought against Carolyn B. and her husband on June 23, 1975, by the San Diego County Department of Public Welfare pursuant to Civil Code section 232 for abandonment (Civ. Code, \u00a7 232, subd. (a)(1)), cruelty and neglect (Civ. Code, \u00a7 232, subd. (a)(2)), conviction of a felony (Civ. Code, \u00a7 232, subd. (a)(4)), and inability to properly support or control due to mental illness (Civ. Code, \u00a7 232, subd. (a)(6)). The department also sought to be appointed guardian of the minors under Civil Code section 239<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> until the children could be placed for adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">The record on appeal includes the written report of the juvenile probation officer and the reporter\u2019s transcript of the testimony of the deputy probation officer, the dependent child worker, the psychiatrist who interviewed the parents and the minors\u2019 mother. No findings were requested by parties and on October 3, 1975, the trial court granted the petition. The court\u2019s judgment declared: \u201clx Is Hereby Ordered, Adjudged And Decreed that Carmaleta [B.], Carlotta [B.], Clarence [B.], Clarenton [B.], and Carolyn [B.],. .. should be and are declared free from the custody and control of their mother Carolyn [B.], pursuant to Civil Code section 232, subdivisions (a)(2) and (a)(6),[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] and the legal father, Clarence [B.], pursuant to Civil Code section 232, subdivisions (a)(2), (a)(4) and (a)(6),[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] and said persons are hereby deprived of the custody and control of said ... children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>It is further provided that the department of public welfare was duly appointed guardian of the minors pending their adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">The Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Mr. and Mrs. B. now have five children: Carmaleta, age nine; Carlotta, age eight; Clarence, Jr., age seven; Clarenton, age six; and Carolyn, age three. The minors first came to the attention of the juvenile authorities in July 1970 when staff at Mercy Hospital treated Clarence for a head injury similar to that suffered by his sister Carlotta the year before. A staff doctor notified the juvenile probation department of the circumstances surrounding Clarence\u2019s condition, as told to him by Mrs. B.\u2019s sister who visited the child while he was hospitalized. Carlotta suffered physical damage as a result of her injury and Clarence is partially paralyzed and is reported to have no vision in the left eye.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">It was not until June 1973, however, that the four older children, Carolyn having not yet been born, were removed from their parents\u2019 custody and declared dependent children of the San Diego County Juvenile Court. The probation officer\u2019s report states the wardships were ordered \u201c.. . under the provision of then Section 600, subdivision (d)[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] of the Welfare and Institutions Code which permitted a child to be declared a dependent child .. . whose home [was] an unfit place for him by reason of neglect, cruelty ... or physical abuse.. . .\u201d The action was the result of a petition alleging that \u201cthe home was unfit because of the depravity and cruelty of the father in that during the period of 1973 [he] subjected or exposed the girls to sexual abuse or damage and that the mother failed to protect the girls . .. and that the father subjected or exposed the boys to physical abuse or damage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">Caseworkers also found that Mr. B. had been convicted of battery under section 242 of the Penal Code in 1970 for whipping a two-year-old boy that his wife was babysitting and that in 1975, he was convicted of an attempt to commit unlawful sexual intercourse with a fourteen-year-old girl in violation of Penal Code section 664.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>In 1973 dependency proceedings gave custody of the four children to Mrs. B. under the supervision of Mrs. B.\u2019s mother in the mother\u2019s home in Washington, D.C. Three months after arriving in Washington, Mrs. B. gave birth to her fifth child Carolyn B. In March of 1974, Mrs. B. began psychiatric consultation at a local hospital and voluntarily underwent a short-term commitment. At this time she and her mother were having serious disagreements over the care of the children, and as a result of their disharmony, the Washington, D.C. juvenile authorities arranged for the four elder children to be returned to California. The children arrived in San Diego in March 1974, and were placed with foster parents on April 5, 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">Within a few weeks of the children\u2019s arrival, Mrs. B. returned to San Diego with her infant daughter and set up a separate residence away from her husband. On April 30, 1974, a month after her return, the department of public welfare succeeded in having the baby declared a ward of the court and a dependent child pursuant to then section 600, subdivision (a)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of the Welfare and Institutions Code for \u201cany person under ... age 18 who ... has no parent... capable of exercising [proper parental] care ...\u201d apparently on the ground that Mrs. B. was incapable of protecting her from possible abuse by Mr. B. The baby was subsequently placed with the same foster parents as were her brothers and sisters.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Having lost custody of all the children and having no income, Mrs. B., on the advice of a social worker, went to live with her husband while she trained as a nurse\u2019s aide. Although she has made a few abortive attempts to move, Mrs. B. continues to reside with her husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">In June 1975, just one year after the last child was placed in foster care, the department of public welfare pursuant to section 232.9<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> initiated this petition to free the minors from the custody and control of their parents. It is from the ensuing judgment under section 232, subdivisions (a)(2) and (a)(6), herein described, that Mrs. B. appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>Parenting is a fundamental right, and accordingly, is disturbed only in extreme cases of persons acting in a fashion incompatible with parenthood. Thus, the court in <em>In re T. M. R. </em>(1974) 41 Cal.App.3d 694, 703 [116 Cal.Rptr. 292], held: \u201cThe relationship of... natural parent... [and]... children is a vital human relationship which has far-reaching implications for the growth and development of the child. (See Kay &amp; Phillips, <em>Poverty and the Law of Child Custody </em>(1966) 54 Cal.L.Rev. 717.) Thus, the involuntary termination of that relationship by state action must be viewed as a drastic remedy which should be resorted to only in extreme cases of neglect or abandonment.\u201d <em>(Lois R. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1971) 19 Cal.App.3d 895 [97 Cal.Rptr. 158]; <em>In re J. T. </em>(1974) 40 Cal.App.3d 633 [115 Cal.Rptr. 553]; <em>In re Raya </em>(1967) 255 Cal.App.2d 260, 265 [63 Cal.Rptr. 252]; <em>In re A. J. </em>(1969) 274 Cal.App.2d 199, 202 [78 Cal.Rptr. 880]; <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>Illinois </em>(1972) 405 U.S. 645 [31 L.Ed.2d 551, 92 S.Ct. 1208].)</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Our decision in <em>In re B. G. </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 679 [114 Cal.Rptr. 444, 523 P.2d 244], emphasized the gravity of this right, holding that the doctrine preferring parental custody was not affected by the enactment of section 4600 except to focus \u201cattention not on the unfitness of the parent but the detriment to the child. (See <em>Guardianship of Marino, supra, </em>30 Cal.App.3d 952, 958 [106 Cal.Rptr. 655]).\u201d (11 Cal.3d 698.) <em>B. G. </em>permits custody to go to nonparents \u201c... only upon a clear showing that such award is essential to avert harm to the child.\u201d (11 Cal.3d p. 699.)</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">In light of this legislative and judicial policy, we must determine if the trial court\u2019s findings under subdivisions (a)(2) and (a)(6) were supported by substantial evidence such that the situation contemplated by the statute arises, and severing the parental relationship becomes the least detrimental alternative for the children. <em>(In re D. L. C. </em>(1976) 54 Cal.App.3d 840, 850 [126 Cal.Rptr. 863]; <em>In re Eugene W. </em>(1972) 29 Cal.App.3d 623, 629 [105 Cal.Rptr. 736]; Goldstein et al., Beyond the Best Interests of the Child (1973).)</p>\n<p id=\"b520-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>The Section 232, Subdivision (a)(6) Finding\u2014Inability Due To Mental Illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">Section 232 (see fn. 3, <em>ante.) </em>provides that \u201c[a]n action may be brought for the purpose of having any person under the age of 18 years declared free from the custody and control of either or both of his parents when such person comes within any of the following descriptions ... (6) [Person] [w]hose ... parents are, and will remain incapable of supporting or controlling the child .. . because of mental deficiency or... illness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">The court impliedly found that Mrs. B. \u201c... [was] and [would] remain incapable of supporting or controlling the [children] in a proper manner because of mental . .. illness\u201d under subdivision (a)(6) of the statute.  Mentally ill persons under section 232 have been judicially defined as those persons \u201c(a) [w]ho are of such mental condition that they are in need of supervision, treatment, care or restraint\u201d or \u201c(b) [w]ho are of such mental condition that they are dangerous to themselves or to the person or property of others....\u201d <em>(In re Baby Boy T. </em>(1970) 9 Cal.App.3d 815, 820 [88 Cal.Rptr. 418]; see also <em>In re Eugene W., supra, </em>p. 628, fn. 2.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Kern County Welfare Department, as amicus curiae, urges the obsolescence of this definition and suggests that this court adopt a broader interpretation of mental illness consistent with what it deems the implications of sections 232.5, 237, and 232, subdivision (a)(7), emphasizing the welfare of the child. We decline the invitation to reinterpret the meaning of mental illness under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Notwithstanding that on reenactment or amendment<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the Legislature is presumed to have adopted the judicial construction of statutory language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number><em>(People </em>v. <em>Hallner </em>(1956) 43 Cal.2d 715 [277 P.2d 393]; <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Jordan </em>(1949) 34 Cal.2d 87 [207 P.2d 47]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Curtis </em>(1969) 70 Cal.2d 347 [34 Cal.Rptr. 713, 450 P.2d 33]; <em>Ladd </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees </em>(1972) 23 Cal.App.3d 984 [100 Cal.Rptr. 571]), amicus suggests no cogent reason for altering the definition that is now incorporated in the legislative scheme. Its brief asks for the meaning of mental illness to be liberalized to facilitate the termination of the parental relationship where the parents are demonstrably incapable of providing proper care but are nevertheless not so incapacitated as to require \u201c... supervision, treatment ... or restraint.\u201d The courts in <em>In re Baby Boy T., supra, </em>9 Cal.App.3d 815 and <em>In re Eugene W., supra, 29 </em>Cal.App.3d 623, have upheld the existing definition, and the tenor of their opinions is consistent with the proposition that family rights, both the parent\u2019s and the child\u2019s rights, should not be vulnerable to a too easy finding of mental illness. Indeed, the strictness of this definition of mental illness has acted as a safeguard to protect the primacy of the family. Moreover, although it can be argued that the present standard prevents severance in some cases where the parents may be incapable of providing proper care, it is evident that any significant harm to the child\u2019s welfare can be adequately addressed by subdivision (a)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Section 232, subdivision (a)(7) provides that a child may be freed from parental custody and control \u201c[w]ho has been cared for in one or more foster homes ... for two or more consecutive years,... [if] the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that return of the child to his parents] . .. would be detrimental to the child... .\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>\n                   The section, accordingly, balances the interests of the child in secure and sufficient parenting with the conjoined interests of both parent and child in preserving the familial bond. The subdivision has the added advantage of permitting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>parents a longer period, two years, in which to rehabilitate themselves to a position whereby they can properly support this most fundamental responsibility. Such an accommodation, inherent in the structuring of section 232, affords the fullest opportunity to the parents for exercise of their rights not inconsistent with the ultimate best interests of the child. Accordingly, amicus\u2019 proposed definition of mental illness appears unnecessary to achieve the purpose of the statute in securing the welfare of the child; considering the fundamental interests here involved, we should not, in the absence of language clearly expressing such a standard, so interpret the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">In the instant case, there is insufficient evidence to show Mrs. B. was mentally ill under the standard of <em>In re Baby Boy T., supra, 9 </em>Cal.App.3d 815 and <em>In re Eugene W., supra, </em>29 Cal.App.3d 623. The evidence of her mental condition was contained in the probation officer\u2019s report and testimony which anticipated the psychiatric evaluation and the testimony of one of the examining psychiatrists. The report stated: \u201cMrs. [B.] comes across as a well-meaning individual who is emotionally too weak to [properly] care for her children.\u201d Dr. Vargas, the psychiatrist corroborated this assessment at the hearing. He said that mental illness was \u201cany type of mental disorder which incapacitates an individual to live normally . ..\u201d continuing, that he and his colleagues thought that Mrs. B. was suffering from mental illness in that sense, and, because of her inability to cope with stress situations, she would be unable to take care of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">However, both Ms. Bell and Dr. Vargas acknowledged that their conclusions of her mental condition were based on Mrs. B.\u2019s neglect in failing to prevent the injuries that resulted in the children being made wards of the court, and her purported \u201cinability to cope\u201d in Washington, D.C. Ms. Bell, the author of the report, said she had never met Mrs. B., and Dr. Vargas said his judgment of her mental condition was made from an hour interview and her past history. Moreover, Dr. Vargas verified on cross-, and recross-examination that he had only seen Mrs. B. once, and that her establishing a separate residence apart from Mr. B. with welfare assistance and guidance \u201c.. . could be tried,\u201d thereby conceding that whatever the classification of her mental state, Mrs. B.\u2019s problems constituted no immediate danger to herself or her children. Clearly, under such a showing, it could not be said that Mrs. B. \u201cwas and would remain incapable of supporting or controlling her children\u201d according to this subdivision. There was, therefore, no substantial evidence for a finding that Mrs. B. was mentally ill, and the trial court erred to the extent it based its decision to grant the petition on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>The Section 232, Subdivision (a)(2) Finding\u2014Neglect</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">The court\u2019s second finding supporting the section 232 petition was that the children had been .. cruelly treated or neglected, by [their] parents ..under subdivision (a)(2) of section 232. Mrs. B. urges that the court\u2019s finding against her under the provision was unsupported by substantial evidence because this determination, like the probation officer\u2019s and the psychiatrist\u2019s testimony, was predicated solely on the acts which initially caused the wardship proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">It is well settled that an order to free a child from parental custody and control must rest on present circumstances as well as past acts although such prior acts are evidence which may be considered by the court in deciding whether there is sufficient showing to justify the order. <em>(In re Morrow </em>(1970) 9 Cal.App.3d 39, 54, 56 [88 Cal.Rptr. 142]; <em>In re Zimmerman </em>(1962) 206 Cal.App.2d 835, 844-845 [24 Cal.Rptr. 329]; <em>In re Cardenas </em>(1961) 194 Cal.App.2d 849, 855 [15 Cal.Rptr. 238]; <em>In re Williams </em>(1955) 133 Cal.App.2d 515 [284 P.2d 510].) In court proceedings held June 23, 1973, the department of public welfare\u2019s petition alleging Mr. B.\u2019s physical and sexual abuse of the children and Mrs. B.\u2019s failure to protect them, was granted and the children were declared dependent children of the court under then Welfare and Institutions Code section 600, subdivision (d), providing for such wardship where a minor\u2019s home \u201c... is an unfit place for him by reason of neglect, cruelty, depravity or physical abuse. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">Under the principles of collateral estoppel, Mrs. B. may be precluded from denying the truth of the findings of the dependency proceeding that she failed to protect the children <em>(Bernhard </em>v. <em>Bank of America </em>(1942) 19 Cal.2d 807; 807, 811, 813 [122 P.2d 892]); however, \u201cinquiry into the issue of cruelty or neglect [in a section 232 action] is not foreclosed by the order making the minor a dependent child of the juvenile court. <em>In re Williams </em>[1962] 133 Cal.App.2d 515 . . . 518[.]\u201d <em>(In re Morrow </em>(1970), <em>supra, 9 </em>Cal.App.3d 39 at p. 54; see also <em>Louis Stores, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control </em>(1962) 57 Cal.2d 749, 757 [22 Cal.Rptr. 14, 371 P.2d 758].)</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">The court in <em>In re Zimmerman, supra, </em>206 Cal.App.2d 835, 842, reviewed the distinction between a petition to declare children wards of the juvenile court (now dependent children) where the issue was actual custody and a proceeding to have the children declared free of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>custody and control of the parent where the mother stood to lose all her parental rights; it held: \u201cWe do not think that such proceedings to free a child from parental control have been invested by the Legislature with the rigid and inflexible character that appellants ascribe to them. It is clear to us that the court\u2019s consideration of the matter must proceed beyond the point of concluding merely that the mother was deprived of the custody of her child for moral depravity and that the period of a year has elapsed. The court in the instant proceedings is not finalizing an antecedent interlocutory judgment.\u201d (206 Cal.App.2d 843.)</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">Mrs. B. was therefore \u201centitled to have the circumstances leading to the [dependency] order[s] reviewed in the light of subsequent events, and with consideration of the nature of the order sought in [this proceeding]. ... It [was] reasonable to consider under subdivision (b) [of section 232] whether the conditions which gave rise to the . .. neglect still persisted].\u201d <em>(In re Morrow </em>(1970) <em>supra, 9 </em>Cal.App.3d 39, 55-56; <em>In re Susan M. </em>(1975) 53 Cal.App.3d 300 [125 Cal.Rptr. 707]; <em>In re Gano </em>(1958) 160 Cal.App.2d 700 [325 P.2d 485].) The record indicates, however, that the trial judge did take Mrs. B.\u2019s present circumstances into account before making his decision. At the hearing, in response to questions by counsel and the court, Mrs. B. testified to, and the probation officer\u2019s report corroborated, her efforts to resolve her personality problems, and to train for employment so she might, with the supportive services of the department of public welfare, regain custody. Such a showing, absent any contrary evidence by Mrs. B., suggests her current circumstances were weighed in the court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">Nevertheless, there was evidence to support the court\u2019s conclusion of neglect for four of the five children. The mandatory conditions of section 232, subdivision (a)(2) (a child made a ward of the court because of cruel or neglectful treatment whose parents have been deprived of custody for one year), were satisfied for these children. Moreover, although much of the testimony of the probation officer and the psychiatrist admits to being based on case files with only a brief interview or phone conversation, this evidence, and the evidence of Mrs. B.\u2019s psychological difficulties in Washington, D.C., while insufficient to show mental illness, temper her showing of rehabilitation and capability to undertake the children\u2019s care. Indeed, petitioner\u2019s own testimony that she never feared for the safety of the children around their father, a convicted sex offender, may have properly convinced the trial court that Mrs. B. did not appreciate the necessity of keeping the children apart from Mr. B. and therefore could not be relied upon to live away from him if the children were returned to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>her care. Such issues of fact and credibility presented questions for the trial court <em>(In re Morrow, supra, 9 </em>Cal.3d 39, 57; <em>In re D. L. C. </em>(1976), <em>supra, </em>54 Cal.App.3d 840, 843), and we cannot say that there was not substantial evidence to support the order declaring the four older children free from the custody and control of their mother under section 232, subdivision (a)(2).  We hold, however, that no cruelty or neglect has been proven as to Carolyn B. who was bom after the abuse which resulted in the dependency of the other children, and who was made a ward of the court under a different dependency subdivision. (Cf. <em>In re J. T. </em>(1974) 40 Cal.App.3d 633, 638 [115 Cal.Rptr. 553]; <em>In re Baby Boy T., supra, 9 </em>Cal.App.3d 815, 819.)</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">The Section 4600 Finding Of Detriment</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">Since the mental illness ground is unsupported by the evidence, and therefore cannot be used to sever the parental relationship to all of the children,, and since the neglect ground is supported only as to four of the five children, we conclude that the case must be remanded to the trial court for a determination of the finding of detriment and a redetermination of whether the section 232 petition should be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">Section 4600<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> requires: \u201cBefore the court makes any order awarding custody to a person or persons other than a parent, without the consent of the parents, it shall make a finding that an award of custody to a parent would be detrimental to the child, and the award to a nonparent is required to serve the best interests of the child. . . .\u201d  Our decision in <em>In re B. G., </em>held section 4600 applied to all cases where custody of children was in issue, and it requires a finding by the court that placement away from the parent \u201c. . . is <em>essential </em>to avert harm to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>child. . . .\u201d (Italics added.) (11 Cal.3d 679, at p. 699.) This finding of detriment has been required in section 232 cases. <em>(In re B. G., supra, </em>11 Cal.3d 679; <em>In re D. L. C. </em>(1976) <em>supra, </em>54 Cal.App.3d 840; <em>In re T. M. R. </em>(1974) 41 Cal.App.3d 694 [116 Cal.Rptr. 292]; <em>In re Susan M., supra </em>(1975) 53 Cal.App.3d 300.) In the instant case, the trial court, without such express finding, declared the children free of their parents\u2019 custody and control, basing its decision on three subdivisions of section 232, of which only subdivisions (a)(2) and (a)(6) are in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">In a case such as this where fundamental rights are affected by the exercise of discretion by the trial court, we recognize that such discretion can only be truly exercised if there is no misconception by the trial court as to the legal basis for its action. Thus, where, as here, some of the grounds for the trial court\u2019s action have been determined on appeal to be supportable and other grounds unsupported, the matter should be remanded for the trial court\u2019s redetermination of the ultimate issue on the proper grounds. <em>(Bonham </em>v. <em>McConnell </em>(1955) 45 Cal.2d 304, 306 [288 P.2d 502]; <em>Byrd </em>v. <em>Savage </em>(1963) 219 Cal.App.2d 396, 402 [32 Cal.Rptr. 881]; <em>Andrews </em>v. <em>Cunningham </em>(1955) 105 Cal.App.2d 525, 529 [233 P.2d 563].) Had the court concluded that Mrs. B. was not mentally ill and that the judgment would separate the siblings, it may well have come to a different result on the question of whether the order would constitute the least detrimental alternative for the children. We cannot say that the erroneous findings were surplusage (see <em>Brewer </em>v. <em>Simpson, </em>53 Cal.2d 567 [2 Cal.Rptr. 609, 349 P.2d 289]) or that there is \u201cno real doubt\u201d in the absence of the erroneous findings.
