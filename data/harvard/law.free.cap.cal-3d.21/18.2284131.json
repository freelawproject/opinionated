Among other contentions, appellant asserts that the superior court erred in failing to make and enter express findings which indicate the reasons for the order of commitment. We will conclude that, since neither the Constitution nor statutes require such findings, and since the record in such cases ordinarily is sufficient to permit adequate appellate review, we should not impose such an obligation as a judicial rule of procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>Appellant was found to have committed a robbery and to have inflicted great bodily harm upon the victim; he was adjudicated a ward of the juvenile court under Welfare and Institutions Code section 602 (all further statutory references are to that code unless otherwise specified); and a disposition hearing was held to determine a suitable placement (\u00a7\u00a7 727-731). Appellant\u2019s probation officer recommended that appellant be sent to a county-maintained camp for delinquent youths. The referee disagreed, stating, on the record, that \u201cthis minor has and had for sometime been involved seriously and actively in gang activities. He was given a home on probation ... and ordered to stay away from those gang activities. [11] This is not the first serious offense involving violence in which he has been involved, and with this extensive history, the court. .. finds that the mental and physical condition ... of the ward is such as to render it probable that he will be benefited by .. . treatment provided by [the Youth Authority].\u201d (See \u00a7 734, requiring such a determination of probable benefit from a Youth Authority commitment; see also <em>In re Aline D. </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 557 [121 Cal.Rptr. 816, 536 P.2d 65].)</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">Because it would result in removing appellant from his home the referee\u2019s order was not effective until approved by a juvenile court judge. (\u00a7 249 (former \u00a7 555); see <em>In re Edgar M. </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 727, 731, 737-738 [122 Cal.Rptr. 574, 537 P.2d 406].) In the present case such approval was given by an order made by the juvenile court judge on a printed form which recited that the court had found (in the language of \u00a7 734) that appellant would probably benefit from the treatment provided by the Youth Authority. The order did not repeat, however, the referee\u2019s declared reasons for recommending such a commitment. Appellant neither objected to the absence of findings nor requested a rehearing of the disposition order in the juvenile court. (See \u00a7 252 (former \u00a7 558).)</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">We observe, initially, that there presently exists no due process necessity that express findings be made in cases of this kind. Thus far, the United States Supreme Court has recognized a constitutional requirement only in the \u201ccritical\u201d situation in which a juvenile court has waived its own jurisdiction over the minor in favor of adult criminal proceedings. In such a case, the high court has required that the juvenile courts furnish a statement of the reasons supporting the waiver in order to assure an appellate review that has meaning. <em>(Kent </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1966) 383 U.S. 541, 561 [16 L.Ed.2d 84, 97, 86 S.Ct. 1045]; see <em>In re Sturm </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 258, 269, fn. 13 [113 Cal.Rptr. 361, 521 P.2d 97].) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>In contrast, the minor in the present case is retained within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court. As we shall note, the decision to retain and commit a minor to the Youth Authority ordinarily is accompanied by a record which amply discloses the reasons supporting the commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">Furthermore, there is no statutory requirement that either the juvenile court or referee express the reasons which support a minor\u2019s commitment to the Youth Authority. Section 726 states that \u201c... no ward or dependent child shall be taken from the physical custody of a parent or guardian unless upon the hearing the court finds ... that the parent or guardian is incapable of providing ... for the minor\u201d (subd. (a)), that the minor has failed to reform while on probation (subd. (b)), or that \u201cthe welfare of the minor requires that his custody be taken from his parent or guardian\u201d (subd. (c)). In addition, as previously noted, section 734 requires a determination of probable benefit to the minor from a Youth Authority placement. Apart from these two sections, the Legislature has not imposed any requirement that particular findings be entered in support of a commitment order.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">Appellant, while acknowledging the absence of any constitutional or statutory requirement of express findings, nonetheless urges that, as a policy matter, we should compel such findings pursuant to \u201cour supervisory authority over state criminal procedure.\u201d (See <em>In re Podesto </em>(1976) 15 Cal.3d 921, 938 [127 Cal.Rptr. 97, 544 P.2d 1297].) In <em>Podesto </em>we imposed a requirement that trial courts render a brief statement of reasons in support of an order denying a motion for bail on appeal, to insure significant appellate review. It should be noted, in passing, that denials of bail occur in the absence of any previous formal hearing on the matter, and generate no substantial reviewable record. We explained in <em>Podesto </em>that findings serve several worthy purposes: They help to assure a realistic review by providing a method of evaluating a judge\u2019s decision or order; they guard against careless decision making by encouraging the trial judge to express the grounds for his decision; and they preserve public confidence in the fairness of the judicial process. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 937; see also <em>In re Bye </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 96, 110 [115 Cal.Rptr. 382, 524 P.2d 854] [statement of reasons supporting revocation of outpatient status for narcotics addict]; <em>In re Sturm, supra, </em>11 Cal.3d 258, 269-272 [statement of reasons for denying parole].)</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">Courts, however, have not required findings, or a statement of reasons, in every type of proceeding. (E.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Edwards </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>796, 805-806 [135 Cal.Rptr. 411, 557 P.2d 995] [denial of probation]; <em>Kawaichi </em>v. <em>Madigan </em>(1975) 53 Cal.App.3d 461, 466 [126 Cal.Rptr. 63] [denial of release on one\u2019s own recognizance pending trial]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ruiz (1975) 53 </em>Cal.App.3d 715, 717-718 [125 Cal.Rptr. 886] [revocation of probation].) In declining to impose a requirement that trial courts state their reasons for denying probation in a criminal case, we explained in <em>Edwards </em>that, unlike the <em>Podesto </em>situation, such a requirement was unnecessary to insure a proper appellate review, for the record on appeal from a judgment denying probation is usually sufficient for that purpose, containing \u201ca full record of all proceedings including the probation and sentencing hearing itself; there is thus a solid basis for review ....\u201d (18 Cal.3d at p. 804.) Furthermore, we pointed out that a judge who is aware that his judicial conduct is subject to review on a full record \u201cis not likely to make a hasty or careless decision. Thus an element of compulsion to exercise care and sound judgment is present without the requirement of an articulated statement of reasons .. ..\u201d (P. 805.)</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">Similar considerations move us herein. The record of a disposition hearing in juvenile court ordinarily will provide an adequate appellate record from which to determine the reasons supporting any Youth Authority commitment. The probation report, together with a transcription of the hearing and the referee\u2019s remarks and conclusions usually will accompany every record on appeal. As noted above, the record herein does contain the various reasons given by the referee in support of his order, and we discern no valid purpose which would be served by requiring the juvenile court judge to repeat those or other reasons in his commitment order. In the absence of any contrary indication in the record, we think it fair to presume from the judge\u2019s approval of the order that the judge relied upon the same or similar reasons as those stated by the referee.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">Appellant relies on <em>In re Lawrence B. </em>(1976) 61 Cal.App.3d 671, 673 [132 Cal.Rptr. 599], wherein the court held that an order couched only in the conclusionaiy terms of section 726 is insufficient to support a Youth Authority commitment. We are more persuaded, however, by the force of the dissenting opinion of Justice Jefferson who observed in <em>Lawrence B., </em>\u201cBy its express terms. Welfare and Institutions Code section 726 requires a finding <em>only </em>in the language of the statute. [If]. .. Additional, express findings are neither mandated by any provision of the State of California Constitution, nor the United States Constitution, nor by any section of the Welfare and Institutions Code, nor by the decisional law of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>this state. An appellate court ought not, by <em>judicial fiat, </em>[to] interpret the plain and unambiguous language of Welfare and Institutions Code section 726 as requiring anything additional to what the statute itself explicitly requires.\u201d (P. 676, italics in original.) The dissent further found significance in the fact that in 1975 the Legislature amended section 707 to require a recital in the court\u2019s order of the various factors which led the court to conclude that a minor was not a fit and proper subject for juvenile court; no similar amendment was made to section 726. In this connection, and in a similar vein, we observe that in adult criminal proceedings the Legislature has expressly required the sentencing court to \u201cstate the reasons for its sentence choice on the record at the time of sentencing.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1170, subd. (c).) The Legislature has the means by which to require such a statement when it elects to do so. To the extent that <em>Lawrence B. </em>is contrary to the views expressed herein, we disapprove it.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">In the present case, as appellant points out, the record fails to indicate, affirmatively, whether the juvenile court judge had reviewed either the transcript of the proceedings before the referee, or the referee\u2019s informal findings, prior to the judge\u2019s approval of the commitment order. Apparently the action of the referee and juvenile court judge occurred on the same day, suggesting that the latter could not have had available the transcript of proceedings conducted before the referee. Appellant contends that, under such circumstances, the judge\u2019s approval must be considered \u201cperfunctory\u201d and inadequate. In appellant\u2019s view, the referee\u2019s order properly could not become operative until the full transcript of the proceedings before the referee had been prepared and reviewed by the approving judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">The juvenile court judge, however, did have the benefit of an 11-page probation officer\u2019s report containing a behavioral evaluation, reason for the hearing, statements of minor, parents, interested parties, a detailed \u201cPrevious History\u201d and a \u201cProgress Under Supervision\u201d report.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">Appellant\u2019s contention, moreover, fails to distinguish between the <em>approval </em>procedure (\u00a7 249 (former \u00a7 555)) and the <em>rehearing </em>procedure (\u00a7 252 (former \u00a7 558)) which appellant waived in this case. An application for rehearing requires a reexamination of the entire record by the juvenile court judge; it is necessary that the judge examine the complete transcript of the proceedings before the referee in order to exercise an informed independent judgment. (See <em>In re Edgar M., supra, </em>14 Cal.3d 727, 737; <em>In re Damon C. </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 493, 497-498 [128 Cal.Rptr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>172, 546 P.2d 676].) On the other hand, an approval of a referee\u2019s order removing a minor from his parents\u2019 custody must occur <em>within two judicial days. </em>(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 1318(b).) This rule, enacted to insure that such orders become operative without undue delay, further provides that \u201cThe approval of a referee\u2019s order by a judge in these circumstances <em>is not a rehearing on the </em>merits.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">As the advisory committee comment to rule 1318 explains, the approval provision of former section 555 (now \u00a7 249) was intended only as a requirement that the referee\u2019s order be \u201ccountersigned\u201d by a juvenile court judge, thereby attesting to the authenticity of the order. (Judicial Council of Cal., Annual Rep. (1977) p. 41.) According to the comment, \u201c. .. the approval procedures are, in effect, a requirement for a second signature, by a judge, before the referee\u2019s order becomes \u2018effective,\u2019 <em>i.e., </em>operative.\u201d <em>(Ibid.; </em>see also <em>In re Edgar M., supra, </em>14 Cal.3d 727, 737-738; <em>In re Dale S. </em>(1970) 10 Cal.App.3d 952, 956 [89 Cal.Rptr. 499].)</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">It is true that the requirement of approval by a juvenile court judge derives from the constitutional mandate that referees are restricted to performing \u201csubordinate judicial duties.\u201d (Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 22; see <em>In re Edgar M., supra, </em>14 Cal.3d at p. 732.) Yet, as the framers of rule 1318 recognized, that constitutional requirement is fully satisfied by obtaining the countersignature of a juvenile court judge, so long as opportunity to seek a full rehearing remains available on request. Given the availability of the rehearing procedure, no reason appears why the initial approval of the referee\u2019s order may not be based solely on the probation report, any other documentaiy evidence in the case, and any summaries of testimony which may accompany the record, without requiring the preparation and review of the entire transcript, necessitating a lengthy delay and precluding compliance with the two-day-approval provision of rule 1318(b). Indeed, were appellant\u2019s contention to be accepted, a minor would be entitled, in effect, to seek\" <em>two </em>rehearings of the referee\u2019s decision, surely, an uneconomical use of judicial resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">Appellant next asserts that a specific-findings requirement is necessary in order to implement our decision in <em>In re Aline D., supra, </em>14 Cal.3d 557, wherein we held that a Youth Authority commitment \u201cmust be supported by a determination, based upon substantial evidence in the record, of probable benefit to the minor.\u201d (P. 567.) In <em>Aline D., </em>the juvenile court ordered such a commitment despite its express doubts that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>the ward would benefit from such treatment. We observed that a \u201c \\ .. commitment to the Youth Authority is generally viewed as <em>the final treatment resource </em>available to the juvenile court....\u2019\u201d (P. 564, italics in original.) Nothing we stated in <em>A line D., </em>however, would support the argument that the juvenile court must enter express findings which explain the reasons in favor of a Youth Authority commitment. As we have previously noted, ordinarily the appellate record, including the remarks of the referee at the dispositional hearing, form an adequate basis for determining the propriety of the commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">A recent case by the Court of Appeal analyzes the relevant cases and reaches a conclusion fully in accord with our holding herein and our earlier expressions in <em>People </em>v. <em>Edwards, supra, </em>18 Cal.3d 796. In <em>In re Robert D. </em>(1977) 72 Cal.App.3d 180, 188 [139 Cal.Rptr. 840], the court rejected the argument that a statement of reasons must be given to support the denial of a rehearing by a juvenile court judge of a referee\u2019s decision declaring the petitioner a ward of the juvenile court and committing him to a placement facility. On the basis of its study of the pertinent cases, the court concluded that \u201cNo statement of reasons for decision is required where: (1) the action is judicial in nature; (2) involves a discretion exercised upon totality of circumstances rather than specific criteria; (3) the interplay of the circumstances is set forth in a record; and (4) judicial review on the record is a matter of right and not appellate discretion. [Citations.]\u201d (P. 188; see also <em>In re Willy L. </em>(1976) 56 Cal.App.3d 256, 265 [128 Cal.Rptr. 592].)</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">Appellant further contends that, under <em>A line D. </em>a commitment to the Youth Authority should never be ordered until \u201cless restrictive\u201d placements have been attempted. To the contrary, the circumstances in a particular case may well suggest the desirability of a Youth Authority commitment despite the availability of such alternative dispositions as placement in a county camp or ranch. (See <em>In re Willy L., supra, </em>at p. 265; <em>In re Lawrence B., supra, </em>61 Cal.App.3d 671, 677 (dis. opn.).) <em>Aline D. </em>stressed the importance of finding a probable benefit to the minor before a Youth Authority commitment can be upheld. In the present case, such a finding was made and was included in the court\u2019s order. Evidence appearing in the probation report that the minor had a lengthy history of gang involvement and several prior violent ofienses amply supported that finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>Appellant argues that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the referee\u2019s finding that he had participated in the robbery and assault. However, the victim made a positive identification of appellant at the field lineup conducted shortly after the offense occurred. Appellant also contends that his trial counsel was incompetent because of counsel\u2019s failure to recall one witness and to explore other possible defenses. The matters of which appellant complains were each matters involving possible tactical decisions by counsel \u201cas to which we will not ordinarily exercise judicial hindsight.

A petition was filed against appellant, John H., in the Juvenile Court of Los Angeles County on October 28, 1975. A referee ordered appellant detained on October 29th, and on November 14th, a second referee found him to be a proper subject to be dealt with under the Juvenile Court Law. A third referee sustained the petition filed against appellant on November 18th.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">The dispositional hearing was held in the early afternoon of December 1st before a fourth referee. Both the probation officer and the investigating police officer recommended a camp placement. Although appellant had never previously been placed in any setting outside his home, the referee ordered appellant committed to the Youth Authority. Later that same afternoon, a judge of the juvenile court signed an order entitled \u201ccommitment to the youth authority (Juvenile),\u201d which \u201chereby committed [appellant] to the Youth Authority ....\u201d That form contained a preprinted sentence stating that \u201c[t]he mental and physical condition and qualifications of this person are such as to render it probable that he will be benefited by the reformatory educational discipline or other treatment provided by the Youth Authority.\u201d At the time the judge signed this order, no transcript of the jurisdictional or dispositional hearing had been prepared. Thus the judge was unaware of the evidence presented at the jurisdictional and dispositional hearings, the arguments of appellant\u2019s counsel, and the basis on which the referee decided to commit appellant to the Youth Authority. A probation report had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>prepared before the dispositional hearing, but the record is silent as to whether the judge saw it before he signed appellant\u2019s commitment order.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">The day after the judge signed the commitment order, an unsigned document entitled \u201cfindings and order of referee disposition #1)\u201d was filed. Two boxes were checked off on this form. Next to these boxes was boilerplate language taken from Welfare and Institutions Code sections 726,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> subdivision (c), and 734.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The record does not reveal who checked these boxes. The judge\u2019s name is typed at the top of the form, but neither the name nor the signature of the referee who conducted the dispositional hearing appears.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">On this record, the majority holds that the juvenile court judge (1) \u201cexpressly approved\u201d the referee\u2019s order removing appellant from his home (\u00a7 249),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and (2) \u201cfully satisfied\u201d himself that the minor would benefit from Youth Authority commitment (\u00a7 734).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">In holding that section 249 was complied with, the majority interprets the words, \u201cexpressly approved,\u201d as requiring a mere countersignature by the judge of the referee\u2019s order. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 26.) This analysis is erroneous for several reasons. First, there was <em>no </em>signed order by the referee which the judge could have countersigned. It is unlikely that the Legislature meant to do away with the referee\u2019s signature altogether, since the word \u201ccountersign\u201d implies the existence of a prior signature to be authenticated. Moreover, even if one were to assume that the referee\u2019s order was the unsigned document entitled \u201cfindings and order of referee (disposition # 1),\u201d the judge cannot be deemed to have \u201ccountersigned\u201d this order, since it was not prepared until <em>after </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>judge had signed the commitment papers and it was never signed by the judge.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">By focusing on the act of countersignature, the majority misreads the Legislature\u2019s intent in requiring express approval by a judge of a referee\u2019s order. The majority opinion bases its narrow reading of section 249 on the advisory committee comment to rule 1318 of the California Rules of Court. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 26.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The advisory committee, in turn, relied on the report of a special juvenile justice study commission in 1960. (Governor\u2019s Special Study Com. on Juvenile Justice, Part I, Recommendations for Changes in California's Juvenile Court Law (1960) p. 36.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Recommendation 19, subdivision (C), of the report reads in part: \u201cIn the event the child is removed from his home, the referee\u2019s order is final when <em>countersigned </em>by the juvenile court judge, provided no request for review is made within the three day period.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">However, the comment to Recommendation 19 shows that the express . approval provision of section 249 was meant to require more than a mere countersignature by the juvenile court judge. At the time the commission recommended enactment of section 555 (now \u00a7 249), current law required referees \u201cto submit [all] their findings to the juvenile court judge for final approval prior to the implementation of the disposition.\u201d (Governor's Special Study Com., Part I, <em>supra, </em>at p. 36.) The commission believed this procedure \u201cplace[d] an excessive burden on the conscientious juvenile court judge who [was] already overworked and <em>often force[d\\ approval to be rendered on a perfunctory basis.\u201d (Ibid., </em>italics added.) Therefore, the commission recommended that this approval procedure be dropped altogether where the referee did not \u201cremove the child from his home.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>In all other dispositions, however, the prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>procedure\u2014requiring something more than \u201capproval... on a perfunctory basis\u201d\u2014was to be retained. In the present case the referee\u2019s order was for the removal of appellant from his home. Clearly, something more than \u201cperfunctory\u201d approval of that order by the judge was contemplated by the Legislature when it enacted section 249. (See <em>In re Dale S. </em>(1970) 10 Cal.App.3d 952, 956 [89 Cal.Rptr. 499].)</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">The appellate record in the present case is devoid of any indication that the judge\u2019s express approval of the referee\u2019s order\u2014if such approval can be inferred from the act of signing the commitment to the Youth Authority\u2014constituted anything more than a perfunctory act. It is clear that the judge did not have the benefit of a reporter\u2019s transcript of the dispositional or jurisdictional hearings for they were not prepared until three months later. The judge did not have the benefit of the referee\u2019s written order (if the unsigned \u201cfindings and order of the referee\u201d is indeed the referee\u2019s order), since it was not filled out until the next day.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Finally, there is no indication that the judge \u201cdid have the benefit of an 11-page probation officer\u2019s report. .. .\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 25.) Although this report was in existence and hence theoretically available to the judge, there is a distinction between having it available and actually reviewing it. Indeed, the record does not even reflect that the probation report was transferred from the courtroom where the dispositional hearing was held to the courtroom of the judge who signed the commitment to the California Youth Authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">In addition to section 249, the California Constitution requires more than a mere perfunctory approval by a juvenile court judge of a referee\u2019s order to remove a minor from his home. Article VI, section 22 of our state Constitution restricts referees <em>to the </em>exercise of \u201csubordinate judicial duties.\u201d <em>(In re Edgar M. </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 727 [122 Cal.Rptr. 574, 537 P.2d 406].) There is no question that the conduct of a contested dispositional hearing and the removal of a minor from his home are <em>not </em>subordinate judicial duties. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 735.) Therefore, to comply with the state Constitution, a referee\u2019s removal order must be reviewed and adopted in a meaningful way by a juvenile court judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">The majority asserts that a judge\u2019s mere signature satisfies the constitutional command so long as the right to a rehearing before a judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>is available. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 26.) However, mere endorsement does not suffice to make a referee\u2019s order that of a judge. (See <em>In re Edgar M., supra, </em>14 Cal.3d at p. 738.) While a minor may waive his statutory right under section 252 to a rehearing, such a waiver cannot expand the authority of a referee beyond the limits set by the citizens of this state when they approved article VI, section 22. In effect, the majority\u2019s holding allows referees, on their own, to remove minors from the custody of the parents, a clear violation of the California Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">The majority has also diluted the duties imposed on a juvenile court judge when committing a minor to the California Youth Authority. In enacting section 734, the Legislature set forth specific language that before a juvenile may be committed to the California Youth Authority, a <em>\u201cjudge </em>of the court\u201d must be <em>\u201cfully satisfied </em>that the mental and physical condition and qualifications of the ward are such as to render it probable that he will be benefited by the reformatory educational discipline or other treatment provided by the Youth Authority.\u201d (Italics added.) Section 734 is the <em>only </em>statute among the surrounding provisions in the Welfare and Institutions Code that requires action by a <em>judge </em>rather than by the <em>juvenile court, </em>which would include the court referees. (See \u00a7 725 et seq.; compare \u00a7 249.) In pinpointing the \u201cjudge\u201d as opposed to the juvenile court generally, the Legislature made clear that it was the judge\u2019s duty to <em>personally </em>evaluate the minor\u2019s suitability before any commitment could be made to the Youth Authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">By ignoring this requirement and focusing on Welfare and Institutions Code section 726, which provides that no juvenile may be taken from the physical custody of a parent \u201cunless upon the [dispositional] hearing the court finds one of [certain enumerated] facts,\u201d the majority sidesteps the real issues presented by this case. There is no question that section 726 was satisfied.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This single-minded focus on section 726 enables the majority to overlook the requirements of sections 249 and 734 that a <em>judge </em>of the juvenile court must perform certain duties when a minor is placed outside his home or committed to the California Youth Authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">In other contexts, this court has required judges to express their reasons for dispositional choices because it serves important judicial interests. <em>(In re Sturm </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 258, 269-270 [113 Cal.Rptr. 361, 521 P.2d 97]; <em>Topanga Assn. for a Scenic Community </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 506, 516-517 [113 Cal.Rptr. 836, 522 P.2d 12]; <em>In re Podesto </em>(1976) 15 Cal.3d 921, 937 [127 Cal.Rptr. 97, 544 P.2d 1297].) Without a written statement by a judge of the reasons for a decision, the appellate courts cannot determine whether a judge has properly exercised his authority. (Commentary, Standards Relating to Dispositional Proceedings, <em>supra, </em>Standard 7.1, p. 53; see also Commentary, National Advisory Commission on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals, Report on Corrections, <em>supra, </em>pp. 195-196; and F. Cohen, <em>Sentencing, Probation, and the Rehabilitative Ideal: The View from Mempa v. Rhay, supra, </em>47 Tex.L.Rev. at p. 25.) A juvenile court\u2019s discretion is limited in making Youth Authority commitments, since such commitments are considered dispositions of last resort under the Juvenile Court Law. (See \u00a7 202 (former \u00a7 502);<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>In re Aline D. </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 557, 566 [121 Cal.Rptr. 816, 536 P.2d 65]; <em>In re Arthur N. </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 226, 237 [127 Cal.Rptr. 641, 545 P.2d 1345]; <em>In re Maria A. </em>(1975) 52 Cal.App.3d 901, 903 [125 Cal.Rptr. 382].) Accordingly, a statement of reasons by the court is necessary if the appellate courts are to determine whether the juvenile court has acted within its statutorily limited discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Appellate review of the juvenile court judge\u2019s express approval of the referee\u2019s, order can hardly be meaningful on the record now before this court. The court is asked to assume (1) that the judge gave his express approval to the referee\u2019s order; (2) that the judge based the presumed express approval on a document which he may never have seen; and (3) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>that the reasons the judge had for giving his presumed approval were among the reasons contemplated by the statute which required him to act.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">Further, where the Legislature has made the juvenile court judge\u2019s performance of a prescribed duty (i.e., the personal evaluation called for by sections 249 and 734) the precondition to a critical dispositional decision, due process requires that there be meaningful appellate review of the judge\u2019s discharge of that statutoiy duty. <em>(Kent </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1966) 383 U.S. 541 [16 L.Ed.2d 84, 86 S.Ct. 1045].)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Meaningful review depends upon the judge\u2019s setting forth with sufficient specificity the reasons for his dispositional decision. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 561 [16 L.Ed.2d at p. 97].) The appellate court \u201cmay not \u2018assume\u2019 that there are adequate reasons....\u201d <em>(Ibid) </em>Yet this is precisely what the majority has done here. It has \u201cpresume[d] from the judge\u2019s approval of the [commitment] order that the judge relied upon the same or similar reasons as those stated by the referee.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 24.) This presumption flies in the face of the facts that the referee\u2019s oral statement of reasons was untranscribed at the time of the judge\u2019s authorization and that the record does not indicate that the judge considered any materials related to the case before signing the commitment order. By indulging such a presumption, the majority serves notice that it will tolerate perfunctory compliance with sections 249 and 734 and abdicates this court\u2019s responsibility to assure fulfillment of the Legislature\u2019s purpose in enacting these statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>In building an adequate record the judge of the juvenile court guards \u201cagainst the careless decision, insuring that the judge himself analyzes the problem and recognizes the grounds for his decision.\u201d <em>(In re Podesto, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d at p. 937; see <em>In re Sturm, supra, </em>11 Cal.3d at p. 269.) Although an articulation of reasons does not guarantee fairness, it certainly \u201cpull[s] in that direction.\u201d (K. Davis, Disretionary Justice, <em>supra, </em>p. 131.)</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">If the juvenile court expresses the rationale for a specific disposition, public faith in the judicial process is reinforced, and the parties and the public are persuaded that \u201cdecision-making is careful, reasoned and equitable.\u201d <em>(In re Podesto, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d at p. 937.) Regrettably, these goals have not been advanced by the majority\u2019s endorsement of perfunctory performance of judicial responsibilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">Tobriner, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a rehearing was denied May 25, 1978.

The majority improperly implies that because \u201cthe minor in the present case is retained within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court\" (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 23), the present proceedings are not critical. More than a decade ago, the Supreme Court held that adjudication proceedings <em>within </em>the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction were sufficiently critical to compel the basic protections of due process, since such proceedings carry within them \u201c. . . the awesome prospect of incarceration in a state institution until the juvenile reaches the age of 21.\u201d <em>(In re Gault </em>(1967) 387 U.S. 1, 36-37 [18 L.Ed.2d 527, 551, 87 S.Ct. 1428] [fn. omitted].) In the same year, the court held that the right to counsel applies to adult sentencing proceedings given \u201cthe critical nature of sentencing.\u201d <em>(Mempa </em>v. <em>Rhay </em>(1967) 389 U.S. 128, 134 [19 L.Ed.2d 336, 340, 88 S.Ct. 254]; see <em>In re Perez </em>(1966) 65 Cal.2d 224 [53 Cal.Rptr. 414, 418 P.2d 6].) No reason appears why juvenile dispositional proceedings are not similarly \u201ccritical,\u201d particularly when they involve the risk of commitment to the Youth Authority, the most drastic placement alternative contemplated by the Juvenile Court Law.
