Article XVI, section 16 of the California Constitution provides that the basis for calculating taxation of property located in a redevelopment project shall be \u201cthe assessment roll used in connection with the taxation of such property by [the local taxing agencies], last equalized prior to the effective date of [the ordinance adopting the redevelopment plan].\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Constitution also provides that tax revenue collected from property in a redevelopment project may be shared by the local taxing agencies and the redevelopment agency. It is the formula for tax allocation between the taxing agencies and the redevelopment agency which the present case addresses.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>That formula is as follows: \u201c(a) That portion of the taxes which would be produced by the rate upon which the tax is levied each year by .. . [the] taxing agencies upon the <em>total sum of the assessed value of the taxable property </em>in the redevelopment project as shown upon the assessment roll used in connection with the taxation of such property by such taxing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>agenc[ies], last equalized prior to the effective date of such ordinance [adopting the redevelopment plan], shall be allocated to . . . the funds of the respective taxing agencies . . .; and [If] (b) That portion of said levied taxes each year in excess of such amount shall be allocated to ... a special fund of the redevelopment agency . . . .\u201d (Italics added.) (Cal. Const., art. XVI, \u00a7 16.)</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">In essence this section provides that if, after a redevelopment project has been approved, the <em>assessed valuation of taxable property </em>in the project increases, the taxes levied on such property in the project area are divided between the taxing agency and the redevelopment agency. The taxing agency receives the same amount of money it would have realized under the assessed valuation existing at the time the project was approved, while the additional money resulting from the rise in assessed valuation is placed in a special fund for repayment of indebtedness incurred in financing the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">This case presents a problem, however, which arises from an ambiguity in the constitutional provisions. As the provisions declare, the \u201cassessed value of the taxable property in the redevelopment project as shown upon the assessment roll\u201d governs the calculation and allocation of tax revenues. Yet the meaning of the phrase \u201ctaxable property\u201d is unclear: does the language refer to that property in a redevelopment project which is taxable <em>each year </em>at the time taxes are imposed, or do the words refer to that property which <em>was taxable </em>at the time the original base assessment roll was prepared? If subsequent to redevelopment the public agency acquires a portion of the formerly taxable property within the redevelopment area, that property attains <em>tax exempt </em>status. Taxes then derived from that property are no longer available for division between the redevelopment agency and the taxing agencies. Under those circumstances, how should the taxes received from the balance of the project be divided?</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">A 1960 opinion of California Attorney General Stanley Mosk elucidates the issue. \u201cTo illustrate the problem,\u201d he explains, \u201cit is helpful to consider a hypothetical situation. Assume there is an area which is to be redeveloped and that there are four parcels of property in this area, A, B, C and D. Each had an assessed value of $100 on the last equalized assessment roll prior to the effective date of the ordinance approving the redevelopment plan (hereinafter referred to as the base roll). After <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>redevelopment parcels A, B and C had an assessed value of $200 each and parcel D had an assessed value of $150. Assume also that the rate of tax is a constant 10%. And assume, finally, that parcel A is later acquired by another public agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">\u201cPrior to redevelopment the total taxes raised in the area are $400 X 10% or $40, and the taxing agencies are entitled to the entire amount. After redevelopment, the total taxes raised are $750 X 10% or $75 and the taxing agencies are entitled to $40 and the redevelopment agency special fund is entitled to $35 ....</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-5\">\u201cAfter the acquisition of parcel A by another public agency, the total taxes drop to $550 X 10% or $55. How is the $55 divided between the taxing agencies and the redevelopment agency special fund? There are three possible results and an argument to support each. The first is the redevelopm[e]nt agency special fund gets $35 and the taxing agencies get $20 on the theory that the redevelopment agency special fund should continue to receive the amount representing the total increase in assessed value which occurred after redevelopment. The second is that the taxing agencies should continue to receive $40 and the redevelopment agency special fund receives only $15 on the theory that the taxing agencies should continue to receive the full amount that they were entitled <em>to </em>receive when redevelopment was first completed. The third possible result is that the taxing agencies get $30 and the redevelopment agency special fund gets $25 on the theory that each ought to share proportionately in the loss of revenue due to the removal from the tax roll of the specific parcel of property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-6\">\u201cThe result turns on the proper interpretation of the phrase \u2018the total sum of the assessed value of the taxable property in the redevelopment project as shown\u2019 upon the base roll which appears in Article [XVI], section [16], subsection (a), <em>supra. </em>Although the first alternative could only be reached by a tortured construction of the above words, the language could support either of the other alternatives. The fact that the \u2018total sum of the assessed value\u2019 is referred to might be used to argue that the amount of taxes due to the taxing agencies should never fall below the amount which they would have received if the total assessed value as carried on the base roll were used in computing the tax. The more reasonable conclusion, however, is that the taxing agencies should receive only the amount of taxes which they would have received had there been no redevelopment project and that this amount is to be computed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>applying the current rate to the total sum of the assessed value of the remaining taxable property on the base roll. In other words, the \u2018total sum of the assessed value of the taxable property\u2019 must be redetermined whenever any parcel of property ceases to be \u2018taxable property.\u2019 \u201d (35 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 211, 212-213 (1960).)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">For reasons which we shall explain, we agree with the Attorney General that the \u201cassessed value of the taxable property\u201d within the redevelopment project must be redetermined whenever project property is acquired by a tax exempt agency, and thus that the loss of tax revenue resulting from that acquisition should be divided proportionately between the redevelopment agency special fund and the taxing agencies. The trial court in the present case' arrived at a contrary conclusion; declining to redetermine the assessed value of taxable property, it placed the entire loss of revenue on the redevelopment agency. We therefore reverse the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">On Februaiy 24, 1965, and by amendment on March 17, 1970, the Council of the City of San Bernardino adopted ordinances approving the redevelopment plan for Central City Project No. 1, Calif. R-79. The plan provided that after the effective date of the ordinance approving the plan, any taxes levied upon taxable property within the project would be allocated pursuant to the Community Redevelopment Law. The plan further provided that plaintiff Redevelopment Agency of the City of San Bernardino could issue bonds payable from any source authorized by state law, including tax revenues allocated and paid to the agency\u2019s special fund. The redevelopment agency subsequently authorized the issuance of $14,800,000 of bonds secured by an irrevocable pledge of its tax revenues.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">After adoption of the plan, the redevelopment agency acquired certain property in the project that had been taxable at the time of the plan\u2019s adoption. The agency leased portions of the property to the city for a term of 50 years for use as a pedestrian mall and public parking lot. The agency deeded other formerly taxable property to the city for streets and public rights of way. Defendant County of San Bernardino does not presently tax this city-owned and city-leased property.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">On April 24, 1973, the redevelopment agency requested that the county assessor reduce the sum of assessed value shown on the project base assessment roll by the assessed value, as shown on the roll, of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>property acquired by the city, and reallocate tax revenues for the 1973-1974 tax year received from property within the project on the basis of the requested adjustment. When the county assessor refused to comply, the agency filed the underlying petition for writ of mandate to compel the requested base roll adjustment and reallocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">The trial court initially identified the purpose underlying the constitutional provision for tax increment financing of community redevelopment; \u201cto return to the taxing agencies the tax revenues they would have received had there been no redevelopment, and to permit the increase above that formerly received from the blighted area to be used to pay off the cost of redevelopment.\u201d Finding that the change in status of property from taxable to tax exempt occurred \u201cpursuant\u201d to the redevelopment plan and was in part \u201cresponsible for any increase in the assessed valuation of property within the redevelopment,\u201d the court held that reduction of the assessment roll would frustrate the constitutional purpose by dramatically decreasing the amount of tax revenues available to the defendant taxing agencies<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and by providing a \u201cwindfall\u201d in increased revenues to the redevelopment agency. Accordingly the court denied the petition for writ of mandate and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Plaintiffs first contend that the trial court\u2019s decision interpreting \u201ctaxable property\u201d as used in article XVI, section 16 to mean property shown as taxable property on the base assessment roll abandons a long established construction that \u201ctaxable property\u201d means <em>currently </em>taxable property. Plaintiffs cite <em>Redevelopment Agency </em>v. <em>Malaki </em>(1963) 216 Cal.App.2d 480, 489 [31 Cal.Rptr. 92], in which the court stated that the word \u201ctaxable\u201d is \u201cdescriptive of a fluid legal status and has no temporal import, perhaps describing status at any time, that is, whenever taxes are being assessed and collected.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>In <em>Malaki, </em>the Capitol Mall redevelopment project covered 10 blocks of downtown Sacramento. A year after adoption of the redevelopment plan, when the state determined to buy four blocks of the project from the redevelopment agency for use as a freeway, the redevelopment agency and the state agreed to eliminate the assessed value of the four-block area from the base assessment roll. Although the redevelopment plan was subsequently amended to accommodate the acquisition, the chairman of the county board of supervisors refused to sign the agreement on the ground that it violated article XVI.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">In granting the redevelopment agency a writ of mandate to compel the chairman\u2019s signature, the Court of Appeal rejected the chairman\u2019s literal reading of article XVI, which would have \u201cunalterably peg[ged]\u201d future tax revenue payable to the local taxing agencies at an amount equal to that which the total of all assessed values in the project area as shown on the assessment roll last equalized would produce. (216 Cal.App.2d at p. 485.) Acknowledging that the draftsmen of article XVI clearly recognized the creation of tax exemptions through public acquisition, the court noted that \u201c[nevertheless, in referring to the \u2018last equalized\u2019 assessment rolls, the draftsmen overlooked the fact that these rolls are physical, tangible documents on which properties are immutably inscribed, even though some ... might someday pass into public ownership and hence provide no tax revenue.\u201d (216 Cal.App.2d at p. 486.)</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">The court resolved this ambiguity in favor of the constitutional objective; \u201cThe objective is to make augmented property values the source of new tax revenue to be used for servicing tax allocation bonds; to facilitate redevelopment by facilitating the bonds and not to present general government with a tax windfall by immunizing it against the loss occasioned by public acquisitions. The word \u2018taxable,\u2019 then as it appears in subdivisions (a) and (b) of article [XVI], section [16], is aimed at future exclusion of publicly owned property; thus the total assessed value shown upon the assessment rolls last equalized before the effective date of redevelopment approval is to be diminished, from time to time, by the assessed values, as shown upon those rolls, of any properties acquired by tax-exempt public entities.\u201d (216 Cal.App.2d at p. 490.)</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">Defendants attempt to distinguish <em>Malaki </em>from the present case. As they argue, <em>Malaki </em>held merely that the <em>agreement </em>to eliminate the assessed value of the freeway blocks did not violate article XVI. In approving the parties\u2019 agreement, however, the court in <em>Malaki </em>clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>found that article XVI mandated the agreed upon readjustment. Moreover, the defendants\u2019 limited reading of a case interpreting constitutional language is especially unwise in light of other decisions approving the result in <em>Malaki. </em>In <em>Redevelopment Agency </em>v. <em>Cooper </em>(1968) 267 Cal.App.2d 70 [72 Cal.Rptr. 557], the court held <em>Malaki </em>applicable to a redevelopment project whose plan was amended for the purpose of acquiring property to be devoted to use as a public subway station.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">Similarly, the Attorney General opinion quoted earlier, in answer to the question, \u201cWho must bear the loss in revenue which follows the acquisition of taxable property in a redevelopment project by another public agency,\u201d stated that \u201c[t]he more reasonable conclusion\u201d is that the \u201ctaxing agencies should receive only the amount of taxes which they would have received had there been no redevelopment project and that this amount is to be computed by applying the current rate to the total sum of the assessed value of the remaining taxable property on the base roll.\u201d (35 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 211, 213 (1960); see also 56 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 464, 472, fn. 7 (1973), approving <em>Malaki.) </em>Under this reasoning, realty located within Central City Project No. 1 and owned by or leased to the City of San Bernardino is not \u201ctaxable property\u201d for the purposes of computing allocation of tax revenues.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">That this conclusion leads to the \u201cmore reasonable\u201d result is clear. Under the trial court\u2019s approach, the situation may well arise in which the redevelopment agency special fund would receive no income from taxes, and therefore may have no means to pay off loans, assessments, indebtedness and interest. The practical effect of such a result would be to cripple the redevelopment program: as plaintiffs emphasize, a redevelopment agency will be unable to sell its bonds if purchasers cannot depend upon the agency\u2019s having a source of revenue from which to meet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>its obligations. \u201cIt is unreasonable to assume that either the Legislature or the people intended such a result.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (35 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 211, 213.)</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Thus we reject the trial court\u2019s distinction that property acquired by a public entity \u201cpursuant\u201d to a redevelopment plan remains taxable, while property in a redevelopment project which \u201cpasses into public ownership for purposes unrelated to the scheme of redevelopment\u201d becomes nontaxable. This distinction would require not only the difficult determination of what would have occurred \u201cbut for\u201d the adoption of a redevelopment plan; it would also increase the uncertainty as to adjustment of the base roll for public acquisitions, thereby seriously impairing the redevelopment agency\u2019s ability to determine the increase in assessed value which secures its bonds. Moreover, the court\u2019s distinction is inconsistent with the clear language of article XVI, section 16, providing that \u201cAll property in a redevelopment project ..., <em>except publicly owned property not subject to taxation </em>by reason of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>ownership, shall be taxed in proportion to its value . . . , and such taxes . . . shall be levied and collected as other taxes are levied and collected by the respective taxing agencies.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">Besides distorting redevelopment financing, the trial court\u2019s decision frustrates the Legislature\u2019s fundamental goals in providing for community redevelopment, for the trial court would penalize redevelopment projects for their acquisition of property for public improvements. The Legislature has specifically stated that \u201ca fundamental purpose of redevelopment is to .. . provide an environment for the social, economic, and psychological growth and well-being of all citizens,\u201d and thereby to remedy the blight which \u201cinadequate public improvements, public facilities, open spaces, and utilities\u201d cause. (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 33071,33032, subd. (d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Our decision will not defeat the objective that the trial court identified as a \u201cpurpose\u201d of tax increment financing, that is, \u201cto return to the taxing agencies the tax revenues they would have received had there been no redevelopment.\u201d The allocation of tax revenues for redevelopment pursuant to article XVI is limited to that amount necessary to pay the costs of redevelopment; once the redevelopment debts have been repaid, \u201cthen all moneys thereafter received from taxes upon the taxable property in such redevelopment project shall be paid into the funds of the respective taxing agencies as taxes on all other property are paid.\u201d (Cal. Const., art. XVI, \u00a7 16, subd. (b).) Thus the sooner the special redevelopment agency fund pays the costs of redevelopment, the sooner will the trial court\u2019s objective\u2014to preserve tax revenues to the taxing agencies\u2014be attained.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">In holding that the words \u201ctaxable property\u201d as used in article XVI, section 16 means property <em>currently </em>taxable, we are mindful of our own injunction regarding interpretation of constitutional provisions. (2) \u201cWhen certain constitutional constructions have been acquiesced in for years, under which vested rights have grown up, it would b,e dangerous to disturb them, and better on the ground of public policy, to sanction than destroy public confidence, by inquiring whether they are correct or not.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wells </em>(1852) 2 Cal. 198, 208.) The record in the present case demonstrates that the administrative practice in several California counties and cities for the past 15 years has been to exclude from the base assessment roll the assessed value of property acquired by public entities for public use, in reliance upon the decisions in <em>Redevelopment Agency </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number><em>Malaki, supra, Redevelopment Agency </em>v. <em>Cooper, supra, </em>and upon the opinions of the Attorney General previously cited.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">To summarize, we have attempted to set forth the reasonable and accepted interpretation of the Constitution\u2019s language \u201cassessed value of the taxable property in the redevelopment project\u201d when project property is acquired by a tax-exempt agency. We think \u201ctaxable property\u201d means property currently taxable; we believe that the assessed value of the taxable property should be redetermined so that the loss of the revenue resulting from the acquisition should be divided proportionately between the redevelopment agency special fund and the taxing agencies. In so doing we not only follow the interpretation of the Attorney General and the courts; we apply a practical and common sense approach, eschewing the reversal of decisions which would result in the destruction of the security of many millions of dollars of outstanding tax allocation bonds.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">We reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">Bird, C.

Proposals have been made by Los Angeles and San Francisco city officials, as well as by the League of California Cities and prospective redevelopers, that legislation be created to make possible liquidation of funds used in redevelopments through the increased tax revenues from the redevelopments themselves.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-10\">\u201cSuch a proposal would take the form of a constitutional amendment.

If the taxes in the amount of the increase above that received formerly from the blighted area could be placed in a special fund, it is believed they would be sufficient to pay off the community\u2019s loss in the acquisition, demolition and resale of the land. It has been pointed out by its proponents that if legislation were passed to allow such an allocation of taxes, it would remove redevelopment programs from community politics and would establish a climate of direct fiscal estimating understood and preferred by private enterprise. The committee recommends that this proposal be further explored and investigated with the purpose of presenting such a constitutional amendment to the electorate of the State.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b297-10\">The Legislature as well has acquiesced in this interpretation of the Constitution.
