J.</author>\n<p id=\"ASS\">Appellant, Wilford Wayne Barton, contends that he was deprived of his right under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution to the competent assistance of counsel on appeal, in that the attorney appointed to represent him in the Court of Appeal failed to present an adequate appellate record from which that court could reach the merits of his search and seizure issue. This contention has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">On November 18, 1975, an information was filed in the Orange County Superior Court, charging appellant with robbeiy (Pen. Code, \u00a7 211) and burglary (Pen. Code, \u00a7 459) and further alleging he had used a firearm in the commission of those offenses (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12022.5). Appellant pleaded not guilty and denied the \u201cuse\u201d allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">' Appellant subsequently moved to suppress certain evidence pursuant to Penal Code section 1538.5. The hearing on that motion required two court days, January 2 and January 9, 1976; at the conclusion of the hearing, the motion was denied. Thereafter, appellant\u2019s case proceeded to jury trial and he was found guilty of second degree robbery and second degree burglary. The jury determined the \u201cuse\u201d allegation to be untrue and the court sentenced appellant to prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">A timely notice of appeal was filed and an appellate record was prepared in due course (cf. Cal. Rules of Court, rule 33(a)). It included a reporter\u2019s verbatim transcript of the proceedings held on January 9th on the section 1538.5 motion to suppress. However, the record did not include a reporter\u2019s transcript of the January 2d session at which witnesses for both sides had testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">Appellant requested the appointment of counsel on appeal, and after his indigency was established, the Court of Appeal granted his request. The attorney appointed to represent appellant filed an opening brief in which he argued that the section 1538.5 motion had been erroneously denied. The attorney did not request that the appellate record be augmented or corrected to include a reporter\u2019s transcript of the January 2d proceedings. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 12.) Instead, counsel based his argument on (1) the evidence adduced at appellant\u2019s trial, (2) the testimony elicited at the January 9th session on the motion to suppress, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>and (3) the \u201cstatement of expected testimony\u201d in a memorandum of points and authorities filed in the trial court by the prosecutor in opposition to the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">The Attorney General, in his brief before the Court of Appeal, argued that the failure of appellant\u2019s attorney to provide a reporter\u2019s transcript of the entire hearing on the motion to suppress precluded appellant from seeking review of this ruling. Calling the defect a \u201cgross dereliction of duty,\u201d the Attorney General asked the Court of Appeal to \u201creject any contentions of error raised in appellant\u2019s brief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Appellant\u2019s counsel took no steps to augment or correct the record, and two months later the Court of Appeal affirmed appellant\u2019s convictions. It held that, \u201cIt is the duty of the appellant to produce an adequate record. This, he has not done. We are thus precluded from making a meaningful review of his contentions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">Appellant\u2019s attorney did not file a petition for rehearing in the Court of Appeal. Appellant himself filed a petition for hearing before this court, alleging he had not been afforded the adequate assistance of counsel. His petition was granted. Counsel was appointed to represent appellant before this court and the record on appeal was augmented to include, inter alia, a reporter\u2019s transcript of the proceedings of January 2d.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">California statutory law permits criminal defendants to appeal as a matter of right from a final judgment of conviction upon a jury verdict in the superior court. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1237, subd. 1.) While such appeals are not mandated by the United States Constitution, the Fourteenth Amendment<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to the Constitution requires that \u201conce established, these avenues [of appellate review] must be kept free of unreasoned distinctions that can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>only impede open and equal access to the courts.\u201d <em>(Rinaldi </em>v. <em>Yeager </em>(1966) 384 U.S. 305, 310 [16 L.Ed.2d 577, 581, 86 S.Ct. 1497].)</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">Among such \u201cUnreasoned distinctions\u201d are those based on the income or assets of a litigant. \u201c[A] State may not grant appellate review in such a way as to discriminate against some convicted defendants on account of their poverty.\u201d <em>(Douglas </em>v. <em>California </em>(1963) 372 U.S. 353, 355 [9 L.Ed.2d 811, 813, 83 S.Ct. 814].) Rather, \u201c[i]n all cases the duty of the State is to provide the indigent as adequate and effective an appellate review as that given appellants with funds . . . .\u201d <em>(Draper </em>v. <em>Washington </em>(1963) 372 U.S. 487, 496 [9 L.Ed.2d 899, 906, 83 S.Ct. 774].) Thus, an indigent who is entitled to appeal is constitutionally entitled to \u201ca complete and effective appellate review of his conviction ....\u201d <em>(Entsminger </em>v. <em>Iowa </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 748, 752 [18 L.Ed.2d 501, 504, 87 S.Ct. 1402].)</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">The Supreme Court has identified at least two \u201cbasic tools\u201d <em>(Britt </em>v. <em>North Carolina </em>(1971) 404 U.S. 226, 227 [30 L.Ed.2d 400, 403, 92 S.Ct. 431]) that are constitutionally necessary for a \u201ccomplete and adequate\u201d appeal by an indigent: (1) a competent attorney on appeal, acting as an advocate on behalf of the indigent (see, e.g., <em>Douglas </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>372 U.S. 353; <em>Anders </em>v. <em>California </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 738 [18 L.Ed.2d 493, 87 S.Ct. 1396]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Feggans </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 444 [62 Cal.Rptr. 419, 432 P.2d 21]); and (2) an appellate record that will permit a meaningful, effective presentation of the indigent\u2019s claims (see, e.g., <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>Illinois </em>(1956) 351 U.S. 12 [100 L.Ed. 891, 76 S.Ct. 585, 55 A.L.R.2d 1055]; <em>Mayer </em>v. <em>City of Chicago </em>(1971) 404 U.S. 189 [30 L.Ed.2d 372, 92 S.Ct. 410]; <em>March </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 422 [102 Cal.Rptr. 597, 498 P.2d 437, 66 A.L.R.3d 945].) Appellant contends, inter alia, he was effectively denied his right to a competent appellate attorney before the Court of Appeal. This court agrees.* 1<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">It is a firmly established principle of our law that the Fourteenth Amendment to the federal Constitution requires that an indigent accused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>be afforded the assistance of counsel on appeal. <em>(Douglas </em>v. <em>California, supra </em>372 U.S. 353; <em>In re Banks </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 337, 342 [93 Cal.Rptr. 591,482 P.2d 215].)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In order to meet these constitutional standards, appointed appellate counsel must \u201cact... in the role of an active advocate in behalf of his client, as opposed to that of <em>amicus </em>curiae.\u201d <em>(Anders </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>386 U.S. at p. 744 [18 L.Ed.2d at p. 498].) Moreover, counsel \u201cmust not only perform as an advocate, but must perform competently as well.\u201d <em>(In re Banks, supra, 4 </em>Cal.3d at p. 342.)</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">This court has, on several previous occasions, set forth some of the specific duties which appointed appellate counsel must fulfill to meet his or her obligations as a competent advocate. These include \u201cthe duty to prepare a legal brief containing citations to the [appellate record<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] and appropriate authority, and setting forth all arguable issues, and the further duty not to argue the case against his client.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lang </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 134, 139 [113 Cal.Rptr. 9, 520 P.2d 393]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Stephenson </em>(1974) 10 Cal.3d 652, 661 [111 Cal.Rptr. 556, 517 P.2d 820]; <em>In re Banks, supra, 4 </em>Cal.3d at p. 342; <em>In re Smith </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 192, 197 [90 Cal.Rptr. 1, 474 P.2d 969]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Feggans, supra, 61 </em>Cal.2d at p. 447.)</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">Obviously, if counsel has a duty to cite to the appellate record in support of his contentions, then counsel has a duty to insure that there is an adequate record before the appellate court from which those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>contentions may be resolved on their merits. Where the appropriate record is missing or incomplete, counsel must see that the defect is remedied, by requesting augmentation or correction of the appellate record (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 12) or by other appropriate means (see, e.g., Cal. Rules of Court, rule 10(c)). Otherwise, counsel has not provided that advocacy which permits \u201cfull consideration and resolution\u201d of the appeal, as required by the Constitution. <em>(Anders </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>386 U.S. at p. 743 [18 L.Ed.2d at pp. 497-498].)</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">In the present case, appellate counsel argued in the Court of Appeal that the superior court had erroneously denied appellant\u2019s pretrial motion to suppress evidence. Appellate review of such a contention, following a judgment of conviction in the superior court, normally requires a reporter\u2019s transcript of the evidentiary proceedings on the motion to suppress.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 33(b)(2)(a).) The record before the Court of Appeal was deficient in this respect, since it contained no reporter\u2019s transcript of the first of the two days of hearings on the motion. Counsel\u2019s failure to appreciate or correct this defect constituted the inadequate assistance of counsel on appeal, since it precluded \u201cfull consideration and resolution of the matter.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>(Anders </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>386 U.S. at p. 743 [18 L.Ed.2d at p. 498].) Therefore, appellant is entitled to a redetermination of his appeal, assisted by competent counsel.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">Appellant has asked this court to abandon what he describes as the \u201c \u2018farce and sham\u2019 or \u2018farce and mockery\u2019 standard\u201d for measuring the incompetence of counsel.  It is unnecessary for this court to do so in the present case, since the standard which appellant attacks is not, and has never been, the standard used to test the adequacy of appellate counsel appointed pursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment. None of the decisions by the United States Supreme Court in this area have mentioned that standard, nor was it employed by this court in <em>Feggans, Smith, Banks, Stephenson, </em>or <em>Lang ***</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(See also <em>People </em>v. <em>Rhoden </em>(1972) 6 Cal.3d 519 [99 Cal.Rptr. 751, 492 P.2d 1143].) Instead, these decisions require that the adequacy of appellate counsel for indigent criminal defendants be measured by their performance of the \u201cspecific duties\u201d <em>(In re Smith, supra, </em>3 Cal.3d at p. 197) required by the Constitution. The \u201cfarce or sham\u201d standard is not involved in this context.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">Appellant was. denied his right under the Fourteenth Amendment to the competent assistance of counsel on appeal because his former counsel failed to obtain an appellate record adequate for consideration of appellant\u2019s claims of error. This cause is transferred to the Court of Appeal, Fourth Appellate District, Division Two, with directions to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>appoint counsel for appellant and to reconsider his appeal. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lang, supra, </em>11 Cal.3d at p. 136.)</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">Tobriner, J., Mosk, J., Clark, J., Richardson, J., Manuel, J., and Jefferson, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b547-10\">This opinion employs the unspecific term \u201cFourteenth Amendment\u201d throughout because it is unclear from the prior cases which provision or provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment underlie the decisions handed down in this area by the United States Supreme Court. Some cases specify the equal protection clause alone; some point to both the equal protection and due process clauses; some rely on a mixture of equal protection and due process principles; and many decisions simply do not mention any particular provision. (E.g., cf. <em>Britt </em>v. <em>North Carolina </em>(1971) 404 U.S. 226, 227 [30 L.Ed.2d 400, 403, 92 S.Ct. 431], with <em>Mayer </em>v. <em>City of Chicago </em>(1971) 404 U.S. 189, 193 [30 L.Ed.2d 372, 377, 92 S.Ct. 410], and <em>Anders </em>v. <em>California </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 738, 744 [18 L.Ed.2d 493, 498, 87 S.Ct. 1396], and <em>Eskridge </em>v. <em>Washington Prison Bd. </em>(1958) 357 U.S. 214, 216 [2 L.Ed.2d 1269, 1271, 78 S.Ct. 1061].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b548-7\">It is unnecessary to reach appellant\u2019s remaining contentions which include the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-8\">(1) whether the state fulfilled its duty under the Fourteenth Amendment to provide appellant with a complete and effective appellate record;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-9\">(2) whether the appellate proceedings were fundamentally unfair in contravention of the due process clauses of the federal Constitution;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-10\">(3) whether appellant was deprived of a right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-11\">(4) whether appellant was denied any right under California\u2019s independent Constitution.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b549-7\">Since it is well settled that the principles of the Fourteenth Amendment cases apply \u201cwhenever a state affords a direct or collateral remedy to attack a criminal conviction\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Shipman </em>(1965) 62 Cal.2d 226, 231 [42 Cal.Rptr. 1, 397 P.2d 993]; see also <em>Lane </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1963) 372 U.S. 477, 484 [9 L.Ed.2d 892, 897, 83 S.Ct. 768]), counsel must also be provided for an indigent (1) who brings a collateral attack on his conviction, once he has made \u201cadequately detailed factual allegations stating a prima facie case\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Shipman, supra, </em>62 Cal.2d at p. 232) or (2) who appeals from the denial of such a collateral attack, where such an appeal is permitted by law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b549-8\">Previously, in specifying the duties of appointed appellate counsel, this court has used the phrase \u201ccitations to the transcript\u201d rather than \u201ccitations to the appellate record.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lang </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 134, 139 [113 Cal.Rptr. 9, 520 P.2d 393]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Feggans, supra, </em>67 Cal.2d at p. 447.) Reference to a \u201ctranscript\u201d is somewhat ambiguous, since the California Rules of Court, rule 33(a), provides for both a \u201cclerk\u2019s transcript\" and a \u201creporter\u2019s transcript\u201d as part of the \u201cnormal record\u201d on appeal from a judgment of conviction in the superior court. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Gaston </em>(1978) 20 Cal.3d 476, 481-482 [143 Cal.Rptr. 205, 573 P.2d 423]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Silva </em>(1978) 20 Cal.3d 489, 492 [143 Cal.Rptr. 212, 573 P.2d 430].) Moreover, an appellate court may consider items not contained in either the clerk\u2019s or reporter\u2019s transcripts, such as exhibits. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 33(a)(3) and (b)(3); rule 10(c); rule 12(a). See <em>People </em>v. <em>Gaston, supra, </em>20 Cal.3d at p. 485.) Thus, a more accurate description of counsel\u2019s duties on appeal is the requirement that counsel make citations to the appellate record, rather than to a transcript.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b550-5\">The Rules of Court do permit the parties, if they so desire, to \u201cpresent the appeal on an agreed statement. . . .\u201d (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 36(a).) No such procedure was employed in appellant\u2019s case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Under the liberal rule for augmentation of the appellate record in rule 12(a) of the California Rules of Court <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gaston, supra, </em>20 Cal.3d at pp. 482-484; <em>People </em>v. <em>Silva, supra, </em>20 Cal.3d at p. 493), appellant would clearly have been entitled to have an augmentation motion granted, since the transcript of the missing day\u2019s proceedings clearly was relevant to an issue appellant was raising in his appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b550-7\"><em>People </em>v. <em>Siegenthaler </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 465 [103 Cal.Rptr. 243, 499 P.2d 499] is not inconsistent with this result. In that case, the defendant moved in the trial court to set aside the information (Pen. Code, \u00a7 995). He argued at the motion that he should not have been held to answer at his preliminary hearing, because the evidence introduced against him at that hearing was the product of an illegal search and seizure. The trial court denied the section 995 motion. Defendant thereafter moved to .suppress that same evidence for the same reasons at a de novo hearing in the superior court (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1538.5). The court denied this motion also.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">On appeal from his conviction, the defendant contended, inter alia, that the denial of each of these motions had been error. However, the appellate record did not contain the preliminary examination transcript, which was necessary to appellate review of the section 995 motion. This court held that this gap in the record precluded appellate review of the section 995 motion. The court was careful to note, however, that the same search and seizure issue was properly before the court on review of the section 1538.5 motion and that by this route the court was able to reach the merits of the issue raised at the section 995 motion. In these limited circumstances, the court declined to address <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>separately the propriety of the denial of the section 995 motion. The result of <em>Siegenthaler </em>would have been otherwise if the gap in the appellate record had totally precluded this court from addressing the search and seizure issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b551-11\">The \u201cfarce or sham\u201d standard was mentioned in connection with the competence of appellate counsel in <em>In re Yurko </em>(1974) 10 Cal.3d 857, 866 [112 Cal.Rptr. 513, 519 P.2d 561]. There, the appellant challenged the adequacy of both his trial counsel and his appellate counsel. In rejecting these claims, this court stated, \u201cThis is not a case where, because of either trial or appellate counsel\u2019s lack of diligence or skill, petitioner\u2019s trial or appeal was reduced to a farce or a sham. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Ibarra </em>(1963) 60 Cal.2d 460, 464 [34 Cal.Rptr. 863, 386 P.2d 487]; <em>In re Smith </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 192, 198-200 [90 Cal.Rptr. 1, 474 P.2d 969].)\u201d <em>(In re Yurko, supra, </em>10 Cal.3d at p. 866.)</p>\n<p id=\"b551-12\">This statement noted that <em>People </em>v. <em>Ibarra, supra, </em>60 Cal.2d 460, had employed a \u201cfarce or sham\u201d standard for measuring the adequacy of <em>trial </em>counsel. However, the statement in <em>Yurko </em>was not meant to suggest that a farce or sham standard applied to appointed <em>appellate </em>counsel; <em>Smith, </em>the case cited therein to support the reference to appellate counsel, did not employ the farce or sham standard. On the contrary, <em>Smith </em>measured the adequacy of appellate counsel based on whether he had raised \u201cerror[s] that <em>arguably </em>might have justified a reversal,\u201d even if a competent presentation of those asserted errors \u201cmight not have compelled reversal.\u201d (Italics added.) <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 200, 201.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b552-5\">Assigned by the Chairperson of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
