J.</author>\n<p id=\"AWd\">A minor who has been detained in custody on a petition filed against him in the juvenile court is entitled to have his jurisdiction hearing<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> within 15 judicial days of his detention hearing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 320, 334, 636, 657.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In the present case, this court must decide whether such a minor may be detained for more than these 15 judicial days when a <em>second </em>petition is filed which is based on the same transactions as the initial petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">At 4:30 a.m. on July 19, 1977, petitioner, Robin M., a 16-year-old minor, was taken into temporary custody (\u00a7 625) by an officer of the Los Angeles Police Department and detained at the County Central Juvenile Hall. On July 21, 1977, at 11:45 a.m.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> a petition was filed in the juvenile court, alleging that the minor came within that court\u2019s jurisdiction under section 602 because he assertedly had committed seven violations of Penal Code section 211 (robbery).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">A detention hearing was held later that same day before a referee, who ordered petitioner detained in the juvenile hall. The minor denied the allegations of the petition and the matter was set for a jurisdiction hearing on August 12.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>At 9 a.m. on August 12, the time set for the jurisdiction hearing, petitioner announced he was ready for trial, and the prosecutor informed the court he expected to be ready at 1:30 p.m. that afternoon. At 1:30, the prosecutor indicated he was unable to proceed and requested a continuance because the investigating police officer, an essential witness in the case, was on vacation. Relying on sections 657 and 700.5, the court denied the motion for a continuance, dismissed the petition \u201cwithout prejudice for lack of prosecution,\u201d and released petitioner from custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Petitioner was then taken to the juvenile hall to be released. However, the police rearrested him and the juvenile probation officer redetained him before he was physically released from custody. On August 15, a second petition, virtually identical to the dismissed petition, was filed against the minor. A detention hearing was held later that same day and petitioner denied the allegations of this second petition and the court ordered him detained. A jurisdiction hearing was set for September 6.  Petitioner thereupon filed this request for the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus and his release from custody pending the jurisdiction hearing.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1473.)</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">Petitioner contends that the Legislature has limited by statute the maximum length of time a juvenile may be detained prior to a jurisdiction hearing. Therefore, he contends that he may not be detained for a period longer than the statutory maximum by using the device of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>dismissing the original petition and filing a new one based on the same transactions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This contention has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">California\u2019s statutes dealing with the detention of minors during the pendency of juvenile court proceedings are largely a product of the Legislature\u2019s overhaul of the Juvenile Court Law in 1961. (Stats. 1961, ch. 1616, p. 3476.) In enacting the 1961 revisions, the Legislature substantially followed the recommendations and proposals of a special study commission on juvenile justice which were issued in 1960.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> That commission found that one of the \u201cmajor problems\u201d with California\u2019s Juvenile Court Law was the \u201cexcessive and unwarranted detention of children in the state.\u201d (Commission Report, pt. I, at p. 12; see also <em>In re William M., supra, </em>3 Cal.3d at pp. 25-26.)</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">A \u201cbasic concern of the Commission is the length of time minors are held in detention pending hearings on petitions. While the estimated average length of time between arrest and the juvenile court hearing presently varies from two to three weeks, the Commission knows of numerous cases in which there has been a delay of between one and two months before the hearing was held. We also have knowledge of a case in which a minor was held in the juvenile hall for six months pending the juvenile court hearing!</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">\u201cThe Commission notes that in most counties children who are detained do not have their juvenile court hearings appreciably earlier than those who are not detained. As a result, the time spent in juvenile halls pending the court hearing amounts to a \u2018sentence,\u2019 even though the court may later decide to grant probation or dismiss the petition. It is indeed difficult to reconcile the practice of detaining a child one to six months prior to the juvenile court hearing with the protective philosophy of the juvenile court.\u201d (Italics omitted.) (Commission Report, pt. I, at P-28.)_</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>In order to \u201cminimize the length of detention\u201d (Commission Report, pt. II, at p. 18), the commission recommended that \u201cmaximum time limits for hearings should be set forth in the law\u201d and that \u201c[priority should be given ... to reducing the time spent in detention prior to a finding of jurisdiction.\u201d (Commission Report, pt. I, at p. 28.) To implement its recommendations, the commission proposed specific statutes, which it enumerated in its report <em>(id., </em>Appen. A, at pp. 51-99), and which the Legislature enacted with few modifications. Those time limits on hearings and detentions remain virtually intact.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">A minor may be taken into \u201ctemporary custody\u201d (\u00a7 625 [\u00a7 305]) by a peace officer, who, if he does not release the minor outright or upon a citation, must deliver custody of the minor \u201cwithout unnecessary delay\u201d to the juvenile probation officer. (\u00a7 626 [\u00a7 307].)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The probation officer must then \u201cimmediately investigate the circumstances of the minor and the facts surrounding his being taken into custody\u201d and must \u201cimmediately\u201d release the minor, unless one or more specified conditions exist.

The minor \u201cshall be released within 48 hours after having been taken into custody, excluding nonjudicial days, unless within said period of time a petition to declare him a ward has been filed ,..(\u00a7 631, subd. (a) [\u00a7 313].)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b374-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>Once a petition is timely filed, the detained minor is entitled to a detention hearing \u201cas soon as possible but in any event before the expiration of the next judicial day after a petition ... has been filed.\u201d (\u00a7 632 [\u00a7 315].)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> If the minor is not released at the detention hearing, the court may further detain him \u201cfor a period not to exceed 15 judicial days.\u201d (\u00a7 636 [\u00a7 320].)</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">The jurisdiction hearing must commence \u201cwithin 15 judicial daysi.[<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>] from the date of the order of the court directing such detention\u201d if the minor is detained or if the minor has been released from custody \u201cwithin 30 days\u201d of the filing of the petition. (\u00a7 657 [\u00a7 334].) The commencement of the hearing may be postponed only under certain limited circumstances.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Among these is a provision that <em>\u201c[e]xcept where a minor is in custody, </em>any hearing on a petition ... may be continued by the court for not more than 10 days in addition to any other continuance authorized in this chapter [\u00a7\u00a7 200-945] whenever the court is satisfied that an unavailable and necessary witness will be available within such time.\u201d (Italics added.) (\u00a7 700.5 [\u00a7 354].)</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Clearly, the Legislature intended that a minor be released from detention if a jurisdiction hearing is not held within 15 judicial days of the detention hearing, since it specifically limited the length of time a court may order a minor detained following the detention hearing to 15 judicial days (\u00a7 657). Further, it refused to provide for any rehearing or extension of that detention order when the original 15-day period <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>expires.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The district attorney and juvenile probation department concede this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">In the present case the district attorney sought to avoid the release of the minor after 15 judicial days by using the technique of dismissing the original petition, filing a new petition based on the same transactions, and, after a detention hearing on this second petition, detaining the minor for a new period of 15 judicial days. Such a procedure completely frustrates the Legislature\u2019s purpose in strictly limiting preadjudication detention. Ultimately, it leads to the detention of minors for periods of time that the special study commission condemned as \u201cexcessive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">The facts of the present case are illustrative: although petitioner waived only one day of time <em>(ante, </em>fn. 5, at p. 340), he remained in preadjudication detention from the day of his arrest on July 19 until his jurisdiction hearing on September 6\u201449 calendar days. A preadjudication detention of this length is well beyond the threshold of one month that the commission found \u201cdifficult to reconcile ... with the protective philosophy of the juvenile court.\u201d (Commission Report, pt. I, at p. 28; see <em>ante, </em>at p. 342.)</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">Moreover, the refiling process completely nullifies the Legislature\u2019s desire to provide \u201cearly hearings for juveniles who are detained\u201d and to give \u201c[pjriority ... to hearing detained cases.\u201d (Commission Report, pt. I, at pp. 28, 29.) In the present case petitioner\u2019s jurisdiction hearing commenced 47 calendar days after the filing of the first petition, well past the <em>\u201cmaximum </em>time limits for hearings\u201d as set forth in section 657. (Italics added.) <em>(Id., </em>at p. 28.) Indeed, petitioner\u2019s hearing was held beyond the 30-day limit provided for petitions involving <em>non-detained </em>minors (\u00a7 657), and past the additional 10-day period which may be permitted in such cases when a necessaiy witness is unavailable (\u00a7 700.5).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b376-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>Two arguments are advanced to support the continued detention of petitioner under the second petition. It is contended that rule 1351(e) of the California Rules of Court authorizes the detention of a minor in this situation.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Rule 1351 was promulgated by the Judicial Council under its authority to \u201cestablish rules governing practice and procedure in the juvenile court <em>not inconsistent with law.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) (\u00a7 265.) However* as the previous analysis of legislative history established, the statutes governing the detention of minors do not permit a detention to last more than 15 judicial days past the minor\u2019s detention hearing. If the hearing leading to a finding of jurisdiction does not commence within that period, the minor is entitled to be released from custody on that transaction whether the hearing is continued or a new petition based on the same transaction is filed. Insofar as rule 1351 is inconsistent with this legislative intent, it is disapproved.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">If a minor is to be released from further detention because his jurisdiction hearing will not commence within 15 judicial days of his detention hearing, the petition against him need not and in most <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>instances should not be dismissed.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Rather, the minor should be discharged from custody, the petition reset for hearing within the time prescribed for cases of nondetained minors (\u00a7 657), and continued thereafter if sanctioned by the statutes governing non-detention cases. (See, e.g., \u00a7 700.5.) In this way, a minor who is initially detained but subsequently released under sections 636 and 657 will have his jurisdiction hearing conducted at least as quickly as a non-detained minor. This procedure conforms to the Legislature\u2019s intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">The vice of the alternative of dismissal and refiling is illustrated by the present case. If petitioner had been released from custody on August 12, his jurisdiction hearing on the second petition could have been held as many as 30 calendar days after it was filed (\u00a7 657). This would be 58 days after petitioner\u2019s arrest or 56 days after the filing of the first petition. This would have been an excessive delay under the standards enunciated by the commission for the hearing of cases of non-detained minors.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">However, if the original petition had been reset within the time limits for non-detained minors, the jurisdiction hearing could have been held as early as August 15 (the next judicial day) or as late as August 22.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> This procedure ensures a speedier jurisdiction hearing by 23-30 calendar days.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">A minor must be discharged from custody if his or her jurisdiction hearing is not held within 15 judicial days after a detention hearing. If the juvenile court releases a minor pursuant to the command of sections 636 and 657, the Legislature\u2019s intent is completely frustrated if a district attorney can simply seek the dismissal of one petition and file a second based on the same transaction. Therefore, this court holds that a juvenile detained in preadjudication custody for the maximum period allowed by law must be released from such detention, whether the jurisdiction hearing is continued or a new petition is filed based on the same transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>Since petitioner is no longer subject to the unlawful detention order issued at the time the second petition was filed, the order to show cause has served its purpose and is discharged. The writ of habeas corpus is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">Tobriner, J., Mosk, J., Clark, J., Richardson, J., Manuel, J., and Newman, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b370-8\">California juvenile court law provides for a jurisdiction hearing to determine \u201cwhether or not the minor is a person described by Section 300, 601, or 602\u201d of the Welfare and Institutions Code, thus establishing whether or not the juvenile court may exercise its jurisdiction over the minor. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 701, 702.)</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">In the present case, as will be seen, the minor was alleged to come within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court on the basis that he was a \u201cperson who [was] under the age of 18 years when he violate[d] [a] law of this state . . . .\u201d (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 602.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b370-10\">The purpose of a detention hearing in juvenile court is to ascertain whether the minor need be detained in custody pending his jurisdiction hearing. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 630, 632, 635, 636.) As this court has previously noted, \u201cthe Legislature [has] indicated its intention that detention be the exception, not the rule.\u201d <em>(In re William M. </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 16, 26 [89 Cal.Rptr. 33, 473 P.2d 737].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b370-11\">All references hereinafter to code sections are to the Welfare and Institutions Code, unless specifically indicated otherwise; all references to rules are to the California Rules of Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b370-12\">This was 55 hours after petitioner was taken into temporary custody. (Cf., <em>post, </em>fn. 11, at p. 343.) None of these 55 hours fell on a nonjudicial day.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b370-13\">Petitioner agreed to waive one day of his right to a speedy jurisdiction hearing so that the hearing could be held one day beyond the limit of 15 judicial days set by section 657.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b371-9\">As a preliminary matter, the respondent juvenile probation officer asserts that this habeas corpus proceeding is moot, because the second petition was sustained on September 7, 1977, as to five of the allegations contained therein, and hence the minor is no longer confined under the prejurisdiction hearing detention order of which he complains. However, these events do not require this court to dismiss the petition. \u201c[I]f a pending case poses an issue of broad public interest that is likely to recur, the court may exercise an inherent discretion to resolve that issue even though an event occurring during its pendency would normally render the matter moot.\u201d <em>(In re William M., </em>supra, 3 Cal.3d at p. 23.) This court is especially loath to dismiss a case as moot if the issues presented arise from \u201csituations which are \u2018capable of repetition, yet evading review.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id., </em>fn. 14, at p. 23, quoting from <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Ogilvie </em>(1969) 394 U.S. 814, 816 [23 L.Ed.2d 1, 4, 89 S.Ct. 1493].)</p>\n<p id=\"b371-10\">The central issue in the present case meets both of these criteria, for it concerns an important recurring problem in the administration of this state\u2019s juvenile court law and is incapable of appellate review during the relatively brief life of the detention order. It is therefore appropriate for this court to address the merits of this petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b372-7\">Petitioner specifically does not challenge the propriety of filing a second petition after one has been dismissed because of a time problem; he attacks only his custodial status during the pendency of the second petition. Therefore, this court is not deciding whether there are limitations on the state\u2019s power to refile a petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b372-8\">The two parts of the commission\u2019s final report are: Report of the Governor\u2019s Special Study Commission on Juvenile Justice, Part I\u2014-Recommendations for Changes in California\u2019s Juvenile Court Law (1960) (hereinafter, Commission Report, pt. I); and Report of the Governor\u2019s Special Study Commission on Juvenile Justice, Part II\u2014A Study of the Administration of Juvenile Justice in California (1960) (hereinafter, Commission Report, pt. II).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b373-7\">The following discussion is geared to those statutes applicable to a minor, such as petitioner, who is alleged to come within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court pursuant to section 602 or 601. Separate but analogous statutes apply to a minor who is alleged to be a \u201cdependent child.\u201d (\u00a7 300 et seq.) These analogous provisions are noted in brackets.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b373-8\">Juvenile court proceedings may commence and a minor may be detained on bases other than the temporary custody provided for in section 625. (See, e.g., \u00a7\u00a7 604, 641, 653.) In all such instances, however, if a petition is filed, the time limits set forth herein are applicable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b373-9\">The record in the present case shows a patent violation of this 48-hour requirement of section 631. The report of the special study commission makes clear that the 48-hour period starts to run from the moment the minor is first taken into temporary custody by the arresting peace officer, not from the time the minor is received by the probation officer at juvenile hall. (Commission Report, pt. II, at pp. 106-107.) Since the initial petition in this case was not filed within 48 hours of his arrest (see, <em>ante. </em>fn. 4, at p. 340.), petitioner should have been released before his first detention hearing or, if the defect had not been discovered earlier, at that hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-10\">While there is an exception to this 48-hour requirement in cases where the minor \u201cwillfully misrepresents himself to be 18 or more years of age when taken into custody\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 631, subd.

I, at pp. 14, 27-29, 67-68, 70), but the Legislature provided for 15 (Stats. 1961, ch. 1616, \u00a7 2, pp. 3476, 3478).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b374-8\">Sections 682 [\u00a7 352] and 700 [\u00a7 353] authorize continuances at the request of the minor, the minor\u2019s parents, or the minor\u2019s attorney. The court may postpone the hearing when it is \u201cin doubt concerning the [minor\u2019s] mental health\u201d (\u00a7 705 [\u00a7 357]) or when it seeks to determine whether the minor is \u201ca danger to himself or others as a result of the use of narcotics ... or a restricted dangerous drug ....\u201d(\u00a7 708 [\u00a7 359].) In addition, when the minor has made an extrajudicial admission or confession and unexpectedly denies it at the hearing, the court may continue the hearing \u201cfor not to exceed seven days\u201d at the prosecutor\u2019s request.

This section also provides for a rehearing at the minor\u2019s request \u201cto consider evidence of a prima facie case.\u201d Neither of these rehearings, however, affects the 15-day time limits of section 636 and 657.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">Since the Legislature provided for a rehearing in these situations, it is apparent that its failure to provide for a rehearing to extend the 15-day period was deliberate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b375-10\">This conclusion is supported by section 700.5, which provides that when a \u201cnecessary witness\u201d for the prosecution is unavailable but is likely to become available within 10 days, the hearing may <em>not </em>be continued to obtain that witness if the minor is in detention. (\u00a7 700.5.) To permit the prosecutor to file a second petition based on the same transaction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>and detain the minor under the newly filed petition gives the prosecutor the very continuance which the Legislature rejected.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b376-7\">Rule 1351 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-8\">\u201c(a) If the minor is not detained, the clerk sljall, upon the filing of the petition, set the petition to be heard, and the hearing shall be commenced, within 30 calendar days from the date of the filing of the petition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-9\">\u201c(b) If the minor is detained at the time the petition is filed, the clerk shall set the petition to be heard, and the hearing shall be commenced, within 15 judicial days from the date of the order of the court directing detention.

This is incorrect. The Legislature provided for the release of minors, who might otherwise meet the criteria for detention, if (1) a petition is not filed within 48 hours after the minor was taken into custody (\u00a7 631, subd. (a)); or (2) a detention hearing is not held within one judicial day of the filing of the petition (\u00a7 632); or (3) the jurisdiction hearing is not commenced within 15 judicial days of the detention order (\u00a7\u00a7 636, 657).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b377-9\">A dismissal would not be inappropriate if it appeared unlikely at the time petitioner were released from custody that the jurisdiction hearing could be held within the time limits (including continuances) permitted in non-detention cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b377-10\">Since the 30th day following the filing of the initial petition fell on Saturday, August 20, the final day for the jurisdiction hearing was the following Monday, the next judicial day.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
