It alleged that it had been using said mark continuously since July 19, 1928, on sajd goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-27\">The appellee, Piggly Wiggly Corporation, filed its opposition to said application, alleging, by its notice of opposition, that on March 6, 1923, it had obtained the registration of a trade-mark, \u201cSunset Gold,\u201d for butter; that since that time it had expanded its business to include various other food products, including Canned fruits, canned vegetables, canned milk, and many other products; and that it believed it would be damaged by the registration of the appellant\u2019s mark \u201cSlices O\u2019Gold.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-28\">Several witnesses were called and examined by the opposer. This testimony shows the use of opposer\u2019s mark, \u201cSunset Gold,\u201d not only on butter, but on eanned fruits and vegetables, long prior to the use by appellant of its mark, \u201cSlices O\u2019Gold.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-29\">The Examiner of Interferences sustained the opposition, which decision was affirmed by the Commissioner, and from the latter decision the appellant has brought the case here. The Commissioner held that the marks were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1007\">*1007</page-number>confusingly similar; that the goods were of the same descriptive properties; and that any doubts should be resolved against the newcomer, the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-5\">In this court, the appellant admits that the respective goods of the parties are of the same descriptive properties, but claims that there is no confusing similarity of marks. The contention is also made that the burden was upon the op poser to prove confusion, and that it has failed to do so. The appellant further shows that on January 15, 1929, it registered, as a mark for canned fruits, \u201cSutter Slices O\u2019Gold,\u201d which it insists should have been taken into account by the Patent Office tribunals in determining whether the marks \u201cSunset Gold\u201d and \u201cSlices O\u2019Gold\u201d are confusingly similar.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-6\"> We agree with the Commissioner of Patents that the marks, when applied to goods of the same descriptive properties, are confusingly similar, and that the registration of appellant\u2019s mark should not be allowed. We cannot agree with the appellant that proof of actual confusion must be made in such cases, but confusion in such eases will be presumed. Such has been the force and effect of our decisions in similar cases, some of the more recent of which are Traub Mfg. Co. v. R. Harris &amp; Co., 53 F.(2d) 416, 19 C. C. P. A. 704; The American Prod. Co. v. Leonard, 53 F.(2d) 894, 19 C. C. P. A. 742; Hellman v. Oakford <em>&amp; </em>Fahnestock, 54 F.(2d) 423, 19 C. C. P. A. 816; Miller Becker Co. v. King of Clubs, 56 F.(2d) 883, 19 C. C. P. A. 1024; Derby Oil Co. v. White Star Refining Co., 62 F.(2d) 984, 20 C. C. P. A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-8\">If there were any doubt about this proposition, it ought to be resolved against the newcomer. We said, in California Packing Corp. v. Tillman &amp; Bendel, 40 F.(2d) 108, 113, 17 C. C. P. A. 1048: \u201c* * * The doctrine of the subject of doubt emanates from and is 'prompted by the fact that the applicant has the whole world to select from and it is no hardship to require him to select a trade-mark which will eliminate the probability of confusion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-9\">We are unable to see wherein the appellant\u2019s case is aided by his prior registration of \u201cSutter Slices O\u2019Gold.\u201d Even conceding that this might be a material circumstance, the appellee\u2019s use of its mark, \u201cSunset Gold,\u201d on goods of the same descriptive properties, antedated, also, the registration of appellant\u2019s latter named <em>mark. </em>It is quite apparent, however, to the court, that there is a considerable difference between the mark, \u201cSlices O\u2019Gold,\u201d and \u201cSutter Slices O\u2019Gold,\u201d and that there might well be a\" difference between said marks as to whether confusion in trade would result. That question, however, is not now before us, and the court expresses no opinion thereon, or as to the validity of the appellant\u2019s said registered mark, \u201cSutter Slices O\u2019Gold.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-10\">The decision of the Commissioner of Patents is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
