A playground apparatus comprising, a central support, a plurality of annularly disposed supports concentrically positioned relative to the central support, vertically spaced members connecting the annularly disposed supports, and radially disposed bars connecting the central support and the annular structure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aiy-dedup-1\">\u201c3. A playground apparatus comprising, a central vertical support, an annular strue-ture including spaced vertical supports and vertieally spaced horizontally disposed eon-neeting bars concentrically arranged relative to the central support, a plurality of series of vertically spaced horizontally disposed radial bars connecting the central support and the surrounding structure, the radial bars of one series being offset with relation to the radial bars of another series.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AVhP\">_ _ p's. A playground apparatus comprising, a central supporting structure forming a well, an outer structure formed of vertically and horizontally disposed bars, and radially disposed bars arranged in vertically spaced horizontal planes mounted upon and connecting said structures.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Afr\">The references relied upon are: Hinton, 1,471,465, October 23, 1923; Hinton, 1,488,-246, March 25, 1924; Hanlon, 1,707,854, April 2,1929.</p>\n<p id=\"atj-dedup-0\">The alleged invention is described in the statement of the Examiner as follows: <em>\u201c * </em>* * The device consists of a number of vertical supports arranged in a circle. Disposed at the center of the circle is another support. Annular members are positioned at vertically spaced intervals upon the circle of supports. A number of rods radiate from the central post and rest upon the annular members and are arranged at spaeed intervals. Arranged concentrically with the said annular members are a plurality of similar members of a lesser diameter and resting upon the radial rods. A structure is thus formed upon which children may climb and thus obtain exercise and recreation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A1uQ\">There should be added to said description the fact that appellant also discloses in his application an arrangement whereby the horizontal radial bars of one series in the device are offset with respect to the radial bars of another series.</p>\n<p id=\"avb-dedup-0\">The references disclose playground structures in the shape of stands provided with bars extending vertically and horizontally, and these stands are used by children on the playground for climbing, as is appellant\u2019s structure. None of the references, however, show, structures annular in form, nor do they show 20 series of horizontal bars offset with respeet to the horizontal bars of another series,</p>\n<p id=\"A5C\">The Board of Appeals agreed with the Examiner that appellant\u2019s arrangement is merely a matter of preference in design, and that, it being similar in construction, use, and purposes, and differing solely in design, it is not patentable over the references cited.</p>\n<p id=\"AZb4\">We think both tribunals of the Patent Of-flee failed to give sufficient consideration to certain features of appellant\u2019s device distinguishing it .from the devices shown in the ref - erenees. These distinguishing features eon-sist of a support in the center of the device, the arrangement of the outside posts in a cir-ele, and the arrangement of the radial crossbars out of alignment vertically,</p>\n<p id=\"a2c-dedup-0\">The fea\u00a3ure 0\u00a3 central support with radial bars extending to the outer' circle pro-rides narrow spaces between the bars near said central support and comparatively wider spaces between said bars near the outer eir0jej enabling younger children to climb around the device toward the inner part of \u00a3he device and older children to climb around the device toward the outer portion thereof. The device being circular in form, children are enabled to display a natural tendency to move in curved or circular paths, as is illustrated by many children\u2019s games and amusements. The feature of the radial bars, one series being offset with relation to the radial bars of ahother series, enables small children t\u00b0 ase the lowest series of bars for trapeze purposes, and larger children to use the next higher series of bars, offset from the lower aeries, for the same purposes. The offset feature also enables children to climb more readily about the device. It seems clear that appellant\u2019s device may be utilized for play by children of different ages to a much greater extent than is afforded by the devices in the Prlor arh</p>\n<p id=\"alj-dedup-0\">These features, we think, involve more than a mere preference in design, and we are of the opinion that they would not be obvious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1001\">*1001</page-number>from a study of the prior art, but involved the exercise of the inventive faculty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-5\">Claims 3 and 5' include all of the features above discussed, and claims I, 2, 4, 6, and 7 include them all except the feature of the offset of the radial bars. We hold that all of said claims should have been allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-6\">With respect to claims 8 and 9, we find that they do not include f\u00e9atures hereinbefore discussed which we hold involved 1he exercise of the inventive faculty, and we do not think that they present any patentable distinction over the prior art.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-7\">For the reasons stated, the decision of the Board of Appeals is reversed as to claims 1 to 7, inclusive, and affirmed as to claims 8 and 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-8\">Modified.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
