These various occurrences happened from six to (fight years prior to the date of the application in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-12\">The policy contained the following provision : \u201cThe right to recovery under this policy shall be barred in the event that any one of the statements in the application, material cither to the acceptance of the risk or to the hazard assumed by the company, is false, or in the event that any one of such statements is falso and made with intent to deceive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b793-13\">This is the second appearance of the case in this court. Further facts will be found in the opinion of the court on the first appeal, 43 F.(2d) 809, 811, 73 A. L. R. 298.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-15\">1. On the first trial, the court below directed a verdict for defendant on the ground that some, of the answers made by plaintiff in the application relative to rejections and amounts of indemnities received were false, and were material and increased the risk of loss; and that the question raised was one of law for the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-16\">On appeal from the judgment entered, this court reversed the judgment, and in its opinion discussed and construed section 6501, Compiled Laws of North Dakota, 1913, as having a direct bearing upon the ease. That section reads as follows: \u201cNo oral or written misrepresentation made in the negotiation of a contract or policy of insurance by the insured or in his behalf shall be deemed material or defeat or avoid the policy or prevent its attaching, unless such misrepresentation is made with actual intent to deceive, or nnless the matter misrepresented increased the risk of loss.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b793-17\">It clearly appears from the records of both trials in the court below and from the briefs on both appeals that the proper construction of said section 6501 was and is one of the vital issues in the case. A rehearing on the former appeal was asked but was denied. Certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States was also denied (282 U. S. 898, 51 S. Ct. 182, 75 L. Ed. 791).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-18\">In its opinion on the former appeal, this court used the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-19\">\u201cLooking first at the language of the North Dakota statute, deferring until later any study of decided eases construing it and similar statutes in other states, it seems to us to mean that no misrepresentation or false statement made in an application for insurance is ipso facto a defense. It is a defence only when it is proved that \u2018the matter misrepresented increased the risk of loss,\u2019 that is to say, when it is proved that the hazard insured against would be more likely to happen in the real state of the facts than in a state of facts not actually existing, hut falsely represented as the real state of facts. * ** \u00ab</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-20\">\u201cBut defendant earnestly contends that the language in section 6501 \u2018unless the matter misrepresented increased the risk of loss\u2019 means \u2018unless the matter misrepresented\u2019 was \u2018material to the risk,\u2019 and that under section 6484 any misrepresentation of a fact is \u2018material to the risk\u2019 if the fact would probably and reasonably have influenced the insurer in forming his estimate of the disadvantages of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>a proposed contract or in making Ms inquiries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-4\">\u201cNo decision of the Supreme Court of North Dakota supporting this construction has been cited. Cases are cited (e. g. Soules v. B. A. Y., 19 N. D. 23, 120 N. W. 760) which hold that that increases the risk which materially affects the risk and so much may readily be conceded. But there is no decision in North Dakota holding that what might reasonably influence an insurer\u2019s entering into the contract necessarily also increases the risk of loss under the contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-5\">\u201cSection 6484, which defendant in part relies on, reads as follows: \u2018Materiality is to be determined not by the event, but solely by the probable and reasonable influence of the facts upon the party to whom the communication is due in forming his estimate of the disadvantages of the proposed contract or in making Ms inquiries.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-6\">\u201cDefendant seeks to apply this section to section 6501 after first construing the words in section 6501 \u2014 \u2018increase the risk of loss,\u2019 as meaning \u2018material to the risk\u2019 \u2014 but such construction of section 6501 robs it of significance and purpose. The obvious intent of the section was to work some change in the pre-existing law. No change was accomplished, if, after its adoption in the same sense as before, whatever affects the acceptance of the risk still defeats the policy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">And further the court said [page 811 of 43 F.(2d)]: \u201cOur view is that the plaintiff\u2019s misrepresentation or, more accurately, his failure to disclose rejections and cancellations, when the explanation in evidence of all the facts surrounding them is considered, was not a misrepresentation as to a matter which so' undoubtedly increased the risk of accidental dismemberment as that reasonable <em>men </em>might not think otherwise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">The construction of the statute so an-no^^need has become the \u201claw of the case\u201d and will not be changed except for weighty reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-9\">In Pennsylvania Mining Co. v. United Mine Workers, 28 F.(2d) 851, 852, this court, speaking by Judge Kenyon, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-10\">\u201cIt is the well-established doctrine of the federal courts that, on a second writ of error or appeal, questions of law or fact determined upon the first hearing are not reconsidered, provided the evidence was substantially the same upon both trials. Under such circumstances questions of law determined on .a writ of error or appeal are the law of the ease, both for the trial court and this court on a second writ of error or appeal. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-12\">\u201cThere should be and is an exception to this rule, viz.: If convinced that a former decision is clearly erroneous and unsound, and works manifest injustice to the parties, an appellate court should not deem itself bound as to such parties by the rule of \u2018law of the case.\u2019 It is the general practice of .courts, however, \u2018to refuse to reopen what has been decided.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b794-13\">In Page v. Arkansas Natural Gas Corporation (C. C. A.) 53 F.(2d) 27, 31, the court, again speaking by Judge Kenyon, said: \u201cThe rule of \u2018the law of the case\u2019 is of course recognized by this court. The theory is that what has once been determined should not be reopened, well expressed by Mr. Justice Holmes in Messinger v. Anderson, 225 U. S. 436, 32 S. Ct. 739, 740, 56 L. Ed. 1152: \u2018In the absence of statute the phrase, \u201claw of the case,\u201d as applied to the effect of previous orders on the later action of the court rendering them in the same case, merely expresses the practice of courts generally <em>to </em>refuse <em>to </em>reopen what has been decided, not a limit to their power.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b794-14\">See, also, City and County of Denver v. Denver Tramway Corp., 23 F.(2d) 287 (C. C. A. 8); Federal Reserve Bank v. Omaha National Bank, 45 F.(2d) 511 (C. C. A. 8); Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. Van Dusen Harrington Co., 60 F.(2d) 394 (C. C. A. 8); \u00c6tna Life Ins. Co. v. Wharton (C. C. A. 8) 63 F.(2d) 378; National Bank of Commerce v. United States (C. C. A.) 224 F. 679.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-15\">We find no reason in the ease at bar for departing from the well-established rule!</p>\n<p id=\"b794-16\">It is true that on the first appeal the question of \u201cintent to deceive\u201d on the part of plaintiff was not stressed; but that question, under the evidence on the second trial, was, in our judgment, rightly submitted to the jury under proper instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-17\">It is also true that on the second trial, defendant introduced the testimony of one new witness; but that testimony was merely cumulative, and does not prevent the application of the doctrine of the \u201claw of the case.\u201d \u00c6tna Life Ins. Co. v. Wharton, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-18\">It follows, in view of the holding of this court on the former appeal, and in view of the evidence in the case, that the court below was right in denying the motion of defendant for a directed verdict upon the latest trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-19\"><em>2. </em>There remains the inquiry whether, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>submitting the questions to the jury, the court erred in its instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">The main error stressed is that the court instructed the jury as follows: \u201c * * * If you find there were such misrepresentations and they were untrue, and then you further find that sneh misrepresentations increased tin; risk of loss ot' the insured under the policy, then you should find for the defendant. But the mero fact, standing alone, that there were misrepresentations that were untrue and even knowingly made, if you fail to find that because of such misrepresentations under that defense that the risk of loss was increased, then the fact that there were some misrepresentations is immaterial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">Tn determining whether this portion of the charge was erroneous, regard must be had to other preceding portions.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">The court had pointed out that under section 6501 of the North Dakota Statute, two defenses were open: (1) That false representations were made with intent to deceive; (2) that false representations were made, and that they increased the risk of loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-8\">As to the first defense, the court charged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-R\">\u201cBut a false representation made with intent to deceive must, of course, not only be false, that is, not only untrue, but it must be false, that is, untrue and knowingly made, coupled with an intent to deceive the company. So before the defendant is entitled to recover or entitled to a verdict at your hands on that ground or under that defense the defendant must have proved to you by a fair preponderance of the evidence, one, that the representations alleged to be false or one or more of such representations, were in fact false, and, two, that plaintiff when he made the representation knew the representation was false, and, three, that he intended thereby to deceive the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b795-9\">This was clear, concise, and complete, and no exception was taken thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-10\">As to the second defense, the court charged: \u201cWith reference to the other defense pleaded by the defendant, namely, that the alleged false representations made by the plaintiff increased the risk of loss under the policy. * * * So with the defense of misrepresentations made increasing\u2019 the risk of loss, that defense is good only when it is proved that the matter misrepresented increased the risk of loss, that is to say, when it is proved that the hazard insured against would be more likely to happen in the real state of the facts than in a state of facts not actually existing but falsely represented as the real state of facts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b795-12\">This was in accord with the law as stated by this court on the former appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-13\">And later, in reference also to the second defense, the court gave the portion of the charge heretofore quoted, to which objection is made.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-14\">Still later, the court summarized its instructions under the two defenses as follows: \u201cI have instructed this jury that under the defense of false representations with intent to deceive, the defendant must prove not only that the representations were false, but that they were knowingly false and coupled with an intent to deceive; but as to the defense of increasing the risk of loss, under that defense, the defendant must prove, first, that they were misrepresentations and that such misrepresentations increased the risk of loss. The fact alone, under that defense, that they were false and made knowingly, unless it increased the hazard of the risk assumed by the company, they are immaterial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b795-15\">We think the trial court was right in thus distinguishing the two defenses under the statute (section 6501, supra); and that in giving the instructions (above quoted) as to the second defense, it followed correctly the holding of this court upon the former appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-16\">3. The remaining specifications of error relate to refusals of the court to give certain charges which were requested by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-17\">Wo have examined these requests, but are of the opinion that there was no reversible error in refusing them. The charge as given was clear, impartial, and covered the vital issues in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-18\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b795-19\">VAN VALKENBURGH,</author>\n<p id=\"aox-dedup-1\">Circuit Judge</p>\n<p id=\"A42d\">(concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-20\">I place my concurrence in the foregoing opinion of Judge BOOTH more specifically upon the ground that the history of this litigation makes the rule announced on the first appeal peculiarly applicable as the law of the ease. Standard Accident Insurance Company v. Rossi (C. C. A. 8) 52 F.(2d) 547, 549; Anderson v. Messenger (C. C. A. 6) 158 F. 250.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
