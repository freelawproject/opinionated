The Tieno Company ad-milted this indebtedness, but set up a counterclaim for $350,000 damages for breach of contract. The case was tried to a jury, which returned a verdict in favor of the Reno Company for $41,588.12. From the judgment entered upon the verdict, the Du Pont Com-piUiy has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"Anx\">The Reno Company had been, from the 23d day of O ctober, 1904, until the 1 st day of Dec timber, 1930, the sole distributor in the s),ate of Iowa of certain products manufae-Rjred only by the Du Pont Company, and intended mainly for the finishing, refinishing, and polishing 0\u00a3 automobiles. These prod-<em>were </em>referred to as Duco. The original contract between the parties, which was made in 1924, had been several times renewed, with slight variations, prior to October 1, 1927. On that date a contract substantially similar to those which preceded it was entered into. It was in the form of a letter prepared by the Du Pont Company and ae-cepted by the Reno Company. We set it forth in full:</p>\n<p id=\"ANO\">\u201cSeptember 1,1927.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AaZ\">\u201cClaiborne-Reno Co., 1023 Locust St., Des</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AT\">Moines, Iowa.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Amvg\">\u201cGentlemen: This will confirm our agreement' whereby you will act as sole distributor \u00b0\u00a3 0U1' SPray DuC0\u2019 Spray \u2122imer\u2019 Bluo Diamond Undercoats and Rubbing Com-g to auiomobile TofmisMng shops and furniture refinishing shops in the following territory, with the exception of such shops as We may find it necessary to serve direct becauso of their connection with manufacturing or industrial consumers of Duco materials,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A_q\">\u201cEntire State of Iowa.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Alm\">ls. understood and agreed that this contract is entered into upon the following conditions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AEu\">\u201cThat it is our intention and desire to continue under this agreement so long as your serviccs\u2019 in our Judgment, prove satisfactory.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AFo\">\u201cThat our object is to secure as rapidly as possible sufficient distribution of our Duco finish process to satisfactorily cover the terrilory in question among responsible refinislie/s vbo ^ ^ &amp; posilion to, provide ade_ quale facilities to enable them to turn out ^ls^\"c^ass work,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Abc\">% \u201cThat the sale of \u00b0ur material or process will not he limited by being connected with the sale or use of any othm-material, appa\u00abtus or process m whmh you are or may beeome ^rested, such as air brush equipment\u2019 \u00abPhojtery, materials, hardware, accessories&gt; cei'cra*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACq6\">\u201cThat you will endeavor to have your eus-tomers refrain from the use of competitive products, and that under no circumstances will such products be used in your shop,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2L\">\u201cThat you will not use, teach or recom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>mend processes of application and finishing not approved by us.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aof-dedup-0\">\u201cThat you will not grant exclusive rights for the use of our Duco Finish or process to any refinisher in any given territory without our written approval.

Poilt Com; pany gave notice to the Reno Company of ^ termination of tbe eo,ntraet effective the Deeember lst foUowing and it was this termination by the Du Pont Company which the Reno Company asserts constituted a breach 0f \u00a3be contract.</p>\n<p id=\"apa-dedup-0\">Tbe Company,s o\u00a3 action, briefly statedj ig tMg. Tbat y. bad since 1924 acted as tbe sole distributor for Duco in the state 0f iowa Under the agreement in question and similar agreements; that it had developed the territory and created a demand for fbe Eu p011f Company\u2019s products, had abandoned the sale of competitive products, had maintained facilities for instruction and demonstration in the use of and application 0f Duco-, had expended large sums of money jn furtherance of the Du Pont Company\u2019s interests, and had in all things carried out its obligations under the contract; that, under the terms of the contract, the Du Pont Company could not terminate it so long as the services of the,Reno Company were, in the judgnent of the Du Pont Company, satisfactory; that the termination of the contract was at a time when, in the judgment of the Du Pont Company, the services of the Reno Company were not unsatisfactory; that the Du Pont Company did not exercise good faith in terminating the agreement; and that the result of the refusal of the Du <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>Pont Company to continue was the destruc-Lion of the Reno Company's business.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">Tire question whether the termination of the contract by tire Pu Pont Company was in good faith, as claimed by it, or in bad faith., as claimed by the Reno Company, was submitted to the jury, and determined, adv&amp;rsely to the former. There had been a motion by the Pu Pont Company for a directed verdict at the close of the evidence, and the failure of the court to direct a verdict in its favor is assigned as error.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-14\">The important question in this case is whether the termination of this contract by lire Du Pont Company gave to the Reno Company a cause of action for damages. Reduced to its lowest terms, the elairn o~ the Peno Company is that what it bargained for and received from the Pu Pont Company was an agreement that it should be the sole dist\u00f1hutor of Duco in the state of Iowa so long as the Pu Pont Company was satisfied with its services and so long as it (the Reno Company) chose to perform the services; that the consideration for the promise on the part of tire Pu Pont Company was the promise of the Reno Company to act as solo distributor and to do the things which it was required to do under the agreement, and the performance of that promise. The Du Pont Company, on the other hand, claims that the contract was unentorceable because the Pu Pont Company did riot promise to continue until dissatisfied, and because of uncertainty ot. consideration and lac'k of mutuality of obligation; that it is a bilateral contract, depending for its consideration upon the mutual promises of the parties, and that, being ei~niinahl~ at will by the Reno Company, it was also terminable at will by the Pu Pont Company; and that the question whether,'in its judgment, the services of the Reno Corn-pruly were satisfactory, is not a justiciabie question.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-46\">There is much to be said in favor of requiring men to adhere strictly to their undertakings, whatever they may be, but there are certain established rules with reicrenee to contracts which are not to be disregarded, no matter how great tire hardship may be `which gi'aivs out ai an adherence to them. No doubt, the rule which requires mutuality of obligation with respect to contracts to be perfonaed in the future, where the promise of one party constitutes the sole consideration for the promise of the other, arises f~om what is regarded by the courts as the inherent unfairness of enforcing a contract which requires performance by one of the parties, but leaves the other party free to accept or reject performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-63\">With some of the contentions otf the Du Pont Company we cannot agree. It is urged that the language of the contract does not indicate a promise by the Dii Pont Company to remain bound until dissatisfied with the S(a~ViCCS of the Reno Company; that all that is expressed is a mere desire and intention to continue the contract while satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-71\">The mere expression of an intention or desire is not a promise. \"An intention is but the purpose a man forms in his own mind; a promise is an express undertaking, or agreement to carry the purpose into effect.

First Series, 5675; 1 Williston, Contracts (1920) \u00a7 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-81\">No special form of words, however, is necessary to create a promise. All that is necessary is that a fair interpretation of the words used shall make it appear that a promise was intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-86\">\"It is undoubtedly true, as argued by counsel, that neither express words of covenant, nor any particular technical words, nor any special form of words, is necessary in order to charge a party with covenant.\" Hale v.

Where one corporation presents to another corporation a form of agreement reciting, \u201cIt is understood and agreed that this contract is entered into upon the following conditions: That it is our intention and desire to continue under this agreement so long as your services, in our judgment, prove satisfactory,\u201d we have no doubt that such language would ordinarily be understood to mean a promise to continue until dissatisfied. See Horton v. Winbigler, 175 Cal. 149, 165 P. 423.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">We do not agree with the contention of the Du Pont Company that there was such uncertainty with reference to the quantity of its products to be taken by the Reno Company as to make the contract void.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-10\">The following language from the opinion of this court in Marrinan Medical Supply, Inc., v. Ft. Dodge Serum Co. (C. C. A. 8) 47 F.(2d) 458, 462, is applicable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-11\">\u201cIf the contract here in question were a pure contract of sale, the criticism of uncertainty would be formidable. But we have held that the contract is 'not purely one of sale. It partakes of the character not only of a sales contract, but also of a factorage contract, and perhaps also of a sales agency contract. In the two latter classes of contracts, uncertainty as to amount is inherent in their very nature. Where territory is to be exploited and orders to be solicited by salesmen, the number and amount of such orders cannot, of course, be foretold. They can be determined only by the potential demand of the territory and the diligence of the salesmen. Contracts of factorage or sales agency are -not invalid for such uncertainty, and we hold that the' present contract is not on that account invalid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-12\"><em>If </em>there is uncertainty, lack of mutuality, or lack of consideration in the contract with which we are concerned, it arises out of the fact that the Reno Company was in a position at any time to terminate the contract without incurring any liability therefor. Had the contract been one for a definite term, it might have been sustained upon the authority of Marrinan Medical Supply, Inc., v. Ft. Dodge Serum Co., supra. The only substantial difference between the contract in-, volved in that ease and this contract was that' the former was to continue for a definite period, and both parties were bound by it during that period. It is placing an unnatural construction upon this contract to hold that the promises made by the Reno Company and their performance constituted the consideration for the Du Pont Company remaining bound so long as it was satisfied, and that its promise in that regard was bought and paid for. The contract itself provides that the consideration for the services of the Reno Company is the discount of 25 per cent, upon all materials ordered from the Du Pont Company. The agreement was nothing more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>Ilian a sales agency agreement, terminable at will by the Beno Company, but containing a promise of the Du Pont Company to continue so long as satisfied with the services of its distributor. For that reason, it is not controlled by Conley Camera Co. v. Multiscope &amp; Film Co. (C. C. A. 8) 216 F. 892, which involved a contract containing- a promise of the Camera Company to sell cameras for an indefinite period to the Multiseope Company in consideration of the payment of $500 and an order for $9,000 worth of photographic wooden ware. We quote from <em>the </em>decision (pages 895 and 896 of 216 F.):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-5\">\u201cIt is also- insisted that judgment should have been rendered in its favor on the pleadings, because the contract is void for want of mutuality, and that there is no definite time within which it is to bo performed. It is true that an executory contract without any express consideration passing to the party who undertakes to sell certain property or perform certain services, when there is no corresponding obligation on the other party, will bo void for want of mutuality. But this rule does not apply when there is a valuable consideration paid by the one party to- the other party who obligates himself to do a certain tiling. [Citing Joy v. St. Louis, 138 U. S. 1, 11 S. Ct. 243, 34 L. Ed. 843.] * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-6\">\u201cOption contracts, whereby a party obligates himself, for a valuable consideration, to convey certain property, are of everyday occurrence. In none of them is there any obligation on the part of the would-be purchaser to make the purchase, that being* discretionary with the party to buy. But the obligor, having received a valuable consideration, cannot be heard to defeat the contract because the obligations are not mutual, as is the ease where the sole consideration is a promise for a promise.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">There are eases perhaps indicating that contracts like the one in question here are not void for uncertainty of consideration or lack of mutuality of obligation. Abrams v. George E. Keith Co. (C. C. A. 3) 30 F.(2d) 90; Coca-Cola Bottling Co., v. Coca-Cola Co. (D. C.) 269 F. 796.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">There are, however, eases in this and other circuits which indicate that the teimination of such a contract does not give rise to a cause of action:</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">A. Santaella <em>&amp; Co. </em>v. Otto F. Lange Co. (C. C. A. 8) 155 F. 719. This was a suit upon a promissory note and upon an account for goods sold and delivered. The answer admitted the debt and set up a counterclaim for damages in the sum of $30,000 resulting from an alleged breach of contract and the failure and refusal to ship cigars as required. The jury returned a verdict in favor of the defendant. Santaella &amp; Co. had entered into a contract with the Lange Company whereby the latter was to have the exclusive right to sell a certain brand of cigars in a certain territory during the life of the brand o\u00ed-as long as the Lange Company cared to sell them. The court said (page 721 of 155 F.):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-11\">\u201cThe controlling question for determina^ tion is: Did the defendants have an enforceable contract with the plaintiff? It must be conceded that, if the defendants had such a contract, it was essential to its validity that it should have been mutually obligatory upon both parties. If the defendants could compel the plaintiff to ship cigars, the plaintiff oug-lit to be in a position to compel the defendants to take. Were the defendants under any obligation to send in orders within any particular time, or for any specified quantity or quality of cigars? The allegations of the counterclaim and the version given of the agreement in the testimony of Otto F. Lange answer these questions. It was entirely at the option of the defendants, dependent upon the conditions of their business and trade, as to whether they would send in any orders at all. From any cause, such as depression in business, or other more desirable arrangements, or a desire to get out of that line of trade, the defendants were at liberty to cease at any time to send orders to the plaintiff, without liability for breach of contract.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-12\">The court held that the case was ruled by Cold Blast Transp. Co. v. Kansas City Bolt &amp; Nut Co. (C. C. A. 8) 114 F. 77, 57 L. R. A. 696. On petition for rehearing, the court said (page 725 of 155 F.):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-13\">\u201cIn support of the motion for rehearing counsel have extensively gone into a review of the case in the attempt to show that the opinion of the court improperly held that the contract in question was unilateral, placing-much stress upon the contention that the testimony of Mr. Lange tended to show that a part of his undertaking under the arrangement between the parties was that he should, by his experience and labor, extend the field for the sale of the cigars to be furnished by the plaintiff in error, thereby creating a larger market for them, and that he performed in this respect his undertaking-. Let it be so conceded. But how does this obviate the stubborn fact that whether or not he would maintain that field and demand, occupy or abandon it, or cease, ad libitum, to send in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>any orders, or betake himself to some other field of operation and employment, were wholly optional on the part of the defendant in error? The plaintiff in error, on suck election by its purchaser, was without remedy. It could not compel the proposed purchaser to Want any cigars. It could not ship a box of cigars, except as ordered by the purchaser. As shown in the opinion, both parties so recognized the situation and acted upon it when the defendant in error directed that the orders already in be not filled. That such a contract is one-sided, wanting in that mutuality essential to its enforcement, is settled in this jurisdiction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">Velie Motor Car Co. v. Kopmeier Motor Car Co. (C. C. A. 7) 194 F. 324. By a written contract, the plaintiff, an automobile manufacturer, purported to grant to the defendant for one year the exclusive right to sell its machines within certain territory, and agreed that they should be invoiced to the defendant at stated prices. The contract required the defendant to deposit $1,000, to order at least fifteen machines during the year, to sell under a guaranty for a year, to maintain a repair shop, and to keep at least one machine in stock for exhibition. The plaintiff did not obligate itself to sell to the defendant any machines, and reserved the right to return the deposit and cancel the contract at any time. The plaintiff sued for a breach of this contract. The court said (page 330 of 194 F.):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-5\">\u201cUnless the defendant received a consideration for its undertakings by being given the exclusive right to sell within the given territory, the contract lacks mutuality. But it will be seen that such right, if any, was made subject to plaintiff\u2019s right to arbitrarily, and without assigning any cause, cancel the contract. Defendant might well decline to go to the expense and trouble of advertising and developing the territory named, when its rights might at any time, be terminated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-6\">\u201cWhatever construction should be given to the contract, whether it be one of sale or of agency, while it remains executory there must be mutuality.

A. 7) 201 F. 499. This case involved an agreement between a manufacturer of automobiles and a dealer. The contract gave the dealer, for the term of one year, the exclusive right to sell its ears in a certain territory at a stated discount from list price, with a provision that no order should be binding unless submitted in writing and accepted by the manufacturer at least thirty days prior to the date for delivery. It further provided that it might be canceled by either party for just cause on thirty da3's\u2019 written notice. Another provision gave the right to cancel for a violation without notice. A supplemental clause bound the dealer to purchase fifty ears during the term of the contract and as many more as it could handle and the manufacturer could supply. The manufacturer gave \u2022notice of cancellation, and the dealer brought an action for damages. The court said, with reference to the clause relating to cancellation (page 504 of 201 F.):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-9\">\u201cIn reference to clause 12 it is frankly conceded in the brief on behalf of plaintiff \u2018that a contract for future delivery of personal property, which confers upon either party the arbitrary right of cancellation pri- or to the delivery, would be lacking in mutuality,\u2019 pursuant to the ruling of this court in the recent case of Velie Motor Car Co. v. Kopmeier Motor Car Co., 194 F. 324, 114 C. C. A. 284; but the contention is that the instant provision, to be \u2018canceled for just cause by either party,\u2019 does not fall within such rule, as it implies \u2018a rightful or lawful cause.\u2019 We believe use of the terms \u2018for just cause\u2019 to be insufficient to exempt the contract from the rule applied in the above-mentioned ease, as no means are furnished to ascertain what may have been the particular cause or causes thereby intended by both parties. That it did not mean violations of the contract terms appears from clause 14, which provides for termination for such cause \u2018without the notice prescribed\u2019 in the above provision. In Cummer v. Butts, 40 Mich. 322, 325, 29 Am. Rep. 530, like agreement for terminating the contract \u2018for good cause,\u2019 was held to afford no \u2018common and intelligible criterion for the parties, or any determinate sense whatever5 as to the cause, so that no breach was committed in terminating the contract.

A. 8) 251 F. 198. This was an action to cancel certain contracts whereby the plaintiff gave to the defendant, a manufacturer of composition roofing, the' exclusive right to use and sell patented cleats for such roofing during the life of the patent. With reference to the terms of the agreements involved,' the court said (page 203 of 251F.):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>\u201cTreating the three agreements as one final agreement, a summary of the obligations of appellee thereunder is as follows: To feature and offer to the trade the two cleats (Kant-Leak with all of its high-grade roofing, and Kontinuous with a popular grade roofing) during the life of the patents; to include favorable references to both cleats in its current advertising of roofing material, and to advocate their use and sale in such periodicals as might seem advisable to ap-pellee, such advertising and advocacy to continue during a substantial demand for the cleats, to the extent determined by the sound judgment of appellee; to pack Kant-Leak Kleets with all high-grade roofing, except where the customers might demand old-style fastenings; to maintain price of high-grade roofing so packed to within 5 cents per square of price with old-style fastenings; to purchase 150,000 sets (kind not specified) in last half of 1914 at monthly rato of 25,000 sets, delivered at Maurer, N. J., or Madison, 111. (as ordered by appellee), at 20 cents per set for Kant-Leak Kleets and 17 cents for Kontinuous Kleets. Of these obligations, which are so uncertain or indefinite that they cannot be determined and enforced? The requirements to feature and offer the cleats to tho trade are definite as to duration but uncontrolled as to manner or exient. The requirement to advertise and advocate their use is left undefined as to extent. The requirement to pack Kant-Leak Kleets with all high-grade roofing except where customer demands old-style is definite in the sense that it is an application to an established business (sale of high-grade roofing with fastenings), the limits of which can be ascertained. The requirement as to maintenance of high-grade roofing price is definite. The requirement as to purchase of 150,000 sets in 1914 may have been indefinite in its terms, but it was performed in all substaiitial respects before any attempted rescission, and therefore must be regarded as definite. There is no requirement that appellee purchase any Kontinuous Kleets after 1914.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-5\">\u201cThe contract was for the life of the patents, which would have continued, after the attack upon the contract, for about 11 years on the Kant-Leak Kleet and about 17 on the Kontinuous Kleet.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">The court held that the defendant had substantially performed a part of the contract, and said (page 204 of 251 F.):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-7\">\u201cAlthough appellee\u2019s performance of this part of the contract must be <em>regarded </em>as substantially complete, yet complete performance of only one of its five or six important executory contract obligations cannot prevent the avoidance of the contract, if others equally important remain executory and are legally uncertain.

That every part of tho consideration He definite or every part be indefinite is not the gauge of the validity of a contract. However, <em>the </em>law requires that the important, essential elements in the consideration be ascertainable with reasonable certainty. This is true because the law will not hold a party bound to a contract against his will, when the substance of what he is to get in return is executory, and is so shadowy in its outline that the other party can refuse to perform with impunity, since either the contract does not compel it, or no court can say what damage it has caused if it fail to act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">The court further said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-10\">\u201cTho evidence convinces that there has been substantial performance of the contract by both parties.up to tho date of attempted avoidance. The entire trouble is found in the contract itself. It was not at its making strong enough to hold, and it had not, through performance, become so up to the time appellants saw fit to withdraw therefrom.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-11\">Huffman v. Paige-Detroit Motor Car Co. (C. C. A. 8) 262 F. 116. This was an action for damages by a dealer against an automobile manufacturer. By the terms of tho contract there in question, the manufacturer granted to the dealer the exclusive right to sell Paige automobiles in Nebraska and parts of Iowa and South Dakota. Tho contract was (page 117 of 262 F.) \u201cmuch like one of agency. * * * The defendant [manufacturer] did not obligate itself to sell, nor plaintiff to buy, any specified quantity of automobiles, nor was a determinable quantity fixed in a mutually binding way by the requirements of an established business. The defendant was expressly exempted from such an obligation and from adherence to the schedule of prices and discounts set forth. It was <em>free to </em>declino shipments under tho contract, and also free to fix and change prices at will. The contract specified a time when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>it expired by limitation.\u201d With reference to the right to terminate, the court said (page 118 of 262 F.):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-4\">\u201cBut aside from the provisions above noted, indicating a lack of mutuality of obligation, the contract expressly reserved to defendant the right of cancellation when in its opinion the plaintiff was not working the territory to the .best advantage. By another clause it was provided that, if the'defendant \u2018believes that the dealer (the plaintiff) is not properly and diligently pushing the sale of its ears, it hereby reserves the right at its election, and without making itself liable in any manner for any claim or action for damages, * * * to cancel and terminate this agreement. * * * \u2019 It is quite manifest that the contract merely furnished a basis for future dealings to be observed no longer than was mutually satisfactory. There was no hard and fast commitment of either party, if he chose to break away. Oakland Motor Car Co. v. Indiana Automobile Co., 121 C. C. A. 319, 201 F. 499; Verlie Motor Car Co. v.

The appellant sought to enjoin the cancellation by appellee of a contract and to compel specific performance. The contract was in the form of a license granting to appellant the exclusive right, within a designated territory, to manufacture \u201corange crush\u201d and to bottle and distribute it under appellee\u2019s trade-mark. The appellee agreed to supply its concentrate to be used in the manufacture of orange crush at stated prices, and to do certain advertising. The appellant agreed to purchase a specified quantity of the concentrate, to maintain a bottling plant, to solicit orders, and to undertake to promote the sale of orange crush and to develop an increase in the volume of sales. The license granted was perpetual, but contained a proviso to the effect that the appellant might at any. time cancel the contract. The bill alleged that the appellant bought a quantity of concentrate, manufactured orange crush, and was engaged 'in the performance of its obligations, when, about a year after the contract was entered into, the appellee gave written notice that it would no longer be bound. The court said (page 694 of 296 F.): \u2022</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-7\">\u201cWe agree with the,. District Judge that the contract was void for lack of mutuality. It may be conceded that the appellee is liable to the appellant for damages for the period during whieh the contract was performed; but for such damages the appellant has an adequate remedy at law. So far, however, as the contract remains executory, it is not binding, since it can be terminated at the will of one of the parties to it. The consideration was a promise for a promise. But the appellant did not promise to do anything, and could at any time cancel the contract. According to- the great weight of authority such a contract is unenforceable. Marble Co. v. Ripley, 10 Wall. 339, 359, 19 L. Ed. 955; Willard Sutherland &amp; Co. v. United States, 262 U. S. 489, 43 S. Ct. 592, 67 L. Ed. 1086; Velie Motor Car Co. v.

Moore v. Security Trust &amp; Life Ins. Co. (C. C. A. 8) 168 F. 496, 499, certiorari denied 219 U. S. 583, 31 S. Ct. 469, 55 L. Ed. 346; Willcox &amp; Gibbs Sewing-Machine Co. v. Ewing, 141 U.

R. 232.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-13\">We gather, from the cases in this and other circuits to whieh we have referred that, where a contract is so lacking in mutuality of obligation or certainty of consideration that it may be canceled, as in the Woerheide Case, or that specific performance will be denied on that sole ground, as in the Miami Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Case, its termination by either party creates no liability for damages resulting from a refusal to carry on.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-14\">The contract here is such that, because of the uncertainty \"of continued performance by the Reno Company, a court of equity would, upon that ground alone, refuse specific performance. Had the Du Pont Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>pany brought a suit in equity to cancel the contract, upon the authority of the Woer-heide Case, it would have been canceled for uncertainty of consideration. Our conclusion, therefore, is that, whether the termination by the Du Font Company was in good faith or bad faith, no action for damages could be based upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">We have much sympathy with the theory upon which the case was disposed of in the court below. It seems fair that, after having spent six years in developing the territory assigned to it, the Reno Company should have been permitted to continue or should have been compensated for the injury done it by having its business taken away. However, the injury done to the Reno Company was one against which its contract, rather obviously, did not afford protection. As was said by Judge Stone in the Woerheide Case (page 204 of 251 F.): \u201cThe entire trouble is found in the contract itself. It was not at its making strong enough to hold. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">\u201cThe fact that the promisee relies on the promise to his injury, or the promisor gains some advantage therefrom, does not establish consideration without the element of bargain or agreed exchange.\u201d Restatement of the Law of Contracts of the American Law Institute, vol. 1, \u00a7 75, Comment c.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">It is unnecessary to consider other questions presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">The judgment is reversed, and the ease remanded <em>for </em>further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
