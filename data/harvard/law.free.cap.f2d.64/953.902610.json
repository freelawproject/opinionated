Nagle, 268 U. S. <em>336, 45 S. Ct. 539, 540, 69 L. </em>Ed. 985 (1925), held that under the treaty the wife and minor children of a resident Chinese merchant had had the right of entry prior to the Immigration Act of 1924 (43 Stat. 153), though only the \u201cmerchant\u201d and not the wife or child was specifically mentioned in the treaty, citing with approval United States v. Gue Lim, 176 U. S. 459, 20 S. Ct. <em>415, 44 </em>L. Ed. 544. Construing the aet of 1924 \u201cwith the view to preserve treaty rights unless clearly annulled,\u201d the court, rejecting the Labor Department\u2019s contention, held that it could not conclude that \u201cthe general terms therein disclose a congressional intent absolutely to exclude the petitioners from entry.\u201d No question of visa or other documents was involved. In the Gue Lim Case, supra, as in Chew Heong v. United States, 112 U. S. 536, 5 S. Ct. 255, 28 L. Ed. 770, the court held that the provisions in the act of 1884 (23 Stat. 315) for certificates and visas must be construed as inapplicable to those members of the several treaty privileged classes of Chinese, for whom compliance with the terms of the act was an absolute impossibility ; the alternative to that construction would have required the court to impute to Congress an intent to violate the treaty. These eases too involved no question as to the compatibility of such provisions with the treaty obligations, if and when their observance was possible. Indeed, the court obviously assumed that the broad language of the treaty<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> did not preclude the requirement of a visa or other document of identification by those persons for whom there was the possibility of obtaining them; no one questioned the duty of a \u201cmerchant\u201d himself to get the proper papers as a condition to his readinittanee. As Secretary of State Foster-reported to the President on January 7, 1893 (4 Moore, Int. Law Dig. pp. 154r-357):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b977-20\">\u201cTreaty provisions granting the right of entry, travel, or residence in this country generally contain in some form the condition of subjection to the laws of the land. Such a condition, if not expressed, is necessarily implied. * 9 9</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b977-21\">\u201cIt is doubtful whether any of these treaty provisions guaranteeing rights of travel, residence, etc., were intended or can bo construed to be restrictive of the right of the contracting governments to control im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>migration into their respective territories. # ** #</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b978-4\">\u201cBut I do not think that even a provision guaranteeing the reception of immigrants\u2014 and much less a provision simply guaranteeing rights of entry, travel, or residence\u2014 could be held to prevent this Government from temporarily suspending immigration for the preservation of public health. It is simply the exercise of the police power of the nation, or, as it is called by the publicists, the right of self-preservation. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b978-5\">\u201cThe subjection of conventional agreements to the power of self-preservation must be implied, for it can not be presumed that when governments contract with each other they will fail to take notice of the existence of so inherent a right of sovereignty and attempt to grant away that which, by the very nature of things is incapable of being granted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b978-6\">\u201cThis Government has for some time freely exercised without question the right to regulate and restrict immigration, by excluding criminals, paupers, and diseased persons. No government, so far as I know, has contested its exercise on the ground that the treaty right of its subjects to enter the United States for travel, sojourn, or business is infringed thereby. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b978-7\">There is no conflict, therefore, between the Treaty of 1880 and the departmental rule<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> adopted pursuant to section 24 of the Immigration Act of 1924 (8 USCA \u00a7 222)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> or the executive order made pursuant to the Act of May 22, 1918, extended by the' Act of March 2, 1921<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (22 USCA \u00a7\u00a7 223-227).</p>\n<p id=\"b978-14\">Construing the treaty as conditioning the right of entry on a compliance with the provisions of the immigration laws and the reasonable departmental and executive provisions lawfully adopted [see United States ex rel. London v. Phelps (C. C. A.) 22 F.(2d) 288], the decision of this court in the Tom Tang Shee Case, 63 F.(2d) 191, following the Polymeris Case, 284 U. S. 279, 52 S. Ct. 143, 144, 76 L. Ed. 291, .compels a reversal. In those cases, as in this case, the immigrant was clearly admissible (there, under the Immigration Act, here, under the treaty), except that in each instance the prescribed documents were not presented. As was said in the Polymeris Case: \u201cThe relators must show not only that they ought to be admitted, but that the United States by the only voice authorized to express its will has said so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b978-15\">Order reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b977-22\"> \u201cArticlo II.
