Each of these concerns was charged with the interstate sale of lumber under various terms, including the phrase, \u201cwhite pine,\u201d with the alleged result of misleading and deceiving the trade and public to the injury of competitors and the public, and that the same is an \u201cunfair method of competition forbidden by section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act\u201d (15 US<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>CA \u00a7 45). The term employed by eaeli of petitioners hero is \u201cCalifornia White Pine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\"> \u201cTo sustain the orders of the commission, three requisites must exist: (1) That the methods used are unfair; (2) that they are methods of competition in interstate commerce; and (3) that a proceeding by the commission to prevent the use of the methods appears to be in the interest of the public.\u201d Federal Trade Commission v. Royal Milling Co., 53 S. Ct. 335, 336, 77 L. Ed. - (decided February 6, 1933); Fed. Trade Comm. v. Raladam Co., 283 U. S. 643, 646, 647, 51 S. Ct. 587, 75 L. Ed. 1324, 79 A. L. R. 1191. That the use of the expression, \u201cCalifornia White Pine,\u201d is a method of competition, there is no question. The only questions presented are whether requisites (1) and (3), found by the Commission to exist, are supported by the testimony. If so supported, the statute provides that such findings \u201cshall bo conclusive.\u201d Fed. Trade Comm. v. Winsted Hosiery Co., 258 U. S. 483, 491, 42 S. Ct. 384, 66 L. Ed. 729.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">In Federal Trade Commission v. Raladam Co., 283 U. S. 643, 51 S. Ct. 587, 590, 75 L. Ed. 1324, 79 A. L. R. 1191, the Supreme Court said: \u201cIn a ease arising under the Trade Commission Act the fundamental questions are, whether the methods complained of are \u2018unfair,\u2019 and whether, as in cases under the Sherman Act, they tend to the substantial injury of the public by restricting competition in interstate trade and \u2018the common liberty to engage therein.\u2019 The paramount aim of the act is the protection of the public from the evils likely to result from the destruction of competition or the restriction of it in a substantial degree. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">In Federal Trade Commission v. Sinclair Refining Co., 261 U. S. 463, 43 S. Ct. 450, 454, 67 L. Ed. 746 the court said : \u201cThe great purpose of both statutes was to advance the public interest by securing fair opportunity for the play of the contending forces ordinarily engendered by an honest desire for gain. And to this end it is essential that those who adventure their time, skill, and capital should have large freedom of action in the conduct of their own affairs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">This court in Hills Bros. v. Fed. Trade Comm., 9 F.(2d) 481, 484, said: \u201cThe court is only concerned with the question whether there is any competent testimony to support the findings of the commission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">Pinus ponderosa belongs botanically with the so-called \u201cyellow pine\u201d group. The typical \u201cyellow pine\u201d is the longleaf pine of the South, a hard lumber useful where strength is needed, and classified botanically as pinus palustris and pinus taeda. When lumber from the pinus ponderosa trees came into local use in California, it was given the name \u201cCalifornia White Pine\u201d in order to distinguish it from the hard \u201cyellow pines\u201d of the South. By 1886 it was so marketed in the states of California, Nevada, and Utah with occasional shipments further east. By about 1900 it was so marketed in the middle West sections, and about 1915 shipments extended to the Atlantic Coast.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-11\">The only species of true botanical \u201cwhite pines\u201d of commercial importance are Northern White Pine, and two Pacific Coast varieties \u2014 Idaho White Pine and Sugar Pine. The annual production of Northern White Pine in the United States is 825,000,000 feet B. M., of which 358,000,000 feot is from virgin timber in Minnesota, the remainder, 467,-000,000 feet, being in the main second growth from the original forests stretching throughout the northern and eastern sections of the United States from Minnesota to the Atlantic Coast. The annual production of Idaho White Pine is 500,000,000 feet and of Sugar Pine 280,000,000 feet. The annual production of Ponderosa is 2,800,000,000 feet, of which more than half has been sold since 1924 as \u201cPondosa Pine,\u201d and the remainder as \u201cCalifornia White Pine,\u201d \u201cArizona White Pine,\u201d and \u201cNew Mexico White Pine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b643-12\">Prior to 1924 the majority of Washington, Idaho, Western Montana and Northern and Central Oregon producers of Ponderosa were designating their lumber \u201cWestern White Pine.\u201d Upon application for complaints against them the Commission investigated this trade term. As a result of an agreement entered into by most of such producers in that year the name \u201cPondosa Pine\u201d was adopted as a substitute. In the brief of counsel appearing as amicus curias is the statement that following the said orders of the Commission of June 8, 1931, the name was again changed to \u201cPonderosa Pine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b643-13\">Statistical Bulletin No. 21 of United States Department of Agriculture (Commission\u2019s Exhibit 34) gives a statement of the total timber stand in the United States for the year 1920 in board feet as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b643-14\">Pinus Ponderosa (\u201cCalifornia White Pine\u201d) and Pinus Jeffreyi (Jeffrey Pine) 249.578.000. 000.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-16\">Pinus strobus (\u201cNorthern White Pine\u201d) and Pinus resinosa (\u201cNorway Pine\u201d) 23,-457.000. 000.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-18\">Pinus Mont\u00edcola (\u201cIdaho White Pine\u201d) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>and Finns lambertiana (\u201cSugar Pine\u201d) 57,-071,000,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">Prom the foregoing it appears that the available supply of ponderosa and its kindred Jeffrey pine is about three times greater than the total available supply of the botanically true white pine timber in this country. The record also discloses an estimate of more than 15,000,000,000 board feet of Northern \u25a0white pine (Strobus) within the Canadian Provinces. At the rate of consumption given, not considering second growth, the present stand of timber will be practically exhausted within sixty years.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">In Respondent\u2019s Exhibit No. 31 \u2014 \u201cU. S. Department of Commerce Bureau of Standards \u2014 Lumber\u2014Simplified' Practice Recommendation R 16-29\u201d (Issued December 5, 1929) there appears under the heading \u201cNomenclature of Commercial Softwoods\u201d the statement: \u201cThe following standard commercial names for lumber cut from the principal species of softwoods shall be used in the formulation of lumber-grading rules and in the construction of contracts and the terms of purchase and sale of American Standard lumber. Preferred commercial names are shown in italic.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">Here follows under subheadings of various names of trees such as cedars, firs, hemlocks, etc., the \u201cStandard commercial name\u201d of lumbers, produced therefrom. Under the subheading \u201cPines\u201d appear sixteen names, the following among others: \u201cArkansas soft pine,\u201d \u201cCalifornia white pine,\u201d \u201cIdaho white pine,\u201d \u201cLongleaf pine,\u201d \u201cNorth Carolina pine,\u201d \u201cNorthern white pine,\u201d \u201cNorway pine,\u201d \u201cPondosa pine,\u201d \u201cSouthern pine,\u201d \u201cSugar pine.\u201d Placed opposite each such. \u201cStandard commercial name\u201d is the proper botanical name or designation. Of the sixteen names, ten are of the botanical yellow pine. While commercially pine lumber falls within two main groups \u2014 the white and the yellow pines, it may be noted that the Bureau of Standards in the exhibit referred to makes no such groupings as it does in the ease of \u201cDouglas Eir\u201d and \u201cThe true firs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">While action taken by the Bureau of Standards is persuasive in a ease of this character, it is not necessarily controlling on the Federal Trade Commission or the courts. There may be cases in which the action of the bureau should be regarded as decisive. As said by the Circuit Court of Appeals, Seventh Circuit, in a recent case, Kirk &amp; Co. v. Fed. Trade Comm., 59 F.(2d) <em>179, 183: </em>\u201cWe deem it quite pertinent and decisive of the question before us. The government, through its agency, the Bureau of Standards, has thus committed itself to the proposition that castile soap may be made of <em>oily and </em>fatty elements other than olive oil. Being solely a question of fact we deem it expedi-' ent for other departments of the government, including the judiciary, to accept such construction, if for no other reason than that of consistency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b644-10\">It would not necessarily follow from this decision that a yellow pine might be sold as a white pine if such sales were unfair to the trade and injurious to the public, notwithstanding the Bureau of Standards had specified a name such as \u201cCalifornia white pine\u201d in a list of \u201cStandard commercial names\u201d for pine lumber. It would be different, however, if the particular lumber sold under such name possessed substantially the same qualities possessed by the white pines of commerce as distinguished from certain well known commercial yellow pines.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-11\">As shown by Bulletin 556 of the United States Department of Agriculture (Respondent\u2019s Exhibit 21) in the physical properties of weight, stiffness, strength, hardness, and shrinkage, ponderosa compares favorably with strobus. Expert witnesses from the United States Forest Products Laboratory place ponderosa in its mechanical properties with the typical white pine lumbers. There appears to be no serious question in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-12\">A statement by E. P. Ivory, formerly with the United States Forest Service, a witness-called by the Commission, succinctly presents certain facts: \u201cThere are 37 pine species in the United States and just as the oaks are divided into white and red oak groups, so the pines are divided into white and yellow pine groups. Botanically, California white pine falls in the yellow pine group chiefly because it has three long needles in each bundle, whereas the white pines have five. The physical properties and uses of the wood cut from this tree, however, align it with the white pine group and set it apart very distinctively from the yellow pine group.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b644-13\">From the testimony of this witness there also appears the statement: \u201cPhysical properties of California white pine, as demonstrated in tests made at the U. S. Government Forest Products Laboratory, Madison, Wisconsin, and its uses, closely align California white pine with the botanical white pines. In fact, in many of its most important qualities and uses California white pine is more typically a white pine than are some species which botanically are classified ag white pines.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>The finding of the Commission to which objection is principally directed as not being supported by the evidence reads: \u201cTrue white pine lumber is far more durable than Pon-derosa lumber when exposed to weather conditions. The Ponderosa pine has on an average a far greater amount of sapwood than trees generally used for lumber. The sapwood of the Ponderosa is less durable than any other part of the tree \u2014 especially when exposed to weather conditions. It is the sapwood of the Ponderosa that most closely resembles the heartwood of the true white pines in appearance and softness. It is the sapwood of the Ponderosa that it usually sold for uses and purposes for which the heartwood of the true white pines is celebrated. The close resemblance between the heartwood of the true white pines and the sapwood of the Ponderosa above noted, is one of the greatest causes of the confusion and deception in the marketing of the two species.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">The gist of this finding is that true white pine lumber is far more durable and has a far less percentage of sapwood than ponder-osa lumber, and that the close resemblance between the heartwood of true white pines and the sapwood of ponderosa is one of the greatest causes of confusion and deception in the marketing of the two species.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">An exhibit in the record discloses that the sapwood of the Irue white pine tree appears to be about <em>1% </em>inches in thickness as compared with 3 inches for the yellow pino. The relative percentage of sapwood in a particular tree depends largely upon its diameter. The attention of the court is directed to a chart showing a strobus tree 9% inches in diameter to have 60 per cent, sapwood, while a ponderosa tree 18 inches in diameter has 55 per cent, sapwood content, and trees of 21 inches in diameter have a sapwood content of 30 per cent, and 48 per cent., respectively. While these figures are interesting as showing the proportion of sapwood and heartwood content of logs, they do not necessarily indicate the relative proportion of sapwood and heartwood content in the lumber produced therefrom. That there is a greater percentage of sapwood content in ponderosa lumber than there is in the trae white pine lumber, there is no question. This variation, however, appears to be of importance only as it has a hearing upon the relative durability of the two classes of lumber. It is the sapwood which was found by the Commission to be more subject to decay when applied to exterior uses.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">Upon the question of durability of pon-derosa as compared with the true white pines the testimony of a number of witnesses appears in the record. A reference to the testimony of a few only will be sufficiently illustrative. Russell F. Whitehead, a New York City architect and editor of an architectural journal, testified that lumber made from pon-derosa \u201cis not a satisfactory substitute for genuine white pine to use in exterior of a building, in any way, shape or form.\u201d The witness further testified that he regarded it as reasonably satisfactory for interior purposes, \u201cbut not if exposed to the weather.\u201d W. B. Greeley, for seven years chief forester of the United States and now manager of the West Coast Lumberman\u2019s Association, Seattle, testified: \u201cThe genuine white pines have the reputation for greater durability in uses exposed to the weather. That would not apply to interior uses protected from the weather.\u201d George W. Kelham, for twenty-two years an architect in San Francisco, testified as to the use of ponderosa where exposed to the weather: \u201cIt is unsatisfactory under those conditions, and that would be the general opinion of the architects that I know. * * * It doesn\u2019t, in our opinion, last well. It decays more rapidly than other wood.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">Professor C. P. Winslow, director of the United States Forest Products Laboratory at Madison, Wis., since 1917, to the question, \u201cWhat is the difference between white pine and Pinus ponderosa as to durability?\u201d answered : \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b645-10\">Professor G. M. Hunt of the same laboratory, testified: \u201cThe general experience with Ihe use of the White Pines during the 200 years since they began to be used indicated that these pines had moderately high durability. The general experience with Pinus Ponderosa indicated that that wood had low durability in contact with the ground or any place favoring the growth of decay. That is a matter of common knowledge.\u201d To the question, \u201cHave there been tests which will adequately settle the question as to the relative decay resisting qualities of the heartwood of Pinus Ponderosa and the heartwood of Pinus Strobus?\u201d Professor Hunt answered : \u201cThere have not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b645-11\">The weight to be given to testimony above outlined upon the question of the relative durability of the two lumbers is not as clear as it might otherwise seem to be, viewed in the light of other facts and circumstances. The expression that Ponderosa lumber is not a satisfactory substitute \u201cfor use in exterior of a building, in any way, shape, or form,\u201d may well be viewed in the light of the fact that buildings erected from lumber from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>original Northern white pine forests have withstood the elements for two centuries, while but few, if any, erected with lumber from the Ponderosa tree may lay claim to an age in excess of about seventy-five years. Specific instances of decay under ordinary conditions of upkeep are almost wholly lacking in the record. The director of the Forest Products Laboratory did not know what the difference in durability is. Professor Hunt's testimony was to the effect that it was a matter of common knowledge from general experience that Ponderosa \u201chad low durability in contact with the ground or any place favoring the growth of decay.\u201d As most of the lumber used even for exterior purposes does not come in contact with the ground, it would not necessarily follow that such lumber might not in other respects have moderately high durability unless the witness meant to say that any exterior use was a \u201cplace favoring the growth of decay.\u201d The testimony of the witness does not appear to warrant the latter interpretation. What the testimony appears to establish is that Northern white pine has relatively a greater durability for exterior use without establishing any comparative degree of such durability.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">Upon the question of public confusion in the matter of lumber nomenclature, the testimony of a number of witnesses appears in the record. Mr. Alfred Busselle, for twenty-five years a practicing architect in New York, specializing in high-grade residential work, testified \u201cIn my experience there is a great deal of confusion in the pine market due to the terminology, and some of the confusion is quite honest. 81 * * I know that California white pine connotes to some people a distinct type of wood, hut it connotes to other people, white pine in general, and therein lies the confusion.\u201d Those who are confused, generally speaking, the witness testified were the \u201cmillmen and the lumber dealers, as well as the architects.\u201d Just why architects and lumber dealers should be confused in view of the aid and assistance furnished by the government through the Bureau of Standards is not readily apparent. It may properly be assumed that architects have a general knowledge of the qualities of the various materials they specify. If it is . deemed important that a particular residence or other building be constructed of so-called true white pine because of its known or claimed superior wearing or other qualities, a reference to the standard commercial names \u2014\u201cNorthern White Pine,\u201d \u201cIdaho White Pine,\u201d or \u201cSugar Pine,\u201d will enable the architect to so specify, and the contractor and dealer to comply with the specifications. The testimony does not support a view that when architects so specify there is any confusion or even any material amount of intentional substitution of some other lumber than that specified. It is clearly established by the testimony that the true white pines are sufficiently well known in the trade to be able to command a higher price over that sold under the trade name of California White Pine or Pondosa.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">The testimony of a number of witnesses engaged in the retail trade in various states is to the effect that orders for white pine lumber without other designation, would be filled by any lumber using the designation \u201cwhite,\u201d including California White Pine. It does not appear, however, from the testimony of these witnesses that in filling such orders with California White Pine, or with other lumber using the designation \u201cwhite,\u201d and which was not a botanically' true white pine, a practice prevailed of charging a price therefor on a basis of the market price for Northern or Idaho White Pine.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">P. J. Curley, president for five years of a wholesale and retail lumber house at Chicago, testified: \u201cIt is commonly known among the sash and door men if a specification comes in for White Pine, they will furnish California White Pine or so-called Western Pine or Pondosa Pine, without attempting to get the genuine Northern White Pine or Idaho White Pine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">The reason for the substitution the witness testified \u201cis the lower price, lower cost to the sash and door men or to the interior men.\u201d The amount of such substitution the witness estimated at \u201cabout ninety-five per cent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b646-9\">If it be considered that manufacturers of sash and doors and exterior trim use ponder-osa lumber principally in such manufacture, and supply the same when the specification calls for white pine, the important question remains of the character of material so supplied and whether a price is charged therefor based on the difference in cost of the two lumbers. There is no testimony touching the question of price of this particular character of manufactured product. With the exception of the possible question of durability, the materiality of which has not been established, it does not otherwise appear'the public is injured by action of such manufacturers. If, as testified by the witness Curley, these manufacturers use Ponderosa pine as readily as they do California White Pine in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>filling specifications calling for white pine, it is not apparent that an affirmance of the Commission\u2019s orders would afford any relief if injury from such manufacture in fact occurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">In the finding of the Commission complained of appears the statement: \u201cIt is the sapwood of Ponderosa that most closely resembles fhe heartwood of the true white pines in appearance and softness.\u201d In respondent\u2019s brief appears the statement: \u201cTrue white pines excel ponderosa in the soft texture of the wood as an average. * * ' \u201d The court\u2019s attention has not been called to any tests made of the relative hardness of heartwood as compared with sapwood. The tests made by the United States Forest Products Laboratory for \u201cHardness (side section)\u201d show Ponderosa softer by 2 per cent, and \u201c(end section)\u201d softer by more than 6 por cent, than Strobus. In comparison with the Southern Yellow Pine (longleaf) both woods are softer by more than 50 per cent.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">As bearing on the question relative to the contention that the use of the commercial name- \u2014 \u201cCalifornia White Pine\u201d \u2014 is unfair to the trade, we quote the following excerpt from the brief of respondent: \u201cIdaho white pine, in 1922 and 1923, had a premium of $16 or $17 per thousand feet. Since the decline of 3927 the premium has been but $5.-50 to $8.50. In September, 1927, the Weyer-haeuser Sales Company made a drastic cut in Idaho white pine largely for the reason that the Weyerhaeuser concerns \u2018had come to the conclusion that, because other woods not true white pines were being marketed under the white pine name, it was no longer possible to get the price preferences that we had previously gotten.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">It may be noted, however, in connection with the foregoing statement, that the reduction in price did not occur until three years after the commercial name of half of the Ponderosa of commerce was changed from Western White Pino to Pondosa.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">It may be conceded that if the use of the commercial name \u2014 California White Pine\u2014 is prohibited in the lumber trade, Northern White Pine and Idaho White Pine will be aide to command a higher price than that which now prevails over lumber produced from the forests of Ponderosa pine. If this situation be conceded, and it be further conceded that the increased price of Strobus lumber finds a correlative reduction in the price of Ponderosa lumber, the further question remains whether such change in commercial methods of sale will be in the interest of the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-10\">The case of Federal Trade Commission v. Winsted Hosiery Co., 258 U. S. 483, 42 S. Ct. 384, 385, 66 L. Ed. 729, is stressed in the brief of respondent as one presenting a \u201cremarkable parallel\u201d respecting the use of unfair methods, the prevention of which is in the interest of the public. From the opinion we quote the following excerpt: \u201cA substantial part of the consuming public, and also some buyers for retailers and sales people, understand the words \u2018Merino,\u2019 \u2018Natural Merino,\u2019 \u2018Gray Merino,\u2019 \u2018Natural Wool,\u2019 \u2018Gray Wool,\u2019 \u2018Australian Wool\u2019 and \u2018Natural Worsted,\u2019 as applied to underwear, to mean that the underwear is all wool. By means of the labels and brands of the Winsted Company bearing such words, part of the public is misled into selling or into buying as all wool, underwear which in fact is in large part cotton. And these brands and labels tend to aid and encourage the representations of unscrupulous retailers and their salesmen who knowingly sell to their customers as all wool, underwear which is largely composed of cotton.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b647-11\">The sale or purchase of a material as all wool which in fact is in large part cotton presents a situation which may not be said to be parallel to that presented upon the facts in this case. If a material from a gray wool from some other breed of sheep than a Merino were dealt with in commerce under the name of \u201cMerino\u201d or \u201cGray Merino,\u201d then there might be some parallel between the two eases. In the case at bar we are considering questions as between certain pine lumbers. The use of the word \u201cwhite\u201d is hero sought to be prohibited in connection with the trade name of a lumber produced from a certain species of pine tree which botanically falls within the yellow pine group, but which in its industrial utility comes within the white pine group as known to commerce and industry. In the field of commerce and industry there are but two groups of pine lumbers\u2014 the white and the yellow. Primarily this grouping reflects the industrial utility of the several lumbers. While botanically Pinus Ponderosa falls within the same general classification as Pinus Polnstris, the lumber from which latter trees first became known to commerce as Southern Yellow Pine, Pon-derosa in industrial utility possesses more nearly the qualities of Pinus Strobus, which as Northern White Pine was the first of the pines known to commerce using the designation \u201cwhite.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b647-12\">It may be conceded that the evidence establishes that Northern White Pine lumber from the forests of Minnesota and Idaho <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>White Pine lumber possess certain qualities which make those lumbers a superior grade to lumber produced and sold- as California White Pine. When we compare Idaho White Pine wijii Northern White Pine we find that the Department of Agriculture (Exhibit 21) records the former as possessing greater strength and stiffness, but with all a softer quality. As said in the brief for respondent: \u201cLumber is a product of growth, not an inorganic, chemical product. Lumber from any given species, even the most uniform, will vary somewhat in quality. Where species are similar in average quality, or where the variations in a species are great there will be some overlapping.\u201d In considering California White Pine with Northern White Pine, for example, the fact may not be overlooked that the greater portion of the annual production of such lumber, 467,000,000 board feet, comes from second growth timber. Concerning this second growth lumber, in the brief of respondent, we read: \u201cWhile most of the new growth of Strobus is being prematurely cut and used for inferior purposes, yet doubtless many areas are being allowed to stand for their maximum value.\u201d This statement is suggestive' of the fact that the public interest is not promoted by the premature cutting of second growth timber.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">In considering the fact that certain of the so-called / true white pines produce lumber superior in certain respects to that produced from Ponderosa, there is also to be considered the fact that these species of true white pines differ also from each other as the so-called true yellow pines differ from each other. Whatever these differences are, in commerce and industry pine lumber is classified into two groups, white pine and yellow pine, and any lumber falls within one or the other of these two main groupings, largely if not entirely because of its peculiar industrial utility.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">In considering the weight to be given to the fact that Ponderosa is not only not a botanical true white pine, but in certain respects is also inferior in a more or less uncertain degree to certain of the true white pines of commerce, the past history, as well as the future of the industry is deserving of consideration. The supply of the botanical true white pine is far more limited than that of Ponderosa. The public is not only interested in not being deceived in the material it purchases under a certain nomenclature, but possibly in an even larger sense in the conservation of the forests. In the brief for respondent appears this statement: \u201cThe superiority of true white pine lumber over ponderosa has been reflected in the fact that Northern White Pine, Idaho White Pine, and Sugar Pine have all commanded a higher price on the market than ponderosa. The price differentials still continue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">It is manifest from this statement that notwithstanding the fact that Ponderosa has been sold in markets throughout the country under the commercial name California White Pine, and under other names using the word \u201cwhite,\u201d for more than fifteen years prior to the institution of this proceeding, the so-called true white pines were able to command a higher price.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">It is the conclusion of the court that viewing the testimony in the light of all the facts of the ease, it is insufficient tO' support findings that petitioners\u2019 use of the commercial name California White Pine is an unfair method of competition or that its prevention would be in the interest of the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">The orders complained of should be annulled and set aside. It is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
