PUBLIC SERVICE RAILWAY COMPANY, DEFENDANT-APPELLANT.</parties>\n<otherdate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b298-6\">Submitted March 22, 1923</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"At9\">Decided June 5, 1923.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b298-9\">Before Justices Parker, Bergen and Minturn.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b298-10\">For the appellant, <em>Leonard J. Tynan.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b298-11\">For the appellee, <em>Nathan H.

There was a motion to nonsuit, and one to direct, on the grounds that there was no evidence of negligence and that plaintiff was conclusively shown guilty of contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>According to the testimony for plaintiff, he drove his car up Belmont avenue ahead of defendant\u2019s trolley car and came to a standstill preparatory to backing into a parking space, and that while so standing, defendant\u2019s car ran into the rear of plaintiff\u2019s ear, though the tail light was shining.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">Of course, the jury should have believed the testimony of other witnesses and have taken a different view of the facts, but in such a general situation as that indicated above, it is difficult to see how any court can properly say there was no question of negligence or contributory negligence for a jury to pass upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">The judgment is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
