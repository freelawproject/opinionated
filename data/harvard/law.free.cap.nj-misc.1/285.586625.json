He suffered from shock and was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>also injured about the legs. He lost fifteen days at his work and was earning $5 a day at the time of the accident. He underwent treatment for two and one-half months and suffered considerable pain, and there was evidence that he had suffered a derangement of the nervous system. He had a substantial medical bill to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">The rule granted by the court in this case was to show cause why the verdict should not be set aside and a new trial granted as to damages only. But we think that the situation requires that a new trial unlimited in scope and including both liability and damages should be granted, and it is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
