From the evidence it seems to us that by the contract (which was not in writing) the plaintiffs assumed the obligation of getting the proper government permits, and that they did not do. The mere fact that the plaintiffs contracted for the doing by them of a thing that they could not do, but which was not impossible of performance, did not entitle them to a verdict. But another and complete answer to this point is that there was no request to charge the matter which it is now asserted should have been charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">The second point is that \u201cthe trial judge erred by instructing the jury to return a verdict for the plaintiffs for $5,000 or nothing.\" We think the instruction correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">The precise complaint seems to be that the judge should have instructed the jury to return a verdict for. $5,000 in favor of the plaintiffs, but that clearly the judge could not' do under the evidence. We, therefore, think the instruction was one of which the plaintiffs cannot complain.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">It is further complained under this head that this instruction was communicated to the jury through the medium of the clerk upon their inquiry as to whether they might find a compromise verdict for the plaintiffs for $2,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">Of course, the manner in which the instruction was imparted was informal and irregular, but that ought not to result in setting aside the verdict, when, as appears clearly, the lawful rights of the plaintiffs were not prejudiced thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">The rule to show cause will be discharged, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
