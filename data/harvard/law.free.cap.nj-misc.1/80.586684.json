The first paragraph is that the judgment was \u201ccontrary to law;\u201d how, does not appear. The second, that the judgment was contrary to evidence and the weight of evidence. The third, fifth and sixth, that the \u201cevidence disclosed\u201d or \u201cshowed\u201d certain alleged facts; and the fourth, that the evidence failed to disclose any priority of contract. This is all. Not one ruling by the trial court claimed erroneous is pointed out. Under rule 145, the appeal is to be heard solely on the points of law so specified. Where none is \u00a1specified, the judgment will be affirmed. <em>Kearns </em>v. Waldron, 76 <em>N. J. L. </em>370; <em>Champlin </em>v. <em>Barthold, </em>82 <em>Id. </em>13. Such will be the order in this case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
