An order for a summary review of the conviction was allowed by Justice Minturn, on application of the said defendant under the act of 1908. <em>Pamph. L., p. </em>442; 2 <em>Comp. Stat., p. </em>1868, <em>pl. </em>1456.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-12\">On December 29th, 1921, judgment was rendered and entered in the Supreme Court as follows: \u201cThe court, having inspected the transcript,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-13\">On January 21st, 1922, there was an order entered in the Supreme Court, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-14\">\u201cWhereas under date of December 15th, 1921, Hon. James E. Minturn, one of the justices of the above court, filed an opinion in the above-entitled matter under the title of \u201cThe State <em>v. </em>Louis Gross, prosecutor;\u2019 and whereas said opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>at the beginning thereof says: \u2018On <em>certiorari, </em>removing conviction;\u2019 and whereas by inadvertence said proceeding before the said justice was so designated; and whereas said proceeding was before the said justice on summary review in accordance with the provisions of chapter 228 of the laws of 1908 <em>(p. </em>442); and whereas the attorneys of the respective parties desire to correct the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-4\">\u201cIt is, on this nineteenth day of January, 1922, ordered that the proceedings herein be and the same hereby are amended and the said opinion be and the same hereby is amended so as to provide that the said proceedings before the said justice were and are under said chapter 228 of the laws of 1908 aforesaid, and not on <em>certiora/ri.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-5\">\u201cCollins &amp; Cokbin,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-6\">\n<em>\u201cAttorneys of Complainants.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-7\">\u201cWeinberger &amp; Weinberger,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-8\">\n<em>\u201cAttorneys of Defendant.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-9\">\u201cBuie actually entered this 21st day of January, 1922,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AmQ\">\u201cOn motion of</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-10\">\u201cCollins <em>&amp; </em>Corbin,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-11\">\n<em>\u201cAiUorneys of Complainants.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-12\">\u201cJames P. Minturn,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-13\">\n<em>\u201cS. C. jr</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-14\">The record does not show that the judgment was amended so as to conform with the provisions of chapter 228 of the laws of 1908 <em>(Pamph. L., p. </em>442), relating to a summary review of convictions under ordinances, and so far as the record stands there was no order made by the justice under the statute, but in lieu thereof he gave judgment by virtue of his judicial office reversing the conviction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-15\">\u201cThe court, having inspected the transcript and proceedings of the recorder of the city of Passaic, returned with the writ of review in this cause, the reasons for reversing the judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>ment below, and having heard the argument of counsels thereon, and having duly considered the same:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-4\">\u201cIt is ordered, adjudged and decreed that the judgment of Thomas P. Costello, Esq., recorder of the.police court of the city of Passaic, county of Passaic, aforesaid, be reversed, set aside, made void and for nothing holden and that the said defendant-appellant, Louis Gross, be restored in all things wherein he hath lost by reason of the said erroneous judgment, together with costs to be -taxed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-5\">\u201cDated December 29th, 1921.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-6\">\u201cJames E. Minturn,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-7\">\n<em>\"Justice of Supreme Court.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-8\">\u201cOn motion of</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-9\">\u201cWeinberger &amp; Weinberger,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-10\">\n<em>\u201cAttorneys of Defendant-Appellant.\u201d</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b71-11\">The <em>certiorari </em>commands the justice and the- Supreme Court clerk to certify and send a certain order dated December 29th, 1921, wherein the justice reversed a certain conviction, &amp;c., to the Supreme Court. Beferring to the record, we find that it is the judgment of reversal which is dated December 29th, 1921, and which is certified and sent up for review. The <em>certiorari </em>was allowed January 19th, 1922, and on January 21st, 1922, an order was taken amending the opinion filed in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-12\">There is no reason assigned that the justice erred in giving a judgment of reversal instead of making an order in conformity with the provisions of the statute of 1908. In fact there was no objection made to the proceedings on that ground. Counsel of prosecutors did call the attention of the justice that in his opinion filed in- the case he stated that it was before him on <em>certiorari, </em>whereas it was before -him as a statutory tribunal, and in that respect the opinion was amended. But we are not concerned with the opinion. We think we are concluded by the record, and as a writ of <em>certiorari </em>will not lie to a judgment of the Supreme Court, the writ must be dismissed, as being improvidently allowed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
