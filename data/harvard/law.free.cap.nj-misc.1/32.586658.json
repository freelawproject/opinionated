The note was taken by Whitman to-Eaymond E. Smith, secretary end treasurer of the Eoseville Trust Company for the purpose of having the proceeds of the note placed to the credit of the Interstate Land and Securities Company. The defendant claimed that 'the note was loaned by him to be used for the credit of the Interstate Land and Securities Company and ivas not given in payment for capital stock of that company. On Aiigust 13th, 1913, the Eoseville Trust Company was closed by the commissioner o\u00a3 banking and insurance. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>note was found on the .desk of the secretary and treasurer. There was no entry in the hooks of the Roseville Trust Company that it had ever been placed to- the credit of the Interstate Land and Securities Company, which was indebted to the Roseville Trust Company, at the time of its suspension, for overdrafts in approximately the sum of $15,000. On August 2''6th, 1913, the note was presented for payment to the representative of the commissioner of banking and insurance, having in charge the affairs of the Roseville Trust Company, and was protested for non-payment. An application for a rule to show cause was made to the trial court within the time allowed by the rules. The application was denied. \u2019 The defendant contends that he is deprived of the right of review on the question of fact by the action of the trial judge, and that the questions involved are of such consequence to the defendant that he should at least be permitted to- argue them before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">After reading of the testimony we have concluded that the defendant is at least entitled to argue the questions involved in this case before this court. A rule to show cause will be allowed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
