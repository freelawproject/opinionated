It is brought for review here on <em>certiorari. </em>The record of the District Court returned with the writ shows that the affidavit upon which the proceedings were instituted and based against the prosecutor, and which resulted in a judgment of eviction against him, contained all the essential jurisdictional facts and which, according to the return before us, were established on the trial. The application by the prosecutor for a rule to take testimony as to what the testimony was at the trial on the hearing of the case in the District Court, is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-12\">The writ is dismissed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
