The theory, upon which the complaint seems to be founded, appears to be that though the prosecutor had obtained a license from the town to operate the jitney bus, as required by section 2 of the town ordinance, nevertheless, since during the week beginning July 17th, 1922, to July 24th, 1922, the license, for some reason or other (the cause or reason not being stated in the complaint), vras suspended, that the operation of the auto bus by the prosecutor on July 19th was a violation of section 1 of the ordinance. This seems to us to be clearly erroneous. There is nothing contained in section 1 that prohibits the operation of an auto bus by one who has obtained a license <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>and whose license is under suspension. Penal laws must be strictly construed, hence, unless there is some section of the ordinance providing a penalty for the operation of an auto bus by a person who has obtained a license to operate the same, but whose license is temporarily under suspension, none can be lawfully inflicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">Section <em>7 </em>of the ordinance, in substance, provides that all jitneys licensed thereunder shall \u00a1be subject to inspection by the mayor and any member of the board of aldermen, and by any police or health officer both as to <em>condition </em>and operation, and if found'to be unsafe or unsanitary or for <em>any'oilier reason </em>deemed sufficient, the license may be without notice suspended by the mayor and board of aldermen, or the committee on licenses thereof; and if such defect is not remedied or such reason complied with within ten days after notice of such suspension the license may, by the mayor and board of aldermen, be revoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Without pausing to consider the reasonableness of this section of the ordinance in its entirety, and while it may be within the power of the mayor and board of aldermen to suspend a license where ihe jitney is found to be unsafe or unsanitary, which question does not become necessary to decide here, we think that the declaration \u201cor for any other reason deemed sufficient\u201d by the mayor and board of aider-men a license may be suspended, is clearly too indefinite, if not also too unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">Furthermore, as a license may be suspended without notice, it seems to us that the complaint in this case is insufficient to charge the' prosecutor with a violation of section 1 of the ordinance, without alleging that he had notice or knowledge that his license was suspended. Although the mayor and board of' aldermen are authorized by the ordinance to suspend the license in given cases, without notice, that fact cannot rationally carry with it that the prosecutor need not have any notice or knowledge of such suspension before he can be successfully prosecuted for a violation of his right under the license to operate. A natural sense of justice forbids such a thought.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>The phrase in the complaint that the prosecutor\u2019s license was \u201cduly and legally suspended\u201d is a mere conclusion and opinion expressed on undisclosed facts, and is contrary to sound and valid pleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">So, also, the phrase that the \u201cprosecutor \u201cdid willfully and unlawfully operate\u201d the auto bus, &amp;c., is a conclusion drawn from undisclosed facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">For the reasons given, the conviction should be set aside, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">We have not examined the other reasons urged on behalf of the prosecutor for setting aside the conviction, since we concluded that the complaint was insufficient and no ordinance on which to sustain the conviction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
