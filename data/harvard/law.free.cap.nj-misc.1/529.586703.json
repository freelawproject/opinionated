ERIE RAILROAD COMPANY.</parties>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b541-9\">Decided November 8, 1923.</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b541-11\">For the appellant, <em>Weinberger &amp; Weinberger.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b541-12\">For the defendant, <em>Collins &amp; Corbin.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b541-13\">Before Gummere, Chief Justice, and Justices Minturn and Black.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b541-14\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"b541-15\">The plaintiff\u2019s intestate was a flagman, employed by the defendant company at its Rutherford crossing, and was run <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>down and killed while on duty at the crossing on the evening of January 13th, 1921. The trial resulted in the direction of a verdict for the defendant company, on the ground that there was no negligence on the part of the defendant company; the claim that it was customary for the engineman to blow a whistle when approaching the crossing for the purpose of warning the employes on the crossing not having been supported. We think the proofs justified that conclusion, since the blowing of the whistle was manifestly a mere performance of the statutory duty imposed upon railroad companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">The other grounds upon which the motion to direct a verdict was rested we think without merit. If it be assumed that the decedent was conclusively shown to have been guilty of contributory negligence, that fact did-not bar him from the right to recover, the Eederal statute providing that it shall only affect the <em>quantum </em>of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">The contention that the decedent assumed the risk, even if it be considered that the duty of giving warning to flagmen on ci\u2019ossings had been shown, is without merit. The failure to give the warning was the failure of a fellow-servant to perform the duty entrusted to him, and an employe does not assume the risk of danger arising out of the negligence of a fellow-employe.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Counsel for the railroad company having moved for the direction of a verdict, proceeded to argue the matter, and apparently his argument was replied to by counsel for the plaintiff. At the conclusion of the argument the court said, \u201cI think I will grant the motion;\u201d and after some little further discussion counsel for the plaintiff said, \u201cI do not think that the plaintiff is entitled to have a nonsuit in this case,\u201d to which the court replied, \u201cNo, I think if there is an error, it can be cured by the court above.\u201d An exception was entered to this ruling, and the court then instructed the jury to return a verdict in favor of the defendant. We think the statement of defendant\u2019s counsel, that \u201cplaintiff is entitled to have a nonsuit,\u201d was in effect a submission to a voluntary nonsuit. It is settled that plaintiff has a right to suffer a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>nonsuit on liis own motion at an}\u2019 time before the jury have retired to consider their verdict. <em>Malone </em>v. <em>Erie Railroad Co., </em>90 <em>N. J. L. </em>350.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">In that case it was held that an offer to submit to a voluntary nonsuit is made in time providing the court has not then begun its instruction to the jury to render a verdict for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Eor this reason the judgment should be a reversal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
