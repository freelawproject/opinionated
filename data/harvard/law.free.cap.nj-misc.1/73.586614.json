The defendants each file thirteen assignments of error and thirteen specifications or reasons for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">They are argued under seven points in the brief of the defendants. First, answer to question put to witness, John A. Fell; no objection. Second, criiicism of the charge in reference to what Aldeman, an accomplice, said to the prosecutor when he made -his plea. The word \u201cdefendant\u201d is used in the printed book; this doubtless meant the defendant Aldeman. This was not error; so point 3, criticism of the use of the word <em>\u201cmust,\u201d </em>by the trial court. This is hypercritical. Fourth, \u201cWho is telling the truth,\u201d that is your job \u201cto decide.\u201d ' We fail to see wherein this was error. So, points 5 and 6, the criticism of the charge, is without legal merit. They need no discussion. Seventh, because the verdict rendered is against the weight of the evidence; we find this is not so.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">Finding no error in the record, the judgment of the Essex County Court of General Quarter Sessions is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
