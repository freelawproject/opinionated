ROBERT BERCKES, DEFENDANT-APPELLANT.</parties>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b418-4\">Decided July 14, 1923.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b418-7\">Before Justices Kalisch, Black and Kaxzenbaci-i.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b418-8\">For the rule, <em>Lazarus &amp; Brenner (Nathan L. Goodman, </em>on the brief).</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b418-9\"><em>Contra, Anthony P. LaPorta (Thomas H.

While crossing Adam street, between Newark and First streets, in Hoboken, he was hit by defendant\u2019s motor ear and sustained a fracture of the right thigh, a laceration of the right ear, causing disfigurement. The accident happened in broad daylight.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>There was testimony tending to establish that Antonio had been playing hide and seek, and the game being finished he started to cross Adam street from the westerly to the easterly side of the street, with the intention of going over to the Liberty theatre, and that he had only taken two or three steps when he was struck by the defendant\u2019s automobile and dragged about twenty-five feet. There was a decided conflict in the testimony. The plantiff\u2019s testimony was corroborated in many material respects by his playmates. There was evidence from which a jury could reasonably infer that the automobile was being driven along a public street at an excessive rate of speed; for example, that after the plaintiff was hit he was dragged a distance of twenty feet before the car was brought to a stop. Two juries have passed upon the facts of the case and have reached the same result that the injury to the plaintiff Antonio was the result of the defendant\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">\u201cA second concurring verdict upon the same state of facts or slightly varying evidence should cause the court to hesitate before granting a third trial.\u201d <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Paterson Paper Co., </em>69 <em>N. J. L. </em>474; <em>Fulton </em>v. <em>Grieb Rubber Co., 72 Id. </em>36; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Central Railroad Co. of New Jersey, </em>109 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>360; <em>Lembeck </em>v. <em>Harms et al., </em>118 <em>Id. </em>537.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">The contention that the verdict in favor of Antonio\u2019s mother is contrary to the judge\u2019s charge finds no support in a fair reading of it. Nor can we say the award of $325 damages to the mother is excessive. She is entitled to the earnings of her son until he reaches the age of twenty-one, unless sooner emancipated. This fact in itself has a probable and a speculative value, and was eminently for a jury to pass upon and determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">The rule to show cause is discharged, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
