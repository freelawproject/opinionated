He seems to have formerly had an earning power of $12 a day, of which he was deprived for a considerable time, and there was the possibility or probability of decreased earning power in the future. He had some medical expenses and there was his pain and suffering to be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-11\">The rule granted by the court in this case was to show cause why the verdict should not be set aside and a new trial granted as to damages only. But we think that the situation requires that a new trial unlimited in scope and including both liability and damages should be granted, and it is so ordered. . \u2022</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
