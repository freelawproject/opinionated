The indictment was in the common law form, the averments being that the defendant caused and procured certain men and women of evil name and fame to habitually meet at a house kept by him in the city of Newark, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>and there remain drinking, tippling, fighting, committing acts of open lewdness, whoring, &amp;c., &amp;c., and did then and there expose to sale to the frequenters of said premises intoxicating liquor, contrary to law. The trial resulted in the conviction of the defendant and he now challenges file legality of that conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">The only ground upon which we are asked to reverse the conviction is directed at the charge to the jury. Both sides having rested, counsel for the defendant submitted to the trial court the following request to charge: \u201cIf the jury find that the only unlawful acts committed by the defendant consist wholly in the unlawful sale of intoxicating liquor, the defendant cannot be convicted under this indictment and he is entitled to a verdict of not guilty.\u201d It is settled, so far a.s this court is concerned, that, since the enactment of the statute of March 10th, 1893 (section 74 of our Crimes act), which prohibits the finding of an indictment against a person for the offense of maintaining a common law nuisance or keeping' a disorderly house, where the offense sought to be punished consists wholly in the unlawful sale of intoxicating liquor, a person who is indicted for the common law offense of keeping a disorderly <em>house </em>\u2014 i. <em>e., </em>for maintaining a place where men and women collect and indulge in drinking, tippling, fighting, committing acts of open lewdness, &amp;c.\u2014 is entitled to an acquittal where'the only proof offered to support the charge against him relates to sales of intoxicating liquor contrary to law. <em>State </em>v. <em>Goff, 74 N. J. L. </em>247.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Counsel for defendant asserts that this request was not charged. On the other hand, the prosecutor of the pleas asserts with equal vigor that it was charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">An examination of the record discloses the following situation: The request submitted not having been referred to in the charge to the jury, and the jury having retired, counsel for defendant called .the attention of the court to its failure to charge the request. The court thereupon sent for the jury. The jurors having returned into the jury-box, in compliance with the direction of the court, the presiding judge addressed \u25a0 them as follows: \u201cI am sorry to have found it necessary to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>bring you back, but the defendant had requested me to charge a certain charge, and I find I have overlooked charging it in my regular charge.\u201d The request of the defendant is as follows : The court then read the request verbatim, and, having done so, added this: \u201cThat is the end of the defendant\u2019s request, but I charge you that if, in addition thereto, it is shown that men and women were permitted to frequent the place, and there drink such intoxicating liquor, get drunk there, solicit there, make arrangements for sexual intercourse there, the charge that the place was a disorderly house is made out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">The argument on the part of counsel for the defendant is that although the court read the request it did not charge it. The suggestion is that the court should have said to the jury, after reading the request, \u201cI so charge you;\u201d or \u201cI so instruct you;\u201d or words to that effect. This seems to us to be hypercritical. If the trial judge did not intend to charge the request no object can he perceived in his requiring the return of the jury. His opening statement to the jury on its return made it plain why he had sent for them, namely, that he had overlooked charging a request which had been submitted by the defendant. This statement, coupled with the reading of the request which he told the jury he had \u201coverlooked charging,\u201d was, by necessary implication, an instruction that the legal principle embodied in the request must be observed by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">It is further argued that even if it be considered that the request was charged, the <em>addendum </em>to it laid down an erroneous legal principle, the claim being that it nullified the request by permitting the jury to convict, if they found that the frequenters of the place drank intoxicating liquor there; in other words, that the language used, \u201cthere drink intoxicating liquor, get drunk there, solicit there, make arrangements for sexual intercourse there,\u201d describe isolated acts, any one of which would support a conviction on the indictment. We are not impressed with the soundness of the contention.. We think that in the absence of a disjunctive such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>as <em>or, </em>the words used describe a. series of acts, one following the other, which together are the constituents of a common law disorderly house, where such acts habitually occur in a particular place, with the knowledge and consent of the owner of the place.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">The judgment under review will be affirmed.-</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
