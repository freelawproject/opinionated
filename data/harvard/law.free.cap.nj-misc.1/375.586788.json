FRANK TANZARELLO, PLAINTIFF IN ERROR.</parties>\n<otherdate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b387-5\">Submitted March 22, 1923</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Arq\">Decided June 21, 1923.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b387-8\">Before Gummere, Chief Justice, and Justices Swayze and Trenchard.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b387-9\">For the plaintiff in error, <em>Weinberger &amp; Weinberger.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b387-10\">For the state, <em>Jacob Willard De Yoe, </em>prosecutor of the pleas.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b387-11\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"b387-12\">.This writ of error brings up for review the judgment entered upon the conviction of the plaintiff in error upon an indictment for statutory arson.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-13\">At the trial the plaintiff in error took, among others, exceptions to the refusal of the court to charge certain requests to charge, and took also a general exception to the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-14\">The main insistence here is that the court wrongfully refused to instruct the jury on the law of <em>alibi, </em>notwithstanding he was expressly requested so to do and notwithstanding <em>alibi </em>was the defence set up by defendant, and notwithstanding there was evidence tending to support such <em>alibi.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b387-15\">Request No. 12 reads: \u201cIf a reasonable doubt of guilt is raised even by inconclusive evidence of the <em>alibi, </em>the defendant is entitled to the benefit thereof and should be acquitted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-16\">That request was denied, and we think there was evidence <em>tending </em>to establish an <em>alibi. </em>It is true that it was <em>inconclusive, </em>but in these circumstances, when the trial court was requested to charge the law of <em>alibi, </em>he should have done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>Where (as here) a request to charge calls for the application of a correct legal principi\u00e9 is applicable to the testimony and clearly material to defendant\u2019s case, he is entitled to have it distinctly charged in such way as not to leave room for misapprehension or mistake by the jury. <em>State </em>v. <em>De Geralmo, </em>83 <em>N. J. L. </em>135.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">The indictment in that case was for rape; defendant presented testimony tending to prove an <em>alibi. </em>He requested the court to charge \u201cthat if reasonable doubt of guilt is raised, even by inconclusive evidence of the <em>alibi, </em>defendant is entitled to the .benefit of it.\u201d (This was the very language of the twelfth request to charge in the case at bar.) By way of reply, the trial court said, \u201cI will charge you that the evidence must satisfy you of the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d The Supreme Court held that this was not a legal compliance with the request, the court not having dealt with the subject-matter of the request in any part of the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">That is precisely the situation here. The trial court charged generally that the state was bound to satisfy the jury of defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, but did not advert to the law of <em>alibi </em>at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">In <em>Roe </em>v. <em>State, </em>45 <em>N. J. L. </em>49 (cited in the above mentioned case), the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-7\">\u201cOne of the most important duties of the court is to declare the law applicable to a case to the jury when requested so to do.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">The error was prejudicial to the defendant and hence requires a reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">Since there must be a new trial we remark that we find no other error in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-10\">The judgment will-be reversed and a new trial awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
