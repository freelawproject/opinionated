We think that it wa\u00e1 fairly open to the jury to find that the accident was caused by the failure of the ship\u2019s rudder to function properly, either because it was out of order, or because the quartermaster at the wheel failed to comply with the pilot\u2019s orders. The jury evidently so found, and we find no fault with such finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">It seems very improbable that the pilot, in broad daylight, on a clear day, with no very troublesome wind or tide, should have failed to have given the order, which plainly should have been given, to have pointed his vessel so as to get into the proper position in deep water to make the draw. The pilot himself says that he gave the order to put the wheel hard to starboard when he was alongside of the black buoy. The testimony is very persuasive that the rudder did not move in response to such an order, if it was given This, seems to appear from the testimony of those in a position to observe, and also from what happened immediately before and following the collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">. We think that it was therefore a very natural thing for the jury to conclude that for some reason this order was not communicated by the usual instrumentalities to the rudder, and that this was due either to failure of the quartermaster to obey the pilot\u2019s order or to the fact that the- steering gear was defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">In short, we cannot say that this verdict is against the great weight of the evidence, nor that it was against the charge of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">The rule, will be discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
