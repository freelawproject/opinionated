Baker. He, with others, was riding in his automobile along the highway and came into collision with a truck of the defendant. He was killed as a result of the collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-13\">It is argued that there was no-evidence of any negligence upon the part of the defendant which was the proximate cause of the accident, and hene\u00e9 a verdict should have been directed. We think there is no merit in that contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-14\">Erom the testimony upon the part of the plaintiff by the three occupants of the automobile it wasi open to the jury to find that they were traveling at the rate of about fifteen miles an hour in the night-time, the night being clear overhead but foggy along the ground; that their proper automobile lights were lighted; that suddenly the defendant\u2019s truck loomed up about fourteen feet away, in the centre of the highway, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>which was only about sixteen feet wide; and that the truck, which had considerable overhang, hit the plaintiff\u2019s car on the left side, notwithstanding the fact that plaintiff\u2019s car was well over to the right and proper side of the road, the right-hand wheels of the automobile running along the shoulder of the road. There was also testimony that the headlights of the truck were very dim, consisting of oil lights.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">The alleged negligence, the proximate cause of fhe accident, and the alleged negligence of the plaintiff, were jury questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">The judgment will be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
