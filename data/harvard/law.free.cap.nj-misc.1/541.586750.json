The accident occurred in Jersey City in broad daylight. The truck was being driven along Summit avenue, traveling north. The purpose of the driver of the truck was to turn to his left at the intersection of that street with Jewett avenue. As he was doing this the plaintiff, who was traveling along Summit avenue on his motorcycle in a southerly direction, undertook to cross in front of the truck as a result of which the collision occurred. The jury found a verdict in favor of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-12\">Our examination of the testimony sent up with the rule satisfies us that the verdict is very plainly against the clear weight of the evidence 'both on the finding of negligence on the part of the driver of defendant Feigenspan\u2019s truck and the finding of the absence of negligence on the part of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-13\">For this reason the rule to show cause will be made absolute.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
