Defendant was an automobile repair man. Plaintiff\u2019s case was that he engaged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>defendant to repair the motor of his automobile; that after the defendant completed the job the plaintiff paid him $85 for it and defendant delivered the car to the plaintiff; that then t\u00edre plaintiff undertook to start the car out of defendant\u2019s shop and in the act of starting, the motor \u201cwent to pieces\u201d and \u201cbecame smashed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">Plaintiff then had the car repaired elsewhere and brought this suit to recover damages resulting to him by reason of what he alleges to be the negligent repair work of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">The first point is that the verdict was contrary to the weight of the evidence on the question of defendant\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">Our examination of the case leads us to think that considering all of the testimony on both sides, much of it expert testimony, and more particularly considering the testimony to the effect that defendant used on the motor, in his attempt to repair it, a steel crowbar three and a half feet long and three-quarters of an inch thick, to pry off the old trimming chains, that there was presented a fair jury question and we cannot say that the verdict was contrary to the weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">The next point argued by the defendant is that the judge erred in refusing to grant a nonsuit. What we have said in respect to the former point disposes of this, in our judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">These are the only questions which we find argued.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-9\">The rule will be discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
