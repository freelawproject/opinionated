The plaintiff then brought this suit and recovered $150 for the alleged false imprisonment; the judgment was against Ryan alone and did not include the officer, the finding being in his favor, and from this judgment the defendant Ryan appeals. The only question argued is whether there was any false imprisonment at the instigation of Ryan. We th-ink from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>evidence there can be no doubt that Byan made .the complaint, although orally, and that thereby he procured the imprisonment of the plaintiff, and that the trial court properly determined the ease, and therefore the judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
