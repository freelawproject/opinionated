M., cannot be bracketed and cannot have the common designation \u201cRegular Republican,\u201d as pra3red by the relator. This cannot be done because, as the county clerk properly decided, that <em>designation </em>had alread3\u2019 been taken by <em>five persons </em>who were candidates for election to the five offices in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-15\">The rule'will be discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-16\">The same result is reached in Noonburg <em>v. </em>McCutcheon and also in Meier et al. <em>v. </em>McCutcheon.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
