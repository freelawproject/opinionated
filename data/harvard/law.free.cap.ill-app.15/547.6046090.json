that no goods have been manufactured under said patent number 212,607; that since the organization of said corporation, said Kelly and Smalley have disposed of all their stock for very considerable sums of money and are no longer stockholders.; that said Smalley was the secretary of the corporation and was fully aware of said agreement between it and said Kelly.</summary><summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b554-5\" pgmap=\"554\">The bill further alleges that Kelly and Smalley, on or about the first day of February, 1884, after they had ceased to be stockholders or interested in said corporation, combined and procured to be organized a corporation under the laws of this State, called the Kelly Covering Company, its object and purpose being to manufacture and sell covering for steam pipes, boilers, etc., being the same business as that for which the complainant was organized, and in which it was engaged; that the Kelly Covering Company advertises itself as manufacturing and dealing in non-conducting covering at 186 East Jackson street, Chicago, with said Kelly as general agent and said Smalley as manager; that the complainant, since its organization, has spent large sums of money in advertising its business and placing its goods before the public; that it has a very large and profitable business and is well known throughout the United States and Canadas as the manufacturers of a very superior article of steam pipe and non-conducting covering; that the said Kelly Covering Company is manufacturing the same goods as those manufactured by the complainant, and which the complainant has the exclusive right to manufacture and sell under the several patents so assigned to it by said Kelly.</summary><summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b554-6\" pgmap=\"554(76) 555(17)\">The bill charges that Kelly and Smalley adopted the name \u201c The Kelly Covering Company\u201d for the purpose of deceiving the public and to injure and defraud the complainant; that the Kelly Covering Company is offering its goods at a very low price and below the price at which the business can be carried on with profit, and is doing so in order to enable itself to use the market which the comj:&gt;lainant has established, and to injure and defraud the complainant, and that it is doing the complainant great and irreparable injury.</summary><summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b555-4\" pgmap=\"555\">The prayer of the bill is that Kelly, Smalley and the Kelly Covering Company may be enjoined from manufacturing, selling, applying or advertising iron pipe, steam pipe or nonconducting pipe covering, and also a general prayer for relief.</summary><summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b555-5\" pgmap=\"555\">The decree perpetually enjoins the defendants and each of them \u201cfrom manufacturing or selling any non-conducting steam pipe or other covering, the patent right to manufacture which was ever owned by the defendant, George Kelly, and by him assigned or agreed to be assigned, either by general or special assignment, to the complainant.

Turner, 17 Ill. 179; Hildreth v. Turner, 17 Ill. 184; Edmunds v. Myers, 16 Ill. 207; Miller v. Young, 33 Ill. 354; Linington v. Strong, 90 Ill. 556; Hollida v.

These letters patent were originally issued to and owned by Kelly, one of the defendants, and were by him assigned to the complainant. The instrument by which the assignment was made, in addition to assigning to the complainant one or more patents then already in existence, contained an agreemen t on Kelly\u2019s part to use\" his best endeavors to procure letters patent for certain other inventions of like character, which he liad then made, the same when issued to belong to and become the property of the complainant; and also an agreement that his subsequent inventions and improvements in relation to the same class of manufactured articles, should belong to the complainant, and that he would use his best endeavors lo procure letters patent therefor for its use.</p> <p id=\"b556-5\" pgmap=\"556\">There is no complaint in the bill of any breach of any of the terms or conditions of the agreement. So far as appears, Kelly did all he undertook to do by way of procuring letters patent for his unpatented inventions, and turning the same over to the complainant. The complaint is, that Kelly and the other defendants are engaged in the business of nianufacturing and selling the goods which the complainant has the exclusive right to manufacture and sell, under the several patents assigned to it by Kelly, and the praj-er of the hill is that he may be restrained from so doing. The decree also is limited to merely enjoining the defendants from manufacturing or selling any of the patented articles covered by the letters patent assigned or agreed to be assigned by Kelly to the complainant.</p> <p id=\"b556-6\" pgmap=\"556\">It will thus be seen that the case presented by the record is one purely and simply of an alleged infringement of certain patent rights. Neither the hill nor the decree seeks to enforce rights or to redress wrongs dependent upon or growing out of a contract. No agreement is set up, either on the part of the defendants or of Kelly, not to engage in manufacturing and selling the articles in question, but the only ground upon which the complainant seeks to have the defendants debarred from engaging in that business is, the exclusive right or monopoly secured to it by its letters patent.</p> <p id=\"b556-7\" pgmap=\"556(84) 557(24)\">Section 629 of the Revised Statutes of the United States confers upon the United States Circuit Courts original jurisdiction, among other things, of all suits at law or in equity arising under the patent or copyrights laws of the United States; and again, by section'll!, it is provided that the jurisdiction of said courts in all cases arising under said laws shall be exclusive of the courts of the several States. Section 4921 further provides that the several courts vested with jurisdietion of eases arising under the patent laws, shall have power to grant injunctions to prevent the violation of any right secured by patent.</p> <p id=\"b557-4\" pgmap=\"557\">These statutes are too plain to require comment. The exclusive jurisdiction of all suits brought to restrain infringements of patents is in the federal courts. This doctrine is clearly announced in the decisions cited by counsel for the appellants. It follows that the superior court had no jurisdiction, and that the demurrer to the bill should have been sustained. The decree will be reversed with directions to the court below to sustain the demurrer, and for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p> <p id=\"b557-5\" pgmap=\"557\">Decree reversed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
