Under <em>Rose v. Lundy, </em>455 U.S. 509, 102 S.Ct. 1198, 71 L.Ed.2d 379 (1982), appellant has the option of amending his initial \u201cmixed petition\u201d to eliminate the unexhausted claims rather than repairing to state court. Filing a separate revised petition is equally appropriate. Yet, we cannot say that appellant has correctly exercised his rights under <em>Rose </em>since neither of his subsequent petitions were made part of the record. This lapse is not attributable to appellant, however, for the petitions should have become part of the record as a matter of course. Appellant brought his petitions pro se under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915, in forma pauperis. Upon receipt of such a petition, the district court should have first docketed the petition and then considered the sufficiency of the allegations. <em>See Watson v. Ault, </em>525 F.2d 886 (5th Cir.1976) (petition should be docketed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1489\">*1489</page-number>once economic eligibility determined). In that way, the petition would become part of the record available for review on appeal from dismissal. Since the district court did not comply with this procedure, the order refusing to docket the petition shall be vacated and the case remanded for further proceedings in accord with <em>Watson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1589-4\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
