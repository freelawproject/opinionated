After his death, and during the life-time of the widow, Maria Stevenson, two of the testator\u2019s children died intestate,unmarried and without issue; that is,Francis Stevenson, one of said children, died October 9th, 1832, and Joseph B. Stevenson, another of said children, died December 13th, 1853. The widow of the testator died July 19th, 1857.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b206-5\">After the death of the widow, the executor, James Rogers, Esq., with the approbation of the Chancellor, signified by an order for sale granted at the Sept. T. 1857, proceeded to sell the mansion house and premises of the testator, in execution of the direction of his will, and at the Feb. T. 1858, made return of the sale, which was approved, and the proceeds ($22,020.26) after deducting expenses, were ordered to remain in the hands of the executor, for distribution under the will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b206-6\">At the Feb. T. 1859, the executor by his petition, representing the facts, prayed the instruction of the Chancellor touching the distribution of those shares of the fund which would have been taken by Francis Stevenson and Joseph B. Stevenson, had they been living at the period of distribution. Of the children of the testator the eldest son, Dr. Henry Stevenson, was the child of a former wife; all the rest being children of the testator\u2019s widow. It was claimed by the heirs of Dr. Henry Stevenson (also now deceased) that the shares of the two children of the testator, Vho had died intestate and without issue in the widow\u2019s life-i time, and before the period fixed for the sale of the mansion house, had descended from them, as real estate, to all their surviving brothers and sisters, including the eldest brother of the half blood, he being of the blood of the common ancestor, from whom the estate was derived. On the other hand, it was claimed that the direction for sale <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>worked an equitable conversion of the premises in the lifetime of the widow, so that the shares of the deceased children passed, as personal estate, to their executors or administrators.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b207-5\">Accompanying the petition of the executor for instructions, there were filed concurrent petitions of all the parties interested, submitting to the decree of Chancellor their rights in the premises.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b207-6\"><em>W. H. </em>Rogers,for the representatives of Henry Stevenson.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b207-7\">To effect an equitable conversion, the will must direct a sale absolutely, without any qualification, irrespective of all contingencies and not subject to any discretion. <em>Leigh &amp; Dalzell on Conv. </em>15; <em>Newl. on Cont. </em>54; <em>2 Kent Com. </em>230 (n); <em>2 Sto.

A mere <em>power </em>to sell or purchase does not change the nature of property or the course of its descent. 1 <em>Jarm. on Wills, </em>529.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b207-8\">The present case, even giving to the testator\u2019s expressed desire the force of a direction, is at most but a power, and its exercise subject to contingencies. During the life-time of the widow the sale was contingent upon her desire; and after her death it depended upon the discretion of the Chancellor. Until this discretion was exercised there could be no conversion. Meanwhile, by tbe death of the two children their shares descended as real estate. 9 <em>Watts.

It was, evidently, not the testator\u2019s intention to make the fact of sale, whether or not it should he made at all, contingent upon the Chancellor\u2019s approval, but only to require his supervision and judgment with respect to the time and terms, as a security against a sale being made at an improper time or for an inadequate price. The purpose of the testator to sell was positive, and the direction in that respect unqualified. This brings the case within the established doctrine of equitable conversion. <em>Williams on Fx\u2019rs. </em>551. The rule is fully discussed in <em>Fletcher vs. Ashburner, </em>1 <em>Bro. Ch. Rep. </em>497.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b208-5\">The Chancellor,</author>\n<p id=\"A-o\">after holding the case under conside-' ration, expressed the opinion that the direction for sale was sufficiently unqualified to work an equitable conversion of the fund from the death of the testator; and its distribution was decreed accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
