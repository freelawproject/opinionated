He alleges that his \u201ccivil and constitutional rights\u201d were violated at his trial and the State produced \u201cfalse and insufficient\u201d evidence against him. In his brief in this court he argues at some length that: he was not guilty, did not shoot anybody, but in his own house fired, at a man trying to break into his shop, two bullets, which lodged in his front door; at his trial his lawyer \u201cmisrepresented\u201d him by not calling five witnesses; a named policeman threatened two of his five witnesses with imprisonment if they testified for him; after sentence of three years, and after refusal of his lawyer to do so, he \u201cmade a motion\u201d to call his five witnesses, and the court (who heard the case without a jury) called one of them, struck out the policeman\u2019s testimony, and reduced the sentence to two years; he was thus convicted on \u201cfalse, unconstitutional, malicious, prejudiced, prejudged [perjured?], insufficient and inadequate testimony,\u201d of one witness, the man shot; he has newly discovered evidence that he did not shoot the man; no warrant was \u201csworn against\u201d him.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">Even if these assertions in the brief had been allegations in the petition for <em>habeas corpus, </em>they would not have been sufficient to entitle petitioner to a writ. There are no allegations or assertions or supporting affidavits as to <em>facts </em>showing that evidence was perjured and known by the State\u2019s officers to be perjured <em>(Mooney v. Holohan, </em>294 U. S. 103, 112, 55 S. Ct. 340, 79 L. Ed. 791, 98 A. L. R. 406; <em>Lyle v. State of Kansas, </em>317 U. S. 213, 63 S. Ct. 177, 87 L. Ed. 214; <em>Lisenba v. People of State of California, </em>314 U. S. 219, 62 S. Ct. 280, 86 L. Ed. 166), or was suppressed by threats of State\u2019s officers, or that petitioner\u2019s counsel betrayed him or acted corruptly or collusively <em>(Woods v. Nierstheimer, </em>328 U. S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>211, 66 S. Ct. 996, 90 L. Ed. 1177)\u2014assuming without deciding <em>(Nance v. Warden, </em>189 Md. 112, 53 A. 2d 554, 555), that such charges of lack of due process could be reviewed on <em>habeas corpus.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Of course, no testimony can be taken in this court. Neither here nor below can the question of guilt or innocence and the sufficiency of the evidence be retried on <em>habeas corpus. Olewiler v. Brady, </em>185 Md. 341, 344, 44 A. 2d 807; <em>Bernard v. Warden, </em>187 Md. 273, 49 A. 2d 737. Ordinarily rulings on evidence present no question of due process and are reviewable only on appeal or motion for new trial. <em>Cf. Chambers v. Florida, </em>309 U. S. 227, 60 S. Ct. 472, 84 L. Ed. 716; <em>Lisenba v. California, </em>314 U. S. 219, 62 S. Ct. 280, 86 L. Ed. 166. There is no showing of rulings on evidence which involve any fundamental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">\n<em>Order affirmed, without costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
