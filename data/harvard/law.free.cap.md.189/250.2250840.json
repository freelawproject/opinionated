The briefs and oral arguments in this court, and the opinions of the lower court and the Board, cover a wide range of questions of law and fact. Our view of the case makes it unnecessary to discuss or mention many of these questions or the facts pertaining to them. It will, however, be necessary to consider some facts regarding particular employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-10\">The basic questions presented are, (1) whether within the meaning of section 5(d) of the Unemployment Compensation Law, Code Supp. 1943, Article 95A, which disqualifies an individual for benefits in specified circumstances, claimants\u2019 unemployment was due to a stoppage of work which existed because of a labor dispute \u201cat the factory, establishment, or other premises\u201d at which they were last employed, and (2) if it was, whether section 5(d) is inapplicable because of the proviso in that subsection. The. Board answered the first question in the negative and held claimants not disqualified. If this finding of fact is supported by substantial evidence, it is conclusive and the second question is immaterial. Art. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>95A, sec. 14(c) ; <em>Heaps v. Cobb, </em>185 Md. 372, 380, 45 A. 2d 73; <em>Lewis v. Cumberland, </em>188 Md. 58; 54 A. 2d 319, 324. In stating the material facts, therefore, we must ignore opposing evidence (if any) and state as facts evidence most favorable to the Board\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">Employer is engaged in smelting and refining copper. It owns eighteen or more plants (mines, smelters and refineries) in various states, including a smelter at Garfield, Utah, and a refinery at Baltimore. \u201cBlister\u201d copper, smelted at Garfield, is refined at Baltimore. Claimants were employed at the Baltimore refinery. Employees at Baltimore, Garfield and sixteen other plants respectively were members of nineteen local C.I.O. unions and were represented by these unions as bargaining agents. The members of the local unions were, as such, members of one \u201cinternational\u201d union. In November and December, 1945, a \u201ccouncil\u201d of these nineteen local unions was organized for the purpose of national bargaining for all the unions with the employer. For a number of years it has been a purpose of the international union to achieve \u201cnational bargaining,\u201d but it has been completely unsuccessful in its attempt to do so. In December, 1945, the employer, by a letter from the chairman of its board to the vice-president of the international union and director of the council, refused to grant a request for national bargaining and said, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cThe plant manager, who is directly responsible for the success or failure of the enterprise of which he has charge, is, we believe, the proper person to negotiate the terms and conditions of the labor agreement applicable to the plant.\u201d The council tried to \u201csynchronize\u201d wage negotiations\u2014and strikes and threats of strikes\u2014on the part of all nineteen unions. Three Utah unions (two at Garfield), which had taken a strike vote under the SmithConnally Act, 50 U. S. C. A. Appendix, sec. 1501 <em>et seq., </em>before the council was organized, and which claimed that the issues in dispute in Utah were different from those in other states, refused to cooperate in such synchronization, and went on strike on January 21, 1946. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>Later the council took a strike vote of the sixteen other unions, and the sixteen went on strike on February 25, 1946. This strike, the lower court says, continued until June 19, 1946. During the Utah strike Baltimore employees paid their regular union dues but made no contributions to finance the strike. While they were laid off or were on strike they paid no dues.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">From time to time from February 4, 1946, to February 23, 1946, employer laid off a large number of its Baltimore employees because of lack of work. Each employee so laid off was sent a letter from employer stating that: Conditions had made it necessary to give him a \u201cfurlough\u201d; the Garfield plant, \u201cwhich supplies the copper for this refinery, is now shut down due to a strike\u201d called by the international union, which became effective January 21, 1946; and \u201cthe last copper from Garfield arrived here on February 4, 1946.\u201d Regret was expressed that these circumstances \u201chave forced us to gradually reduce our working force, but there is nothing else we can do. You will be notified promptly when the strike in Utah is over and we are ready to start up your department again.\u201d In the formal \u201cseparation notice\u201d sent by employer to each employee laid off \u201clack of work\u201d and not \u201clabor dispute\u201d was checked as the \u201creason for separation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">No claim is made on behalf of employees who ceased work when the Baltimore strike began, on February 25, 1946. Nor does the Board\u2019s decision\u2014or the appeals to the lower court and to this court\u2014cover any question as to the right of claimants to compensation from the time they were laid off until February 25, 1946. The lower court, however, held that claimants were not entitled to compensation (already paid them) for the period from February 4, 1946, to February 25, 1946. We find no basis for the court\u2019s action in this respect or for employer\u2019s contention that this question was or is properly at issue below or in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">Assuming that claimants\u2019 unemployment was originally due to a stoppage of work which existed because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>of a labor dispute at the Garfield plant, the question arises whether the Garfield plant and the Baltimore plant were one \u201cestablishment\u201d within the meaning of section 5(d), <em>i. e., </em>whether the Garfield plant was the \u201cestablishment\u201d at which claimants were last employed. The lower court found that the Garfield and Baltimore plants constituted one establishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">In <em>Spielmann v. Industrial Commission, </em>1940, 236 Wis. 240, 295 N. W. 1, cited by the lower court and by employer, the commission found, and it was undisputed, that: An automobile manufacturer had a body plant at Milwakee and an assembly plant at Kenosha, forty miles away. The one plant was devoted exclusively to the manufacture of bodies for several models of cars; the other exclusively to manufacture of other parts and assembly of the completed cars. Ninety-eight per cent of the cars were built against specific orders. Because of the numerous possible combinations in model, color, trim, accessories, etc., it was necessary that production schedules be carefully planned in advance. Accordingly the work of both plants was projected on a monthly, weekly and daily basis by a central planning department at the Kenosha plant. The production in each plant was highly synchronized and the work of the two plants so coordinated that a body built at Milwaukee against a given car order would meet the chasis built at Kenosha against the same order, pursuant to a prearranged schedule. It was endeavored to <em>keep the hourly rate of prodMction of the two plants the same. The bodies were transported from Milwaukee to Kenosha by trucks owned by the manufacturer and driven by its employees. The manufacturer had a general works manager in charge of the operation of the two plants. </em>(Italics supplied.) The commission concluded: \u201cBecause of the <em>functional integrality, general unity and physical proximity </em>of the two plants it is found that they constitute a single \u2018establishment.\u2019 \u201d (Italics supplied.) <em>Supra, </em>236 Wis. 244, 245, 295 N. W. 4. The court, sustaining the commission\u2019s finding, said: \u201cIt appears from this summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>that although ^ the two plants were forty miles apart, they were just as much a single establishment for the manufacture of automobiles as they would have been had they been in two buildings adjacent to each other, or in separate parts of the same building.\u201d <em>Supra, </em>236 Wis. 245, 295 N. W. 4. \u201cThe two plants manifestly constitute an establishment for the manufacture of automobiles, else the company has no establishment for their manufacture.\u201d <em>Supra, </em>236 Wis. 246, 295 N. W. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">Comparison with the facts in the <em>Spielman </em>case shows the absence of evidence that the Garfield and Baltimore plants, because of \u201cfunctional integrality,\u201d \u201cgeneral unity\u201d or \u201cphysical proximity,\u201d constitute a single \u201cestablishment.\u201d Plant managers, or even workmen, may commute forty miles to and fro daily. It would be futile to attempt to fix a precise limit (whether 2000 miles, or more or less) of \u201cphysical proximity.\u201d It is sufficient that in the ordinary use of words a plant at Garfield and one at Baltimore would not be called one \u201cestablishment\u201d and facts are lacking which might give a special and unusual application to the word \u201cestablishment.\u201d <em>Cf. Matson Terminals, Inc., v. California Employment Commission, </em>24 Cal. 2d 695, 707, 151 P. 2d 202. There is no evidence of more \u201cfunctional integration\u201d than there is in the case of any manufacturer who might regularly buy materials and supplies from certain suppliers, e. <em>g., </em>metals from Canada, coal from West Virginia or power from Baltimore. At all events the evidence is sufficient to support the Board\u2019s finding that the Garfield and Baltimore plants were not one \u201cestablishment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\"><em>Chrysler Corp. v. Smith, </em>1941, 297 Mich. 438, 448-449, 298 N. W. 87, 135 A. L. R. 900, also cited by the lower court and by employer, follows the <em>Spielman </em>case and is similar on the facts, but the \u201cphysical proximity\u201d of the plants was greater, <em>i. e., </em>all were in the Detroit area, and the Dodge Main Plant was within eleven miles of the others. Most of the manufacturing operations were \u201cfunctionally integrated and highly synchronized with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>the production of the Dodge Main Plant.\u201d <em>Supra, </em>297 Mich. 444, 298 N. W. 89, 135 A. L. R. 900.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\"><em>Unemployment Compensation Commission v. Aragon, </em>329 U. S. 143, 91 L. Ed. 136, 67 S. Ct. 245, involved no question whether two plants constituted one establishment. The court merely sustained the. commission\u2019s finding that there was a labor dispute at Alaskan establishments, though the negotiations were conducted at Seattle.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">The evidence indicates that, if asked to return to work, all the claimants probably would have actively participated in the Baltimore strike by refusing to cross the picket line. <em>Brown v. Maryland Unemployment Compensation Board, </em>189 Md. 233, 55 A. 2d 696, just decided. However, (with the exception hereafter mentioned) claimants\u2019 unemployment was due directly to lack of work before the Baltimore strike and not to stoppage of work because of the Baltimore strike. Claimants therefore are not disqualified for benefits under section 5(d). <em>Cf. Muncie Foundry Division v. Review Board, </em>1943, 114 Ind. App. 475, 485, 51 N. E. 2d 891, in which (as the Board says) it was held that if unemployment is originally caused by lack of work and a labor dispute develops during the continuance of the unavailability of work, such labor dispute does not disqualify the employee from benefits until work becomes available and he refuses to work because of the labor dispute. By the same token, a former employee would not be entitled to workmen\u2019s compensation for an accident by which he would have been injured if he had not been laid off.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">The lower court\u2019s opinion is based largely on the \u201cdeclaration of policy,\u201d in section 2 of the Law, that the unemployment reserves are to be used for the benefit of \u201cpersons unemployed through no fault of their own,\u201d and a finding by the court that after February 25, 1946 claimants were unemployed \u201cbecause of their own fault.\u201d In <em>Walter Bledsoe Coal Co. v. Review Board, etc., </em>1943, 221 Ind. 16, 20, 21, 46 N. E. 2d 477, 479, the corresponding provision in the Indiana statute was considered in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>connection with the provision for disqualification because of a labor dispute. The court held that \u201cfault\u201d does not mean \u201csomething worthy of censure,\u201d but \u201cmust be construed as meaning failure or volition.\u201d Quoted with approval, <em>Board of Review v. Mid-Continental Pet. Corp., </em>193 Okl. 36, 39, 40, 141 P. 2d 69. We have had occasion to refer to section 2 as \u201ca guide for the interpretation and application\u201d of the law. <em>Celanese Corporation of America v. Davis, </em>186 Md. 463, 47 A. 2d 379, 381; <em>Maryland Unemployment Compensation Board v. Albrecht, </em>183 Md. 87, 36 A. 2d 666. We have, however, held that if the language of the law is plain and free of ambiguity, the meaning of the language is the meaning of the Legislature. <em>Saunders v. Maryland Unemployment Compensation Board, </em>188 Md. 677, 53 A. 2d 579, 581. Section 5(d) deals explicitly with the subject of disqualification for benefits because of a labor dispute. We are not at liberty to construe the negative words of section 2, \u201cthrough no fault of their own,\u201d as an affirmative disqualification for \u201cfault,\u201d without regard to the express provisions of section 5 (d). If there is incongruity between the \u201cgeneral policy\u201d in section 2 and the result of particular provisions in section 5(d), the incongruity may be eliminated only by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">The order of the lower court must therefore be reversed\u2014except in respect of claimant Tucker who testified that when the Baltimore strike began he agreed to do, and later did do, \u201cpicket duty.\u201d An individual, to be eligible to receive benefits, must be \u201cable to work and is available for work.\u201d Section 4(c). He is disqualified for benefits if \u201chis unemployment is due to a stoppage of work which exists because of a labor dispute at the * * * establishment * * * at which he is or was last employed\u201d and he is \u201cparticipating in * * * the labor dispute.\u201d Section 5 (d). We have held that, \u201cThe purpose of the statute was to alleviate the consequences of involuntary employment. It was not intended to penalize or subsidize either employees or employers,' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>lawfully engaged in a labor dispute.\u201d <em>Saunders v. Maryland Unemployment Compensation Board, supra. </em>When Tucker thus voluntarily and actively participated in the Baltimore strike by agreeing to do and doing \u201cpicket duty,\u201d we think he thereby made himself \u201cunavailable for work,\u201d (cf. <em>Board of Review v. Mid-Continental Pet. Corp., </em>193 Okl. 36, 41, 141 P. 2d 69), and made his own strike and stoppage of work the direct and proximate cause\u2014or a direct and proximate cause\u2014of his own continued unemployment, notwithstanding the relation between the previous Garfield strike and his previous unemployment. He ceased to be a victim of the Garfield labor dispute and became an active partisan in the Baltimore labor dispute. As a voluntary active party to the Baltimore labor dispute, he is not entitled to be subsidized by unemployment benefits. His case on its facts is in sharp contrast with cases in which members of no union <em>(Kieckhefer Container Co. v. Unemployment Compensation Commission, </em>1940, 125 N. J. L. 52, 54, 13 A. 2d 646), or of a union not cooperating with the striking union <em>(Department of Industrial Relations v. Drummond, </em>1941, 30 Ala. App. 78, 1 So. 2d 395; <em>Wicklund v. Commissioner of Unemployment Compensation, </em>1943, 18 Wash. 2d 206, 138 P. 2d 876, 148 A. L. R. 1298), were held entitled to compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">Only eight claimants are parties to this appeal. Their claims were disallowed by the claim examiner. Section 6(c). His decision was reversed by the Board. Section 6(f). The Board\u2019s decision in turn was reversed by the lower court. Employer\u2019s counsel says approximately 480 claimants\u2019 status \u201cwill be determined by this appeal\u201d. The record does not disclose the present status of the four hundred and more claims. It does not clearly show who were parties to the appeals from the examiner to the Board. The appeal to the lower court was taken against eight named claimants, who however professed to answer \u201con their own behalf and for and on behalf of all other employees similarly situated\u201d. Though the other four hundred claimants are not before us, we may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>say -that three of them testified \u00e1nd \u25a0 showed themselves not entitled to compensation, one, DeMario, because he did.\u201cpicket duty,\u201d and two, Ross and Davidson, because they were not \u201claid off\u201d before the Baltimore strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\"><em>Order \u25a0 affirmed as to appellant .Tucker (as to compensation from and after February 25; 1936) and reversed as to the other appellants, costs above and below to be paid one-eighth by appellant Tucker, </em>seven-eighths\u2022 <em>by appellee.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
