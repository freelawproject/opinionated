On the former appeal this court affirmed the finding that defendant was guilty of adultery, but reversed the decree of divorce and remanded the case to permit her to set up a defense of adultery on plaintiff\u2019s part. <em>Dougherty v. Dougherty, </em>187 Md. 21, 48 A. 2d 451, 456. On this second appeal defendant complains of (1) finding that plaintiff was not guilty of adultery and (2) denial of alimony <em>pendente lite </em>since August 29, 1946.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">On the former appeal it was held that the public interest in divorce cases required that defendant be given an opportunity to prove plaintiff\u2019s adultery, though as between the parties this defense might be too belated to merit a hearing. The public interest does not require that in considering the credibility of testimony the staleness of the testimony be ignored. At the first trial \u201cdefendant\u2019s solicitor, in asking for leave to amend, explained that he did not obtain the facts as to recrimination until the first day of the trial, but the witnesses were in court ready to testify to the facts.\u201d 187 Md. 21, 48 A. 2d 456. At the second trial defendant\u2019s principal witness and defendant herself both testified that about April, 1941 (before plaintiff left defendant) the witness .telephoned plaintiff and plaintiff went to see her.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">This witness testified, at length and in detail, that early in 1941 she advertised for a young lady to share her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>apartment on Belair Road, and that plaintiff on behalf of \u201chis young lady friend\u201d answered the advertisement, made a deposit of a week\u2019s rent and the same evening brought around the so-called co-respondent, who stayed with witness for several months, both sleeping in the same bed, until one evening when witness \u201cwent out\u201d with plaintiff and the co-respondent, the two women quarreled and the co-respondent left. The co-respondent says she left because witness \u201cmakes her living by bringing men off the street into her home\u201d and she found witness in bed with a man. Witness testified to repeated visits by plaintiff to the co-respondent and to behavior which shows both disposition and opportunity for adultery, including spending a night together in the apartment while witness was away for the night. Witness says she herself has married one man who died, one whose marriage was annulled, and there was one she \u201cwas supposed to marry\u201d but never did marry, who lived \u201cas a boarder in her home\u201d for several years and by whose name she was known by the neighbors and listed in the telephone directory up to the time she testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">This witness\u2019s testimony as to plaintiff and the corespondent was flatly denied by them. They say the corespondent was a friend of the wife of a business associate and friend of plaintiff, that they first met at dinner at his friend\u2019s home, that on that occasion and another similar one plaintiff, at the request of his friend\u2019s wife, drove the co-respondent to her home on Belair Road, taking with him and back home his friend and the friend\u2019s wife and son, that plaintiff and the co-respondent never met except on these two occasions and once by chance in front of the B. &amp; O. Building. This testimony is corroborated by plaintiff\u2019s friend.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">A friend of defendant testified that in 1940 on three occasions she went with defendant to Broadway and saw plaintiff enter a house, stay about an hour and come out with the co-respondent. A niece of defendant says that once in 1942 she saw plaintiff talking with the co-respon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>dent in a department store where the co-respondent was then employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Whether plaintiff was proved guilty of adultery is a question of credibility, which can best be decided by the trial judge, who saw and heard the witnesses. If defendant\u2019s witness is believed, plaintiff was guilty. If plaintiff and the co-respondent are believed, he was not guilty. If none of them are believed, defendant has failed to sustain the burden of proof. The judge did not believe defendant\u2019s witness and did believe plaintiff and the co-respondent. We accept his finding. Defendant has failed to prove adultery on plaintiff\u2019s part.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">The lower court\u2019s only reason for denying alimony <em>pendente lite </em>was that, this court having finally found defendant guilty of adultery, she could not (even if plaintiff were likewise guilty) be entitled to a divorce or to [permanent] alimony, and therefore \u201cit would be contrary to the intent and purpose of the law to award alimony <em>[pendente </em>lite] to the wife * * * merely during the trial of a different issue which can not affect her right to [permanent] alimony.\u201d But alimony <em>pendente lite, </em>unlike permanent alimony, depends not upon guilt or innocence but only upon need. \u201cThe general rule is clear and undisputed, that the wife, in these cases, is a privileged suitor, and that the court, without inquiring into the merits, and whether she be plaintiff or defendant, will allow her alimony, <em>pendente lite, </em>and a sum for carrying on the suit. The rule is believed to be almost universal, to allow a destitute wife, who has been abandoned, or is living apart from her husband, temporary alimony, and the means of prosecuting or defending a suit for divorce, and this without any inquiry whatever, into the merits.\u201d <em>Coles v. Coles, 2 </em>Md. Ch. 341, 346. That case has repeatedly been quoted or cited and followed by this court. Wives found to be at fault both by the lower court and on appeal have been held entitled to alimony, as well as \u201csuit money\u201d (including counsel fees), pending appeal. <em>Sterling v. Sterling, </em>145 Md. 631, 643, 644, 125 A. 809; <em>Daiger v. Daiger, </em>154 Md. 501, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>507-509, 140 A. 717; <em>Cohen v. Cohen, </em>170 Md. 630, 638, 639, 187 A. 104. In other words, the wife is entitled to an allowance <em>pendente lite </em>to maintain the suit and also the suitor. <em>Cf. Brown v. Brown, </em>3 Terry 157, 29 A. 2d 149, 153. \u201cSometimes there may be reasons for allowing her counsel fees and money for other expenses when the court, in the exercise of the discretion vested in it, will not grant alimony <em>pendente lite.\u201d Hood v. Hood, </em>138 Md. 355, 360, 113 A. 895, 897, 15 A. L. R. 774. But no such reasons have been suggested in the case at bar except the finding of the wife\u2019s adultery. The fact that in a number of other jurisdictions the law is different emphasizes the long-established Maryland law. <em>Schouler, Divorce, Separation and Domestic Relations, </em>(6th Ed.), sec. 1769; <em>Keezer, Marriage and Divorce, </em>(3d Ed.), pp. 643, 680. If abuses regarding alimony <em>pendente lite </em>require change in the law, change may be made by legislation. <em>Cf. </em>Code, art. 16, sec. 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">On the former appeal we said, \u201c* * * it is clear that a divorce to one of two equally guilty spouses is just as definitely against the provisions and policy of the law as any other divorce which the law forbids.\u201d 187 Md. 21, 31. 48 A. 2d 456. We think the policy and the public interest which required that this belated defense be heard required proper allowances <em>pendente lite. </em>We may assume that if this defense had prevailed, defendant would not have been entitled to permanent alimony. It does not necessarily follow that plaintiff might not have been compelled to support her, <em>e. g., </em>by criminal proceedings (Code, art. 27, sec. 89, as amended) or by actions at law for necessaries. Until a suit for divorce is finally disposed of, maintenance <em>pendente lite </em>can be enforced by the divorce court, without resort to criminal proceedings or actions at law. We think that alimony <em>pendente lite </em>should have been continued pending this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">\n<em>Decree affirmed in part and reversed in part, and cause remanded for passage of a decree in accordance with this opinion, costs to be paid by appellee.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
