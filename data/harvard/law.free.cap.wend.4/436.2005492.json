The intestate died in 1813, and administration of his estate in the same year was granted to Huldah Doolittle and Joseph McKee by the then surrogate of the county of Jefferson. In January, 1827, a petition was presented to the surrogate of Jefferson by McKee, describing himself as <em>surviving administrator, </em>stating that \u00bfhe intestate was seised at the time of his death of certain real estate ; that the petitioner had made an account of the personal estate and of the debts of the deceased, and that such estate was insufficient to pay such debts, and requesting the aid of the surrogate in the premises; whereupon an order was made by the surrogate, requiring all persons interested to shew cause before him on the 20th March then next, why so much of the real estate should not be sold as would be sufficient to pay the debts of the intestate. On the day of shewing cause an order was made for the sale of the real estate, and on the 4th of J une, 1828, another order confirming the sale had in pursuance of the previous order, and directing a deed to be executed to the purchaser of the lessor of the plaintiff; and on the 5th July, 1828, a deed of the premises in question was accordingly executed to him by McKee as surviving administrator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b437-4\">The gran ting of administration was proved by an <em>exemplification </em>of the letters of administration, under the hand and seal of office of the present surrogate. The defendant objected to such evidence as inadmissible, insisting that the <em>original </em>letters should be produced; the objection was overruled. The several orders of the surrogate were also proved by exemplifications. It appeared in evidence that Huldah Doolittle, the <em>administratrix </em>died in June, 1827. Upon this state of facts the defendant objected to the sufficiency of the evidence to entitle the plaintiff to recover: first, because the <em>administratrix </em>did not unite with the <em>administrator </em>in the application to the surrogate for the sale of the intestate\u2019s estate ; and secondly, because it had not been shewn otherwise than by the recitals in the orders that there were any debts of the intestate, that there was a deficiency of assets <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>to pay the same, or that the personal property had been app]jec\u00a1 to t^e payme\u00f1t of debts, and consequently that enough had not been shewn to give the surrogate jurisdiction ; which objections were overruled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b438-4\">The defendant then produced in evidence a deed of the premises in question from the <em>heirs </em>of the intestate to one D. S. bearing date 6th March, 1827, and a conveyance from the grantees in that deed tb the defendant in this cause, bearing date 21st March, 1828 ; and <em>offered </em>to prove, that by the inventory, affidavit and papers presented to the surrogate by the administrator, on his application for an order of sale, it <em>did not appear </em>that at the time of such application any debts remained due from the \"estate of the intestate; and that it <em>did </em>appear that a large amount of property of the estate of the intestate remained undisposed of; and also that by the said papers it did appear, and that it was in fact true, that the debts for the payment of which the administrator applied for a sale, were debts created by and accruing to the administrator, for services rendered and expenses incurred by him since the decease of the intestate ; which evidence was objected to, and overruled by the judge. The defendant insisted that he was entitled to notice to quit, which objection was also overruled by the judge, who charged the jury that the plaintiff was entitled to recover ; the jury accordingly found a verdict for the plaintiff, to set aside which a motion was now made.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b438-5\"><em>J. A. Spencer, </em>for defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Abh\">The exemplification of the letters of administration ought not to have been received in evidence, the original being unaccounted for. They are mere letters of authority given to and remaining in the possession of the administrators and being originals should be produced or their absence accounted for. The granting of such letters is not a proceeding of record, and consequently cannot be exemplified;</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b438-6\">Both administrators should have united in the petition to the surrogate for the sale of the real estate. The words <em>\u201cany </em>executor or administrator, &amp;c.\u201d used in the statute, (1 R. L. 450, \u00a7 23,) manifestly apply to all the represen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>tatives of any particular estate, and not a single representative of that estate where there are several representatives. There seems to be a distinction as to the powers of executors and administrators: <em>one </em>executor may do an act which shall be binding on all, but the rule does not apply to administrators. (Comyn\u2019s Dig. tit. Executors B. 12. n. g.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b439-5\">The evidence offered to shew- that the surrogate had not jurisdiction ought to have been received. In <em>Dakin </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>(6 Cowen, 221,) it was held, that it should be shewn affirmatively that the surrogate had power to make the decree, that the facts upon which he acted gave him jurisdiction of the subject matter and of the persons before him. What is necessary to be averred must be proved and may be negatived. Evidence in contradiction of the records of tribunals of special and limited jurisdiction, shewing that the proof necessary to give them jurisdiction was not exhibited, is admissible. (19 Johns. R. 39. 3 Cowen, 206. 11 Johns. R. 175.) It may be shewn that the intestate at the time of his death was not an inhabitant of the county where the letters of administration were granted, in contradiction of the letters. (14 Johns. R. 428.) So it may be shewn in the appointment by a surrogate of a guardian to an infant that the requisite security was not given. (8 Cowen, 304.) In a proceeding against a man for leaving his wife and children a charge to the town, it is allowed to him to aver and prove that he, did not leave his wife and children a charge, notwithstanding the fact has been adjudicated by two tribunals. (6 Cowen, 234.) Allowing the surrogate\u2019s decree to <em>he prima facie </em>evidence of the facts set forth in it, a party affected by such decree is not estopped from controverting and contradicting such facts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b439-9\">The application for the sale of the real estate ought not to have been entertained after the lapse of 14 years (6 Johns. Ch. R. 360.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b439-11\">The defendant was entitled to notice to quit. [17 Johns. R. 158. 1 id. 45. 3 Caines, 188. 1 Johns. C. 153.]</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b439-13\"><em>C. P. Kirkland,, </em>for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AfRV\">The evidence of the granting of administration was unnecessary in this case; but if ne<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>cessary, the exemplification was sufficient proof of the fact. (1 Phil. Ev. 289. <em>1 </em>Starkie, 517. 8 East, 187.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AhQ\">The surrogate had jurisdiction of the several questions sec^ ^ere and it was his province to decide them. The court will intend that he had proper evidence to justify his decree, which, being unappealed from, is conclusive, (6 Cowen, 494.) His decision is <em>res judicata, </em>and cannot be collaterally questioned. (6 Johns. C. R. 381.) The judgment of a court of exclusive jurisdiction, directly on the point, is conclusive. (1 Phil. Ev. 242.) Nothing which might have been insisted on by way of appeal can be urged in answer to the evidence furnished by the decree. (1 Starkie\u2019s Ev. 253.) The record of proceedings in a court of limited jurisdiction, regular and correct on the face of it, cannot be impeached in a collateral action. (8 Johns. R. 50. 8 Cowen, 178.) Had the defendant offered to shew that the letters of administration were <em>not </em>granted in Jefferson county, the order for sale being made by the surrogate of that county, such evidence would have been admissible, for it would have attacked the <em>jurisdiction </em>of the surrogate ; but the evidence offered by him affecting the <em>exercise </em>of the jurisdiction, was incompetent and properly excluded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b440-5\">The sale of the lessor of the plaintiff divested the title of the heirs of the intestate, and of all persons claiming under them. (1 R. L. 450, \u00a7 24. 6 Johns. C. R. 381. 20 Johns. R. 420.) Consequently the defendant was not entitled to notice to quit.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b440-6\">\n<em>By the Court,</em>\n</p>\n<author id=\"Abaa\">Marcy, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A17\">However extraordinary or erroneous be the determination and proceedings of a court of limited authority, if it acts within its proper jurisdiction as to the subject matter, place and person, its judgment or decree cannot be impeached or invalidated in a collateral action.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">. This case presents the question\u2014what is necessary to give a surrogate jurisdiction where real estate is directed to be sold to supply a deficiency in the assets to pay the debts of a testator or intestate? The argument on behalf of the defendant seemed to proceed on the assumption that <em>an actual deficiency </em>in the assets must exist in order to confer jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>tion. By an examination of the act relative to the court of probates, (1 R. L. 450, \u00a7 23,) it will be found that the surrogate, if he be the officer for the county in which probate of the will or letters of administration were granted, is required to act <em>on the suggestion </em>of an administrator or executor of a deficiency of assets, <em>and </em>on receiving an account of the personal estate and debts of the deceased. He thus acquires jurisdiction of the subject matter. Notice is then required to be given for persons interested to shew cause against granting the order for the sale of the real estate. After hearing the proofs and allegations of the executors or administrators and other persons interested in the estate, the surrogate is to examine into and determine the question whether there is personal property sufficient to pay the debts or not; and if he finds there is not enough for that purpose, he orders a sale. In deciding upon the sufficiency of the assets, he acts judicially, and an error in this matter does not affect his jurisdiction. It would no more invalidate Ms subsequent proceedings than a mistake as to any other matter submitted to his examination and decision. He has not only authority, but it is Ms duty to settle that question. If he errs, Ms determination may be reviewed and reversed on an appeal; his proceedings are not void, but voidable only. (3 Cowen, 206.)</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">It was not made a question but that the surrogate of Jefferson county was the proper officer to entertain the application, and to make the order for the sale in case a sale was proper; but it was contended that <em>all </em>the admimstrators should have joined in the application. When there are several executors, the acts of any one are deemed inlaw to be the acts of all. (2 Ves. sen. 267. Toller, 324). A distinction in this respect between executors and administrators is found in some books. <em>Gomyn </em>does not notice it, and I believe if it ever was established, it is now exploded. It was demed in the case of Jacomb v. Harwood, (2 Ves. sen. 265;) and this court has passed on that question, and said that executors and administrators stand on the same ground, and their powers and responsibilities in respect to each other are the same. <em>(Douglass </em>v. <em>Satterlee, </em>11 Johns. R. 16. <em>Murray </em>v. <em>Blatchford, </em>1 Wendell, 583.) If these cases were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>not sufficient to authorize us to disregard. the supposed diU ference, it would, I apprehend, be very difficult to sustain it By any thing like substantial, reasons. The nature of their' \u00b0fficesi certainly so far as the personal estate is concerned', is so much alike that it affords no occasion to apply to the- one, in deciding upon their acts, a rule which is inapplicable to the other.</p>\n<p id=\"AkH\">The phraseology of the section directing' the proceedings' when the real estate is to be sold, would justify an application by <em>one </em>administrator, if the general rule was that where there are several <em>they' </em>must act conjointly. It is, that \u201c when <em>any </em>executor or administrator, &amp;c. shall discover or suspect\u201d a deficiency in the personal estate of his testator or intestate to pay the debts, &amp;c: <em>Tie </em>may make the application in the manner' therein provided! Upon general principles, and by the construction of the statute, I am' satisfied that' a single administrator, when he has an associate, has the right to call in the aid of the surrogate of the r roper county to sell real estate, to supply the deficiency in the personal estate, to pay the debts of the intestate.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Some minor questions _ are raised in this case, upon which We ought to express opr views. It is certain that an unreasonable length of time elapsed between the granting of the letters of administration and the period when the proceedings were instituted for the sale of the real property. This might have been, and, without some explanation, should have been a reason for the surrogate to- reject the application; The laws fixes no definite limits within which the proceedings must be commenced; we cannot therefore say that they are void. The time is- left to the discretion of the officer, and\" his error, if any, in relation to it, can be corrected only on appeal. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">The judge erred, it is said, in receiving an exemplified copy of the letters of administration without evidence or suggestion of the loss of the original.' Where the judgment, decree or proceeding of a court of record is to be proved\", it may be done by producing the original or a copy duly authenticated. (Starkie\u2019s Ev. pt. <em>2, </em>151.) This is the general rule- I cannot find that_ there- is, nor do I know why <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>there should be an exception to it in relation to the records of surrogates\u2019 courts. The letters of administration granted to M\u2019Kee and Doolittle were recorded, (perhaps I might say, were copies of the record.) Lord Ellenborough, in the case of <em>Alden </em>v. <em>Keddell, </em>(8 East, 187,) said that the letters of administration were only a copy of the original minutes of the court. In that case the book of acts directing letters to be issued, was received as evidence that letters had been granted. I think the judge decided correctly in receiving the exemplification of the letters of administration in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">The want of notice to quit did not, in my opinion, form an objection to the plaintiff\u2019s recovery. The question of notice can never arise where the relation of landlord and tenant does not exist. The defendant was not in possession as tenant of the lessor. He did not enter by his permission or with his acquiescence; nor did he enter under any person from whom the lessor claimed title. The lessor\u2019s title did not come from the <em>heirs, </em>but from the <em>ancestor, </em>and. overreached the title of the heirs. The statutes declares that the sale, by order of the surrogate, conveys a title to the purchaser valid and effectual against the heirs and devisees, and all claiming from or under them. There is no pretence for saying that the relation of landlord and tenant exists, or ever did exist, between the lessor or those from whom he claims and the defendant, or those under whom he held; and therefore no notice to quit could be required.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">Motion for new trial denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
