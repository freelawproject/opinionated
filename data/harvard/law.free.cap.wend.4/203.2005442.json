Judge Hayden, a commissioner <em>ex officio, </em>to execute the duties of a judge of this court at chambers refused to endorse his allowance of an appeal from a judgment rendered in a justice\u2019s court, because the affidavit setting forth the proceedings before the justice was <em>not </em>made within ten days after the rendering of the judgment, which was on the 22d January, and the affidavit was not made until the 4th February. A mandamus was now asked for directing the commissioner to endorse his <em>allocatur.</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b203-16\"><em>W. C.

A party wishing to avail himself of the remedy given by the statute must bring himself strictly within it or he is not entitled to its benefits. <em>The motion </em>therefore is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
