Mills, Inc. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>9 CIT 309 (1985). Following designation of <em>Izod </em>as a test case pursuant to Rule 84(b) of the Rules of this Court, a suspension calendar containing 387 related actions was established pursuant to Rule 84(a) of the Rules of this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-11\">When the <em>Izod </em>decision became final, a suspension disposition calendar was established pursuant to Rule 85(a) of the Rules of this Court, containing all 387 actions from the suspension calendar. Thereafter, the Court directed the Clerk of the Court to issue the notice required by Rule 85(b) of the Rules of this Court advising the parties that the 387 actions would remain on the suspension disposition calendar for 18 months, the maximum time allowed under Rule 85(b) of the Rules of this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-12\">A review of the history of the suspension disposition calendar shows that this Court has generously granted each action an average of five motions for an extension of time to remain on the suspension disposition calendar pending settlement by the parties. Currently, 184 actions remain on the calendar.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-13\">Federal trial courts have a responsibility to manage their dockets to provide for the efficient and expeditious termination of controversies. <em>Applied Research Labs. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>70 Cust. Ct. 321, 323 (1973). One tool by which this Court may manage its docket is the <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal of actions which are languishing without further prosecution. <em>Link </em>v. <em>Wabash R.R. Co., </em>370 U.S. 626-30 <em>reh\u2019g denied </em>371 U.S. 873 (1962); <em>Julien </em>v. <em>Zeringue, </em>864 F.2d 1572, 1575 (1989); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Chas. Kurz Co., </em>55 CCPA 107, 110, C.A.D. 941, 396 F.2d 1013, 1016 (1968). <em>See also </em>Rule 41(b)(2) of the Rules of this Court. In <em>Chas.

The parties are to complete all discovery in these actions by the dismissal date stated in the attached schedule;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-5\">2. Any proposed stipulated judgment on agreed statement of facts under Rule 58.1 of the Rules of this Court must be submitted to the Government with the required notice to the Court and any dispositive motions are to be filed with the Court before the close of business fifteen days after the dismissal date stated in the attached schedule;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-6\">3.
