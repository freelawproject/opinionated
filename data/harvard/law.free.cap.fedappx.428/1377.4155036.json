Ortiz. In December of 1971, Mr. Ortiz filed a claim for benefits for a service-connected disability that he characterized as a \u201cnervous condition\u201d and \u201crecurrent headaches.\u201d After obtaining a psychiatric evaluation, the Veterans Administration regional office rejected Mr. Ortiz\u2019s claim in 1972. The regional office concluded that his \u201cnervous condition\u201d was not service connected and stated that a \u201cpersonality disorder\u201d is \u201cnot a disability under the law.\u201d Mr. Ortiz did not appeal that determination, and that decision became final.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">In 1979, Mr. Ortiz sought to reopen his disallowed claim. He supported his request with a psychiatric evaluation made by a private physician. When the regional office refused to reopen his 1971 claim, Mr. Ortiz filed a notice of disagreement. The regional office provided him with a statement of the case, which identified the single issue in the case as the \u201csufficiency of evidence to reopen claim for service connection for nervous condition\u201d and stated that the 1979 psychiatric evaluation was insufficient to warrant reopening because it was \u201csolely cumulative or repetitious in character\u201d to the evidence already in the record and therefore was not new and material evidence that would justify reopening the 1971 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">Mr. Ortiz took steps to appeal that decision to the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals. At the outset, there was some confusion regarding what documents Mr. Ortiz had submitted in support of his appeal. In March of 1980, Mr. Ortiz wrote to the agency asking about the status of his appeal of his request for service connection for his nervous condition. The following month, the regional office sent Mr. Ortiz a letter instructing him that if he wished to \u201creactivate [his] appeal,\u201d he should submit a copy of VA Form 1-9, a standard agency form that includes instructions and questions that are relevant to perfecting an appeal to the Board. Mr. Ortiz responded by letter in May of that same year. He explained that he had already sent the agency a completed copy of VA Form 1-9:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ArL\">I just received a letter on 23 April of 1980, relative to my claim of the case, for the compensation for my nervous condition. The form was sent out in November of 1979, from here, the Veterans at Ponce.... Please search the records because no action has yet been taken. I hope that you can make an evaluation, since I do not see any reason why you would not want to do it, since I have all the rights. I was 8 years waiting. I hope you will give me an appointment since I feel very sick and the treatment at Mayaguez consists only of pills and nothing else.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">The regional office again sent Mr. Ortiz a letter instructing him to file VA Form 1-9. That letter, dated June of 1980, advised Mr. Ortiz that no further action would be taken on his appeal unless he submitted the completed form within 30 days. Mr. Ortiz did not respond to that letter, and the Board did not take any further steps to address his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-10\">In 1994, Mr. Ortiz again sought to reopen his claim. This time, following lengthy proceedings, the regional office granted him service connection for a bipolar disorder with an effective date of July 8, 1994. Mr. Ortiz disputed the assigned effective date; he contended that the effective date for his benefits should be 1979, because the Board had improperly failed to process his 1979 appeal, which he contended was still pending in appellate status. <em>See Adams v. Shinseki, </em>568 F.3d 956, 960 (Fed.Cir.2009). In a 2005 decision the Board adjusted his effective date slightly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1042\">*1042</page-number>but rejected his \u201cpending claim\u201d argument on the ground that he had failed to file a VA Form 1-9 or its equivalent, setting out allegations of error of fact or law, within one year of the regional office\u2019s September 1979 decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Mr. Ortiz appealed the Board\u2019s decision to the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (\u201cthe Veterans Court\u201d). In a single-judge decision dated July 28, 2008, the court concluded that Mr. Ortiz\u2019s submissions \u201cdid no more than identify his claim,\u201d i.e., his request for service-connected disability benefits, and therefore did not satisfy the statutory requirement that he identify particular factual or legal errors in the regional office\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">On rehearing <em>en banc, </em>the Veterans Court upheld the Board\u2019s decision by a divided vote. Analyzing the statute that sets forth the procedures governing appeals to the Board, the court noted that since its enactment in 1962, the statute has required a claimant\u2019s formal appeal to \u201cset out specific allegations of error of fact or law, such allegations related to the specific items in the statement of the case.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7105(d)(3). The court explained that the veteran\u2019s substantive appeal must expand upon his initial statement of disagreement with the regional office\u2019s decision and set forth, \u201chowever inartfully \u2014 a particular theory of error for the Board to decide.\u201d The court stated that although Mr. Ortiz\u2019s 1980 letter had identified his claim of service connection for a nervous condition and had made clear that he \u201cwas contesting whether new and material evidence had been submitted to reopen the prior denial of that claim,\u201d that was not sufficient. Because Mr. Ortiz\u2019s letter had \u201casserted no reason or theory why the [statement of the case] was incorrect\u201d and had \u201cfailed to even state a rough or inarticulate allegation of error,\u201d the court concluded that the Board had properly treated the 1979 appeal as having been abandoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">The dissenting judges noted that Mr. Ortiz\u2019s letters were sent to the agency \u201cshortly after he received the [statement of the case] that addressed only one issue \u2014 the failure, as determined by the [regional office] to submit new and material evidence \u2014 making it readily understandable what Mr. Ortiz was contesting.\u201d In the view of the dissenting judges, Mr. Ortiz\u2019s act of \u201csimply appealing the [regional office\u2019s] determination that he had not submitted new and material evidence is sufficient issue identification\u201d for his administrative appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">Mr. Ortiz died while the case was pending before the Veterans Court. Following the entry of judgment in the Veterans Court, Ms. Rivera moved to be substituted on her husband\u2019s claim. Because the time for filing an appeal was approaching, she filed a notice of appeal to this court before the Veterans Court had acted on her motion. The Veterans Court then denied the motion on the ground that the notice of appeal had transferred exclusive jurisdiction over the matter to this court. Ms. Rivera argues that.the notice of appeal did not divest the Veterans Court of authority to enter an order substituting her on her husband\u2019s claim, but in the alternative, she moved this court to hold that she should be substituted on Mr. Ortiz\u2019s claim. We granted Ms. Rivera\u2019s motion without prejudice to the government\u2019s right to object to the substitution, but the government has raised no objection to the substitution order in its brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b400-11\">The statute governing appeals to the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals that was in effect in 1980, 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4005(d)(3) (1980), is nearly identical to the statute that is in force today, although it has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1043\">*1043</page-number>recodified as 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7105(d)(3). The statute stated then, and states now, that the claimant\u2019s appeal \u201cshould set out specific allegations of error of fact or law, such allegations related to specific items in the statement of the case.\u201d It adds that the Board \u201cmay dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4005(d)(5) (1976), now codified as 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7105(d)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">The appeal process requires a claimant to make two filings in response to a decision by a regional office with which the claimant disagrees. First, the claimant must file a notice of disagreement, which need only express a \u201cdesire for review\u201d of the regional office\u2019s decision. 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 19.113 (1980). In response, the regional office prepares a \u201cstatement of the case\u201d explaining its decision on the claim. To trigger review by the Board, the claimant is required to file an appeal, identifying the error or errors committed by the regional office.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">The Veterans Court acknowledged that the Department of Veterans Affairs (\u201cDVA\u201d), both at the time of Mr. Ortiz\u2019s 1980 appeal and now, has operated under a duty to read the documents that a claimant files in support of his appeal liberally and sympathetically in deciding if the claimant has sufficiently alleged an error of fact or law. 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 19.116 (1980) (obligation to construe filing liberally); <em>see Comer v. Peake, </em>552 F.3d 1362, 1368 (Fed.Cir.2009) (same, under current regulation). Moreover, we have held that the Board is required to address all issues reasonably raised on appeal, even if the issue might not be directly raised in the veteran\u2019s appellate filings when read in isolation. <em>Robinson v. Shinseki, </em>557 F.3d 1355, 1361 (Fed.Cir.2009); <em>Comer, </em>552 F.3d at 1368 (DVA obliged to consider entitlement to TDIU benefits, even when not specifically raised in the formal appeal, if the record contains \u201cpersuasive and pervasive evidence\u201d of unemployability).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">While acknowledging the liberal standard that is to be applied to the construction of veterans\u2019 submissions, the Veterans Court interpreted section 7105(d)(3) to require an appellant to present \u201ca particular theory of error for the Board to decide\u201d and to \u201cexplain why the [statement of the case] was in error.\u201d Mr. Ortiz\u2019s 1980 letter to the agency failed to satisfy that standard, according to the Veterans Court, because \u201cit does not dispute any finding of fact made by the [regional office]\u201d and merely reflects his dissatisfaction with the decision against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">The Veterans Court based its construction of section 7105(d)(3) in significant part on its understanding of the legislative history leading to the enactment of that provision. The court noted that in 1962, Congress enacted the law that \u201crequired [the] VA for the first time to fully explain its decisions through a new procedure called the Statement of the Case.\u201d Act of Sept. 19, 1962, Pub. L. No. 87-666, 76 Stat. 553 (1962). The court added that the Act \u201cbalanced this new disclosure rule with a requirement that claimants respond to the [statement of the case] with a Substantive Appeal that must clearly identify the benefits sought and \u2018should set out specific allegations of error of fact or law....\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">In fact, the requirement that claimants set out specific allegations of error in their substantive appeals was not adopted to balance the agency\u2019s obligation to issue a statement of the case, but was of much earlier vintage. In 1933, Congress authorized the President to create what is now the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals. Independent Offices Appropriation Act, 1934, Pub. L. No. 73-78, 48 Stat. 283, 309 (1933). The Board was created later that same year by executive order. Exec. Order No. 6230, pt. 2, \u00a7 1 (1933). Language similar to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1044\">*1044</page-number>language at issue in this case first appeared in that 1933 order: \u201cEach application for review on appeal should contain specific assignments of the alleged mistake of fact or error of law in the adjudication of said claim, and any application for review on appeal insufficient in this respect may be dismissed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 7. But it was not until 1962 that Congress required the regional office to prepare the statement of the case. The statement of the case was intended to summarize the evidence, identify the applicable law, and explain the reasons for the regional office\u2019s decision. 76 Stat. at 553. Congress believed that veterans often lacked the information necessary to pursue an appeal to the Board, and it intended the statement of the case to assist the veterans in framing their further submissions and the Board in resolving appeals. <em>See </em>S.Rep. No. 87-1843, at 2 (1962) (\u201cThis bill will place the veteran or his survivor in a better position to develop new evidence available and to fully prepare and present his appeal. Moreover, the issue should be more clearly delineated which should facilitate appellate procedures in many cases.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Accordingly, before 1962 veterans were required to identify specific errors of fact or law for the Board to review, even though they did not have the benefit of the agency\u2019s statement of the case explaining the reason for the regional office\u2019s decision. Because the pleading requirement was neither imposed for the first time nor amended as part of the 1962 legislation, it appears that Congress did not intend to \u201cbalance\u201d the obligations of the agency and the obligations of the claimant by requiring the veteran to offer, as the Veterans Court stated, \u201ca particular theory of error.\u201d To the contrary, with the statement of the case procedure in place, the Board could identify the issues on appeal with reference to the statement of the case and did not have to rely exclusively on the veteran\u2019s appeal to frame the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">Section 7105(d)(3) does not prescribe a particular format for the veteran\u2019s appeal or a particular degree of specificity that must be provided. If the regional office addresses, for example, multiple claims in the same decision, it may be reasonable to expect the veteran to specify the particular denied claim that he seeks to appeal. On the other hand, less specificity is necessary when the regional office\u2019s decision turns on only a single issue and the nature of the claimed error with respect to that issue is obvious from the decision itself. In fact, when the regional office decides only one issue and references only one issue in the statement of the case, the veteran\u2019s expression of a desire to appeal from the regional office\u2019s decision effectively identifies the issue to be decided by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">In its 1979 decision, the regional office decided a single issue: that Mr. Ortiz\u2019s newly submitted evidence was not sufficient to warrant reopening his previously disallowed claim. The statement of the case identified the sole issue as the \u201csufficiency of the evidence to reopen claim for service connection for nervous condition,\u201d and it explained the regional office\u2019s decision simply by saying that Mr. Ortiz\u2019s evidence was \u201csolely cumulative or repetitious in character\u201d and failed to establish that his nervous condition was incurred or aggravated in service. In such a case, in which the sole issue on appeal is the factual question of the sufficiency of the veteran\u2019s evidence to reopen his claim, all that is required is that the veteran make clear that he disagrees with the regional office\u2019s conclusion that he failed to offer new and material evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">The Veterans Court acknowledged that Mr. Ortiz\u2019s 1980 correspondence made it clear that he was \u201ccontesting whether new and material evidence had been submitted to reopen the prior denial of that claim.\u201d The court also stated that it would have been sufficient if Mr. Ortiz had stated in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1045\">*1045</page-number>his appeal \u201cthat the [regional office] erred in its interpretation of the new evidence it discussed.\u201d Comparing what the court regarded Mr. Ortiz to have made clear in his correspondence and what the court considered to be necessary to satisfy the statutory standard, it appears that the court interpreted the statute to require an explicit statement of what was conveyed by clear implication in his correspondence. In light of the Board\u2019s obligations to read veterans\u2019 submissions liberally and to consider the full context within which those submissions are made, we conclude that section 7105(d)(8) does not impose such a requirement, at least in the context of a case involving the single factual question of the sufficiency of the veteran\u2019s evidence to reopen a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">Under these circumstances, since there was only a single issue identified in the statement of the case, Mr. Ortiz\u2019s 1980 letters to the Veterans Administration were sufficient to identify the issue on appeal and to satisfy the statutory standard. Where, as in this case, the underlying facts are undisputed, it is within our jurisdiction to decide the ultimate legal question, i.e., whether Mr. Ortiz adequately identified the error he wished the Board to correct. <em>See Szemraj v. Principi, </em>357 F.3d 1370,1375 (Fed.Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Costs to Ms. Rivera.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">REVERSED</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
