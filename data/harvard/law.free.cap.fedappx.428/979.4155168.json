Stevens (\u201cMr. Stevens\u201d), pro se, appeals from a decision of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (\u201cVeterans Court\u201d) affirming the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals (\u201cBoard\u2019s\u201d) decision denying Mr. Stevens\u2019 service connection for his knee injury. Because Mr. Stevens raises only factual contentions, we dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-26\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b407-27\">Mr. Stevens served in the United States Army from December of 1953 to December of 1957. Mr. Stevens suffers from \u201cmild to moderate arthritis\u201d in both knees. In March of 2004, Mr. Stevens filed a claim for benefits with the Department of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1050\">*1050</page-number>Veterans Affairs (\u201cVA\u201d) alleging a service connection for an injury to his right knee. Mr. Stevens alleged that he injured his right knee in 1956 when stationed in Alaska. According to Mr. Stevens, he was working on a telephone pole when a \u201cbull moose violently shook the pole\u201d causing him to fall to the ground and injure his right knee. Mr. Stevens alleges that after the fall he was examined at the local hospital and that his \u201cknee was wrapped up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">The record in this case is limited, in part because the 1973 fire at the National Personnel Records Center in St. Louis, Missouri apparently destroyed Mr. Stevens\u2019 service medical records, save for his separation examination. Mr. Stevens\u2019 separation examination noted scars on his forehead and knee, and stated that his lower extremities were normal upon clinical evaluation. According to a report from an outpatient visit to the VA in November of 2000, Mr. Stevens stated he received a laceration on his right knee at the age of nine. He also reported that he had not been injured or hospitalized during his military service.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">The VA Regional Office denied Mr. Stevens\u2019 claim, concluding that the evidence did not demonstrate a service connection to his knee injury. Following an appeal, the Board affirmed, concluding that \u201c[t] he preponderance of the evidence [was] against\u201d Mr. Stevens\u2019 claim. The Veterans Court affirmed, finding that the Board\u2019s determination was not clearly erroneous. The Veterans Court also found that the VA had satisfied its \u201cheightened\u201d duty to assist Mr. Stevens\u2019 with his claim due to the loss of records in the fire. Addressing Mr. Stevens\u2019 contention that the record was not an \u201caccurate account\u201d of his military service, the Veterans Court concluded that there was no showing of \u201cbad faith or negligence on the part of [the] VA\u201d in losing the records in the fire. Finally, because the Veterans Court held that the Board\u2019s weighing of the evidence was not \u201cclearly erroneous,\u201d the court held that it could not apply the \u201cbenefit of the doubt\u201d rule to Mr. Stevens\u2019 claim. Mr. Stevens appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">Our review of Veterans Court decisions is limited by statute. Under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(a), we may review \u201cthe validity of a decision of the [Veterans] Court on a rule of law or of any statute or regulation ... or any interpretation thereof (other than a determination as to a factual matter) that was relied on by the Court in making the decision.\u201d Unless the appeal presents a constitutional issue, we \u201cmay not review (A) a challenge to a factual determination, or (B) a challenge to a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a particular case.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">Mr. Stevens makes several fact-based arguments in his informal brief, none of which fall within this court\u2019s jurisdiction. First, Mr. Stevens contends that he is entitled to \u201cservice-connected compensation\u201d because the nature of his injuries is \u201cconsistent\u201d with his claim that he was injured during an on-duty fall. In other words, Mr. Stevens contends that the Board\u2019s determination that a preponderance of the evidence was against a finding of service connection for the injury was wrong. Whether Mr. Stevens\u2019 injury is service connected is a question of fact though, and we do not have jurisdiction to reweigh the evidence considered by the Board. <em>See Waltzer v. Nicholson, </em>447 F.3d 1378, 1380 (Fed.Cir.2006) (holding that a challenge to the proper weight of the evidence is a question of fact, outside this court\u2019s jurisdiction). Second, Mr. Stevens questions whether the limited record can be considered \u201can accurate account\u201d of his service in the military. The question of whether the record is accurate is also a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1051\">*1051</page-number>factual matter, outside the jurisdiction of this court. <em>See Waters v. Shinseki </em>601 F.3d 1274, 1278 (Fed.Cir.2010) (holding that a claim that medical records were falsified was a factual question, outside of the court\u2019s jurisdiction).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Third, Mr. Stevens \u201crequests]\u201d that this court apply the \u201cbenefit of the doubt principle\u201d to his appeal. The \u201cbenefit of the doubt\u201d rule is codified at 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5107(b) and states that the \u201cthe Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant\u201d only \u201c[w]hen there is an approximate balance\u201d of evidence on a material issue. Where, as here, the Board has determined that a \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d is contrary to the veteran\u2019s claim, \u00a7 5107(b) does not apply. <em>Fagan v. Shinseki, </em>573 F.3d 1282, 1287 (Fed.Cir.2009) (\u201c[T]he \u2018benefit of the doubt\u2019 doctrine has \u2018no application where the Board determines that the preponderance of the evidence weighs against the veteran\u2019s claim\u2019 or when the evidence is not in \u2018equipoise.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Ortiz v. Principi </em>274 F.3d 1361, 1366 (Fed.Cir.2001)). The Veterans Court held that the Board\u2019s factual findings were not clearly erroneous and that therefore the \u201cbenefit of the doubt\u201d rule was inapplicable. This court does not have jurisdiction to consider the proper weight of the evidence, and therefore does not have jurisdiction to consider the application of \u00a7 5107(b) to the facts of a veteran\u2019s claim. <em>Ferguson v. Principi, </em>273 F.3d 1072, 1076 (Fed.Cir.2001) (stating that \u00a7 5107(b) was \u201cunambiguous on its face\u201d and that the application of the statute to the facts of a veteran\u2019s claim is outside this court\u2019s jurisdiction).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">Finally, to the extent Mr. Stevens contends that the loss of his records in the 1973 fire should result in a presumption of a service connection for his injury, this court has previously considered and rejected such an argument. <em>Cromer v. Nicholson, </em>455 F.3d 1346, 1351 (Fed.Cir.2006) (acknowledging the \u201cchallenges posed by the loss of records in the 1973 fire\u201d but concluding that the difficulties are \u201cnot a sufficient basis on which this court can create a new rule that would alter the process for benefits claims\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">For the reasons stated above, we dismiss Mr. Stevens\u2019 appeal for a lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">Costs</p>\n<p id=\"b409-10\">Each party shall bear its own costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-11\">DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
