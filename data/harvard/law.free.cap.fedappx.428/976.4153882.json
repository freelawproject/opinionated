In this appeal, she argues that the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (\u201cthe Veterans Court\u201d) improperly rejected her contention that the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals should have ordered a medical opinion to be prepared in connection with her claim. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Mrs. Webster\u2019s husband, Gary L. Webster, served in Vietnam during the 1960s as an active duty member of the United States Army. He died of pancreatic cancer in 1998. Mrs. Webster subsequently sought Dependency and Indemnity Compensation benefits for his death based on her assertion that his death was service-connected. Her theory of service connection was that Mr. Webster\u2019s exposure, while in Vietnam, to herbicides including Agent Orange ultimately caused the pancreatic cancer that resulted in his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">After proceedings before a regional office of the Department of Veterans Affairs (\u201cDVA\u201d) and the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals, followed by a remand from the Veterans Court for readjudication, the Board denied Mrs. Webster\u2019s request for compensation. As part of its decision, the Board ruled, based on the evidence before it, that the DVA was not required to obtain a medical opinion with respect to the service-connection issue. The Board also held that the DVA had not violated its duty to assist the claimant because, based on the development of the case already, undertaken, there was \u201cno reasonable possibility that further assistance will aid in substantiating her claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">The Board noted that Mr. Webster\u2019s disease did not manifest itself until more than 20 years after his separation from service and concluded that \u201cthe record does not contain any objective medical evidence that indicates that [his disease was] linked to his period of active military service, including herbicide and/or pesticide exposure during service in the Republic of Vietnam.\u201d The Board held that medical treatise evidence submitted by Mrs. Webster was general in nature and insufficient to support her claim of causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-10\">Mrs. Webster appealed that decision to the Veterans Court. She argued that the DVA had violated its duty to assist her when it failed to order a medical opinion that might support her claim. The court noted that the DVA is not required to order a medical opinion if \u201cno reasonable possibility exists that the medical opinion would aid in substantiating her claim.\u201d Because the court concluded that a medical opinion would not aid Mrs. Webster in substantiating her claim, the court rejected her argument that an opinion should have been ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-11\">On appeal to this court, Mrs. Webster does not disagree with the \u201cno reasonable possibility\u201d test articulated by the Veterans Court. Rather, she argues that the court erroneously relied on outdated precedents from before the enactment of the Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (\u201cVCAA\u201d), which expanded the scope of the DVA\u2019s duty to assist claimants. Under the proper standard, she contends, the treatise evidence that she submitted should have been regarded as sufficient to trigger the DVA\u2019s duty to order a medical opinion regarding the question whether Mr. Webster\u2019s disease was caused by his exposure to Agent Orange.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-12\">Mrs. Webster objects to the Veterans Court\u2019s citation of cases dealing with the \u201cwell-grounded claim\u201d rule, which at one time imposed a heavy evidentiary burden on claimants before the DVA\u2019s duty to assist the claimants would be triggered. <em>See Wallin v. West, </em>11 Vet.App. 509 (1998); <em>Beausoleil v. Brown, </em>8 Vet.App. 459 (1996). Congress abolished that rule in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1048\">*1048</page-number>the VCAA and made clear that the DVA had a duty to assist claimants unless no reasonable possibility exists that such assistance would aid in substantiating their claims. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5103A(a)(2); <em>Wood v. Peake, </em>520 F.3d 1345, 1348 (Fed.Cir.2008); <em>see also Waters v. Shinseki, </em>601 F.3d 1274, 1278-79 (Fed.Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">Mrs. Webster\u2019s objection to the court\u2019s reference to the well-grounded claim rule is well taken. That rule has been legislatively overturned, and references to the standards that were used in applying that rule risk creating confusion regarding the standard that applies to the DVA\u2019s responsibilities under the duty to assist imposed by the VCAA. In this case, however, the citation of the \u201cwell-grounded claim\u201d cases in the Veterans Court\u2019s opinion is harmless, as it does not indicate that the court actually applied an incorrect standard. The court articulated the correct standard when it stated that a medical opinion is not required if \u201cno reasonable possibility exists\u201d that the opinion would aid in substantiating the claim, and the language that the court cited from the \u201cwell-grounded claim\u201d cases is not inconsistent with that test. Thus, the court stated that the treatise evidence was \u201cgeneral in nature\u201d and that such evidence must not be \u201cspeculative\u201d and \u201cinconclusive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Mrs. Webster particularly objects to the court\u2019s statement that the treatise evidence \u201clacks the \u2018degree of certainty\u2019 required by our prior caselaw.\u201d While the court\u2019s allusion to the \u201cprior caselaw\u201d appears to refer to the \u201cwell-grounded claim\u201d cases, which do not set forth the correct standard for assessing the DVA\u2019s duties under the VCAA, the phrase quoted by the court is itself not incorrect as applied to the particular issue in this case. The court\u2019s reference to the \u201cdegree of certainty\u201d is taken from a sentence in an earlier case providing that medical treatise evidence is sufficient to trigger the DVA\u2019s duty to assist if it \u201cdiscusses generic relationships with a degree of certainty such that, under the facts of a specific case, there is at least plausible causality based upon objective facts.\u201d <em>Wallin, </em>11 Vet.App. at 514, quoting <em>Sacks v. West, </em>11 Vet.App. 314, 317 (1998). We do not regard that statement, at least as applied in this case, to be inconsistent with the \u201cno reasonable possibility\u201d standard earlier stated by the court. That is particularly true in light of the court\u2019s observation that the Board found the treatise evidence to be \u201cspeculative, general, and inconclusive,\u201d and the court\u2019s ultimate ruling that a medical opinion could not assist Mrs. Webster in substantiating her claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">On this record, while we do not endorse the reference to cases invoking the well-grounded claim rule in the context of a case involving the post-VCAA duty to assist, we conclude that the court\u2019s reference to several of its previous well-grounded claim cases did not have the effect of altering the court\u2019s application of the proper standard, which it articulated at the outset of its discussion of the treatise issue. Because, in this context, our jurisdiction is limited to review of the legal principles and rules applied by the Veterans Court, we do not address the question whether the court correctly held that, under the proper legal standard, the particular evidence submitted in this case should have been deemed sufficient to require the DVA to order a medical opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">No costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
