On the date named in the indictment, the accused issued a search warrant for the premises of one James Robinson, having cause to believe that ardent spirits were there stored contrary to law. The warrant was given to the deputy sheriff to be executed, who organized a posse to accompany him to the premises in question. Some hours later, upon the same day, the officer and the posse returned with several runlets and vessels, supposed to contain ardent spirits which had been found on the premises of James Robinson. The officer and posse entered the office of the accused upon their return, conveying the liquor before the accused, and a considerable crowd of people also at the same time entered the room. Thereupon the accused asked several of the bystanders their opinion as to what the liquor was. One of them smelt it, not tasting it, and expressed the opinion that it was not whiskey, but burnt molasses. The accused asked another person \u201cto go get a glass and try it,\u201d telling this person \u201cto pour out some and see what it is.\u201d This per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>son poured out nearly a glass full and drank it, and said that \u201cif \u2019twas whiskey it was the meanest stuff he ever tasted.\u201d The accused said to another person: \u201cWe have something here, we don\u2019t know what it is. Taste it and see.\u201d Some one passed to this person a glass and he took \u201cabout two fingers\u201d and drank it, and said that it. was whiskey. The \u25a0accused beckoned to another person and made the same statement and request last mentioned of him, adding, \u201cI know you are a good judge of liquor.\u201d This person took \u201ca good-size drink of it,\u201d and said he thought it was mean com whiskey. The accused said to another person that he wanted \u201csome good judge of liquor to see whether the stuff was whiskey or not,\u201d and asked him to taste it. This person took between a teaspoonful and tablespoonful of it and drank it, and said that it tasted like liquor to him. Another person, named Parrish, who had been a distiller, came into the room, and the accused said: \u201cHere is Had Parrish. He can tell whether it is whiskey or not.\u201d Parrish didn\u2019t taste the .liquor, but rubbed some of it between his hands and stated that the \u201cstuff\u201d appeared to him to be a \u201cpoor grade of com liquor that is the first run of the still, and did not appear to be fit to drink.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b614-5\">The accused testified that he \u201calways endeavored in such cases to determine whether the liquor in question is ardent spirits before sending the case on to the grand jury, in order to avoid sending on a frivolous case and in order to do the prisoner justice.\u201d That \u201che, therefore, in the case of James Robinson, being uncertain of the character of the liquid, asked two or three persons to taste it and tell him what it was. That opinions varied, but witness (the accused) finally concluded that the liquid was ardent spirits, and sent the case on for trial. That witness (the accused) did not dispense ardent spirits within the meaning of the prohibition law, but was conscientiously trying to ascertain what his duty was in regard to sending the case on for trial.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b615-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>The former Commonwealth\u2019s attorney of the county, a witness for the accused, testified that he had practiced law in the county for over twenty-five years, and that, \u201cin all his experience he had never seen a more faithful or efficient officer than the defendant. * * * (That) when witness was Commonwealth\u2019s attorney he always had the full cooperation of the defendant in the enforcement of the penal laws of the Commonwealth. (That) the defendant conscientiously enforces the prohibition as well as all other penal laws in cases brought before him.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b615-5\">The present Commonwealth\u2019s attorney (who did not prosecute the instant case, however, because of the accused being a relative of his, a special prosecuting attorney having for that reason been appointed by the court, who prosecuted the case in the court below), was also a witness for the accused, and testified that \u201cno more faithful or conscientious justice could be found\u201d than the accused; \u201cthat the defendant always co-operates with the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney in the enforcement of all penal laws of the Commonwealth, prohibition laws as well as other laws.\u201d That, \u201cas a matter of fact, defendant was considering the case of James Robinson when the alleged violation of law by the defendant occurred, and after ascertaining to his satisfaction that the liquid found at Robinson\u2019s home was ardent spirits, sent the case on to the grand jury and the case is now pending in the Circuit Court of Brunswick county.\u201d That \u201cwitness has always observed that where the evidence warranted doing so, the defendant sends on to the grand jury cases involving violation of the prohibition laws.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AIeH\">Another witness for the accused testified that he had practiced at the bar of the county for a great many years, and that \u201cthe defendant is a faithful and conscientious officer and enforces the prohibition, as well as all other penal, laws of the Commonwealth.\u201d That \u201cthe defendant is a good officer.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b616-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>Another witness for the accused\u2014the chairman of the board of supervisors for the county and a member of the State Highway Commission\u2014testified to the same effect.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b616-5\">\u25a0 Witnesses for the accused also testified to the effect that there was no disorder in the room on the occasion above referred to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b616-6\">The trial court, over the objections of the accused, gave the following instructions in writing:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b616-7\">\u201c1.

The court instructs the jury that if they believe from the evidence that the sole object and purpose of the defendant in asking a person or persons in his office to taste, or drink of, the liquid found in the possession of James Robinson was to enable the defendant, as justice of the peace, to ascertain whether the said liquid was ardent spirits and thus enable him to arrive at a correct conclusion on the question whether the case of the said James Robinson should be sent on to the grand jury, they must find the defendant not guilty. But in ascertaining the object and purpose of the defendant in asking and permitting persons to taste or drink of the liquid in question, they shall consider all the facts and circumstances shown in evidence, including the number of persons who drank and the quantity of liquid permitted to be drunk by them.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b617-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>And the following oral instruction was given to the jury by the court, of its own motion, to which the accused objected:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b617-5\">\u201cThis appears to be a case of unintentional or inadvertent violation of the prohibition law; and if you find the defendant guilty, you must not impose a jail sentence, but only a fine, of not less than $50.00 nor more than $500.00.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b617-6\">The jury found the following verdict: \u201cWe, the jury, find the defendant guilty and fix his punishment at a fine of $50.00.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b617-8\">The accused, by counsel, moved the court to set aside the verdict as contrary to the law and the evidence.

Was instruction No. 3 erroneous?</p>\n<p id=\"b617-14\">We are of opinion that this instruction correctly stated the law as applicable to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-15\">As said in 23 Cyc. 574-5: \u201cIt is well settled that a judicial officer, when required to exercise his judgment or discretion, is not liable criminally for any error which he commits, provided he acts in good faith. But any judicial of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>ficer who acts corruptly is responsible criminally, whether he acts under the law or without the law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">As said in Bishop\u2019s New Cr. Law (8th ed.), sec. 460: \u201cOne serving in a judicial or other capacity in which he is required to exercise a judgment of his own, is not punishable for a mere error therein or a mistake of the law. His act, to be cognizable criminally, or even civilly, must be willful and corrupt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">In the opinion of the court, delivered by Judge Brockenbrough in <em>Jacob\u2019s Case </em>(which was a prosecution of justices of the peace), 2 Leigh (29 Va.), at p. 715, this is said: \u201cIt is a well-settled principle that a judicial officer cannot be prosecuted criminally for any judgment rendered by him, however illegal, unless rendered from some motive of malice, partiality or corruption. Much less can such a prosecution be carried on, where the act done is within the plane of his lawful authority, without such corrupt motive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">We do not mean to approve of the method resorted to by the justice in the case before us of having persons drink the liquor in order to testify as to its character. Such a proceeding is too liable to abuse. The statute law prescribes a different method for the ascertainment of such fact where it is necessary. Section 4621 of the Code provides the method of obtaining an analysis of the liquor, and that method should be resorted to where all other available existing evidence leaves the character of the liquor in question in reasonable doubt. Nevertheless, if the accused acted in the premises in the discharge of his duty as a justice of the peace, and in entire good faith, however mistakenly, he was not liable criminally, and the instruction under consideration correctly submitted the ascertainment of those facts to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> 2. Were instructions Nos. 1 and 2 erroneous?</p>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">This question must be answered in the affirmative. These instructions are both instructions to find the accused guilty, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>and are both predicated upon but a partial view of the evidence. They both ignore the uncontroverted testimony of and for the accused to the effect that he acted in his official capacity and entirely in good faith, with the sole purpose of discharging what he conceived to be his duty as a justice of the peace. Upon well-settled principles, both instructions were erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> 3. Was the concluding oral instruction given to the jury by the court erroneous?</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">This question also must be answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">While doubtless intended to apply only in the event that the jury should find the accused guilty of violation of the prohibition law, and in that case would have been a perfectly proper instruction under the statute, it does not clearly say so. As given, it sets out, by expressing the opinion of the trial judge that it appeared to be a case of violation of the prohibition law, albeit one of an unintentional violation of such law. This was such an invasion of the province of the jury as to constitute in itself reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">The case must, therefore, be reversed, and a new trial awarded, to be had, if the case is further prosecuted, in conformity with the views above expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
