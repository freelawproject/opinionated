But C was one to whom the physical fact of footprints pointed, not merely as an accomplice in the crime, but as the murderer, and his narrative was inherently improbable and. incredible, and moreover was made after repeated previous denials of all knowledge of the subject, and altogether the circumstances attending the testimony of C indicated that the jury would not have given it credence unless they had been satisfied that he was corroborated. The Commonwealth\u2019s attorney in argument stated that accused killed deceased at a certain place near the house of C, went back to the house, changed his shoes for a pair of C\u2019s, and then carried the body to where it was found. There Was no evidence of any probative value to sustain this theory, which was corroborative of C\u2019s testimony, and the action of the trial court in overruling an objection to the statement and refusing to instruct the jury to disregard it was error.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b654-11\">Error to a judgment of the Circuit Court of Halifax county.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"b654-12\">\n<em>Reversed and new trial granted.</em>\n</disposition>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b654-13\">The verdict in this case found the accused guilty of mur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>der in the second degree and fixed his punishment at ten years in the penitentiary.

There were two wounds, both of which, according to the testimony for the Commonwealth, were mortal wounds, if inflicted while Rickman was living \u2014one consisting of a fracture of the skull about one and a quarter inches in length on the right side of the head above the ear, and the other consisting of the fracture of the spine on a level with the hip bones, the skin being scraped off at this place in the center of the back, making an abrasion underneath the clothing of the size of a half dollar. In addition to these wounds, there was laceration about the lips, the right corner of the mouth was cut; there were marks of the teeth on the inner surfaces of the lower and top lips, one tooth broken, one missing; there was laceration back of the right ear, 'about half an inch in length; and there were a number of bruises on the forehead about an inch long, some distance apart, running up and down the forehead. The testimony of the physician, who examined the body as a member of the coroner\u2019s jury on the next day after the murder, concerning the appearance of the wounds, is to the effect, that of those on the head and face, \u201csome looked like they were caused by a blunt instrument and some with an instrument that had a sharp point to it\u201d; that the wounds on the face and head could have been caused by a pistol such as the pistol in evidence belonging to the accused; that the bruises on the forehead might have been made by the butt end of that pistol, and the fracture above the ear could have been made by the hammer of the pistol; and that the wound in the back, causing the fracture of the spine, could have been caused by a blunt instrument, such as the club in evidence, which was found at the place <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>at which, according to the theory of the Commonwealth, the murder was committed. This witness testified further, however, that he could not say that the wounds on the face and head were made by the pistol; that there was nothing about these wounds that indicated to the mind of the witness that they were made by the pistol; that they could have been made by some other instrument; and that he could not say that the lick which fractured the spine was hit by the club in evidence. And the evidence fails to disclose that there was any bloodstain on the pistol or club, or other, evidence that either of them' was an instrument used by the murderer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b656-4\">The body of the deceased was found lying in the public road \u201cfight across one of the tracks made by vehicles.\u201d The witness for the Commonwealth, who testified to first seeing the body, was in an automobile with some young ladies, returning from a dance.

That he did not recognize it at the time as the body of any person, and did not stop, but saw something in the road which afterwards proved to be the body of the deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b657-24\">Another witness for the Commonwealth, on cross-examination, but without objection on the part of the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney, testified that he had a conversation with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>one John Medley the next morning after the murder, and that Medley said that he thought he, Medley, ran over the body of the deceased the night before, and thought at the time that he, Medley, had killed the deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b658-4\">It appears from Medley\u2019s testimony, who was a witness for the accused, that Medley was traveling in an automobile truck that night, and left the home of Jim Coleman, presently to be mentioned, which was about a mile from the place in the road where the body was found, not earlier than 12:15 o\u2019clock, so that if his automobile struck the body of the deceased as it lay in the road, this must have been some time not earlier than about 12:30 o\u2019clock of such night. Medley, however, was not asked any question about running over the body of the deceased, and did not testify on that subject.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b658-5\">The coroner\u2019s inquest was held the morning following the murder, which was Sunday, at the place in the road where the body was found, the inquest beginning about ten o\u2019clock that morning. Before the coroner\u2019s jury met, however, the news of the murder and of the finding of the body had. gone abroad in the neighborhood, and a, considerable crowd gathered about the place where the body lay in the road and around about the body. There is no direct evidence on the subject of whether the body was or was not moved by any one during the morning before the coroner\u2019s jury convened.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b658-6\">When the coroner\u2019s jury met, the body was lying in the road, as aforesaid, on the back, the right arm being flexed and partially across the chest. A tooth and an empty pistol cartridge were found near the body. A bottle of extract of pineapple was lying on the chest of the body, and a pint bottle of whiskey, about two-thirds full, was setting up under the right arm of the body. There was no blood in the road near the body, except that when the coroner\u2019s jury raised the head in- their examination of the body, some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>bloody serum ran out of the nostril on the same side on which the skull was fractured. And the testimony for the Commonwealth was to the effect that one of the wounds was near an artery, which ordinarily would have bled considerably, and that if the deceased had been killed where the body was found in the road there would have been evidence of blood in the road from the wounds on the head.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b659-4\">The dwelling house of Jim Coleman, a colored man, is located on the south side of the public road above mentioned, about seventy-five yards off from the public road. This dwelling house is about one mile east of the place where the body wa,s found.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b659-5\">On the Saturday night of the murder there was a dance, and what the colored people call \u201ca party,\u201d at the house of Jim Coleman, and a large gathering of colored people were there, of men and women, beginning about 8:30 or nine o.\u2019clock that evening and breaking up about one o\u2019clock that night. There was the selling of food and drink, and, according to the testimony for the Commonwealth, the accused, who occupied a room in Coleman\u2019s house, as a lodger, was selling intoxicating liquor that night, sometimes in one of the rooms of the house, and at other times in the yard at the rear of the house. Jim Coleman, assisted by others, was selling food from time to time. The house could not hold the crowd, and many were on the outside of the house, here and there in the rear, on the sides and in front of the house, while the party was going on.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b659-6\">The testimony for the Commonwealth is to the effect that about 10:15 o\u2019clock on the night mentioned, the accused was seen in the public road in front of Coleman\u2019s house; and that later, about eleven o\u2019clock, the. deceased (the only white person who- appears to have been at the house of Coleman that night), was seen to come, in a somewhat drunken condition, from one side of Coleman\u2019s house, as if coming from the rear of the house, and, as he walked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>out towards the front of the house, the accused engaged in conversation with the colored men, Davis and Wood, who were afterwards among the witnesses for the Commonwealth, during which conversation the deceased said: \u201cSome one has been meddling with me\u201d (according to Wood\u2019s testimony) ; \u201cSome - of a - is picking at me\u201d (according to Davis\u2019 testimony). Neither Wood nor Davis asked, nor did the deceased say, who was \u201cpicking at\u201d him or \u201cmeddling with\u201d him. Davis assured the deceased that nobody should bother him while he was with him (Davis). The deceased asked Davis if the latter had any whiskey. Davis said, \u201cNo.\u201d The deceased then said: \u201cI have some here, and I want to get some to gO' with it to make it better.\u201d Davis said that he didn\u2019t have a drop. The deceased then said that \u201cthe whiskey he had was not any good,\u201d but that if Davis would go with him out to the public road he would give Davis a drink, and also extended the same invitation to Wood. On getting out to the public road, just in front of Coleman\u2019s house, the deceased, Davis and Wood were seen by Harry Crute, a white man, who was passing along the public road at the time in his automobile, going homeward, which was eastward along such road. Crute stopped his car and talked a few minutes with the deceased, Davis and Wood. Thereupon, two other persons coming up, the deceased, Davis and Wood, asked Crute\u2019s permission to ride down the public road with Crute, and did so, to a point in front of Bethel Church, a distance of some fifty yards east of the entrance to Coleman\u2019s house. There the deceased, Davis and Wood got out of Crute\u2019s automobile and Crute went on homeward. This occurred, as Crute, a.-witness for the accused, testified, at \u201ca few minutes past half-past eleven\u201d o\u2019clock. Crute fixes this time by saying that when he drove up in front of Coleman\u2019s house and stopped, as above stated, he looked a,t his watch and that it was then 11:30 o\u2019clock; and that it was a few <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>minutes thereafter that he left the deceased, Davis and Wood in front of the church.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b661-4\">Davis and Wood, witnesses for the Commonwealth, as aforesaid, testified that on getting out of Crute\u2019s automobile in front of the church, the deceased gave them each a drink of whiskey. Davis says the deceased gave them their drinks out of a quart bottle, which was about half full of liquor at the time. These witnesses further testified that they and the deceased then walked back along the public road to the entrance to Coleman\u2019s house, and that at that place they parted with the deceased, the latter going on westward along the public road in the direction of his home and of the place where his dead body was seen in the road within a short time afterwards, and Wood and Davis returning to Coleman\u2019s house, from which they not long afterwards departed for their own homes. These witnesses also testified that when they parted with the deceased, as last stated, they saw no one else in sight; met no one, saw no one, and heard no one else, and \u201cheard no difficulty\u201d occur as they went on to Coleman\u2019s house. Their testimony as to the time of night when this parting with the deceased occurred is in accord with Crute\u2019s testimony, and fixes such parting at about 11:45 o\u2019clock.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b661-5\">The testimony for the Commonwealth developed the following, among other, facts:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b661-6\">When the body of the deceased and its surroundings were being examined at the inquest, a track on the ground, made by the toe of a shoe with nails in it, was noticed just under one of the arms of the dead man. Outside of the trampling in the road of those who had stood or walked around the body, tracks were found and followed which were the same as the track last mentioned. These tracks led from the body to Jim Coleman\u2019s house. He was found with shoes on his feet which made the tracks which led from the body to his house. He was asked if he had been to the place <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>where the body was, and he denied that he had been there and denied all knowledge of the cause of the death of the deceased and of who killed him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b662-4\">\u2022 Coleman was, thereupon, arrested and lodged in jail that same day\u2014Sunday, March 20, 1921\u2014charged with the murder. That night an armed mob attacked the jail, and, not succeeding in breaking in, called to Coleman and demanded that he tell them who murdered Rickman. Coleman told them that he did not know who committed the crime. The mob then fired a number of shots at or near Coleman, then paused and said to Coleman that they didn\u2019t believe that he killed Rickman, but that they did believe that he knew who did, and that if he didn\u2019t tell them who it was they would kill him. Thereupon, Coleman again declared that he did not know who killed Rickman, and did this repeatedly. The mob then left the jail and, going to Coleman\u2019s dwelling house, burned it to the ground and all of his property there.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b662-5\">Coleman was then\u2014on the next night, being Monday night\u2014removed to the jail at Lynchburg for safe-keeping, and was kept confined ther\u00e9 for some time. Subsequently, he was brought back to, and kept confined in, the local jail, where he was still so confined and still charged with the murder at the time he testified on the trial of the accused. Meanwhile, a number of other colored men who were at the party at Jim Coleman\u2019s or were seen out in the public road on the night of the murder (including the accused, Wood and Davis, above mentioned, and others) were under arrest and confined in jail, charged with the murder; and the county had a detective employed, who, as well as the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney and the sheriff, and a Mr. Bailey, in-whom Coleman seems to have had especial confidence, had interviews from time to time with Coleman, and also with others under arrest and not under arrest, some of whom were afterwards used as witnesses for the Commonwealth, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>quizzing them on the subject of who committed the murder. The evidence makes it plain that during this time those who were quizzing Coleman repeatedly impressed upon him the predicament in which he stood and would stand when he came to be tried upon the charge against him of having committed the crime of the murder unless he should, prior to his trial, name some one, other than himself, who wore his shoes which made the tracks aforesaid the night of the murder, and unless he should furnish some proof pointing to some one else as the person who committed the crime. Nevertheless, Coleman repeatedly denied to those who quizzed him all knowledge on the subject of who killed the deceased until he (Coleman) was brought back from Lynchburg to the local jail and was being again confined there and the time was approaching when he would be tried for the crime. Coleman then, on April 20, first, either to the Mr. Bailey above referred to, or to the detective (the record leaving it in some doubt to which, in the first instance), and afterwards in the presence of the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney and others, and subsequently upon the witness stand as a witness for the Commonwealth on the trial of the accused, made the statement which charged the accused with the crime, the material portions of which statement are as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b663-4\">Coleman said that the shoes which made the tracks aforesaid were his every-day shoes. That on the night of his dance or party, he took them off and left them in the shed room of his house, which was one of the rooms on the first floor of the house. That he wore that night, while the party was going on, another and lighter pair of shoes. That he went into the shed room between ten and twelve o\u2019clock that night, and the lamp was burning and the shoes of the accused, George Dickerson, \u201cwere setting with the toes that way\u201d (indicating), and that he, Coleman, looked and said: \u201cUhm! good Lord.\u201d That the accused\u2019s shoes were stand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>ing there and Coleman\u2019s shoes were gone. That the next time he, Coleman, saw the accused, the latter came to the front door and said: \u201cUhm! you all here dancing,\u201d and Coleman said, \u201cYes.\u201d That thereupon the accused danced \u201cfrom the door clean into the kitchen and asked Miss Chappel to have a treat\u201d and also offered Coleman a treat. That \u201ca good while after that,\u201d he, Coleman, heard the accused \u201ctalking between the stable and the house.\u201d That he, Coleman, was then standing in his kitchen door and saw the accused and two other persons, whom he did not know, standing with their backs to him, Coleman. That he, Coleman, recognized the accused by his voice. That the accused said: \u201cSomebody is dead.\u201d That he, Coleman, said: \u201cWhat do you say, George; who is that dead?\u201d That the accused said \u201cnothing\u201d and the three walked away. The statement of Coleman, as given on the trial of the accused, thereupon continued as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b664-4\">\u201cQ.

But it was the testimony of one to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>whom the physical facts of the tracks of the shoes (owned by and found on his feet when he was arrested) pointed, not merely as an accomplice in the crime, but as the murderer. The narrative of the alleged confession of the accused which such testimony presented to the jury is so inherently improbable and well-nigh incredible in itself, and contains, in its repeated references to the dead body being \u201cup the road,\u201d such evidence of knowledge on the part of Coleman of the location of the body, which nothing the accused had then said gave him information about (furnishing, indeed, internal evidence, either of the guilt of Coleman of the crime, or of other knowledge about it on his part than that derived, as he claimed, from the accused), as to make such narrative doubly unreliable. Moreover, the circumstances of the repeated previous denials by Coleman of all knowledge on the subject (some of such denials made when being shot at by the mob, under threat of instant death if he did not disclose what he knew) make it almost unbelievable that his narrative aforesaid could be true and that he could have refrained from divulging some portion of it before he did. And further, there are the circumstances that, preceding the telling, Coleman took time to frame the story he told; that he was meanwhile having repeatedly impressed upon him, by the detective and others, the predicament he was in unless he could lay the crime upon some one else. These considerations convince us that the jury would not have given credence to the testimony of Coleman had they not been satisfied that he was corroborated by other evidence in the case connecting the accused with the commission of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\">There was absolutely no evidence before the jury to corroborate the testimony of Coleman, connecting the deceased with the commission of the crime, except the testimony of Daniel Harris, and the testimony with reference to the location of the place at which the deceased was killed.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>As to Daniel Harris\u2019 testimony, it merely corroborated Coleman in his testimony, that while in the Lynchburg jail he asked the accused why the latter wore his (Coleman\u2019s) shoes, and that the accused made no reply except to tell Coleman to shut his mouth. Harris\u2019 previous statement to the contrary, and his intimacy with Coleman, and his being himself one of those who had been arrested and charged with the same crime, were circumstances which indicate that the jury would not have given credence to Coleman\u2019s testimony upon the mere corroboration afforded, by this testimony of Harris.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">(c) We come, then, to the consideration of the testimony with reference to the location of the place at which the deceased was killed.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">If the fact was that the deceased was killed at the place within fifty yards of the house of Coleman (the evidence showing that the accused was in and about such house on the night of the murder and about the time the murder was committed), the accused, according to the evidence for the Commonwealth, may have been absent from the house, at some time, long enough to have done the killing, and possibly, at another time, long enough to have gone, wearing the shoes of Coleman, and carried the body from such place to the location in the road where the body was found; although the testimony for the Commonwealth failed to show affirmatively that the accused was at any time absent from Coleman\u2019s house long enough to have so carried the body. That is to say, in such case the evidence would have shown that the accused may have had the opportunity to commit the crime and take the body to the place at which it was found in the road. Whereas, if the fact was that there was no proof of where the killing took place (the evidence showing that the deceased was not killed at the place at which his body was found), there was an absence of evidence to show that the accused had the opportunity to com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>mit the crime and dispose of the body as aforesaid. In such situation, the fact that the deceased was killed at the place in close proximity to Coleman\u2019s house was an essential link in the chain of the circumstantial evidence relied on by the Commonwealth to connect the accused with the commission of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">Accordingly, as appears from one of the bills of exception in the case, the attorney for the Commonwealth, in his closing argument before the jury, made the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-5\">\u201c* * * The facts are that George Dickerson was behind that house selling whiskey. Rickman went back there and bought whiskey from him and accused him of watering it, and they had a row about it. After Rickman left George Dickerson, he went back there and the difficulty was renewed. Of course we do not contend George Dickerson changed his shoes then; he didn\u2019t have time, he chased him across that field, killed him, laid him over the fence and then came back to the house and put on Coleman\u2019s shoes and then carried the body to where it was found in the road.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">To such statement of the attorney for the Commonwealth, the accused, by counsel, objected on the ground that it was not supported by the evidence and that there was no evidence in the case on which to base the statement; that it was an appeal to the prejudice and passion of the jury, and moved the court to tell the jury not to consider this statement; but the court overruled the defendant\u2019s objection to said argument and declined to instruct the jury to disregard the same. This action of the court is made the basis of one of the assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">We are of opinion that this assignment of error is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">There was before the jury absolutely no evidence of any probative value, even if it had been a civil case, that any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>human being was killed at the place referred to in the statement of the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">There was no evidence whatever of tracks made by the shoes of Coleman, making the nail prints, or of any other tracks, going from the alleged place of the killing to the place where the body was found in the road. There was no evidence explaining why such vestiges were not apparent on the ground, if they were looked for and were not found. And we find no evidence in the record of the existence of any fence, such as is referred to in the statement of the attorney for the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">There was no evidence that the blood seen at this place was human blood; or that the tracks from the house across the open field made by some person wearing No. 5 shoes were made by the deceased, rather than by some other person wearing that size shoes. No peculiarity whatever about such tracks was shown in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">Preceding the party, doubtless many fowls and likely some animals were killed to provide food which was sold, at the party. Tim whole of the testimony for the Commonwealth on the subject under consideration is entirely consistent. with the theory that the tracks of the' three or four persons seen across the open ground near the house (not merely of two persons, of the deceased and accused, according to the statement of the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney) were the tracks of some persons chasing a fowl or a pig; that the' blood on the ground was the blood of a fowl, or of an animal, caught and killed there; and that the disturbance of the ground at that place was caused by a no more serious tragedy. And as to the club:' There were doubtless many such lying about that and other bodies of woods in the vicinity. There was no evidence that this club had struck across the body of any person or had been handled by human hands, recently before it was found. Indeed, the evidence fails to show beyond a reasonable doubt that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>wound in the back of the deceased was made with any club whatever. This wound may have been made, consistently with all of the evidence, by some other instrument, possibly by some automobile running over the dead body in the road. This hypothesis is consistent with the evidence as it appears in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\">And the circumstances of the public disappointment which would naturally ensue if all of the many persons suspected of and charged with the crime should escape conviction rendered it peculiarly a case in which the jury were liable to be misled into drawing inferences and reaching conclusions touching the guilt of the accused not warranted by a calm and dispassionate consideration of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">It seems plain, therefore, that the action of the trial court in overruling the objection to the statement of the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney and refusing to instruct the jury to disregard such statement, misled the jury into erroneously thinking that there was sufficient evidence before them to sustain the theory of the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney that the killing took place in close proximity to the house in which the. accused was, as aforesaid; and that the testimony of Coleman was thus corroborated. And we are convinced by the considerations aforesaid that, but for being so misled, the jury would not have convicted the accused upon the other evidence in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">Because of such action of the trial court, the case must be reversed and a new trial will be granted to the accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">Burks, J., concurs in results.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\"><em>Reversed and new trial </em>granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
