Clearly, therefore, the writing was properly admissible in evidence as a part \u2019 of the <em>res gestae. </em>Its effect as evidence, however, was dependent upon the question \"of fact whether the writing proved to be what the evidence for the defendant tended to show the defendant considered it to be at the time it received the money of the plaintiff.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b268-11\">3. <em>Instructions\u2014Peremptory Instructions\u2014Directing Verdict\u2014Application of Section 6003 of the Code of 1919, Where the Verdict Depends Upon a Question of </em>Law.\u2014Section 6003 of the Code of 1919, forbidding peremptory instructions, is not to be construed as applying to eases in which the verdict of the jury depends necessarily and exclusively upon a question of law, such as the legal effect of a deed or contract.

Such of those facts ias are material may be stated as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b270-8\">On. August 1, 1919, the plaintiff, being at the time at Tutwiler, Miss., saw in a recent issue of a newspaper published in the city of Norfolk, Va., the following advertisement of property for sale:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b270-9\">\u201cFairfax avenue: Garage and lot\u2014lot 25x125 feet; brick garage, tile roof, six garages renting for $42 month, and about fifteen or twenty more can be built; rental of these will, be guaranteed.

But the fact was that on seeing this advertisement the plaintiff cut it out of the newspaper and, on August 1, 1919, from said place in Mississippi, wrote the following letter to the defendant, inclosing therein the said newspaper clipping:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b270-11\">\u201cGardner Invest.

The telegram was the only communication of the plaintiff to Wagner on the subject so far as appeared from the evidence. The plaintiff did not send Wagner 'any copy of the advertisement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-4\">On receipt of the telegram, Wagner went to see the defendant, not as acting for himself, but as the agent of the plaintiff; and the uncontroverted testimony is express that the defendant then, and in all the transactions with Wagner subsequently, \u201cknew\u201d that Wagner \u201cwas dealing\u201d for the plaintiff, and not for himself. But the defendant required Wagner to sign an agreement in writing in which Wagner was named as the purchaser, without mention of the fact that he was such a,s the agent of the plaintiff, and to deposit $500.00, both of which Wagner did; the uncontroverted testimony, however, being that the defendant knew at the time that the $500.00 deposited consisted of money belonging to the plaintiff \u201cand were deposited according to instructions\u201d (Wagner) \u201creceived from\u201d (the plaintiff); and that Wagner was acting in signing the agreement as agent for the plaintiff, and not for himself; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>so that the agreement wias made by Wagner for the sole benefit of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-4\">The agreement referred to, so far as material, was in the following form:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-5\">\u201cThis agreement of sale made in triplicate, this 11th day of August, 1919, between Gardner Investment Corporation, agents for E.

He engaged a certain title company to examine the title and represent him in closing the purchase of the property. On or about September 10, 1919, the attorney for Odend\u2019hall, the owner of the property, had prepared a deed conveying the property to the plaintiff, not to Wagner, and had the deed with him duly executed and acknowledged, ready for delivery, and met the plaintiff at the office of the title company with a view to closing the contract. Meanwhile, the deed of trust and notes provided for by the agreement in writing aforesaid had been drawn by the title- company, at the direction of the plaintiff, but in accordance with the \u201cdictation\u201d of the attorney for Odend\u2019hall, the owner, as that attorney himself testified. This attorney further testified on the subject of what occurred on this occasion, as follows: \u201cWe were about to go to the stage of carrying out the contract of prorating the taxes and the rents, and so on, when Dr. Harrison\u201d (the plaintiff) \u201craised the objection then that the contract, as he understood it, provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>that the garages were rented, and that the rents for the garages were guaranteed for a year.\u201d (It may be here noted that the agreement in writing aforesaid contained no provision as to the property being rented, or as to guaranteeing the rents, those references appearing in the advertisement only; so that the plaintiff could not have been here referring to said agreement in writing as \u201cthe contract,\u201d if he knew its contents.) The witness proceeded further with his testimony, as follows: \u201cWhen he told me that, Mr. Odend\u2019hall not being with me, I told them they would have to postpone the settlement, as I was not authorized by Mr. Odend\u2019hall to carry out any such contract as that. Several (* * *) after that, Mr. Odend\u2019hall came to my office and directed me to carry out the terms of the contract with this modification, that he was to allow Dr. Harrison one year\u2019s rent on those garages, I think, a,t $7.00 per month, and credit that as accrued interest on the back of the note. After receiving those directions, I went back to the title company, at the hour designated, and waited for about three-quarters of an hour, and Dr. Harrison did not put in an appearance.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-6\">On the subject of what occurred after he got to Norfolk, ' and at his meeting with the attorney for the owner, above referred to, when they failed to close the contract of purchase, the plaintiff testified as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-7\">\u201cIn the first place, I understood I was to pay $1,500.00 more, but they wanted $2,400.00 more, I think it was. I passed that and was about\u2014I did draw a check for $2,400, and then I found that the garages were not rented, that there were only three of them rented, and I tore the check up. That is my recollection.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-8\">\u201cQ. Did they show you a copy of any contract that had been made in relation to this property?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-9\">\u201cA. Showed me a contract which says that the money <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>shall be returned to me if not satisfactory. I think that is written in the contract.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-4\">Wagner testified on the same subjects as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-5\">\u201cQ. Please tell the court and jury what occurred as soon as he (the plaintiff) came here and found the condition of the property?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-6\">\u201cA. We first went to the office of the Gardner Investment Corporation to take up the matter of transferring the title. There was some difficulty in finding out whether or not the garages were rented. It was finally decided that that matter would be settled later, and we adjourned to meet later in the office of the Guaranty Title and Trust Company in order to transfer the title to the property, but upon finding that the garages were not all rented the deal was postponed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-7\">\u201cQ. Was the deal consummated?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-8\">\u2022\u201cA. No, sir.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-9\">\u201cQ. Why was it not consummated?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-10\"><em>\u201cA. </em>It was not consummated because the property was not as represented, and we didn\u2019t want it.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-11\">It was also shown in evidence as an uncontroverted fact that the defendant had the $500.00 in its hands at the time of suit, but had been instructed by Odend\u2019hall not to turn it over to the plaintiff, and that at the time of the trial the defendant still had the money in its hands.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-12\">There are only three questions on which any conflict is perceived in the evidence. Those .questions are: (1) Whether Wagner, by reason of the general terms of the telegram to him, was given such large discretion that he was authorized by the plaintiff to enter into the contract as expressed in the written agreement aforesaid, as agent for the plaintiff, so as to constitute that agreement the contract binding on the plaintiff? (2) Whether the conduct of the plaintiff, after he arrived in Norfolk and knew of the agreement in writing, was such that he ratified that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>agreement? and (3) whether, if such agreement was binding on the plaintiff as his contract, there was a breach of that contract on the part of the plaintiff?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-4\">There may be further questions in the case whether the refunding of the money paid, mentioned in the contract, means what is there said, and if so whether the option there mentioned goes to the refunding or merely to the effect thereof; or whether there was a meeting of the minds of the parties on the meaning of \u201cretained\u201d instead of \u201crefunded,\u201d the word used in the writing, there being in such eases a mere clerical error and mutual mistake in using the word \u201crefunding\u201d instead of \u201cretained.\u201d These may be questions of law, or mixed questions of law and fact, if fully developed by the evidence. They are not fully developed by the evidence in the record, and need not be further specifically mentioned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-5\">Of the evidence bearing on the three questions of fact above stated, it is sufficient to say that the conflict is more in the inferences which may be contended should be drawn from the evidence than' in the evidence itself; and what inferences should be drawn from the evidence, whether in favor of the plaintiff or defendant, upon these questions, are, under the circumstances, disclosed, controverted matters of fact, about which reasonable minds may reasonably differ in conclusions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-6\">The action of the trial court on the subject of the instructions appears from the record to have been as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-7\">\u201cThe following instruction granted at the request of the defendant is the only instruction granted. It was granted over the objection of the plaintiff, land the plaintiff excepted:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-8\">\u201c \u2018The court instructs the jury that under the law it is the duty of the court\u2014that is, the judge\u2014to construe the written contract in evidence in this case, so construing said written contract in this case the court instructs you that the defendant is not liable to the plaintiff in this case.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b277-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>\u201cBefore granting this instruction, the court stated to the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, in the presence of the jury, in response to objections to the instruction, which plaintiff\u2019s counsel argued:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b277-4\">\u201cThe Court: \u2018The defendant company is haled into court upon a claim that it has money belonging to plaintiff. Defendant admits having $500.00 paid him on account of property bought by a Mr. Wagner, with whom a sealed contract was entered into with one Odend\u2019hall\u2014neither one of these are parties to the suit. This contract has been admitted as evidence because defendant received the $500.00 in pursuance thereof. If the plaintiff, who is not a party to the contract, is permitted to recover, there is nothing to prevent Wagner, who is not a party to the suit, from proceeding on his contract in a separate action to recover the same $500.00.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b277-5\">\u201c T feel constrained, therefore, to tell the jury that, under this contract and the evidence connected therewith, there cannot be a verdict for the plaintiff.\u2019 \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b277-6\">The following instruction was requested by the plaintiff, but refused by the court:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b277-7\">\u201cThe court instructs the jury, that if they believe from the evidence that the defendants advertised the garages on Fairfax avenue for sale, and that by letter in writing, August 1st, the plaintiff agreed to take the property, and in pursuance thereto instructed a deposit of a sum of money to secure the property until he could come on and close the deal, and that after he came on to close the deal he found that the property was not rented, as stated in the advertisement, and refused to close the deal on the ground of material misrepresentations, that he is entitled to have his deposit returned in this case, and they should find for the plaintiff.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b277-8\"><em>J.

Did the court err in refusing to exclude from the jury the agreement in writing between the defendant, as agent for the owner of the property, and Wagner, as agent for the plaintiff, as the latter undertook to act and as dealt with by the defendant as an actor in the matter, as shown by the uncontroverted evidence, although the last-named agency was not stated in the writing?</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">This question must be answered in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">The defendant, according to the testimony in its behalf, received the $500.00 sued for, certainly partly, in pursuance of the provisions of this writing. The execution of this writing was one of the circumstances which attended the payment of this money into the hands of the defendant. Clearly, therefore, the writing was properly admissible in evidence as a part of the <em>res gestae. </em>Its effect as evidence \u2014how far it would be relied upon by the defendant as authorizing it to hold the $500.00 sued for\u2014was and is another question, dependent upon the question of fact whether the writing proved to be what the evidence for the defendant tended to show the defendant considered it to be at the time it received the money of the plaintiff, namely: a contract binding upon the plaintiff and under the terms of which the defendant had the right to receive and hold possession of the said money of the plaintiff. *</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\"><bracketnum>[3,4]</bracketnum> 2. Did the court err in granting the single instruction which was given the jury at the request of the defendant, which is set forth above?</p>\n<p id=\"b278-10\">This question must be answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-11\">In the argument of the assignment of error involving this instruction, it is urged that it was reversible error in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>the court to give it for the reason that it is a peremptory-instruction, and hence in violation of the statute (section 6003 of the Code) forbidding peremptory- instructions. But, as held in <em>Small </em>v. <em>Va. Ry. &amp; Power Co., </em>125 Va. 416, 99 S. E. 525, that statute is not to be construed as applying to cases in which the verdict of the jury depends necessarily and exclusively upon a question of law, such as the legal effect of a deed or contract. The instruction in question contained merely the construction of the written contract by the trial judge. Therefore, it was not <em>per se </em>in violation of the statute just mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">However, the instruction under consideration, when read in the light of the statement of the trial judge before the jury in explanation thereof, and in the light of the evidence in the case, in effect, told the jury that the writing above mentioned was a contract between Wagner and the owner of the property sold, and could not be considered as a contract between the defendant, as agent of the owner, and Wagner, as agent of the plaintiff, in any aspect of the case. The uncontroverted evidence before the jury was to the effect that if the writing was a binding contract at all, it was a contract between the parties last named, and not a contract between Wagner and the owner. The instruction was, therefore, erroneous, both because it took from the jury their consideration of the evidence on this pure question of fact, and because it embodied a conclusion of fact which was directly contrary to the uncontroverted evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">There is only one hypothesis upon which we could decline to reverse the case because of such erroneous instruction, and that is this: If the evidence was such that, regarding the agreement in writing as having been entered into by the defendant with Wagner, as agent of the plaintiff, the jury would not have been warranted in coming to any other conclusion than that the plaintiff was bound by such writing as his contract, either because (1) he had authorized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>Wagner to make it for him, or (2) he had ratified it after it was made; and further, that the plaintiff had unjustifiably broken the contract, and as a result had forfeited the $500.00. In such case, the instruction might be considered as harmless error. But the evidence before the jury on all three of those questions of fact (not to here mention the difficulties in the way of arriving at the result just referred to upon the meagre facts pertaining thereto appearing in the evidence), was such that they were seriously controverted questions of fact, about which reasonable minds may reasonably differ in conclusions. They are, therefore, peculiarly jury questions, and they should have been left to the decision of the jury, under suitable and proper instructions, if asked for by either of the parties. Hence, the instruction under consideration cannot be considered as harmless error, and the hypothesis mentioned cannot save the case from reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">3. The only remaining question presented by the assignments of error is whether the court erred in refusing to give the instruction set forth above, asked for by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">The instruction contains obvious defects. However\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">As it is not probable that an instruction in this precise form will be asked for by the plaintiff upon a new trial, we deem what we have said above in general terms, in regard to the instructions which should be given upon a new trial, sufficient to dispose of the subject for all practical purposes should the issues and the evidence on a new trial be the same as upon the one already had, and we feel that it is unnecessary for us to say anything further concerning the precise instruction last mentioned, either in approval or disapproval of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">The verdict and judgment under review will be set aside and annulled and a new trial, <em>de novo, </em>will be awarded the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
