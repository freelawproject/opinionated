Defendant company took over the entire business of the Adams Express Company as a going concern and all of the tangible property of the latter theretofore used in the business. The entire existence of the Adams Express Company as a going concern was consolidated or merged in the defendant. The liability of the Adams Express Company to the plaintiff existed at the time of such consolidation or merger, and was actually or constructively known to the defendant to so exist. The property of the Adams Express Company so taken over by defendant company was more than sufficient to pay the liability, and defendant, company did not undertake to pay anything for such property except its own capital stock. After the consolidation the Adams Express Company did own some property located elsewhere than in Virginia, and although it transacted no business other than that of winding up its affairs, it maintained an office in New York city, with its official organization intact.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b169-9\"><em>Held: </em>That defendant company was answerable to the plaintiff for the liability of the Adams Express Company to the plaintiff which existed at the time of the consolidation.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b169-10\">2, <em>Corporations\u2014Consolidation\u2014Inability of Consolidated Company for Debts and Claims Against Original </em>Corporations.\u2014When two or more corporations are consolidated into a new corporation with a now name, and the constituent corporations go out of existence, if no arrangements are made respecting their property and liabilities, the consolidated corporation will be . answerable for their liabilities, at least to the extent of the property acquired from the constituent corporation whose liability is sought to be enforced against the consolidated corporation.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b170-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>3. <em>Corporations-\u2014Creditors\u2014Fraudulent and Voluntary Conveyances \u2014Transfer of Corporate </em>Assets.\u2014Only by a transfer for value can the property of a corporation or other debtor be so transferred as to defeat the claims of creditors.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b170-5\">4. <em>Corporations\u2014Consolidation\u2014Consolidated Company Not a Purchaser for </em>Value.\u2014A new corporation formed by the consolidation or merger of other corporations does not occupy the relation of a purchaser for value of the property of the old companies, where it gives nothing for the property but its own capital stock.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b170-7\">5. <em>Corporations\u2014Consolidation\u2014Consolidated Company a Purchaser for Value\u2014Liability of New Company for Claims Against Old </em>Company.\u2014If the property of a corporation merged in a new corporation is acquired by the new corporation by actual <em>bona fide </em>purchase for value, the new corporation is not liable for claims against the old company which do not constitute liens upon the property purchased.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b170-9\">6. <em>Corporations\u2014Consolidation\u2014Liability of the Consolidated Corporation for the Unsecured Debts of Its Constituent </em>Companies.\u2014 In the absence of statute fixing the liability of the new corporation, the liabilities of a consolidated corporation for the unsecured debts of its constituent companies rests upon the agreement, express or implied, of the consolidated corporation to pay such debts.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b170-11\">7.

On the last-named day the Adams Express Company terminated its said business, not only between said points, but also throughout Virginia and the United States; and the defendant, on and after July 1, 1918, undertook, as a common carrier, to carry on, throughout the United States, the express transportation business theretofore transacted by the Adams Express Company, the American Express Company, the Wells-Fargo Express Company, and the Southern Express Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b172-6\">The defendant, the American Railway Express Company, is a corporation, incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on June 22, 1918, and as such authorized tq engage in and carry on throughout the States, Territories and possessions of the United States and in the District of Columbia and in adjacent foreign countries, the express transportation business, as a common carrier; the authorized capital stock of the defendant being $40,000,000, divided into 400,000 shares of the par value of $100.00 each, the minimum capital stock with which the corporation was authorized to commence business being $33,000,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b172-7\">The undertaking aforesaid, on the part of the defendant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>the American Railway Express Company, on and after July 1, 1918, to carry on throughout the United States the transportation business theretofore transacted by the Adams, the American, the Wells-Fargo and the Southern Express Companies, was entered into in pursuance of -an agreement between the four companies last mentioned and the defendant. That agreement was entered into some time in June, 1918, prior to July 1, 1918. There is no copy of such agreement in the record of the case before us, and what are or are not some of its provisions may be said to be left in some doubt. At any rate, one of the subjects of controversy in the instant case is whether such agreement on the part of the defendant expressly stipulated that it would be liable for and would pay all of the unsecured indebtedness of the Adams Express Company existing on July 1, 1918.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b173-4\">There are other provisions of said agreement and certain facts attending the organization and the beginning of the business of the defendant on July 1, 1918, and the passing into its hands on that day of certain property of the Adams Express Company, about which, however, there is no controversy in the case and which appear from the record before us. These are as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b173-5\">The defendant began its business aforesaid on July 1, 1918. Prior to that date it owned no property whatever. On that date, in pursuance of said agreement between it and the four other express companies aforesaid, the defendant took over from such four other express companies certain property theretofore belonging to such other companies at a valuation of $30,000,0.00, to be paid for by the issuance of capital stock of the defendant of the par value of that amount and delivery of such stock to such four other express companies. The property of the Adams Express Company which was thus acquired by the defendant was the whole of the tangible property then owned and used by the Adams Express Company in its express business <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>aforesaid throughout the United States, including all of such property in Virginia, which was considerable in quantity <em>; </em>and this property was taken over, as aforesaid, at its book value, <em>i. e., </em>its value as carried at the time on the books of the Adams Express Company. What this precise value was, or what was the precise amount of the stock of the defendant which was given therefor to the Adams Express Company, does not appear from the record before us; but it does appear from the record that this value and stock amounted to a great many millions of dollars\u2014far more than sufficient to pay the plaintiff\u2019s claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b174-4\">At the time the property aforesaid of the Adams Express Company was taken over, as aforesaid, on July 1, 1918, and the defendant agreed to issue its stock therefor, as aforesaid, the defendant knew that an indefinite number and amount of unliquidated claims against and unsecured obligations of the Adams Express Company, of the character of the claim of the plaintiff, were in existence, outstanding and unsatisfied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b174-5\">At the time of the trial the defendant, as a matter of fact, had issued and delivered to the Adams Express Company only about seventy-five per cent of the stock which was to be issued to it, as aforesaid, in payment for the property of the Adams Express Company taken over by the defendant, as aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b174-6\">After June 30, 1918, the Adams Express Company had no agent in Virginia on whom process could be served so-as to commence a suit or action in Virginia against it; nor any property in Virginia which could be attached. It appears that on and after July 1, 1918, the Adams Express-Company did own some property, located elsewhere than in Virginia, and other than that which was turned over to the-defendant, as aforesaid; but what was the character or value of such other property, or just where it was or is-located, does not appear. \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b175-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>So far as appears from the record, the Adams Express Company, on and after July 1, 1918, has engaged in no business other than that of winding up its affairs, including the liquidation of its outstanding liabilities and obligations; and for that purpose has had an office in New York city, with its official organization intact, consisting of its president, secretary, treasurer, general counsel and its claim departments.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b175-4\">Other material circumstances are referred to in the opinion of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b175-5\"><em>Stewart K.

Is the defendant answerable to the plaintiff for the liability of the Adams Express Company to the plaintiff which existed at the time the defendant took over the entire business of the Adams Express Company as a going eoncern and all of the tangible property of the latter theretofore used in its business, because of the circumstances that the entire existence of the Adams Express Company as a going concern was consolidated or merged in the defendant; that the liability existed at the time of such consolidation or merger, and was actually or constructively known to the defendant to so exist; that the property so taken over was more than sufficient to pay the liability, and that the defendant did not undertake to pay anything for the property except its own capital stock?</p>\n<p id=\"b175-10\">This question must be answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> As said in 6 Am. &amp; Eng. Enc. Law (2nd ed.) p. 818, see. 4: \u201cWhen two or more corporations are consolidated into a new corporation with a new name, and the constituent corporations go out of existence, if no arrangements are made respecting their property and liabilities, the consolidated corporation will be answerable for their liabilities, at least to*the extent of the property acquired from the constituent corporations- whose liability is sought to be enforced against the consolidated corporation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\"><bracketnum>[3, 4]</bracketnum> As pointed out, however, in the valuable work just quoted, the essential elements of the liability of the new corporation in such case, and the basic reasons therefor, are: First, that only by a transfer for value can the property of a corporation or other debtor be transferred so as to defeat the claims of creditors <em>(Idem., </em>pp. 819, 822); and, secondly, that the new corporation does not occupy the relation of a purchaser for value of the property of the old company, where it gives nothing for the property but its own capital stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\"><bracketnum>[5]</bracketnum> If, indeed, the property of the old company is acquired by the new corporation by actual <em>bona fide </em>purchase for value, it is well settled that the .new corporation is not liable for claims against the old company which do not constitute liens upon the property purchased. <em>Idem., </em>p. 819.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">Concerning a similar situation to that under consideration in the case in judgment, this is said in <em>Young </em>v. <em>The Steamboat Key City, </em>14 Wall. 653, 20 L. Ed. 896: * * \u2022 neither the stockholders of\u201d (the old company) \u201cnor of the new corporation have ever parted with or paid any money or other thing of value for\u201d (the property), \u201cotherwise than by this consolidation of the companies into one; and it is not apparent, nor even a reasonable presumption, that, if the new company has to pay the libellant\u2019s debt in this case, they will be the losers, but it is nearly certain the loss will fall where it should\u2014on the stockholders coming in through the\u201d (old company).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>As said in 5 Thomp. on Corp. (2nd ed.), sec. 6083: \u201c* * * the consolidated corporation, as a rule, even in the absence of statute, or agreement, assumes all the liabilities of the constituent companies, and they may be enforced by a direct action against it as it is presumed to have notice of the rights of creditors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">As said in <em>Jennings, Neff &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Crystal Ice Co., etc., </em>128 Tenn. 236, 159 S. W. 1088, 1089, 47 L. R. A. (N. S.), p. 1061: \u201cThe doctrine that corporate assets are a trust fund, at least to the extent that creditors are entitled in equity to payment of their debts before any distribution of corporate property is made among stockholders, is fully established in Tennessee, and creditors have a right to follow its assets or property into the hands of any one who is not a holder in good faith in the ordinary course of business. <em>Vance </em>v. <em>McNabb, etc., Co., </em>92 Tenn. 47, 20 S. W. 424; Pom. Eq. Jur., par. 1046.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">\u201cThere is abundant authority likewise for the proposition that where one corporation, for its own stock and bonds, purchases all the assets of another, without provision for the debts of the latter, the transaction is out of the ordinary course of business, and the very circumstances of the case imply full knowledge on the part of the purchasing corporation of all facts necessary to charge the property in its hands with the debts of the selling corporation.\u201d (Citing authorities.)</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">Jji Sft ifc</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">\u201cIt follows that when the purchasing corporation took over in exchange for its own stock and bonds the assets of the other, and permitted these securities, which had been substituted for the visible tangible property of the selling corporation, to be distributed among the stockholders of the latter, without provisions for the creditors of the latter, it thereby became a party, with full notice, to the diversion of a trust fund. As such, the purchasing corpora<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>tion holds the property so acquired impressed with the same trust with which the property was originally charged, and the purchasing corporation is liable to the creditors of the selling corporation to the extent of the value of the property thus obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">\u201cCreditors of the old corporation cannot be required to look alone to the stock and bonds which were substituted for the real, tangible assets of that corporation. The value of the securities so substituted is more or less problematical, and creditors should not be forced to surrender their claims against available, visible assets, and transfer such claim to new securities. Their remedy cannot be hindered and impaired for the benefit of stockholders. * *. *</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">\u201cWe are aware that there is some conflict in the cases as to the right of creditors under circumstances such as these, but we think the views we have expressed are sustained by the weight of authority.

E. 327.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\"><bracketnum>[10]</bracketnum> In truth, the quantity of the property transferred, as compared with that retained, is material only to this extent : If there is not sufficient property retained by the constituent company, within the jurisdiction of the courts of the State, to satisfy the obligation of such company to the plaintiff, so that the remedy of the plaintiff is substantially impaired, and the other aforesaid requisite circumstances exist, the liability we have been considering will arise; if, on the other hand, there is sufficient property so retained, as to leave the remedy of the plaintiff substantially unimpaired, even if the aforesaid other circumstances do exist, the liability will not arise.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\"><bracketnum>[11]</bracketnum> Again: It is not essential to the new corporation being considered as a <em>consolidated company, </em>within the meaning of those terms as used in the authorities above cited and quoted from, nor to the liability of the new corporation above referred to, that the constituent companies should cease to exist <em>de jure </em>upon the organization of the new corporation. The going \u201cout of existence\u201d of the constituent companies\u2014to which the quotation above made from 6 Am. <em>&amp; </em>Eng. Enc\u2019l Law, sec. 4, p. 818, and other authorities on the same subject refer\u2014is the cessation of all actual transaction of business as a going concern\u2014the <em>de facto </em>cessation of all business\u2014the abandonment of all life \u00e1nd operation according to the design of the charter of the constituent companies. The continued existence <em>de jure </em>of the constituent companies, for the purpose of winding up their affairs or other purposes, is immaterial. <em>Berthold </em>v. <em>Hollar</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number><em>day-Klotz Land &amp; Lumber Co., </em>91 Mo. App. 233; <em>Montgomery, etc., R. Co. </em>v. <em>Branch Sons &amp; Co., </em>59 Ala, 139, 5 Thomp. on Corp. (2nd ed.), sec. 6041.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">As said by the authority last cited: \u201cThe termination of the existence of the constituent, companies is not necessary to either the accomplishment or validity of the consolidation * *</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">The defendant relies upon <em>McAlister </em>v. <em>American Railway Express Co., </em>179 N. C. 556, 108 S. E. 129, 15 A. L. R. 1090, and it must be said that the holding in that case is directly contrary to our holding above. But such holding is, as we think, also directly contrary to the great weight of authority and to the true principles involved, and for those reasons we cannot follow it.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">The other cases relied on by the defendant are the following: <em>Seaboard Air Line Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Leader, </em>115 Ga. 702, 42 S. E. 38; <em>Whiting </em>v. <em>Malden, etc., R. Co., </em>202 Mass. 298, 88 N. E. 907, 132 Am. St. Rep. <em>493; Austin </em>v. <em>Tecumseh Nat. Bank, </em>49 Neb. 412, 68 N. W. 628, 35 L. R. A. 444, 59 Am. St. Rep. 543; <em>Colorado, etc., R. Co. </em>v. <em>Albrecht, </em>22 Colo. App. 201, 123 Pac. 957; <em>Bruffett </em>v. <em>Great Western R. R. Co., </em>25 Ill. 353; <em>Hallidie Machinery Co. </em>v. <em>Washington Brick, etc., Co., </em>70 Wash. 80, 126 Pac. 96. These cases are not inconsistent with our holding above. They hold merely that, in the absence of statute imposing the liability, for the new corporation to be liable for the unsecured debts of its predecessor, it must appear, either that the new corporation expressly assumed the liabilities of its predecessor or that the circumstances are such that the law charges the new corporation with such liability; that, in the absence of a statutory provision on the subject, the mere fact that the property of a company is acquired by another company or individual does not of itself make the new holder of the property liable for the debts of the seller of it; for, <em>non constat, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>the new holder may have been a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser of the property for value in the ordinary course of business, in which case such holder would not be liable for debts which were not liens on the property. All of this is in entire accord with true principles and with our views upon the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">Much of the argument before us has concerned the question of fact of whether there was an express agreement in the case in judgment on the part of the defendant to pay the unsecured debts and liabilities of the Adams Express Company existing at the time of the consolidation aforesaid; but our view being, as 'aforesaid, that under the circumstances of this case, the law will imply such agreement, it is, of course, unnecessary for us to deal with such question of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\"><bracketnum>[12]</bracketnum> There is but one other question presented by the assignments of error for our decision, and that is this: \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">2. Was there sufficient evidence before the jury to support their finding to the effect that the Adams Express Company, in June, 1918, received, at Kensington, 111., the quantity of the goods in question for transportation to the plaintiff, as alleged?</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">This question must be answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">A witness for the plaintiff, who was the depot agent of the defendant at the place of destination of the goods in Virginia, was permitted by the trial court, over the objection of the defendant, to testify as to what a certain entry in the delivery record book of the Adams Express Company showed was the shortage on a shipment of said goods to the plaintiff from Kensington, 111., on May 18, 1921, which was a different shipment from' that on which the action was based. The defendant contends that such testimony as to such book entry was improperly admitted in evidence for several reasons (which need not be set forth here), and hence that the case should be considered as if such testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>mony were not in the record; and that if such testimony were stricken out of the record there would be no testimony left to support ^the verdict in the particular in question. This position of the defendant overlooks the fact that the. plaintiff himself testified, without objection thereto on the part of the defendant, that prior to the trial he received a receipt from <em>\u201cthe agent at </em>Kensington, 111., * * * showing the shipment\u201d in question, which receipt, other testimony for plaintiff before the jury showed, was turned over to counsel for the defendant prior to the trial. The agent at Kensington, 111., was agent for the defendant at the time he sent the plaintiff the receipt mentioned. There was, therefore, ample evidence before the jury to support the finding in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">The case will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
