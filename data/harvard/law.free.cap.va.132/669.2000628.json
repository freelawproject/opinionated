The defendant introduced evidence tending to contradict all of these incriminating circumstances, but, as the jury heard and saw all of the witnesses and credited the evidence which so clearly indicates the guilt of the accused, their finding is conclusive. The attorney for the accused appears to realize that this result is inevitable, and undertakes to escape it by stating in his petition that the \u201cofficers testified falsely against the petitioner * * * and that they were actuated so to do solely through malice.\u201d It is sufficient to say as to this that there is nothing in the record to justify this imputation against the witnesses for the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
