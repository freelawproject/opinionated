See <em>Pine &amp; Scott </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>121 Va. 812, 93 S. E. 652; <em>Wilkerson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>122 Va. 920, 95 S. E. 388; <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>126 Va. 815, 101 S. E. 896; <em>Hitt </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>131 Va. 752, 109 S. E. 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The second assignment of error is that the court below had \u201cno jurisdiction to try this case because the prohibition law is superseded by United States statute, known as the \u2018Volstead act\u2019 (41 Stat. 305), and passed by the Congress of the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">This subject was fully considered in <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>129 Va. 723, 105 S. E. 589, and the conclusion reached, which is contrary to the position taken in this assignment of error. No reason is stated why we should reach a different conclusion, and we know of none. That conclusion is, therefore, adhered to.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-10\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> The third and only remaining assignment of error is that \u201cthe punishment pronounced is cruel and unusual and is in violation of the Constitution of Virginia.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b605-11\">No reason is presented in support of this assignment of error. There is no merit in this assignment. See <em>Bracy\u2019s Case, </em>119 Va. 867, 89 S. E. 144; <em>Hart\u2019s Case, </em>131 Va. 726, 109 S.
