It is true no question of necessity for accommodation of the public arises upon an application for a distiller\u2019s license, and it is contended that if no facts are set forth in the remonstrance which would justify the court in refusing the application, the license is a matter of right. But although the court\u2019s discretion is not so broad in such an application as in an application for a wholesale or a retail liquor license, and the reasons which may influence the discretion of the court are fewer in the former than in the latter cases, yet the same general principle upon which it is presumed an appeal, in the absence of anything to show the contrary, that the license was refused for a legal reason, and not arbitrarily, applies as well in one case as in the other. Johnson\u2019s License, 156 Pa. 322, as distinguished and explained in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>Gross\u2019s License, 161 Pa. 344, is not authority for holding differently, and in the latter case it was distinctly declared that the presumption in all such cases \u2014 where the license was refused after hearing \u2014 is, that the judge performed his duty according to law: \u201c he is not bound to set out legal reasons for his action ; he is only bound to have them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b691-3\">The order is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
