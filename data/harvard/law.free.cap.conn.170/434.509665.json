The facts as set forth in the finding are undisputed. The plaintiff bid upon and was awarded by the state a contract in excess of six million dollars for the construction and relocation of a highway known as route 8. The contract, in general, called for building bridges, blasting, relocating utilities, excavating and filling and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>plaintiff was. required, among other things, to provide and incorporate into the work various building materials, including sand, stone, loam, gravel and bituminous material. In general, payment was to be for accepted work in place. In addition, the contract contained several special provisions including one entitled \u201cEscalator Clause Pertaining to Changes in Common Carrier Rates,\u201d the interpretation of which constitutes the single issue raised by this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">The special provision in question, which is set forth in full in the footnote,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> provides, where applicable, for an adjustment in payment to the contractor \u201cto compensate for increases or decreases in cost due to changes in common carrier rates becoming effective after the date of opening of bids and before the date stipulated for completion of the work, as adjusted because of authorized extensions of time.\u201d The plaintiff, in addition to its construction activities, was also duly licensed by the public utilities commission as a common carrier and, at some time after the work called for by the contract began, an increase in the local tariffs charged by the plaintiff as a common carrier for hauling bull?; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>materials by damp tracks was anthorized by the commission. The haaling of most of the balk materials for the highway project involved here, inclading sand, stone, gravel, loam and bitaminoas concrete, was performed by tracks owned by the plaintiff, althoagh some also were haaled by tracks owned by Connectieat Sand and Stone Corporation, a closely related corporation which had the same main office and practically the same officers and directors as the plaintiff bat which was not a common carrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Approximately two years after completion of the project, the plaintiff sent a letter to the defendant reqnesting an adjastment ander the so-called escalator claase becaase of an increase in the haaling rates for common carriers effective Jane 7, 1965, which it claimed entitled it to additional sams -with respect to the transportation of balk materials in its own tracks as well as in the tracks of its affiliate corporation, Connectieat Sand and Stone Corporation. Accompanying this reqaest, in addition to correspondence between the two corporations with respect to the rate increase, was a doeament appearing to be an invoice or bill from Connectieat Sand and Stone Corporation to the plaintiff for \u201cadditional charge for haaling materials to the above project . . . dae to increase in tariff rates.\u201d Althoagh that invoice or bill appeared to be marked \u201cpaid,\u201d no money actnally changed hands between the two corporations; rather, mataal book entries were made. The trial coart foand that these mataal book entries were circaitoas and woald cancel each other and that the plaintiff did not actnally incar an increase in cost dae to changes in common carrier rates within the meaning of those words in the escalator claase, and this finding was not dispated.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>Upon the foregoing faets, the trial court concluded that the plaintiff had failed to show that there was an increased cost to it due to changes in common carrier rates; that in hauling materials to the project in its own trucks the plaintiff was performing services for itself and not as a common carrier; that the hauling performed by Connecticut Sand and Stone Corporation does not qualify for additional compensation under the escalator clause because it was not a common carrier and a receipted bill from it, accordingly, was not a bill from a common carrier; that the escalator clause applies only to services performed for the plaintiff by another common carrier; and finally that the plaintiff was not entitled to the additional compensation claimed. The plaintiff\u2019s assignment of errors attacks only the validity of the foregoing conclusions and not that of the facts found, squarely raising as the issue to be determined by us whether the court arrived at a fair and reasonable interpretation of the escalator clause in the contract in concluding that it applied only to hauling services performed for the plaintiff contractor by another common carrier and not to such services performed by the plaintiff for itself nor to hauling services performed for it by another carrier which was not a common carrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">\u201cThe court\u2019s conclusions which have been attacked are to be tested by the finding. . . . These conclusions must stand unless they are legally or logically inconsistent with the facts found or unless they involve the application of some erroneous rule of law material to the case.\u201d <em>Cedo Bros., Inc. </em>v. <em>Feldmann, </em>161 Conn. 265, 271, 287 A.2d 374; <em>Johnston Jewels, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Leonard, </em>156 Conn. 75, 79, 239 A.2d 500; <em>Craig </em>v. <em>Dunleavy, </em>154 Conn. 100, 105, 221 A.2d 855; Maltbie, Conn. App. Proc. \u00a7 166. One <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>of the rules applicable to the determination of a dispute over the meaning of a contract is that pertaining to determination of the intent of the parties. \u201cThe oft-repeated rule is that the intent of the parties is to be ascertained by a fair and reasonable construction of the written words in the light of the circumstances surrounding the execution of the writing and in the light of the object of the parties in executing the contract.\u201d <em>New Haven Sand Blast Co. </em>v. <em>Dreisbach, </em>102 Conn. 169, 180, 128 A. 320. And, as we recently stated in <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Pension &amp; Retirement Board, </em>167 Conn. 352, 354, 355 A.2d 283: \u201cThe intention of the parties to a contract is to be determined from the language used interpreted in the light of the situation of the parties and the circumstances connected with the transaction. The question is not what intention existed in the minds of the parties but what intention is expressed in the language used. . . . The words used by the parties \u2018must be accorded their common meaning and usage where they can be sensibly applied to the subject matter of the contract.\u2019 <em>Beach </em>v. <em>Beach, </em>141 Conn. 583, 589, 107 A.2d 629; <em>Sturtevant </em>v. <em>Sturtevant, . . . </em>[146 Conn. 644, 647, 153 A.2d 828].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">In according \u201cthe words used by the parties\u201d their \u201ccommon meaning and usage,\u201d the trial court first analyzed the phrase \u201cto compensate for increases or decreases in cost due to changes in common carrier rates.\u201d It cited the definition of a motor common carrier in \u00a7 16-281 (c) of the General Statutes as one who operates a motor vehicle \u201cin the transportation of property . . . for the general public, for hire,\u201d and referred to <em>Ace-High Dresses, Inc. </em>v. <em>J. C. Trucking Co., Inc., </em>122 Conn. 578, 581, 191 A. 536, where this court clarified that definition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>by stating that a common carrier \u201cmust be engaged in the business of carrying goods for others as a public employment,\u201d quoting from 1 Hutchinson, Carriers (3d Ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 47, 48. The court correctly concluded that the words \u201ccommon carrier rates\u201d in the escalator clause referred to rates for services that a motor common carrier performs for others, and not to rates for services not performed as a common carrier, and hence that the words do not apply to services that the plaintiff performed for itself and not for others. The correctness of this conclusion is strengthened by the words in the same sentence of the escalator clause providing for payments to the contractor to be adjusted \u201cto compensate for increases or decreases in cost\u201d due to changes in such rates. These words clearly require a showing by the plaintiff that there has been an increase <em>in cost </em>due to the changes, for they would not automatically increase the cost so long as the contractor was himself performing the service, as would be the case where an independent common carrier performing such service would be legally bound to increase the charge, thus actually increasing the cost of that service to the contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">The mere fact that the plaintiff, in addition to being a general contractor also was licensed as a common carrier does not support its contention that, in hauling the materials required for fulfillment of its contract, it was operating as a common carrier. In <em>Colli </em>v. <em>Real Estate Commission, </em>169 Conn. 445, 364 A.2d 167, we recognized that the mere fact that an individual is licensed as a real estate broker does not mean that he acts in that capacity in every real estate transaction in which he participates. See <em>Santa Fe, Prescott &amp; Phoenix Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Grant Brothers Construction Co., </em>228 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>U.S. 177, 33 S. Ct. 474, 57 L. Ed. 787. Since it was the plaintiff\u2019s contractual obligation to provide the materials and to incorporate them into the work, it clearly was hauling materials which it was obligated to supply and which it itself used and consumed in constructing the highway. See <em>Fusco-Amatruda Co. </em>v. <em>Tax Commissioner, </em>168 Conn. 597, 601, 362 A.2d 847.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">The correctness of the court\u2019s conclusion is further strengthened by the language in the third paragraph of the escalator clause which specifies that the amount of any adjustment claimed must be \u201cshown by receipted common carrier bills,\u201d which clearly indicates (1) that a common carrier must have rendered a bill to the contractor and (2) that the contractor must have paid that bill. The plaintiff\u2019s argument that these words merely indicate the method by which the amount of the adjustment is to be proved overlooks the fact that if this were the intention of the parties, the use of the word \u201creceipted\u201d would be unnecessary. Of course, the receipted bill furnished to the plaintiff by Connecticut Sand and Stone Corporation does not meet the stated requirements since it is not a bill from a common carrier. The meaning of the escalator clause appears to be unambiguous and its wording clearly supports the court\u2019s conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b455-7\"> \u201c[General Statutes] See. 4-61. actions against the state on highway and publio works CONTRACTS.
