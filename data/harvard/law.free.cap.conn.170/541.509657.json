He attained the status of \u201cpermanent employee\u201d upon satisfactory completion of a six-month probationary or working test period, and continued to work for the state until he resigned on November 26,1971. The plaintiff was reemployed by the state on December 10,1973, in the same classification he had previously held. On February 28, 1974, the plaintiff was dismissed from state service without a hearing. The plaintiff appealed to the defendant personnel appeal board for review of that action. The board ruled that it lacked jurisdiction to hear his appeal on its merits because at the time of his dismissal the plaintiff was not a \u201cpermanent employee.\u201d That ruling was based on a determination by the board that, since the plaintiff had resigned in 1971, upon his reemployment he held the status of a new employee and was required to undergo a second six-month probationary period. The plaintiff appealed from the board\u2019s ruling to the Court of Common Pleas and the court found the issues for the plaintiff. The court held that the plaintiff was entitled to a hearing before the board because he was a \u201cpermanent employee\u201d at the time of his dismissal and because of his constitutional right to due process. From that holding the defendant board has appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>Section 5-201 of the General Statutes provides for the appointment of a personnel appeal board consisting of nine members whose duty it is to hear and act upon appeals filed in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 5-202 (a) by aggrieved state employees. Section 5-202 (a) provides that \u201c[a]ny permanent employee holding a position in the classified service who is . . . dismissed, or is individually aggrieved . . . may obtain a review of such action or alleged grievance by presenting a written appeal to the personnel appeal board.\u201d We first consider whether the plaintiff was a \u201cpermanent employee\u201d and as such entitled to a hearing before the defendant board under \u00a75-202 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">\u201cPermanent employee\u201d is defined in General Statutes \u00a7 5-196 (r) as \u201can employee holding a position in the classified service under a permanent appointment.\u201d To obtain such permanent appointment, an employee must satisfy a six-month working test requirement, under General Statutes \u00a7 5-230 and Regulations, Connecticut State Agencies \u00a7 5-9-14.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Upon successful completion of the probationary period, the appointing authority determines whether the employee merits permanent status. In some circumstances, an individual who previously had attained permanent status and who is returning to state service is not required to undergo a probationary period. Under Regulations, Connecticut State Agencies \u00a7 5-9-14 (3), no additional working <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>test period is required of an appointee \u201c[1] from a reemployment list [2] who previously served a satisfactory working test in the same or in a comparable class in the same agency and [3] had permanent status therein within the preceding three years.\u201d While the undisputed facts show that the plaintiff had satisfied requirements 2 and 3, we find that he has not satisfied requirement 1 in that his name was not taken from a reemployment list when he was reappointed to state service. Under General Statutes \u00a7 5-248 (d) (1969 Sup.), which was in effect when the plaintiff resigned, the name of an employee who had resigned would be placed on a reemployment list if that employee had resigned in good standing and had withdrawn his resignation within one year from its effective date.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The uncontested finding of the board is that the plaintiff never withdrew his resignation; therefore, his name was never placed on a reemployment list. He cannot benefit from the provisions of $ 5-9-14 (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">Administrative regulations \u201care given the force and effect of law.\u201d <em>Hartford Electric Light Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>161 Conn. 145, 154, 285 A.2d 352. It is explicitly required by $ 5-9-14 (3) of the regulations that in order to be entitled to a waiver of the additional probationary period, the reappointment to state service must have been made from a reemploy<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>ment list. This is not a mere technical requirement. The term \u201cworking test\u201d is defined in General Statutes \u00a7 5-196 (z) as \u201ca trial working period made a part of the selective process under the provisions of this chapter and by regulations issued in accordance herewith, during which the work and conduct of the employee shall be noted by the appointing authority or his authorized agent and reported upon to determine whether such employee merits permanent appointment.\u201d The expressed intent of the legislature is to provide the opportunity to observe and determine whether an employee, by his work and conduct, merits the status of \u201cpermanent employee.\u201d The opportunity to make such observations upon an individual\u2019s reentry into state service is as critical as that upon his original employment. Over the elapsed time, an individual\u2019s ability to work may have been impaired or his attitudes and motivations may have changed. Thus, the additional test period is of important practical value in the reevaluation of an employee who is returning to state service.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">We find that the trial court erred in concluding that the plaintiff was a \u201cpermanent employee.\u201d At the time of his dismissal on February 28, 1974, he was a probationary employee, required to complete a second test period before attaining permanent status. The defendant board was correct in declining to review his dismissal because it lacked jurisdiction under General Statutes \u00a7 5-202 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">We next consider whether the trial court erred in holding that the plaintiff had a constitutional right to a hearing before the board. The court based its holding on the principle that an individual must be accorded due process in the form of a hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>before he can be deprived of a significant property interest. A \u201cproperty interest\u201d may take many forms, and, while it is clear that the term extends \u201cwell beyond actual ownership of real estate, chattels, or money,\u201d it is equally clear that it does not include mere need, desire or unilateral expectation. See <em>Board of Regents </em>v. <em>Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 572, 577, 92 S. Ct. 2701, 33 L. Ed. 2d 548. The origin of a property interest is not in the constitution, but in \u201cexisting rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law\u2014rules or understandings that secure certain benefits and that support claims of entitlement to those benefits.\u201d <em>Board of Regents </em>v. <em>Roth, </em>supra, 577. Under the laws of this state, which are discussed above, it is clear that before the satisfactory completion of the working test period, the plaintiff\u2019s employment was merely probationary. His case is distinguishable from that of public employees who are tenured teachers; see <em>Slochower </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>350 U.S. 551, 76 S. Ct. 637, 100 L. Ed. 692; or those without tenure or formal contract who were hired with implied promises of continued employment; see <em>Connell </em>v. <em>Higgenbotham, </em>403 U.S. 207, 208, 91 S. Ct. 1772, 29 L. Ed. 2d 418. As the plaintiff had no legitimate claim of entitlement to future employment, he had no protected property interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">We find ourselves in agreement with the conclusion of the court in <em>Tichon </em>v. <em>Harder, </em>308 F. Sup. 839, 842 (D. Conn.): \u201cAlthough the Supreme Court has warned that to generalize \u2018that there is no constitutionally protected right to public employment is to obscure the issue\u2019; <em>Wieman </em>v. <em>Updegraff, </em>344 U.S. 183, 191, 73 S. Ct. 215, 97 L. Ed. 216 (1952), it has also stressed that \u2018to acknowledge that there exist constitutional restraints upon state and federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>governments in dealing with their employees is not to say that all snch employees have a constitutional right to notice and a hearing before they can be removed.\u2019 <em>Cafeteria and Restaurant Workers Union Local 473, AFL-CIO </em>v. <em>McElroy, </em>367 U.S. 886, 898, 81 S. Ct. 1743, 6 L. Ed. 2d 1230 (1961). In cases analogous to the present one, the courts have uniformly held that a probationary employee, in the absence of legislation, is not entitled to the protective procedure accorded a career or permanent employee. <em>Jaeger </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>410 F.2d 528 (5 Cir. 1969); <em>Medoff </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>362 F.2d 472 (1 Cir. 1966); <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Gantz, </em>Civ. No. 13, 044 (D. Conn. 1969); <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>237 F. Supp. 222 (D. Md. 1965) aff\u2019d 348 F.2d 464 (4 Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 382 U.S. 1030, 86 S. Ct. 653, 15 L. Ed. 2d 543 (1966).\u201d We conclude that the plaintiff, as a probationary employee having no property interest in continued employment by the state of Connecticut, had no constitutional right to a hearing before the defendant board.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">The plaintiff alleges in his complaint that he was dismissed \u201cpursuant to a claim he was overweight.\u201d Even if we assume that allegation to be true, the plaintiff\u2019s constitutional right to due process is not indicated. The Supreme Court of the United States has held that \u201c \u2018 [w]here a person\u2019s good name, reputation, honor, or integrity is at stake because of what the government is doing to him, notice and an opportunity to be heard are essential.\u2019 [citations omitted].\u201d <em>Board of Regents </em>v. <em>Roth, </em>supra, 573. The claim made here, however, does not stigmatize the plaintiff or damage his standing in the community, nor does it foreclose him from other employment possibilities. A hearing prior to dismissal was not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>There is error, the judgment is set aside and the ease is remanded to the Court of Common Pleas with direction to render judgment dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b563-6\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 5-230. working test periods.
