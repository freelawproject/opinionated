The defendant counterclaimed seeking the same relief on the same grounds as well as alleged intolerable cruelty on the part of the plaintiff. The case was referred to a state referee <em>(Hon. Howard W. Alcorn), </em>who rendered judgment dissolving the marriage and ordering the plaintiff to convey to the defendant his half interest in certain property and to pay her $70 a week. From this judgment the plaintiff brought the present appeal, filing an assignment of errors claiming that the court erred in maldng certain findings and in awarding excessive alimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">The plaintiff did not file either a request for finding or a draft finding. Consequently, no finding was made by the court. \u201cThe absence of a finding does not necessarily preclude action by this court. We are, however, limited in our inquiry to the material facts which appear on the record.\u201d <em>Robertson </em>v. <em>Robertson, </em>164 Conn. 140, 142, 318 A.2d 106. There is a memorandum of decision but it does not establish facts and cannot take the place of a finding, although we may consult it for a better understanding of the basis for the court\u2019s decision. <em>Davenport Taxi, Inc. </em>v. <em>State Labor Commissioner, </em>164 Conn. 233, 235, 319 A.2d 386; <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>143 Conn. 600, 602, 124 A.2d 891.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">The amount of alimony awarded under a decree dissolving a marriage is within the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>Hotkowski </em>v. <em>Hotkowski, </em>165 Conn. 167, 172, 328 A.2d 674; see \u201cConnecticut\u2019s New Approach to Marriage Dissolution,\u201d 47 Conn. B.J. 375, 390. In the absence of a finding and on the record before us, it cannot be said that as a matter of law the award made in this case constituted an abuse of the court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
