The principal issues decided by the verdict were the claims of negligence on the part of the plaintiff and the defendant\u2019s claims of contributory negligence pleaded by way of special defense. Counsel for the named plaintiff on the appeal was not trial counsel and the appeal can best be categorized as a valiant but futile effort to retry the case in this court, pressing claims never presented to the trial court, claims of error in rulings to which no objection was raised at the trial and claims of error in the court\u2019s charge to which no exceptions were taken and as to which no requests to charge were filed. No novel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>principles of law or appellate procedure are involved and to discuss seriatim the plaintiff\u2019s numerous groundless claims of error would serve no good purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
