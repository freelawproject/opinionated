For reasons which follow, we have concluded that the order was erroneously made and must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-5\">Defendant was charged by complaint with three counts of violating Penal Code sections 242 and 243 (battery on a peace officer). At his arraignment, at which he was represented by counsel, trial was set for April 26, 1983. On that date, on defense counsel\u2019s motion the matter was continued to the disposition calendar in the misdemeanor master calendar court, division 90, to May 19, 1983, and thereafter trailed, due to the unavailability of defense counsel, to May 20, 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-6\">On that date, with defendant present with counsel but the prosecutor not then being present, the court called the matter, at which time defense counsel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1030-7\">\u201cHe\u2019s present with counsel. This is a D.A. case, if the court please, and I can\u2019t get any satisfaction from the district attorney. They act as though this case is some poor orphan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1030-8\">\u201cI do have a proposed solution, that is, that defendant would be willing to enter a plea, a pre-plea, request sentencing report through pre-plea, and on the basis of that, have your Honor evaluate it and perhaps offer a tentative disposition, which I can then serve on the People.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1030-9\">\u201cIs that agreeable? The defendant is a lawyer who is also a cab driver and it involves a misunderstanding in an altercation at the Los Angeles International Airport.\u201d The court responded:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1030-10\">\u201cPeople v. Johnson, case is dismissed. The People aren\u2019t ready to proceed. I\u2019m tired of the District Attorney just sending these cases and not showing up, not calling us, not honoring us with their presence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1030-11\">\u201cOn the Court\u2019s motion, case is dismissed. People are not ready to proceed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1030-12\">The record on appeal reflects that in fact a deputy district attorney was present at the proceedings but had not identified herself on the record although she had done so to the clerk. The record further reflects that, \u201cThe People were available on call in Division 91 on May 19 and 20, 1983,\u201d and that division 91, described as \u201cthe Felony Court,\u201d was located next door to division 90, the \u201cMaster Misdemeanor Calendar Court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1031-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 5\">*Supp. 5</page-number>According to an addendum to the settled statement certified by the court below, prior to May 20, 1983, in division 90, a master calendar court, there were other cases called by the court in which the district attorney did not appear, did not call, and \u201cfrustrated\u201d the Court\u2019s attempt at moving a busy calendar. The instant dismissal was \u201cmeant to send a message that the Court would no longer tolerate such conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-5\">On appeal, the People contend that the trial court\u2019s order of dismissal constituted an abuse of discretion and must be reversed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We agree. We have concluded that the order of dismissal, entered without affording the prosecution notice and an opportunity to be heard, was improper, and that, in any event, the dismissal was not \u201cin furtherance of justice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-6\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Gonzales </em>(1965) 235 Cal.App.2d Supp. 887 [46 Cal.Rptr. 301], this court reversed an order of dismissal which was made in the absence of and without prior notice of the court\u2019s intended action to the prosecution. Emphasizing the adversary nature of our criminal procedure and the position of the prosecutor in a criminal action, we stated that, \u201cThe interests of justice will be better promoted, especially in a proceeding prior to trial, by requiring the municipal court acting on its own motion (and not that of the prosecuting attorney) under section 1385 to give notice to the prosecutor and a reasonable opportunity to be present, ...\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 891.)  We cited several policy reasons in support of this rule: first, notice to the prosecutor and a reasonable opportunity to be present enables the trial judge to make a more informed decision; second, the basic concept of fairness requires notice if the rights of an adverse party are likely to be affected;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> third, in order to promote the general respect of the public for the courts and the judicial process, notice and opportunity to be heard are essential; and, finally, to protect judges of lower courts against unfair and improper pressures sometimes placed upon them by members of the public who are charged with misdemeanors and infractions. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 891-893.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-7\">In the case before us we conclude that the trial court\u2019s order of dismissal, made without affording notice to the prosecution and an opportunity for it to be heard, contravened many of the policies articulated in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 6\">*Supp. 6</page-number><em>Gonzalez </em>and on this basis alone constituted an invalid order. <em>{People </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, supra, </em>235 Cal.App.2d Supp. 887.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-4\">Penal Code section 1385 provides: \u201cThe judge or magistrate may, either of its own motion or upon the application of the prosecuting attorney, and in furtherance of justice, order an action to be dismissed. The reasons of the dismissal must be set forth in an order entered upon the minutes. No dismissal shall be made for any cause which would be ground of demurrer to the accusatory pleading.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1032-5\">The trial court\u2019s power to dismiss an action pursuant to section 1385, while broad, is by no means absolute. The power is limited by the requirement that the dismissal be \u201cin furtherance of justice.\u201d The boundaries of the court\u2019s power under section 1385 have been established by precedent <em>{People </em>v. <em>Orin </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 937, 945 [120 Cal.Rptr. 65, 533 P.2d 193]).</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-6\">In <em>Or\u00edn </em>our Supreme Court set forth the parameters of the power observing that paramount among the general principles established by the case law is the rule \u201c \u2018that the language of that section, \u201cfurtherance of justice,\u201d requires consideration both of the constitutional rights of the defendant, and <em>the interests of society represented by the People, </em>in determining whether there should a dismissal. [Citations.]\u2019 \u201d and that, at a minimum, \u201cthe reason for dismissal must be \u2018that which would motivate a reasonable judge.\u2019 \u201d <em>{People </em>v. <em>Or\u00edn, supra, </em>at p. 945. Italics in original.) The court further declared that while pretrial dismissals have been upheld where designed to enable the prosecution to obtain further witnesses, to add additional defendants, to plead new facts, or to plead new offenses, and have also been used to effectuate plea bargains arranged between the People and the defense and approved by the court, \u201cappellate courts have shown considerable opposition to the granting of dismissals under section 1385 in instances where the People are thereby prevented from prosecuting defendants for offenses of which there is probable cause to believe they are guilty as charged.  Courts have recognized that society, represented by the People, has a legitimate interest in \u2018the fair prosecution of crimes properly alleged.\u2019 (Citation omitted.) \u2018\u201c[A] dismissal which arbitrarily cuts those rights without a showing of detriment to the defendant is an abuse of discretion.\u201d [Citations.]\u2019\u201d <em>{Id., </em>at pp. 946-947.)  Finally, our Supreme Court observed that allowing trial judges to make liberal use of section 1385 \u201cto avoid criminal prosecutions where probable cause exists to believe con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 7\">*Supp. 7</page-number>viction is warranted would be contrary to the adversary nature of our criminal procedure as prescribed by the Legislature.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 947.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-5\">For the foregoing reasons we have determined that the order on its merits constituted an abuse of the court\u2019s discretion. On the record before us we cannot say that the reason for the dismissal was that which would motivate a reasonable judge. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Orin, supra, </em>13 Cal.3d at p. 945; <em>People </em>v. <em>Curtiss </em>(1970) 4 Cal.App.3d 123, 126 [84 Cal.Rptr. 106].) The dismissal arbitrarily deprived society of its legitimate interest in the fair prosecution of crimes properly alleged and curtailed society\u2019s interest in enforcement of its penal laws without a showing of detriment to the defendant. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Orin, supra, </em>at p. 947.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-6\">The record reflects that, unlike cases in which the court\u2019s power of dismissal is invoked to protect the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial (see, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Mejia </em>(1976) 57 Cal.App.3d 547 [129 Cal.Rptr. 192]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1976) 62 Cal.App.3d Supp. 1 [133 Cal.Rptr. 123]; cf. <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1977) 70 Cal.App.3d 751 [139 Cal.Rptr. 61]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Peinado </em>(1976) 67 Cal.App.3d Supp. 1 [136 Cal.Rptr. 845]); or to a speedy trial (see, e.g., <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 734 [91 Cal.Rptr. 578, 478 P.2d 10]; cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Flores </em>(1978) 90 Cal.App.3d Supp. 1, 9 [152 Cal.Rptr. 896] [recognizing that failure to bring a defendant to trial within time limit of Pen. Code, \u00a7 1382, requires dismissal unless good cause is shown by the People]), or to effectuate an overriding public policy goal (see, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Jordan </em>(1978) 86 Cal.App.3d 529 [150 Cal.Rptr. 334]), the dismissal at bench serves no paramount policy objective. Rather, the order of the court below frustrated \u201cthe orderly and effective operation of our criminal procedure as envisioned by the Legislature [inasmuch as the court\u2019s power was exercised] without proper and adequate reason under section 1385 [thereby terminating] the prosecution of [the] defendants for crimes properly charged in accordance with legal procedure.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Orin, supra, </em>13 Cal.3d 937, 947.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-7\">In reaching the foregoing conclusion, we are aware of the heavy pressures of case load upon the municipal courts as well as the waste of public funds and scarce judicial resources occasioned by permitting cases to trail or be continued within the time limit of Penal Code section 1382.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1034-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 8\">*Supp. 8</page-number> However, in view of the fundamental right of the People to prosecute defendants upon probable cause to believe they are guilty <em>(People </em>v. <em>Kessel, supra, </em>61 Cal.App.3d 322, 326; <em>People </em>v. <em>Mack </em>(1975) 52 Cal.App.3d 680 [125 Cal.Rptr. 188]; cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Orin, supra, </em>13 Cal.3d 937, 947, 948-951), neither judicial convenience, court congestion, nor judicial pique, no matter how warranted, can supply justification for an order of dismissal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1034-4\">The order of dismissal is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-5\">Reese, P. J., and Cooperman, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1031-8\">Respondent has not filed a brief in this matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1031-9\">In this connection we observed: \u201cWe, of course, take judicial notice of the heavy case load of cases processed and exigencies peculiar to the municipal courts; and we do not say that a formal written notice is required. In certain cases, just a telephone call to the prosecutor with a reasonable opportunity to appear might be adequate. But some kind of notice is a requisite and the onus thereof is not unreasonable.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 892.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1032-7\">The trial court did comply with the requirement of setting forth in its minutes the reasons of the dismissal. <em>{People </em>v. <em>Peinado </em>(1976) 67 Cal.App.3d Supp. 1, 9 [136 Cal.Rptr. 845].) The People do not contend otherwise.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1033-8\">Courts have interpreted section 1382 to permit the prosecution, without suffering a dismissal, to continue cases within the statutory period without the necessity of showing good cause (see, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Rubaum </em>(1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 930 [168 Cal.Rptr. 291]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Arnold </em>(1980) 105 Cal.App.3d 456 [164 Cal.Rptr. 367]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hernandez </em>(1979) 97 Cal.App.3d 451 [158 Cal.Rptr. 742]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Flores </em>(1978) 90 Cal.App.3d Supp. 1 [152 Cal.Rptr. 896]; see, also, <em>People </em>v. <em>Kessel </em>(1976) 61 Cal.App.3d 322 [132 Cal.Rptr. 126].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-9\">These decisions appear to us to be inappropriate: At a time when unprecedented demand is placed by an impatient public upon scarce judicial resources and when public confidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 8\">*Supp. 8</page-number>in the judiciary\u2019s capacity to deal quickly with urgent societal issues is weak at best, these precedents deprive the courts of a much-needed power to order dismissals in cases in which the prosecution is dilatory; indeed, the unfortunate effect of these decisions is often to encourage inefficient preparation of cases and resulting waste of costly court time. We therefore hope that the Legislature will take appropriate action to remedy this unnecessary situation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1034-10\">As an independent branch of government, courts have inherent powers requisite to their effective functioning. Thus, in addition to informal administrative remedies to ensure prompt attendance of deputies of the district attorney and of the public defender, the courts possess the power of contempt <em>(Bloniarz </em>v. <em>Roloson </em>(1969) 70 Cal.2d 143, 147-148 [74 Cal.Rptr. 285, 449 P.2d 221]; <em>Lyons </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1955) 43 Cal.2d 755, 758 [278 P.2d 681]; see <em>Mowrer </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1969) 3 Cal.App.3d 223, 230 [83 Cal.Rptr. 125]) as well as the statutory authority to impose monetary sanctions for unnecessary delay.
