His acts and conduct therefore constitute a ratification and estoppel against him as a matter of law. Navarro Pub. Co. v. Fishburn, <em>2 </em>Posey U. C., 593; Dawson v. Sparks, 1 Posey U.

We do not indorse the proposition thus stated, but the reasonableness of the delay being one of fact, this court can not pass upon it, for which reason we refuse the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-13\">\n<em>Writ of error refused.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
