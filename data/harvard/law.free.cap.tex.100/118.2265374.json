Whether such damages were a natural and probable consequence of the plaintiff\u2019s wife being required to pay additional railroad fare, and <em>2, </em>whether the first conductor, to-wit, the conductor of appellant, when he failed and refused to perform his duty to the plaintiff\u2019s wife, ought reasonably to have foreseen, in the light of the attending circumstances and as a result of his failure to give plaintiff\u2019s wife the proper check for presentation -to the second conductor, that such damages would probably ensue.

Notwithstanding same she was forced to buy a new ticket and pay fare to Kansas City, and that this took about all the money she had, and in order to have sufficient means to buy a ticket from Kansas City to St. Joe, Missouri, and to get some refreshments, she was compelled to borrow the sum of $3 from a fellow passenger, and that she was deprived of the opportunity of taking a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>sleeper and had to sit up in the coach the balance of the trip, which lasted all night. She claims that by reason of said facts she was humiliated, mortified, made nervous, sick, etc., to her damage, and for which damage was claimed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-3\">\u201cDefendant answered, pleading among other things a general denial. There was a trial and verdict of the jury April 19, 1905, in favor of the Missouri, Kansas <em>&amp; </em>Texas Railway, and in favor of the plaintiffs against the Missouri, Kansas &amp; Texas Railway Company of Texas, for the sum of $500. Motion for new trial was filed which was overruled, and the cause is now before this court on' appeal on the part of the Missouri, Kansas &amp; Texas Railway Company of Texas.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">The defendant requested the court to give the following charge which was refused: \u201cIn this case the plaintiff can not recover for any mental distress or feeling which his wife may have suffered by reason of having borrowed from other persons in order- to complete her journey, and they will disallow any claim therefor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">The trial court instructed the jury to find for the plaintiff against the Missouri, Kansas &amp; Texas Railway Company of Texas, \u201cfor such a sum of money as will be a reasonable and fair compensation for such physical and mental suffering, if any, as you believe from the evidence Mrs. Welch sustained, as the natural and probable consequence of being required to pay additional railroad hire, and which you believe ought reasonably to \"have been foreseen by the conductor of the Missouri, Kansas &amp; Texas Railway of Texas in the light of the attending circumstances as a result of his failure to give Mrs. Welch the proper check for presentation to the second conductor, as an evidence of her right to continuous transportation to Kansas City.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">\u201cIf you believe from the evidence that the conductor of the Missouri, Kansas &amp; Texas Railway Company of Texas, in the light of the attending circumstances, could not reasonably have foreseen that as a result of his failure to give Mrs. Welch a check to present to the second conductor showing her right to a continuous passage to Kansas City, Mrs. Welch would be deprived of sleeping car accommodations, or that she would be subjected to the necessity of having to borrow money from the other passengers, then you will not allow plaintiff any damages for any suffering, physical or mental, sustained by Mrs. Welch, if any, from such cause or causes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">Under this charge the minds of the jury were directed specifically .to the mental suffering occasioned to Mrs. Welch by having to borrow money from a fellow passenger, and the question was submitted.to them whether the necessity for such borrowing rvas a reasonable and probable consequence of the negligence of the conductor of the defendant company. The special charge requested by the railroad company, which is copied above, presented to the court the proposition that, as a matter of law, the distress or mental suffering caused by the borrowing of the money was not a subject for damages to be recovered by the plaintiff and, if given, would have withdrawn that issue from the jury. The court erred in not giving the special charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">The general rule to be applied to this case is, that to sustain the judgment, the injury complained of must be shell that at the time the conductor was guilty of the negligent omission he ought to have .fore<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>seen that the necessity to borrow the money or a like injury would probably result therefrom. (Texas &amp; Pac. Ry. Co. v. Bingham, 90 Texas, 223.) The viewpoint from which the facts must be considered is the time when the conductor acted.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Standing in the place of the conductor when he failed to give the slip to authorize the next conductor to transport Mrs. Welch to Kansas City, could one reasonably anticipate that upon being refused a continuous passage Mrs. Welch would be under the necessity of borrowing money from some other person? There is nothing in the facts to suggest such a contingency. Looking back at a state of facts which have transpired, one can see a connection between the consequence and the original cause which would not appear from a most careful consideration of the matter when the first act occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">In the case of Hoffman v. Northern Pacific Railway (47 N. W. Rep., 312), the Supreme Court of Minnesota held that the mental suffering which resulted from the necessity of a passenger to borrow money under like circumstances was too remote to sustain a claim for compensation, and we are of opinion that the holding was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">The Court of Civil Appeals cites the case of Texas &amp; Pacific Railway Company v. Armstrong (93 Texas, 31), in support of its conclusion. In that case the Court of Civil Apeals certified to this court the following question: \u201cAmong other questions presented for decision, appellant has assigned as error that portion of the court\u2019s charge which allows the plaintiff to recover compensation for mental pain, anxiety, or distress suffered by his wife; and whether or not it was error to give this charge, the Court of Civil Appeals for the Third District certifies to the Supreme Court for decision.\u201d In answer this court said: \u201cIf the mental pain, anxiety, and distress, were caused proximately by the negligent act of the agent of the railway company for which that company was liable, then the mental suffering, anxiety, and distress were proper elements of actual damages to be considered, by the jury in arriving at the amount of their verdict.\u201d The facts would have justified the submission of a question similar to that before us, but it was not specified in the question. The answer is so guarded as to restrict its effect to such \u201cmental pain,\u201d etc., as -were proximately caused by the act of the agent. The point made was not that mental suffering arising from want of money could not be recovered, but that in that class of cases, compensation for such suffering from any cause was not recoverable. That was the point certified and the one decided by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">We are of opinion that the facts of. this case, as a matter of law, showed that the railroad company was not liable for the mental suffering which arose out of the fact that Mrs. Welch was placed under the necessity to borrow the sum of $3 from a fellow passenger. Lest our opinion be misconstrued, we say, that we do not intend to hold that the pecuniary condition in which Mrs. Welch was when she was denied passage by the second conductor could not be considered if that condition produced in her mental suffering or mortification or in any way added to the distress of mind which arose from a refusal of the conductor to carry her according to the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-10\">It. is ordered that the judgment of the District Court and of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>Court of Civil Appeals be reversed and that this cause be remanded to the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-3\">on motion for rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">There was no appeal by either party presented to this court from the judgment of the trial court as between James Welch and others and the Missouri, Kansas &amp; Texas Railway Company; therefore, that judgment was not before this court and could not be reversed by it in this proceeding. (Lauchheimer &amp; Sons v. Coop, 99 Texas, 386. The judgment rendered in this court concerns only the litigation between James Welch and the Missouri, Kansas &amp; Texas Railway Company of Texas, and the motion of the Missouri, Kansas &amp; Texas Railway Company for a new trial is therefore overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">Filed October 17, 1906.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
