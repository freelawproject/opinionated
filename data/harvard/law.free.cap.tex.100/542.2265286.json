M. Campbell, brought this suit against the J. B. Watkins Land Mortgage Company to recover damages for an alleged breach of contract of sale of land.

The authority of Wilson &amp; Lightfoot was, in the main, predicated by the plaintiffs upon the following correspondence:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-11\">\u201c \u2018Wilson &amp; Lightfoot,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-12\">\u201cReal Estate and Loans, COPY.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-13\">\u201c837 Main Street,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-14\">\u201cPhone 8303\u20148 Rings. \u201cDallas, Texas, March 14, 1903.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-15\">\u201cJ.

Stanton/</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-15\">\u201cWithin a reasonable time after receipt of the letter of March 18, 1903, Wilson &amp; Lightfoot closed the contract with Mrs. Campbell, and reported the same to appellant. For assigned reasons, unnecessary to state, appellant refused to sell the land to Mrs. Campbell.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-16\">The judgment of the trial court, rendered in this case, depends wholly upon the correspondence between Wilson &amp; Lightfoot and the J. B. Watkins Land Mortgage Company. Outside of that correspondence there is no evidence in the record which we have been able to find that tends to establish the authority of Wilson &amp; Lightfoot to make the sale to Mrs. Campbell. Wilson testified in the case, and it does not appear from his testimony, nor is it claimed by counsel for the defendants in error, that any agency existed prior to the writing of the letter by Wilson &amp; Lightfoot to the Land Mortgage Company. We therefore will examine this correspondence to see if there is anything in the terms used from which it may be fairly concluded that the J. B. Watkins Land Mortgage Company intended to confer authority upon Wilson &amp; Lightfoot to sell the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-17\">The first letter, written by Wilson &amp; Lightfoot to the Land Mortgage Company, does not purport to be the report of action by Wilson &amp; Lightfoot as the agents of the Mortgage Company, but submits to that company an offer which the land agents had received from a person whose name is not disclosed. The slightest intimation of a claim on the part of Wilson &amp; Lightfoot of power to sell is thoroughly negatived by this language of the letter: \u201cShall we close the deal ?\u201d The reply of the Land Mortgage Company did not authorize Wilson &amp; Lightfoot \u201cto close the deal,\u201d but distinctly reserved to the company the right to accept, saying that: \u201cIf you could get the amount of your cash payment increased to $600, we would be willing to accept the offer . . . Awaiting your further report, we are,\u201d etc. Thus, in answer to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>query, \"shall we close the deal?\u201d the Land Mortgage Company replies, \u201cwe would be willing to accept,\u201d upon certain terms yet to be arranged; the question emphasizes the meaning of the reply. From this correspondence, we think that Mrs. Campbell could not have understood that Wilson &amp; Lightfoot had authority to make the sale, but must have known that the power to accept or refuse was still retained by the company until a report had been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">If, however, there were doubt upon the question, the subsequent correspondence between the parties, which is undisputed, and was introduced by the defendants in error, would remove that doubt, for when Wilson &amp; Lightfoot reported the sale as having been made by them to Mrs. Campbell-the Land Mortgage Company promptly declined to ratify it for reasons given but not necessary to be stated. To this letter Wilson &amp; Lightfoot replied, using the following language: -\u201cWe made this sale acting on your letter of March <em>29, </em>in which you agreed to sell for $1,800\u2014$600 cash, balance in one, two, three, four and five years, at eight percent interest. . . . Our customer will not pay more than $1,800, but they are expecting to do quite a lot of improvement on the property, which will make your security much better. We feel that this is a fair price for the property, and that it would be wise to accept this sale, as the property is very much out of repair, and will cost several hundred dollars to put it in anything-like good condition. Of course, if you do not want to sell the property, and do not intend for us to have the sale, after making it, and prefer to wait and see if someone else can make sale, of course this is business of yours. We can sell our customers another place as soon as we find that they will not get this, and we would like for you to answer by wire at our expense as soon as you receive this, and we will act accordingly.\u201d To this letter J. B. Watkins Land Mortgage Company responded by wire as follows: \u201cDo not hold buj^er Downs property. Sell him something else-.\u201d From these letters it will be seen that Wilson &amp; Lightfoot did not understand that they were authorized to make an absolute sale to Mrs. Campbell, but understood it to be subject to the approval of the Land Mortgage Compiny; that was the construction the parties placed upon the correspondence at the time and while the business was being transacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">It is ordered that the judgments of the District Court and Court of Civil Appeals be reversed, and that judgment be here rendered that the defendants in error, Theresa Campbell and H. M. Campbell, take nothing by their suit, and that The J. B. Watkins Land Mortgage Company go hence without day and recover of the said defendants in error all costs.</p>\n<p id=\"An3E\">\n<em>Reversed and rendered for Plaintiff in Error.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
