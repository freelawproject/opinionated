By both, a dealer is one who buys <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>to sell again, at a profit the sale of the article being in the same form in which the dealer purchased; and the dealer is not one who manufactures to sell or buys to manufacture, or buys to keep.

If taxable at all, it must be taxed in its entirety, and if exempt from a tax, it is exempt as a whole, and, therefore, in each and every part. To apply, if a manufacturer, as such, is exempt, the necessary parts of his business, to wit, (1) buying the raw material for manufacture, and (2) selling the manufactured product, must also be exempt.

Such statutes are construed most strongly against the government, and in favor of the citizen, \u201cbecause burdens are not to be imposed, nor presumed to be imposed beyond what the statutes expresslv and clearly import.\u201d United States v.

Such classification is capricious and arbitrary, in that it does not apply to persons engaged in like business, as dealers in coal, etc., and therefore denies the wholesale dealers in oil, etc., the equal protection of the law.

Therefore, this Act in question, which passed -the Legislature finally on April 13, 1905, and was' approved on April 17, 1905, must be construed to refer to April 1, 1906, where it requires reports to be made and taxes paid \u201con the first day of April and quarterly thereafter.\u201d Galveston, H. &amp; S.

All of the questions raised by plaintiff in error, save one, have been decided against it in the opinion just delivered in the case of the Texas Company against J. W. Stephens, et al. The further question arises out of the fact that the company, in its report to the Comptroller, shoived that it had on hand, during the periods for which the tax was to be ascertained, refined products of crude oil of stated values AAdiich it had not sold or othenvise disposed of.. The reasoning of the opinion just referred to leads necessarily to the conclusion that the value of such products was properly included in arriving at the total amount upon which the tax Avas to be estimated. There is no difficulty in seeing that the articles thus held for sale in the wholesale business are within the language of the Statute, The judgment must therefore be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"AIJ\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
