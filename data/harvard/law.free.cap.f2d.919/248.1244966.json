JONES, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"AgZ7\">Defendant-appellant Danny Michael Weeks was convicted after a jury trial of two counts of kidnapping, two counts of interstate transportation of a stolen vehicle, and one count each of carrying a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>firearm during a crime of violence and possessing a firearm as a convicted felon. The district court sentenced Weeks to prison for two consecutive life terms followed by 17 years, plus a fine of $1,250,000. On appeal, Weeks alleges numerous errors by the trial court and the prosecutors. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">This case has come to us before on appeal. In United States v. Weeks, 870 F.2d 267 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, - U.S. 110 S.Ct. 92, 107 L.Ed.2d 57 (1989), we upheld against a double jeopardy challenge the district court's decision to grant Weeks' motion for a mistrial without prejudice to the government's right to reprosecute. The background and procedural history of this prosecution are adequately described in that opinion. We now examine here the seven issues on which Weeks seeks reversal of his convictions following remand and retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">SHACKLES</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">Weeks first contends that the district court abused its discretion in requiring him to stand trial confined by shackles. We agree with Weeks that \u201c[a]n accused person is presumed innocent and is, therefore, entitled to the indicia of innocence in a jury trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Theriault, </em>531 F.2d 281, 284 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 898, 97 S.Ct. 262, 50 L.Ed.2d 182 (1976). This entitlement, however, \u201cmust be balanced against the court\u2019s obligation to protect the court and its processes, and to attend to the safety and security of those in the courtroom.\u201d <em>United States v. Nicholson, </em>846 F.2d 277, 279 (5th Cir.1988). Moreover, \u201c[tjhis balancing of competing interests is entrusted to the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Ther-iault, </em>531 F.2d at 284. The record indicates that the court did not abuse its discretion in requiring Weeks to be shackled.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">As to the necessity of restraining Weeks in the first place, the district court displayed awareness that Weeks had escaped from the Louisiana state penitentiary at Angola and that the crimes charged at trial grew out of this escape. The court also relied on the testimony of two United States Marshals. According to Deputy Bright, the Marshal\u2019s Service knew that Weeks had planned two escapes from the local county jail before his first trial. According to Deputy Riley, the Marshal\u2019s Service twice received notification from the county jail that Weeks was planning to escape prior to his second trial. Weeks attempts to discount these concerns by pointing out that he had been allowed to appear at pretrial matters unchained. We do not see the supposed inconsistency: neither a jury nor large numbers of spectators are present at pretrial proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-10\">Weeks also claims that the court\u2019s reliance on the Marshal\u2019s Service was an impermissible delegation of discretion in violation of <em>United States v. Samuel, </em>431 F.2d 610, 615 (4th Cir.1970). Although the Fourth Circuit did hold that a district judge may not delegate his discretion to the Marshal, it went on to say that \u201che may rely heavily on the Marshal\u2019s advice as to what may be required since it is the Marshal who has the experience in the keeping of prisoners and who must provide the guards and bear the major responsibility if untoward incidents occur.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Weeks attempts to show an impermissible delegation of discretion by quoting the court\u2019s statement that it would \u201cleave Court security to the Marshal\u2019s Service.\u201d This quotation is entirely misleading. It was uttered in response to a request by counsel at voir dire that the marshals \u201cback up;\u201d it had nothing to do with shackling. The court made an extensive record on the shackling issue, even allowing defense counsel to cross-examine the marshals about Weeks\u2019 alleged escape plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-11\">Finally, the court took steps to minimize any potential for prejudice from the shackles. File-type boxes were placed in front of the desk at which Weeks sat during trial, preventing the jury from seeing the shackles but otherwise not blocking its view of him. Before and after Weeks displayed his forearms to the jury, the jury was excused while Weeks was moved around the courtroom. The court noted that these procedures had successfully hidden the shackles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>from the jury at co-defendant James (\"Jimmy\") Colvin's trial-until Colvin had deliberately lifted his legs to show the jurors. With that in mind, the court suggested to counsel before the first trial that she direct Weeks not to do the same thing if he wished to keep the jury ignorant of the shackles. Given its reasonable reliance on the Marshal Service's experience with courtroom security and its efforts to limit any prejudice, the district court did not abuse its discretion in requiring Weeks to be shackled at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">HEARSAY</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">Weeks next claims that the district court erred in allowing an assistant warden of the Angola penitentary to testify that Weeks\u2019s nickname in prison was \u201cGato.\u201d Because kidnap victims Linda Mayeaux and Karyn Laccheo both testified that their abductors used the names \u201cJimmy\u201d and \u201cGato,\u201d this testimony helped to establish the identity of Weeks as one of the two abductors of the women. Weeks argues that the court should have excluded the warden\u2019s testimony as hearsay not falling within any exception. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 802. Hearsay is defined as \u201ca statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted;\u201d a statement is \u201can oral or written assertion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>801(a) and (c). We conclude that the warden\u2019s testimony reported non-assertive oral conduct and was therefore not hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">The following exchanges took place between the witness and defense counsel Meyers and prosecutor Woodward (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-8\">BY MS. MEYERS:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-9\">Q. Have you ever heard, personally heard anyone call Danny Michael Weeks by a nickname?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-10\">A. I have heard other inmates. That\u2019s my personal knowledge of the inmates, and other security people call him by a nickname.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-11\">Q. Personally on the yard or have you heard them use it or just told you that was his name?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-12\">A. I\u2019ve heard an officer before call him by that name.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-13\">Q. So the officer <em>told </em>you that name but didn\u2019t call Mr. Weeks that name and have him answer to that name?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-14\">A. Didn\u2019t have him answer to it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-15\">Q. And the only way you have heard this name Gato is some guards used that name with reference to Mr. Weeks; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-16\">A. I\u2019ve heard a guard <em>use </em>it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-17\">BY MR. WOODWARD:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-18\">Q. The guard is not the only person you\u2019ve heard the name Gato from in regard to Danny Michael Weeks; isn\u2019t that true?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-19\">A. I have heard other inmates use it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AuZX\">Had the interrogation ceased after the third question and answer (\"So the officer told you . . . ?\"), it is likely that the jury, in order to believe that Weeks' nickname was Gato, would have had to accept as true the out-of-court assertion of an unidentified \"officer.\" The questioning continued, however, and the warden elaborated on his previously vague answer. He stated that he had heard both a guard and other inmates \"use\" the nickname. The jury could infer that the warden had personal knowledge of the nickname, knowledge acquired as people often acquire knowledge of names-by hearing other people \"use\" them in a non-assertive manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-20\">We review a district court\u2019s eviden-tiary rulings for abuse of discretion. <em>Le-Boeuf v. K-Mart Corp., </em>888 F.2d 330, 333 (5th Cir.1989). In the present context, this review is focused on the question whether the reported oral conduct of a guard and other inmates conveyed assertions. According to the drafters of the Federal Rules of Evidence, the \u201ckey\u201d to the definition of \u201cstatement\u201d is that \u201cnothing is an assertion unless intended to be one.\u201d Moreover, \u201c[t]he rule is so worded as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>place the burden upon the party claiming that the intention existed; ambiguous and doubtful cases will be resolved against him and in favor of admissibility.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 801(a) advisory committee\u2019s note. The district court implicitly ruled that Weeks did not meet his burden. Given our analysis above, the court did not abuse its discretion by admitting the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">PARTISAN STANCE</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">Weeks next argues that the district court committed reversible error by taking a partisan stance in favor of the government when the court questioned Linda Mayeaux about her doubts as to the identity of Weeks as one of her kidnappers. The following exchange took place during defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of May-eaux:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-7\">Q. At that time you identified Mr. Weeks as the other individual; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-8\">A. Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-9\">THE COURT: Do you have any doubt about that? Do you have any doubt about the identification? Mrs. Mayeaux, do you have any doubt about it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-10\">THE WITNESS: No, sir. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-11\">THE COURT: No doubt at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-12\">THE WITNESS: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-13\">THE COURT: About either Mr. Colvin or Mr. Weeks?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-14\">THE WITNESS: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-15\">THE COURT: No doubt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-16\">THE WITNESS: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-17\">THE COURT: No matter what they were wearing then or now, no doubt?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-18\">THE WITNESS: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-19\">THE COURT: All right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-20\">We address this point in light of two propositions: (1) a district judge has the authority to \u201ccomment on the evidence [and] question witnesses and elicit facts not yet adduced or clarify those previously presented;\u201d and (2) \u201c[o]nly when the judge\u2019s conduct strays from neutrality is the defendant thereby denied a constitutionally fair trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>809 F.2d 1072, 1087 (5th Cir.) (quoting <em>Moore v. United States, </em>598 F.2d 439, 442 (5th Cir.1979)), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>484 U.S. 896, 108 S.Ct. 228, 98 L.Ed.2d 187; 484 U.S. 913, 108 S.Ct. 259, 98 L.Ed.2d 216; 484 U.S. 987, 108 S.Ct. 506, 98 L.Ed.2d 504 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-22\">Weeks compares his case to two cases in which the courts of appeals granted new trials because of judicial intervention in the questioning of witnesses. In United States v. Allsup, 566 F.2d 68 (9th Cir.1977), the district court took over cross-examination of a government witness who had admitted that she had only moments before identified the wrong photograph as her assailant. The court asked the witness why she had made a mistake; the witness answered: \"Well, when I first glanced at [the photographsj-I don't know, I'm scared and my mind just went blank.\" Id. at 72. The court of appeals concluded that \"[t]he implication was strong that [the defendant] had frightened the witness, not simply that she was suffering from a common case of nervousness from being in a courtroom.\" Id. at 72-73. Thus, the total impact of the intervention \"was to destroy the effect of telling cross-examination, to rehabilitate the witness, and to give her testimony an extra and a potentially prejudicial persuasiveness.\" Id. at 73.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-23\"><em>Allsup </em>is distinguishable from this case. This record reveals no \u201ctelling\u201d cross-examination, and if Mayeaux needed any rehabilitating, she satisfied that need herself. When defense counsel asked Mayeaux if she had identified Weeks in the courtroom from his photographs in the newspaper, she replied: \u201cI identified him by seeing him up close for eight-and-a-half hours.\u201d The exchange between the district court and Mayeaux produced no inflammatory or prejudicial remarks. Finally, the <em>Allsup </em>court remanded for a new trial not only for the improper intervention of the trial court, but also for inadequacy of voir dire on the question of insanity and the failure to excuse two jurors for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-24\">Weeks also proffers <em>United States v. Bland, </em>697 F.2d 262 (8th Cir.1983), as requiring reversal. In that case, however, the trial court interrupted defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of two government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>witnesses and took over cross-examination of two defense witnesses. All of the judicial interrogation tended \u201cto emphasize and accentuate the prosecution\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 265. Upon return of the verdict, the judge informed the jury that he also believed the defendant to be guilty. This admittedly partisan stance, compounded by other evidence in the record, is a far cry from the single incident of partisanship alleged to have deprived Weeks of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">The district court\u2019s final instructions to the jury also support the conclusion that the court maintained neutrality. <em>See Williams, </em>809 F.2d at 1088. The court instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-5\">During the course of the trial I occasionally ask questions of a witness in regard to bring out the facts not then fully discovered in the testimony. Once again, do not assume that I hold any opinion on the matters to which my questions may have related. Remember at all times you as jurors are at liberty to disregard all comments of the Court in arriving at your own findings as to the facts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Given this admonition, coming after a single exercise of the district court\u2019s authority to question a witness and clarify facts previously presented, the district court did not overstep the bounds of acceptable judicial conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">UPPER BODY PHOTOGRAPH</p>\n<p id=\"AvPa\">Weeks next argues that the district court erred in admitting into evidence an upper body photograph of Weeks that showed \u201cdevil tattoos and a massive jagged scar.\u201d In her testimony for the government, kidnap victim Karyn Laccheo recalled seeing a panther tattoo and a snake tattoo on Weeks\u2019 left and right arms respectively. The photograph in question was relevant to show that Weeks did indeed have a panther tattoo on his left arm; however, it was also cumulative because Weeks was allowed to bare his arm before the jury. Accordingly, Weeks claims that the court should have excluded the photograph under Fed.R.Evid. 403, which allows the court to exclude relevant evidence \u201cif its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\u201d We review the court\u2019s decision to admit the photograph for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Cochran, </em>697 F.2d 600, 608 (5th Cir.1983). In this case, although we might not have admitted this photograph because it was cumulative of Weeks\u2019s physical demonstration, we do not find the photograph so inflammatory as to have significantly prejudiced the jury. The court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-10\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-11\">FIREARM DISPLAY</p>\n<p id=\"b355-12\">Weeks next contends that the district court erred in allowing the government to display a firearm to the jury even though it was not connected to Weeks. We agree with the government that the court did not abuse its discretion in permitting the display. Two of the six crimes charged in the indictment involved a firearm. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1) (use of a firearm in relation to a crime of violence); 18 U.s.c. App. II, \u00a7 1202(a)(1) (now repealed) (possession of a firearm by a convicted felon). Although the revolver was not the actual firearm used by the defendant, it belonged to a government firearms expert and was identified by kidnap victim Mayeaux as looking similar to the weapon that Weeks took from the trunk of her car and used during the offenses. The court did not admit the firearm into evidence-which would have allowed the jury to examine it during deliberations-but allowed it to be displayed for \"demonstrative purposes only.\" Finally, the court instructed the jury that the revolver they had seen was merely a model similar to the one used in the crime. Weeks also claims that the government displayed the weapon in an inflammatory manner that unfairly prejudiced him. At trial, defense counsel objected because the prosecutor \"clicked [the gun] and tried it again, emphasizing the use of it. It inflames the jury panel. I would object to him trying to point the gun and play with the handle, and he clicks it so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>it\u2019s that much more intimidating.\u201d The prosecutor disputed this characterization, stating that \u201c[t]he gun\u2019s chamber was open. The barrel was open, Your Honor. As I walked toward the witness, the barrel closed.\u201d The court responded: \"Next time keep it closed.\u201d From the cold record, we are unable to determine what actually happened, but the district court evidently accepted the government\u2019s version. The firearm display does not constitute reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">GOVERNMENT MISCONDUCT (FIRST TRIAL)</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">Weeks next claims that the charges against him must be dismissed because government misconduct prejudiced his defense in violation of the due process clause. During the first trial, the government investigated Weeks\u2019 defense counsel for witness tampering and obstruction of justice. <em>See generally United States v. Weeks, </em>870 F.2d 267, 268 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 110 S.Ct. 92, 107 L.Ed.2d 57 (1989) <em>(Weeks I). </em>When the investigation came to light, the district court granted a mistrial without prejudice to the refiling of charges. Weeks now seeks dismissal with prejudice, claiming that his is \u201ca situation in which the conduct of law enforcement agents is so outrageous that due process principles would absolutely bar the government from invoking judicial processes.\u201d <em>United States v. Russell, </em>411 U.S. 423, 431-32, 93 S.Ct. 1637, 1642-43, 36 L.Ed.2d 366 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">We reject this claim. Although the district court found the government\u2019s investigation of defense counsel \u201cmost questionable conduct\" and our court characterized it as \u201cill-advised,\u201d <em>Weeks I, </em>870 F.2d at 270 n. 1, the investigation did not rise to the level of \u201coutrageous\u201d or \u201cshocking to the universal sense of justice,\u201d <em>Russell, </em>411 U.S. at 432, 93 S.Ct. at 1643. In addition, a defendant must show actual prejudice to his ability to receive a fair trial before charges will be dismissed. <em>See United States v. Morrison, </em>449 U.S. 361, 365-66, 101 S.Ct. 665, 668-69, 66 L.Ed.2d 564 (1981) (law enforcement interference with right to counsel); <em>United States v. McKenzie, </em>678 F.2d 629, 631 (5th Cir.) (prosecutorial misconduct in procuring indictment), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 1038, 103 S.Ct. 450, 74 L.Ed.2d 604 (1982). Weeks alleges prejudice because the government \u201ctook advantage of its misconduct in the first trial to remedy its case in the second trial.\u201d Our court previously upheld the district court\u2019s finding that the government did not intentionally provoke a mistrial, stating: \u201cit appears that the prosecution\u2019s case was proceeding quite satisfactorily. The inconsistencies mentioned by appellant suggest minor glitches in the otherwise detailed, powerful, and apparently credible testimony of the victims in this case.\u201d <em>Weeks 1, </em>870 F.2d at 269. This suffices to rebut Weeks\u2019 latest allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-11\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-12\">GOVERNMENT MISCONDUCT (SECOND TRIAL)</p>\n<p id=\"b356-13\">Weeks finally claims that his convictions must be reversed because of the government\u2019s continued misconduct at his second trial. He alleges that the prosecutors repeatedly denigrated him and his defense counsel, alluded to evidence not adduced at trial, and played upon the passions of the jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-14\">Our review of these allegations, and the context in which they arose at trial, reveals an unconnected jumble of minor infractions by the prosecution. Our standard of review is exacting. The court must \u201cconsider whether the prosecutor\u2019s comments deprived defendants of a fair trial in light of ... the magnitude of the prejudicial effect of the statements, the efficacy of any cautionary instructions, and the strength of the evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt.\u201d <em>United States v. Jones, </em>839 F.2d 1041, 1050 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>486 U.S. 1024, 108 S.Ct. 1999, 100 L.Ed.2d 230 (1988); <em>see also United States v. Lowenberg, </em>853 F.2d 295, 302 (5th Cir.1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>489 U.S. 1032, 109 S.Ct. 1170, 103 L.Ed.2d 228 (1989). Cautionary instructions were promptly given in response to defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>counsel s objections to the government\u2019s remarks. Such instructions, plus the strength of the government\u2019s case as we alluded to it in <em>Weeks I, </em>870 F.2d at 269, convince us that any errors by the government were harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the district court and sustain Weeks\u2019 convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
