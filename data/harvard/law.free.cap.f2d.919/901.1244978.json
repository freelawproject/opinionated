Moore appeals the district court\u2019s judgment denying him disability benefits under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423. Moore argues that the district court erred in holding that there is substantial evidence to support the Secretary\u2019s determination that he is not disabled. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-20\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-21\">On March 15, 1987, Moore suffered an apparent heart attack at about the age of fifty-three. He was diagnosed with coronary ischemia and on March 25, he underwent a triple coronary artery bypass operation. The operation was performed by Dr. John DiGiglia, who noted that Moore\u2019s \u201cpost-operative course was essentially uneventful.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-22\">On June 5, 1987, Moore underwent a stress test, administered by Dr. Michael C. Turner, his cardiologist at the time of his surgery, which showed that he had \u201cnormal exercise capacity.\u201d On August 1, when Moore attempted to return to his job as a welder, however, he experienced chest pains and quit after working only half a day. On August 27, he filed his claim for disability benefits. On October 21, 1987, Moore was examined by Dr. John H. Saba-tier at the request of the Social Security Administration. Dr. Sabatier noted that Moore\u2019s electrocardiogram was normal, and he experienced \u201cno true angina.\u201d Sa-batier, however, stated that Moore has \u201csuspected vascular disease involving at least the right upper extremity ...\u201d and was unable to rule out the possibility of a right carotid bruit; additionally, he noted that Moore was suffering from \u201cmoderately severe anxiety depressive symptomatolo-gy-\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-23\">On November 3, 1987, Moore was again admitted to the hospital complaining of chest pain and numbness and tingling in his left arm and leg. Dr. H.B. Lovejoy, his family physician, diagnosed him as having a right carotid aneurysm. On November 5, 1987, Dr. Lovejoy concluded from a stress test he performed on Moore that the plaintiff suffered from a slight limitation of his left ventricular function. On November 9, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>1987, Drs. A.K. Seale and Walter Ledet operated on Moore to remove the aneurysm. Dr. Ledet noted that Moore did \u201cquite well\u201d after the surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-4\">On November 22, 1987, Moore went to a hospital emergency room complaining of severe headaches, cervical pain, and numbness and tingling in his left arm and leg. An x-ray revealed \u201csome minimal degenerative disc disease.\u201d Dr. Ledet diagnosed him as having a transischemic attack and sought to rule out the possibility of a cervical cord compression. He discharged Moore on November 25, 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">On January 5, 1988, Dr. Seale noted that \u201cnumerous evaluations\u201d of Moore concerning his complaints of \u201cheadaches associated with different types of pain both in the chest, and left arm, and the left leg\u201d had \u201cfailed to come up with any significant physical findings.\u201d Additionally, extensive x-rays had \u201cfailed to show any significant abnormalities.\u201d Dr. Seale noted, however, that Dr. Lovejoy \u201chas seen [Moore] regarding his chest pain and has done treadmill EKGs ...\u201d and could be referred to concerning his \u201cmyocardial status.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-6\">On January 19, 1988, Dr. Lovejoy noted that he had last seen Moore on December 8, 1987, at which time Moore complained of numbness, tingling, and loss of strength in his left hand. An MRI, however, had \u201cfailed to reveal any significant abnormality.\u201d Lovejoy reviewed the results of Moore\u2019s stress test on November 5, 1987, concluding that Moore \u201clikely ... has failure of the left ventricular function and therefore is unable to exercise.\u201d He observed further that Moore \u201cstill seems to me to be unable to work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-7\">On June 13, 1988, Dr. DiGiglia noted that Moore \u201cshould not have any long-term disability from his surgical procedure\u201d but referred questions concerning Moore\u2019s \u201cpossible disability from his status post-myocardial infarction and generalized hardening of the arteries\u201d to Dr. Michael C. Turner. On June 16, 1988, Lovejoy noted that, like Dr. Seale, he was unable to explain Moore\u2019s complaints of numbness and tingling and loss of strength in his left hand and that an MRI had revealed no significant abnormalities in the brain.\u201d Lovejoy recommended further evaluation of Moore\u2019s ailments, but stated that, in his opinion, Moore was unable to work \u201cbecause of a combination of problems including his coronary bypass surgery and his undiagnosed left arm and left leg numbness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-9\">On August 12, 1988, Dr. G.R. Morin, a psychiatrist, diagnosed Moore as suffering from a \u201c[djepressive reaction, mild to moderate.\u201d He noted that Moore suffered \u201cno impairment in his ability to relate to others ... no constriction of his interests ... and no deterioration in his personal habits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-10\">At the hearing before the ALJ on July 20, 1988, Moore stated that he was told by his doctors not to lift more than ten pounds. He also indicated that he occasionally went fishing with friends, drove to the store to pick up groceries, and walked outside.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-11\">On October 5, 1988, the ALJ concluded that Rules 202.10 and 202.11 of the Appendix 2 of the Secretary\u2019s regulations directed a finding that Moore was not disabled. On February 23, 1989, the Appeals Council declined to review the decision of the AU.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-12\">On March 6, 1989, Moore filed suit against the Secretary in district court. Both parties filed motions for summary judgment and memoranda in support of these motions. On September 29, 1989, a magistrate recommended that the district court hold that Moore was not disabled. On November 22, 1989, the district court adopted the findings and recommendations of the magistrate and entered judgment for the Secretary. Moore timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-14\">On appeal, Moore argues that the ALJ\u2019s decision that he was not disabled is unsupported by substantial evidence. He argues that the medical evidence indicates that he is disabled and, thus, the Secretary failed to prove the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-15\">The Social Security Act defines \u201cdisability\u201d as \u201cinability to engage in <em>any </em>substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>pairment which can be expected to result in death, or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than twelve months.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(1)(A) (emphasis added). A physical or mental impairment is \u201can impairment that results from anatomical, physiological or psychological abnormalities which are demonstrable by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-3\">Regulations set forth by the Secretary provide that disability claims should be evaluated according to a sequential five-step process. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520 (1986). Step five of that process is at issue in this case. Under step five, once a claimant has proved he is unable to perform his past work because of a severe impairment, in order to establish disability the Secretary must prove that the claimant is nevertheless able to perform other \u201csubstantial gainful work which exists in the national economy.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(2)(A); <em>Herron v. Bowen, </em>788 F.2d 1127, 1131 (5th Cir.1986). This determination requires consideration of the claimant\u2019s residual functional capacity, age, education, and past work experience and the application of the Medical-Vocational Guidelines. Section 404.1520(f)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-4\">After reviewing the medical evidence in this case, the AU concluded that, although Moore suffered a severe impairment resulting from heart disease and degenerative disc disease and was, therefore, unable to return to his work as a welder, he was capable of performing \u201clight work.\u201d Pursuant to the Social Security Administration\u2019s regulations, the AU then applied the Medical-Vocational Guidelines. Under Rules 202.10 and 202.11 of the guidelines, a claimant with Moore\u2019s profile (fifty-three years of age at the time he filed his claim, sixth grade education, and unskilled or semi-skilled but with nontransferable skills), who is capable of performing light work is to be adjudged not disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-7\">We review the AU\u2019s decision to determine whether it is \u201csupported by substantial evidence and whether the proper legal standards were used in evaluating the evidence.\u201d <em>Villa v. Sullivan, </em>895 F.2d 1019, 1021 (5th Cir.1990). We have held that \u201c[substantial evidence is more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Hames v. Heckler, </em>707 F.2d 162, 164 (5th Cir.1983). Although we must review the entire record, we may not reweigh the evidence or substitute our judgment for the Secretary\u2019s. <em>Hollis v. Bowen, </em>837 F.2d 1378, 1383 (5th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-8\">Applying this standard, we hold that there is substantial evidence in the record to support the AU\u2019s determination that Moore was capable of doing light work.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In his Bruce protocol stress test that was administered by Dr. Turner, a cardiologist, on June 5, 1987, less than three months after his coronary bypass surgery, Moore achieved 10.1 METs, a rate we have held is \u201cmore than enough\u201d for the performance of light work.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Harrell v. Bowen, </em>862 F.2d 471, 481 (5th Cir.1988). At his hearing before the AU, Moore further attested to his capacity to perform light work, stating that he occasionally went fishing with friends, drove to the store to pick up groceries, and walked outside; he also confirmed that he was not restricted by his doctors from lifting up to ten pounds.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1007-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>To be sure, as Moore argues, Dr. H.B. Lovejoy, one of his treating physicians, stated that he believed Moore was \u201cunable to work\u201d; he based this opinion, in part, on a stress test he administered to Moore on November 5,1987. We have held that \u201cordinarily the opinions, diagnoses, and medical evidence of a treating physician who is familiar with the claimant\u2019s injuries, treatment, and responses should be accorded considerable weight in determining disability.\u201d <em>Scott v. Heckler, </em>770 F.2d 482, 485 (5th Cir.1985). Yet, the ALJ has sole responsibility for determining a claimant\u2019s disability status. In doing so, the AU \u201cis entitled to determine the credibility of medical experts as well as lay witnesses and to weigh their opinions and testimony accordingly.\u201d <em>Scott, </em>770 F.2d at 485. Generally, a specialist\u2019s opinion is to be accorded greater weight than a non-specialist\u2019s opinion. <em>Dorsey v. Heckler, </em>702 F.2d 597, 603 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-4\">In his opinion, the AU duly noted that Dr. Lovejoy, a general physician whose specialties include occupational and internal medicine, stated that in his opinion Moore was unable to work \u201cbecause of a combination of problems including coronary bypass surgery and his undiagnosed left arm and left leg numbness.\u201d Dr. Lovejoy did not explain whether he was referring to Moore\u2019s previous work as a welder or just any work generally. The AU specifically weighed Dr. Lovejoy\u2019s general opinion against the opinions and diagnoses of two specialists, Dr. DiGiglia, the cardiovascular surgeon who performed Moore\u2019s coronary bypass operation, and Dr. A.K. Seale, the general surgeon who removed Moore\u2019s carotid aneurysm. Dr. DiGiglia stated that Moore should not have any long-term disability from his coronary bypass operation; Dr. Seale noted that, after \u201cnumerous evaluations,\u201d neither he nor Dr. J.F. Raggio, a neurosurgeon, was able to explain Moore\u2019s complaints of headaches associated with chest pain and left arm and left leg numbness. Although it is true that the AU does not address the stress test administered by Dr. Lovejoy, the stress test administered by Dr. Turner, the cardiologist, only five months earlier is strong evidence that Moore was able to perform not only light work, but his regular work as a welder. After evaluating the foregoing evidence, the AU concluded that Moore was capable of performing light work. As indicated, we may not substitute our judgment for that of the Secretary\u2019s.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1007-7\">We, therefore, conclude that under the appropriate standard of review, substantial evidence supports the Secretary\u2019s decision; that is, a reasonable mind could accept from the record as a whole that Moore was capable of performing light work.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1006-5\">.Light work involves lifting no more than twenty pounds at a time with frequent lifting or carrying of objects weighing up to ten pounds. Even though the weight lifted may be very little, a job is in this category when it requires a good deal of walking or standing, or when it involves sitting most Of the time with some pushing and pulling of arm or leg controls. To be considered capable of performing a full or wide range of light work, you must have the ability to do substantially all of these activities. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1567(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1006-9\">. An individual who achieves greater than nine METs is theoretically capable of carrying objects in excess of ninety pounds and performing the work of a lumberjack and heavy laborer. <em>See Cardiac Rehabilitation, </em>ed. by Louis R. Amundsen p. 26 (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1006-10\">. According to Moore, the restrictions imposed upon him by his doctors constantly changed, tn his Disability Report, which he signed on August 27, 1987, Moore stated that he was told by his doctors not to do any straining or lifting. In his Reconsideration Disability Report, how<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>ever, which he signed on December 1, 1987, Moore stated that he was restricted by his doctors from lifting more than five pounds. As indicated, before the ALJ, Moore stated that he was restricted from lifting more than ten pounds. The medical reports of Moore\u2019s doctors, however, fail to indicate that they imposed any such restrictions on Moore\u2019s activities. Rather, Dr. DiGiglia stated that in May 1987, following Moore\u2019s coronary bypass surgery, he told the claimant to \"increase his activities.\u201d Additionally, Dr. Seale stated that, upon Moore\u2019s discharge from the hospital following the surgery to remove the carotid aneurysm, he was \"given routine instructions regarding diet, activity, and at-home care.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1007-13\">. Moreover, we note that the weight of Dr. Love-joy's opinion concerning Moore\u2019s inability to work was minimized by his statement in his final report on June 16, 1988, that \"further evaluation\u201d was necessary to determine the cause of Moore\u2019s complaints of headaches and chest pain.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
