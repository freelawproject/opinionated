Code, \u00a7 15000) and as permitted by Govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>ment Code sections 11180<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and 15006,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> commenced an investigation of \u201cAnti-competitive and/or fraudulent activities in the carnival industry in the State of California.\u201d (Hereafter all statutory citations will, unless specially noted, be to Government Code.)</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">Among the subjects of the investigation were appellants B-Jan Amusement Corporation and West Coast Shows, Incorporated. Pursuant to section 11181<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the Attorney General caused to be served upon each of them a subpoena duces tecum directing production of certain designated documents, books, records, and papers. The service was effected by hand delivery to Robert H. Cohn who was president of both corporations. The corporations failed to appear at the designated time and place. This resulted in ex parte applications to the superior court under sections 11186,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 11187,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and 11188,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> by which the corporations were ordered to show cause why <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>they should not be required to conform to the demands of the subpoenas duces tecum. Service of the orders to show cause was made on Mr. Cohn as president of the corporations, but again they failed to respond. This resulted in the entry of orders on December 22, 1967, directing each corporation to \u201cappear before the Attorney General of the State of California' or his duly authorized representative at Room 6000 State Building, San Francisco, California, on the 8th day of January, 1968, at the hour of 10:00 a.m. or at such other time and place as may be mutually agreed upon prior to January 8, 1968, then and there to produce the documents, books, records, papers and other items designated in Exhibit \u2018A\u2019 to the Subpoena Duces Tecum.\u201d These are the orders from which the corporations have appealed. The appeals have been consolidated for hearing and disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">From the record and briefs before us it appears that the appeals must be dismissed for the reason that they are now moot, the subject orders having been set aside by the superior court.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Following entry of the orders of December 22, 1967, notices of appeal were filed therefrom on February 9, 1968. Thereafter in each proceeding and on March 18, 1968, the superior court found that the orders of December 22, 1967, \u201ccompelling [appellants] to attend and produce certain documents before the Attorney General of the State of California [were] improperly issued and therefore unenforceable in that neither the record of this proceeding, as of December 22, 1967, nor the order[s] of this court of December 22, 1967, recited proper service of the Order[s] to Show Cause' and related documents on which the December 22, 1967 order[s are] based.\u201d It was thereupon \u201cOrdered, Adjudged and Decreed . . . that the order[s] of this court of December 22, 1967, having been improperly issued, [are] set aside and without further effect. This order is entered without prejudice to petitioner herein applying to this court for . . . new order[s] compelling production of any documents previously subpoenaed herein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">The above described March 18, 1968 orders were entered as a result of the successful insistence of counsel for appellants\u2019 president Robert H. Cohn (who are counsel for appellants on this appeal) on contempt proceedings held February 2 and 9, 1968, that the December 22, 1967 orders were beyond the court\u2019s jurisdiction and therefore void and unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>The contentions were based upon the absence from the court\u2019s records, at the time the orders were made, of any proof of service of the antecedent orders to show cause (required by \u00a7 11188, see fn. 6, <em>ante) </em>upon the subject corporations.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">On these appeals, and for the same reasons urged in the superior court on Mr. Cohn\u2019s contempt proceedings, appellants insist that the appealed from orders of December 22, 1967, were beyond the superior court\u2019s jurisdiction and therefore void and unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">The above described orders of March 18, 1968, setting aside the orders here under appeal, are now final. Obviously then, appellants are in no way \u201caggrieved\u201d by the earlier orders and their appeals have become moot.  One who is not aggrieved by a decision of the lower court has no right of appeal therefrom. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 902, formerly \u00a7 938; <em>Radunich </em>v. <em>Basso, </em>235 Cal.App.2d 826, 829-830 [45 Cal.Rptr. 824]; <em>Daniel-son </em>v. <em>Stokes, </em>214 Cal.App.2d 234, 237 [29 Cal.Rptr. 489]; <em>Lamb </em>v. <em>Belt Cas. Co., </em>3 Cal.App.2d 624, 634 [40 P.2d 311].) And of course an appeal which has become moot is subject to dismissal. <em>(Paul </em>v. <em>Milk Depots, Inc., </em>62 Cal.2d 129, 132 [41 Cal.Rptr. 468, 396 P.2d 924].)</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">Nevertheless, appellants contend that the March 18, 1968 orders \u201csetting aside\u201d the orders which are the subject of this appeal were invalid because of Code of Civil Procedure section 946 (since reenacted in substance as Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 916) which stayed \u201cfurther proceedings in the court below upon the order appealed from.\u201d But the rule of former Code of Civil Procedure section 946 is subject to this well recognized exception: \u201c[A] court may set aside a void order at any time. An appeal will not prevent the court from at any time lopping off what has been termed a dead limb on the judicial tree\u2014a void order.\u201d <em>(Macmillan Petroleum Corp. </em>v. <em>Griffin, 99 </em>Cal.App.2d 523, 533 [222 P.2d 69]; see also <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>241 Cal.App.2d 93, 98-99 [50 Cal.Rptr. 408]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Blume, </em>183 Cal.App.2d 474, 477-478 [7 Cal.Rptr. 16]; <em>Pacific Hardware &amp; Steel Co. </em>v. <em>Cheim, </em>169 Cal.App.2d 339, 343-344 [337 P.2d 508]; <em>Batte </em>v. <em>Bandy, </em>165 Cal.App.2d 527, 538 [332 P.2d 439]; <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>152 Cal.App.2d 677, 680-681 [313 P.2d 212].)</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">\u201c 'Tt is well settled that a judgment or order which is void on its face, and which requires only an inspection of the judgment-roll or record to show its invalidity, may be set aside on motion at any time after its entry, by the court which rendered the judgment or made the order. . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>(Hayashi </em>v. <em>Lorenz, </em>42 Cal.2d 848, 851 [271 P.2d 18].) It may be set aside on the court\u2019s own motion <em>(Montgomery </em>v. <em>Norman, </em>120 Cal.App.2d 855, 858 [262 P.2d 360]), and by a judge other than the one who made it <em>(Myers </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>211 Cal.App.2d 767, 771 [27 Cal.Rptr. 778]; <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>113 Cal.App.2d 453, 455 [248 P.2d 122]).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>We are unimpressed by appellants\u2019 argument that although the orders here under appeal are in fact void, nevertheless in determining the validity of the appeals the same orders must be deemed valid. As was said in <em>Alexander </em>v. <em>Hammarberg, </em>103 Cal.App.2d 872, 879 [230 P.2d 399], \u201cThese two positions are entirely inconsistent. The courts will not recognize nor tolerate such tactics. A party may not thus \u2018blow hot and cold.\u2019 \u201d (See also <em>Kirk </em>v. <em>Rutherford, </em>137 Cal.App.2d 681, 683 [290 P.2d 883]; <em>Schulze </em>v. <em>Schulze, </em>121 Cal.App.2d 75, 83 [262 P.2d 646]; <em>Conlin </em>v. <em>Southern Pac. </em>R.R. <em>Co., </em>40 Cal.App. 743, 747 [182 P. 71].)</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">In their briefs appellants make a broad constitutional attack on the pertinent provisions of the Government Code and the manner in which the Attorney General has attempted to give them effect. All parties to the appeal appear to wish a decision on these questions. While such wishes are not necessarily controlling where an appeal is subject to dismissal, it appears to us that such a decision on the issues raised would here be in the public interest. The Attorney General\u2019s investigation of the carnival industry has now been stymied for almost three years. Another attempt to subpoena appellants\u2019 records has been held up in the superior court pending a decision on the constitutional questions here raised. If the instant appeal is dismissed without consideration of its issues, similar proceedings and similar appeals will undoubtedly follow with consequent additional delays.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">It is now established law that where, as in the cases at bench, issues on appeal affect the general public interest and the future rights of the parties, and there is reasonable probability that the same questions will again be litigated and appealed, an appellate court may, although the appeal be subject to dismissal, nevertheless adjudicate the issues involved. (See <em>Eye Dog Foundation </em>v. <em>State Board of Guide Dogs for the Blind, 67 </em>Cal.2d 536, 542 [63 Cal.Rptr. 21, 432 P.2d 717]; <em>County of Madera </em>v. <em>Gendron, </em>59 Cal.2d 798, 804 [31 Cal.Rptr. 302, 382 P.2d 342, 6 A.L.R. 3d 555]; <em>Di Giorgio Fruit Corp. </em>v. <em>Department of Employment, </em>56 Cal.2d 54, 58-59 [13 Cal.Rptr. 663, 362 P.2d 487]; <em>Department of Agriculture </em>v. <em>Tide Oil Co., 269 </em>Cal.App.2d 145, 150-151 [74 Cal.Rptr. 799]; <em>Kirstowsky v</em>. <em>Superior Court, </em>143 Cal.App.2d 745, 749 [300 P.2d 163]; <em>Rattray </em>v. <em>Scudder, 67 </em>Cal.App.2d 123, 127-128 [153 P.2d 433].)</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">We therefore choose to pass upon such of the issues raised by appellants as are likely to be of future recurrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">The Attorney General did not, in connection with the issuance and service of the subject section 11181 subpoenas duces tecum, make the \u201cgood cause\u201d showing, i.e., the relevancy and materiality of the matter sought to be produced, by affidavit as provided in Code of Civil Procedure sections <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>1985<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and 2036.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Appellants contend that this is a Fourth Amendment deficiency giving to the subject process the nature of the abhorrent \u201cGeneral Warrant,\u201d \u201cGeneral Search\u201d and \u201cWrit of Assistance\u201d of early American history.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">Code of Civil Procedure sections 1985 and 2036 apply to proceedings of a <em>judicial </em>nature. Section 1985 refers to \u201capplications before trial for a subpoena duces tecum\u201d; section 2036 requires that its showing of \u201cgood cause\u201d and \u201cany showing made in opposition thereto shall be made in the trial court . . . .\u201d The requirements of those sections tend to prevent an abuse of discovery and to guard against Fourth Amendment and other constitutional encroachment. The party seeking such production of documents by subpoena duces tecum is required to make a showing of the necessary materiality and relevancy at the time he secures the subpoena. Accordingly it has been consistently held that before a subpoena duces tecum may issue under Code of Civil Procedure section 1985 the party seeking it must show \u201cthat the documents sought to be produced for inspection will aid in his case\u201d thus enabling the trial court to make \u201can informed ruling on the issues of good cause.\u201d <em>(Associated Brewers Distributing Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>65 Cal.2d 583, 586-587 [55 Cal.Rptr. 772, 422 P.2d 332].) The showing must be of specific facts justifying discovery <em>(Johnson </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>258 Cal.App.2d 829, 836 [66 Cal.Rptr. 134]), the test being whether the material sought to be discovered is \u201c(1) relevant to the subject matter, (2) material to the issues and (3) needed for effective prepara<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>tion for trial.\u201d <em>(Elmore </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>255 Cal.App.2d 635, 638-639 [63 Cal.Rptr. 307].)</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">On the other hand sections 11180-11191 relate not to <em>judicial proceedings </em>but instead to statutorily permitted <em>investigations </em>in which the court ordinarily plays no part. <em>Brovelli </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1961) 56 Cal.2d 524, 529 [15 Cal.Rptr. 630, 364 P.2d 462], a case also concerned with sections 11180-11191, states: \u201cAs has been said by the United States Supreme Court, the power to make administrative inquiry is not derived from a judicial function but is more analogous to the power of a grand jury, which does not depend on a case or controversy in order to get evidence but can investigate \u2018merely on suspicion that the law is being violated, or even just because it wants assurance that it is not.5 <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Morton Salt Co., </em>338 U.S. 632, 642-643 [70 S.Ct. 357, 94 L.Ed. 401].)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">To accomplish this investigative purpose, an entirely different legislative scheme was developed. Adequate safeguards against constitutional deprival or other abuse of process are provided. <em>Brovelli </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>recites (p. 529): \u201cInsofar as the prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures can be said to apply at all it requires only that the inquiry be one which the agency demanding production is authorized to make, that the demand be not too indefinite, and that the information sought be reasonably relevant.\u201d The requirement that the information sought be \u201creasonably relevant,\u201d of course means reasonably relevant to the intended investigation, not to any judicial issues or hearing. If a person affected by the Government Code process shall believe that <em>Brovelli\u2019s </em>requirements are not met, without contempt or other penalty he need not respond. Thereupon the investigating agency is obliged, on an order to show cause, to arrange a superior court hearing at which conformity of the subpoena duces tecum to constitutional and legal standards may be judicially tested. (\u00a7\u00a7 11187, 11188; see fns. 5 and 6 <em>ante.) </em>Thus, the Government Code provides an opportunity for adjudication of all claimed constitutional and legal rights before one is required to obey the command of a subpoena duces tecum issued for investigative purposes. This is an equivalent, if not greater, measure of constitutional protection to that afforded in judicial proceedings under Code of Civil Procedure sections 1985 and 2036.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Accordingly we hold that failure to follow Code of Civil Procedure sections 1985 and 2036, or some similar practice, does not render proceedings under Government Code sections 11180-11191 constitutionally invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">We advert now to the remaining constitutional issues raised by appellants. They insist that sections 11180-11191 contravene the Fourth Amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>ment, the \u201cdue process\u201d clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and the corresponding provisions of the Constitution of this state (art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 13, 19).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">The same Fourth Amendment contention was made to, and rejected by, the California Supreme Court in <em>Brovelli </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>56 Cal.2d 524. Reviewing the statutes with which we are here concerned (\u00a7\u00a7 11180-11191), the court found no constitutional fault. It was pointed out (p. 529) that where, as here, \u201cthe records of a corporation are the object of a subpena, the situation differs from one where the private papers of an individual are sought. Neither the corporation nor a person having custody of its records can refuse to produce them on the basis of the privilege against self-incrimination. <em>(Wilson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>221 U.S. 361, 377 et seq. [55 L.Ed. 771, 778, 31 S.Ct. 538]; see <em>Curcio </em>v. <em>United States, </em>354 U.S. 118, 122 [1 L.Ed.2d 1225, 1228-1229, 77 S.Ct. 1145].) Insofar as the prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures can be said to apply at all it requires only that the inquiry be one which the agency demanding production is authorized to make, that the demand be not too indefinite, and that the information sought be reasonably relevant. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Morton Salt Co., supra, </em>338 U.S. 632, 651-654 [94 L.Ed. 401, 415-417]; <em>Oklahoma Press Pub. Co. </em>v. <em>Walling, </em>327 U.S. 186, 202 et seq. [90 L.Ed. 614, 625, 66 S.Ct. 494, 166 A.L.R. 531].)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">While appellants dispute the reasoning and authority of <em>Brovelli, </em>we as an intermediate appellate court are bound by that decision. <em>(Auto Equity Sales, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>57 Cal.2d 450, 455 [20 Cal.Rptr. 321, 369 P.2d 937]; <em>Orange County Water Dist. </em>v. <em>City of Riverside, </em>173 Cal.App. 2d 137, 165 [343 P.2d 450].) We apply it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">The claimed \u201cdue process\u201d shortcoming of the statute is not pointed out or argued by appellants in their briefs and may, therefore, be considered abandoned. <em>(Estate of Lee, </em>225 Cal.App.2d 578, 582 [37 Cal.Rptr. 572].) They do comment that many of the first 10 amendments \u201care so basically declarative of justice and fair dealing that they have been included by the Supreme Court in the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and are now binding on the states.\u201d With this, of course, we agree. But we find no \u201cdue process\u201d deprivation in the subject statute; and as we have pointed out ample provision for notice and hearing is provided before one\u2019s papers may be exposed by the \u201cinvestigative\u201d subpoena duces tecum.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">As there is little probability that other issues posed by appellants will recur in the future, we do not consider them.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">For the reasons stated the appeals are dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-9\">Molinari, P.
