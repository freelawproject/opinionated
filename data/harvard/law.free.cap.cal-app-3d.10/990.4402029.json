Plaintiff and the insurance carrier appeal, separately, from the second judgment. The record<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> shows the following facts:</p>\n<p id=\"b943-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"993\">*993</page-number>Albert Patterson, while on the job on April 15, 1965, received an injury which caused his death on July 18 of the same year. The injury having been covered by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act (Lab. Code, div. 4 [commencing with \u00a7 3201]) and insured against by his employer in compliance therewith, an appropriate workmen\u2019s compensation proceeding was commenced. In March, 1967, this proceeding resulted in an award of the following benefits payable by the decedent\u2019s employer\u2019s workmen\u2019s compensation insurance carrier: (1) a death benefit in the amount of $17,500, payable to the widow from and after July 18, 1965, at the rate of $70 per week (less her attorney\u2019s fees, fixed in the award at $850), (2) \u201c[b]urial expenses in the amount of $600.00,\u201d (3) the decedent\u2019s \u201cself-procured medical expenses\u201d and (4) temporary disability payments, for the period between the dates of the decedent\u2019s injury and his death, \u201cless credit for any sums theretofore [fi'c] paid on account thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">In February 1966, the widow (hereinafter \u201cplaintiff\u201d) also brought this negligence action, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 377 (see fn. 11, <em>post) </em>and against defendant as a third party tortfeasor, seeking damages for the decedent\u2019s allegedly wrongful death. In her complaint, she pleaded and prayed general damages in the amount of $200,000 for the loss of the decedent\u2019s \u201ccare, comfort, society, protection and support,\u201d plus \u201creasonable funeral and burial expenses.\u201d In his answer, defendant pleaded among other things that concurrent negligence on the part of the decedent\u2019s employer was a proximate cause of the death.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-6\">In January 1968, pursuant to Labor Code section 3853, the employer\u2019s insurance carrier was permitted to intervene in the action relative to certain payments it had made, and was still making, in compliance with the workmen\u2019s compensation award made in March 1967. (We hereinafter refer to the insurance carrier as \u201cintervener.\u201d) Answering the complaint in intervention, defendant again pleaded that the negligence of the decedent\u2019s employer had been a proximate cause of the decedent\u2019s injury and the damages sustained therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-7\">At the time of intervention, the total amount expended by intervener pursuant to the 1967 workmen\u2019s compensation award was $12,934.04. The complaint in intervention, seeking recovery of this amount from defendant, alleged chat its components were $2,901.90 in medical expenses, $332.14 paid as \u201cdisability indemnity,\u201d and $9,700 paid in death benefits; it also prayed recovery of death benefits to be paid in the future. When plaintiff\u2019s action came to jury trial three months later (in April 1968), continuing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"994\">*994</page-number>payments of death benefits to plaintiff had increased the total amount of intervener\u2019s expenditures to $14,404.04. There was, at the trial, a stipulation that intervener had paid out the latter amount, but the stipulation did not include an itemization thereof.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">The jury was instructed concerning the measure of plaintiff\u2019s general wrongful-death damages, if any, and of her special damages, if any, representing the decedent\u2019s funeral and burial expenses.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The trial court also instructed the jurors that, if they found for plaintiff, they were to fix the damages \u201cwithout regard to the amount of . . . compensation benefits paid to or for the plaintiff\u201d and to \u201crender one figure as to the total amount of damages\u201d; and that the court would \u201cdo\u201d any \u201cdeducting\u201d required if they should find, in response to a special interrogatory submitted to them, concurrent negligence on the part of the decedent\u2019s employer. No other instructions on damages were given.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">The jury returned a verdict for $35,000, in favor of plaintiff and against defendant. (According to the stipulated facts in the agreed statement on appeal, the verdict was \u201csupported in all respects by substantial evidence.\u201d) In response to the special interrogatory, the jury further found that the decedent\u2019s employer had been concurrently negligent, and that such negligence was a proximate cause of the wrongful death.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-6\">Judgment having been entered on the jury verdict, defendant moved the trial court for an order reducing its amount by the full sum ($17,500)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"995\">*995</page-number>the workmen\u2019s compensation death benefits awarded plaintiff in 1967 or, in the alternative, by the $14,404.04 paid'by intervener up to the time of trial. At the hearing on the motion, it was established that the $14,404.04 had consisted, not of death benefits only (as intervener\u2019s counsel had represented prior to the trial stipulation concerning that figure [see fn. 2, <em>ante]), </em>but of death-benefit and other payments made by intervener pursuant to the 1967 award.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b945-4\">Granting defendant\u2019s motion, the trial court made formal findings of fact that (1) intervener had paid \u201cto plaintiff\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> pursuant to the 1967 award and prior to the trial, (2) that intervener owed her additional sums thereunder, (3) \u201c[t]hat a double recovery will result herein if plaintiff enforces the judgment entered on the verdict herein without reduction thereof in the amount of the compensation benefits paid ... as of the time trial commenced herein,\u201d and (4) \u201c[tjhat a double recovery will also result if the monies owed by intervener under said award in the future are paid to plaintiff after payment and satisfaction of the judgment herein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">The findings were followed by conclusions of law that the judgment entered on the verdict should be reduced to $20,595.96 ($35,000 less $14,404.04), and that the remaining monies due under the 1967 workmen\u2019s compensation award \u201cshould be paid directly to the defendant . . . and that no further payments thereunder be made to plaintiff.\u201d A new judgment was entered accordingly.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b945-6\">Upon plaintiff\u2019s and intervener\u2019s separate appeals from the new judgment, we have concluded that the trial court was correct in reducing the amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"996\">*996</page-number>of the first judgment, but that it erred, in the respects hereinafter discussed, in fixing the amount of the reduction; and that, for the latter reason, the judgment must be reversed with directions as hereinafter ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">The parties agree that a reduction of the $35,000 judgment was required, in principle, under the rule established in <em>Witt </em>v. <em>Jackson </em>(1961) 57 Cal.2d 57 [17 Cal.Rptr. 369, 366 P.2d 641] and now applicabl\u00e9 in an action brought against a third party tortfeasor to recover damages for the injury or death of an employee which was covered by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act and caused by the wrongful act or omission of the defendant. In such case, the latter may assert that the injury or death was a proximate result of the concurrent negligence of the employer. If he (the defendant) establishes such concurrent negligence, he is entitled to have the judgment against him reduced by the amount of workmen\u2019s compensation benefits paid. This result emerges from successive applications of the principles (1) that the employer or his workmen\u2019s compensation insurance carrier (the latter of whom commonly appears in such action, as interven\u00e9r has appeared here) may not profit from the employer\u2019s wrong, and (2) that the injured employee or his dependents may not be allowed double recovery of such benefits. <em>( Witt </em>v. <em>Jackson, supra, </em>at pp. 71-73; <em>De Cruz </em>v. <em>Reid </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 217, 221-223 [70 Cal.Rptr. 550, 444 P.2d 342); <em>Slayton </em>v. <em>Wright </em>(1969) 271 Cal.App.2d 219, 230-231 [76 Cal.Rptr. 494]; <em>Gastelum </em>v. <em>City of Torrance </em>(1969) 2 Cal.App.3d 582, 583 [82 Cal.Rptr. 732]. See 2 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (7th ed. 1960) Workmen\u2019s Compensation (1969 Supp.) \u00a7 17A (New), pp. 810-811; 2 Hanna, California Law of Employee Injuries and Workmen\u2019s Compensation (2d ed. 1969) \u00a7 23.04(2); Lupton, <em>Witt </em>v. <em>Jackson-Interpretation </em>(1966) 41. State Bar J. 690; Note (1970) 21 Hastings L. J. 661; Note (1962) 50 Cal. L.Rev. 571.)</p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">In the present case, though, the second judgment ordered (1) direct, arithmetical reduction of the original judgment by the amount of the workmen\u2019s compensation benefits paid to the time of trial, and (2) that future benefits due plaintiff from intervener under the 1967 workmen\u2019s compensation award be made to defendant. The second provision, which operated to include in the required reduction the sum of future benefits payable but yet unpaid under the 1967 award, was erroneous because the amount of such reduction should include only\u2014and no more than\u2014the total workmen\u2019s compensation benefits already paid. <em>(Gastelum </em>v. <em>City of Torrance, supra, </em>2 Cal.App.3d 582 at pp. 583-585; <em>Slayton </em>v. <em>Wright, supra, </em>271 Cal.App.2d 219 at pp. 232-234; <em>Castro </em>v. <em>Fowler Equipment Co. (1965) 233 </em>Cal.App.2d 416, 421-422 [43 Cal.Rptr. 589]; <em>Conner v. Utah Constr. &amp; Mining Co. </em>(1964) 231 Cal.App.2d 263, 275 [41 Cal.Rptr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"997\">*997</page-number>728]. See 2 Hanna, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>\u00a7 23.04(2); Lupton, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>41 State Bar J. 690 at pp. 701-710; Note, <em>supra, </em>21 Hastings L.J. 661 at pp. 668-672.)</p>\n<p id=\"b947-4\">It further appears that the trial court exceeded its jurisdiction in ordering the death benefits paid to defendant in the future. The 1967 workmen\u2019s compensation award having ordered them paid to plaintiff, the court was without jurisdiction to change the award\u2019s terms in this respect. (Lab. Code, \u00a7 5955.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See <em>Slayton </em>v. <em>Wright, supra, </em>271 Cal.App.2d 219 at p. 232; <em>Loustalot </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1947) 30 Cal.2d 905, 910-912 [186 P.2d 673]; <em>Pizarro </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1967) 254 Cal.App.2d 416, 417-420 [61 Cal.Rptr. 923]; <em>Vickich </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1930) 105 Cal.App. 587, 589-592 [288 P. 127].) We must reject defendant\u2019s contention that Code of Civil Procedure section 187<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> gave the court such jurisdiction. Section 187 merely provides ancillary dimensions to jurisdiction already \u201cconferred on\u201d a court. No such jurisdiction was \u201cconferred\u201d here because Labor Code section 5955 (see fn. 8, <em>ante) </em>expressly precluded it.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">Defendant contends that the trial court\u2019s action requiring the payment of future death benefits to him was the only method by which the rule of <em>Witt </em>v. <em>Jackson </em>could be effectively applied to the judgment entered on the verdict. Several arguments support his contention in principle. Application of the <em>Witt </em>rule to unpaid death benefits is relatively uncomplicated because, although unpaid, their amount is fixed and undisputed. (Cf. <em>Slayton </em>v. <em>Wright, supra, </em>271 Cal.App.2d 219 at pp. 231, 233; <em>Castro </em>v. <em>Fowler Equipment Co., supra, </em>233 Cal.App.2d 416 at pp. 421-422; <em>Conner </em>v. <em>Utah Constr. &amp; Mining Co., supra, </em>231 Cal.App.2d 263 at p. 275.) Ordering them paid to defendant in the future (as opposed to reducing the money' judgment against him by their prospective dollar amount) minimized the problems which might arise if plaintiff should die before the benefits have been paid in full. (See Lab. Code, \u00a7 4706, subd. (a). Cf. <em>Gastelum </em>v. <em>City of Torrance, supra, </em>2 Cal.App.3d 582 at p. 584.) Moreover, the rule denying a reduction of. the third party judgment in the full amount of benefits to be paid in the future means that the effect of the <em>Witt </em>rule itself, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"998\">*998</page-number>in any proper case, will be subject to gross variations by reason of time factors. As to benefits which have been permanently fixed, and whether the third party action is for death or injury, a <em>Witt </em>reduction of the judgment therein can range from 100 percent of the benefits paid (if sufficient time elapses between the award thereof and trial of the action) down to zero if the action is tried before a permanent award is made. The effect of a substantive rule should not be subject to the vagaries of calendaring.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">We have concluded, however, that the conceivable merit of the foregoing arguments lends no validity to the trial court\u2019s action with respect to payment of the future benefits here. In the first place, the <em>Witt </em>rule itself applies to third party actions in explicit terms of denying the concurrently negligent employer reimbursement for compensation benefits \u201cmade,\u201d and of reducing employee recovery by the amount he \u201creceived\u201d; the <em>Witt </em>court made no reference to payments \u201cto be made\u201d or \u201cto be received.\u201d <em>(Witt </em>v. <em>Jackson, supra, </em>57 Cal.2d 57 at p. 73. Compare the reference to compensation \u201cpaid or payable\u201d in one of the decisions principally relied upon in <em>Witt (id. </em>at pp. 71, 72) <em>(Lovette </em>v. <em>Lloyd </em>(1953) 236 N.C. 663 [73 S.E.2d 886, 891, 892, 893]); see Lupton, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>41 State Bar J. 690 at pp. 701-702.)</p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">Secondly, the relevant statutes and decisions which refer to reimbursement of benefits \u201cto be paid\u201d (or which the employer has \u201cbecome obligated to pay,\u201d) speak only to recovery thereof by an employer, directly or by lien, not to <em>Witt </em>reduction of a third party judgment in the event the employer\u2019s right to recovery is defeated by his concurrent negligence. (See Lab. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 3852, 3854, 3855; <em>Heaton </em>v. <em>Kerlan </em>(1946) 27 Cal.2d 716, 723 [166 P.2d 857]; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Trapp </em>(1967) 249 Cal.App.2d 929, 936 [58 Cal.Rptr. 229]; <em>Merino </em>v. <em>Pacific Coast Borax Co. </em>(1932) 124 Cal.App. 336, 344 [12 P.2d 458]; <em>Globe Indem. Co. </em>v. <em>Henderson </em>(1921) 54 Cal.App. 510, 514 [202 P. 797].) On the other hand, the clear weight of post-JTz'n decisions (which the Supreme Court can overrule, but which we are not free to ignore as precedent) indicates that the trial court erred in principle by applying <em>Witt </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>to the original third party judgment here, so as to reach the yet-unpaid death benefits. <em>(Gastelum </em>v. <em>City of Torrance, supra, </em>2 Cal.App.3d 582 at pp. 583-585; <em>Slayton </em>v. <em>Wright, supra, </em>271 Cal.App.2d 219 at pp. 232-234; <em>Castro </em>v. <em>Fowler Equipment Co., supra, </em>233 Cal.App.2d 416 at pp. 421-422; <em>Conner </em>v. <em>Utah Constr. &amp; Mining Co., supra, </em>231 Cal.App.2d 263 at p. 275.) Had the court\u2019s action been valid in principle, moreover, it could not be taken through the device employed here (ordering intervener to pay such benefits to defendant) because the court lacked jurisdiction to change the terms of the 1967 workmen\u2019s compensation award. (Lab. Code, \u00a7 5955 [see text at fn. 8, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"999\">*999</page-number><em>ante].) </em>For these overriding reasons, the provision in the judgment relative to payment of future death benefits cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-4\">The other question on the appeal is whether the second judgment correctly reduced the amount of the first one by the dollar figure of $14,404.04. <bracketnum>(4)</bracketnum> Defendant urges that we should sustain the $14,404.04 reduction because plaintiff should not be permitted to \u201cretreat\u201d from the stipulation to that figure made at the trial. But the only actual \u201cstipulation\u201d shown in the record on appeal was between respective counsel for defendant and for intervener, and was to the sole effect that the latter had actually paid out $14,404.04 prior to the trial and pursuant to the 1967 workmen\u2019s compensation award. (See fn. 2, <em>ante.) </em>The stipulated fact was undisputed then and is undisputed now. Counsel for plaintiff did not join in the stipulation. <em>(Id.) So </em>far as appears in the parties\u2019 agreed statement, he only \u201cconceded,\u201d upon the basis of representations previously made by intervener\u2019s attorney, that intervener would be entitled to a lien, in the amount of $14,404.04 and against any judgment recovered by plaintiff, <em>\u201cin the event </em>the jury found <em>no </em>concurrent negligence on the part of the employer [defendant].\u201d <em>(Id. </em>[italics added].)</p>\n<p id=\"b949-6\">The \u201cconcession\u201d made on plaintiff\u2019s behalf was limited to the amount of the lien which would result, in intervener\u2019s favor, if the jury found for plaintiff and absolved the employer of concurrent negligence. The concession did not speak to the amount of any offset against plaintiff\u2019s recovery if the jury found otherwise as to the employer.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The two amounts (both of which, during the trial, were viewed prospectively) were not necessarily identical: the limits of the former were fixed by statute (Lab. Code, \u00a7 3856, subd. (a); see <em>id., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 3852, 3854, 3855), while the latter would include only those of intervener\u2019s expenditures which would represent a double recovery by plaintiff. <em>(Witt </em>v. <em>Jackson, supra, </em>57 Cal.2d 57 at p. 73.) Plaintiff\u2019s \u201cconcession\u201d was contingent upon the jury\u2019s exonerating the employer; the contingency failed when the jury found otherwise. For these reasons, plaintiff is not bound by her \u201cconcession,\u201d and she is not seeking to \u201cretreat,\u201d on appeal, from any stipulation which bound her as to the question of offset which is before us. (See <em>City of Ukiah </em>v. <em>Fones </em>(1966) 64 Cal.2d 104, 110-111 [48 Cal.Rptr. 865, 410 P.2d 369].)</p>\n<p id=\"b949-7\">As we may therefore consider the $14,404.04 reduction on its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1000\">*1000</page-number>merits, the question is reduced to whether the rule prohibiting double recovery <em>(Witt </em>v. <em>Jackson, supra, </em>57 Cal.2d 57 at p. 73) applied to each of the four categories (considered separately) of the $14,404.04 paid out by intervener before the trial. (See fn. 5, ante.) In her wrongful death action, brought by plaintiff in her own right as the decedent\u2019s sole heir, she could recover\u2014-and she properly pleaded\u2014general damages for her pecuniary loss in having been deprived of the decedent\u2019s care, comfort, society and support. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 377; <em>Benwell </em>v. <em>Dean </em>(1967) 249 Cal.App.2d 345, 349 [57 Cal.Rptr. 394] and cases cited.) She could also recover, and she properly pleaded, damages for the decedent\u2019s burial expenses. <em>(Adams </em>v. <em>Southern Pac. Co. </em>(1935) 4 Cal.2d 731, 743-744 [53 P.2d 121]; <em>Francis </em>v. <em>Sauve </em>(1963) 222 Cal.App.2d 102, 124 [34 Cal.Rptr. 754].) The jury having heard evidence and received instructions on both subjects (see fn. 3, <em>ante), </em>its $35,000 verdict obviously constituted recovery of both. It follows that, to avoid double recovery of either item by plaintiff under the first judgment, the second judgment correctly reduced it by the sum of both (i.e., the sum of death benefits and burial expenses paid by intervener before the trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">The other two elements of the $14,404.04 reduction were intervener\u2019s pretrial payments of the decedent\u2019s medical expenses and temporary disability indemnity. Of the latter ($332.14), $120 had been paid to hiiri while he lived; the remaining $212.14, having accrued in his lifetime, was paid to plaintiff, as his \u201cdependent,\u201d after his death. (Lab. Code, \u00a7 4700.) \u2022 (See fn. 5, ante.) According to the 1967 workmen\u2019s compensation award, the medical expenses were \u201cself-procured,\u201d meaning that the decedent incurred them in his lifetime. The temporary disability payments related to his loss of earnings while he lived, not to plaintiff\u2019s loss of support by reason of his death. Hence, both items\u2014the medical expenses and the temporary disability indemnity paid by intervener before the trial\u2014represented \u201closs or damage . . . sustained or incurred [by the decedent] prior to his death\u201d within the meaning of Probate Code section 573.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Damages therefore were recoverable in an action brought by his executor or adminis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1001\">*1001</page-number>trator pursuant to that statute, but not in this action brought by plaintiff in her own right as his heir.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (Code Civ.

Code, \u00a7 573 [id.]; <em>Gallup </em>v. <em>Sparks-Mundo Engineering Co. </em>(1954) 43 Cal.2d 1, 10-11 [271 P.2d 34] [reading Code of Civil Procedure section 377 with former Civil Code section 956, the statutory predecessor of Probate Code section 573]. See <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Dowling </em>(3d Cir. 1963) 318 F.2d 642, 644; 2 Hanna, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>\u00a7 23.05 (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b951-4\">As neither item was recoverable, no evidence of either was offered and the jury was instructed on neither. (See fn. 3, <em>ante.) </em>It successively follows that the $35,000 judgment on the verdict included no recovery of either item, there could be no double recovery of either by plaintiff, the trial court\u2019s finding to the contrary (as to these two items) was unsupported by any evidence or was erroneous as a conclusion of law, the rule of <em>Witt </em>v. <em>Jackson </em>did not apply to either item, and the court erred in reducing the $35,000 judgment by the amount of both.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">Recapitulating the foregoing: The trial court correctly reduced the $35,000 judgment by $10,820 ($10,220 in death benefits plus $600 in burial expenses), but not by $3,584.04 ($3,251.90 in medical expenses plus $332.14 expended by intervener in temporary disability payments). The amount of the reduced judgment should therefore have been $24,180, and its effective date for all relevant purposes should be April 25, 1968 (the date upon which the original, subsequently reduced judgment was entered upon the jury\u2019s verdict).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-6\">The judgment entered herein on June 27, 1968, is reversed. The cause is remanded to the trial court with directions to enter judgment, as of April 25, 1968, in favor of plaintiff and against defendant in the amount of $24,180 (plus plaintiff\u2019s costs of suit), and in favor of defendant and against intervener (with costs of suit) under the complaint in intervention; and to include therein no provision relative to workmen\u2019s compensation benefits due plaintiff but unpaid prior to the commencement of trial herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-7\">Devine, P. J., and Christian, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-8\">A petition for a rehearing was denied September 28, 1970, and the opinion and judgment were modified to read as printed above. Respondent\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied October 28, 1970.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b942-13\">The major part of the original record on appeal consisted of a clerk\u2019s transcript which essentially constituted the judgment roll. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 670.) It was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"993\">*993</page-number>augmented by stipulation to include a \u201cSettled Statement of Facts,\u201d which is actually an \u201cagreed statement\u201d as permitted by rule 6(a), California Rules of Court. The facts recited herein are taken from the original record and from the agreed statement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b944-7\">In the limited record on appeal, the stipulation appears in a two-page reporter\u2019s transcript of the relevant trial proceedings. According thereto, the trial court announced (in the jury\u2019s absence) that respective counsel for intervener and for defendant (the court did not mention plaintiff\u2019s counsel) had proposed to stipulate that, pursuant to the 1967 workmen\u2019s compensation award, the decedent\u2019s employer (referring, in context, to intervener, the employer\u2019s insurance carrier) \u201cwas required tc and did pay medical [.ric] expenses.\u201d Referring to a \u201cletter,\u201d defendant\u2019s counsel then said \u201cI will stipulate that these payments were made pursuant to the . . . [1967 workmen\u2019s compensation award] . . .\u201d (The letter, which presumably itemized the $14,404.04 theretofore expended by intervener, was thereupon marked for identification; it has not, however, been included in the record on appeal.)</p>\n<p id=\"b944-8\">Plaintiff\u2019s counsel was present during this episode but said nothing by way of joining in the stipulation. In this regard, the agreed statement on appeal recites as follows: \u201cBoth during the trial and during argument to the jury, plaintiff\u2019s attorney, upon the basis of . . . previous representations by the attorney for the intervener that the sum of $14,404.04 constituted only death benefits, conceded the intervener would be entitled to assert a lien against plaintiff\u2019s recovery, in the aforesaid amount, in the event the jury found no concurrent negligence on the part of the employer. Both plaintiff and defendant, relying upon the representations of . . . [intervener] . . ., dispensed with any proof as to the precise components of the sum of $14,404.04.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b944-9\">The instructions given in these respects were BAJI Nos. 175, 175-B (Revised), 175-D, 175-E, and an adaptation of No. 177 (Revised).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b944-10\">The agreed statement shows the amount of the death benefits awarded as \u201c$17,500.\u201d The reference therein to defendant\u2019s post-judgment motion indicates that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"995\">*995</page-number>the amount was \u201c$18,000.\u201d The discrepancy being unexplained, we hereinafter use the $17,500 figure in referring to the death-benefit portion of the 1967 workmen\u2019s compensation award.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b945-10\">According to the showing on defendant\u2019s motion as summarized in the agreed statement on appeal, the $14,404.04 total included (1) death-benefit payments made to plaintiff in the total amount of $10,220; (2) the decedent\u2019s burial expenses, reimbursed to plaintiff in the amount of $600; (3) temporary disability payments made or accrued while the decedent lived after his injury, $332.14 ($120 of which was paid to him in his lifetime, $212.14 paid to plaintiff after his death); and (4) medical expenses incurred while he lived, and paid to the various vendors thereof, in the amount of $3,251.90.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b945-11\">Although the first finding states that the full $14,404.04 was paid \u201cto plaintiff,\u201d the agreed statement on appeal shows that some payments thereof were made to others.

As we here indicate, the relevant recitals in the agreed statement on the appeal (see fn. 2, <em>ante) </em>reflect no \u201cagreement\u201d to the effect asserted by defendant, and they wholly refute his interpretation of plaintiff\u2019s \u201cconcession\u201d concerning the $14,404.04.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b950-5\">Probate Code section 573 provides in pertinent part as follows: \u201cExcept as provided in this section no cause of action shall be lost by reason of the de\u00e1th of any person but may be maintained by . . . his executor or administrator. . . .
