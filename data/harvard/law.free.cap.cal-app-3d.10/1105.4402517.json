(hereinafter the retailer), was being supplied with fiberglass panels for sale to its customers by Lasco Industries, Inc. (hereinafter the wholesaler), on a consignment basis in 1965. The retailer sold some of the panels without paying the wholesaler whereupon the wholesaler ceased to provide any more panels.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-10\">In July 1966 a representative of the wholesaler met with the president of the retailer to discuss the delinquent account. The wholesaler offered to deliver additional merchandise to the retailer provided that the retailer furnished security in the form of its \u201cinventory and accounts receivable.\u201d The retailer agreed to do so whereupon the wholesaler filled in the blanks of a document entitled \u201cFinancing Statement.\u201d That document was executed on behalf of the retailer by its president and vice-president and on behalf of the wholesaler by its secretary. It was filed in the office of the Secretary of State on July 22, 1966.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-11\">The wholesaler resumed supplying merchandise to the retailer. The retailer\u2019s business continued to be poor and on February 15, 1967, the retailer made a general assignment to the plaintiff herein for the benefit of its creditors. While the record does not disclose the amount due to creditors, it was vastly in excess of the $5,976.17 held by plaintiff as assignee for the benefit of creditors. The amount due to the wholesaler was $4,636.86. The wholesaler claimed that it was entitled to the entire amount due to it on the basis that it was a preferred creditor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1107\">*1107</page-number>Plaintiff brought this action for declaratory relief against the wholesaler putting in issue only one matter here pertinent, i.e., whether the \u201cFinancing Statement\u201d constitutes a security agreement. The trial court found that it does and plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-4\">One of the purposes of the Commercial Code is to \u201csimplify, clarify and modernize the law regarding commercial transactions.\u201d (Com. Code, \u00a7 1102.) One intended result was \u201ca radical simplification in the formal requisites for creation of a security interest.\u201d (Uniform Com. Code Comment to \u00a7 9-101 which is \u00a7 9101 of the Cal. Com. Code.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-5\">\u201c \u2018Security interest\u2019 means an interest in personal property or fixtures which secures payment or performance of an obligation.\u201d (Com. Code, \u00a7 1201, subd. (37).) \u201c\u2018Security agreement\u2019 means an agreement which creates or provides for a security interest.\u201d (Com. Code, \u00a7 9105, subd. (1) (h).) A security interest is not enforceable unless the \u201cdebtor\u201d has signed a security agreement.\u201d (Com. Code, \u00a7 9203.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-6\">The debtor here (the retailer) signed a document entitled \u201cFinancing Statement\u201d which complied with section 9402 of the Commercial Code, including a description of the collateral of the secured party as \u201cAll inventory and accounts receivable of debtor, as of this date, or which may be acquired or arise during the term of this financing statement.\u201d Unquestionably the document would have sufficed as a security agreement if the description of the collateral had been \u201cAll inventory and accounts receivable of debtor, as of this date, or which may be acquired or arise during the term of this financing statement, as to which the debtor hereby grants to the secured party a security interest to secure payment for all merchandise supplied or to be supplied by the secured party to the debtor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-7\">The purpose of filing a financing statement is to give an existing or prospective creditor the opportunity to inform himself of whether, and of the extent to which, an existing or prospective debtor has encumbered his assets and to govern himself accordingly in dealing with the debtor. The existing or prospective creditor may obtain a copy of any financing statement from the filing officer. (Com. Code, \u00a7 9407.) While the financing statement ordinarily will not reveal the terms of the security agreement, the theory is that this information can be obtained from the parties to the security agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-8\">It is arguable in the case at bench that the wholesaler ought to be a preferred creditor because anyone checking with the Secretary of State would have found that the retailer had acknowledged that all its inventory and accounts receivable were the collateral of a security agreement with the whole<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1108\">*1108</page-number>saler. Since \u201ca security agreement is effective according to its terms between the parties . . . against creditors\u201d (Com. Code, \u00a7 9201) and since neither the wholesaler nor the retailer was obligated to disclose the terms of the security agreement to an inquiring creditor or prospective creditor, it can be argued that a creditor or prospective creditor should have acted on the assumption that there was a security agreement between the wholesaler and the retailer in which the property described was the collateral.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-4\">On the other hand, it is clear that the rights of a third person do not depend upon whether he has examined any financing statement. If the wholesaler and retailer had executed a security agreement but had not filed a financing statement, the security agreement would not make the wholesaler a preferred creditor even though none of the other creditors bothered to ascertain whether a financing statement had been filed. (Com. Code, \u00a7 9302.) The necessary corollary of this proposition is that a financing statement filed with respect to a security agreement which never comes into existence is a nullity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-5\">The question is whether the financing statement executed by the wholesaler and the retailer in this,case also serves as a security agreement. A security agreement must be a writing \u201cwhich creates or provides for a security interest.\u201d (Com. Code, \u00a7 9105, subd. (1) (h).) <em>American Card Co. </em>v. <em>H. M. H. Co. </em>(1963) 97 R.I. 59 [196 A.2d 150] held that a financing statement failed \u201cto qualify also as a security agreement because nowhere in the form is there any evidence of an agreement by the debtor to <em>grant </em>claimants a security interest.\u201d (Italics added.) To the same effect are <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Stocker </em>(10th Cir. 1967) 380 F.2d 123 and <em>DuBay </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(9th Cir. 1969) 417 F.2d 1277. Since one of the purposes of the Commercial Code is to \u201cmake uniform the law among the various jurisdictions\u201d (Com. Code, \u00a7 1102), the cited cases are compelling auhority which we accept. There is a second reason why the financing statement here cannot be considered a security agreement. While the collateral is described, there is no indication of the obligation for which it is security. For all that appears from the writing, the obligation secured may have been a loan from the wholesaler to the retailer which was subsequently repaid and might not have encompassed the retailer\u2019s obligation to the wholesaler for merchandise delivered. A security interest is collateral \u201cwhich secures payment or performance of an obligation\u201d (Com. Code, \u00a7 1201, subd. (37)) and the security agreement is effective only \u201caccording to its terms between the parties . . . against creditors.\u201d (Com. Code, \u00a7 9201.) At a minimum the \u201cterms\u201d must recite the obligation secured. Professor William D. Warren suggests that appropriate language is a grant of a security interest \u201cto secure the performance of the obligations set out in paragraph one,\u201d i.e., a paragraph in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1109\">*1109</page-number>agreement which fully sets out the obligation. (3 Cal. Commercial Law (Cont. Ed. Bar 1966), p. 56.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-4\">In the light of our resolution of the issue discussed,' there is no need to discuss the other issues briefed by the parties. The wholesaler is not a preferred creditor and the judgment is reversed with directions to enter judgment for plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-5\">Wood, P. J., and Lillie, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-6\">A petition for a rehearing was denied September 29, 1970, and respondent\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied November 10, 1970. Wright, C. J., Mosk, J., and Sullivan, J., were of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
