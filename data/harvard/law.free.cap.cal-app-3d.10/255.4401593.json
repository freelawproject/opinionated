Schlegel was on April 12, 1957, declared to be what is now described as \u201cmentally disordered\u201d and committed for placement in a state hospital where she remains today.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>Joseph Schlegel, her husband, executed a will June 7, 1957, which provided that all of his estate should go to Katherine E. Schlegel, but if she should \u201cfail to survive the distribution of my estate,\u201d all of the property would go equally to his five children. Joseph Schlegel died February 22, 1964.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">The executors of Joseph\u2019s will are Ruth V. Preuss and Marvin H. Schlegel, two of his children. The property passing by virtue of the will was valued at $13,200.17. Marvin H. Schlegel was made guardian of his mother\u2019s estate March 15, 1965, and continues in that capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">The Department of Mental Hygiene filed a verified petition for an order directing the executors to terminate the probate of Joseph\u2019s estate and to distribute the assets to Katherine\u2019s guardian. No evidence, by way of affidavits or otherwise, was offered in opposition to any of the allegations of the petition. The petition was nevertheless denied and the department takes this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">The probate of Joseph\u2019s estate has lain dormant for years and there is nothing in the record before us to indicate why the estate was not long since closed. If \u201cdistribution [to Katherine] could and should have occurred,\u201d the condition that she survive distribution of the estate has been satisfied because \u201cunreasonable delay [in distribution] cannot defeat the beneficiary\u2019s interest.\u201d <em>(Estate of Taylor </em>(1967) 66 Cal.2d 855 [59 Cal.Rptr. 437, 428 P.2d 301].)  The department is entitled to an order compelling Katherine\u2019s guardian to pay for her support out of her estate unless \u201cthere is likelihood of the patient\u2019s recovery or release from the hospital and payment will reduce [her] estate to such an extent that [she] is likely to become a burden on the community in the event of [her] discharge from the hospital.\u201d (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 7279.)</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">Here no attempt was made to establish the liability, or the extent thereof, of Katherine\u2019s guardian to the department. Instead, the department sought to compel distribution from Joseph\u2019s estate.  While it is not clear from the petition whether preliminary distribution (Prob. Code, \u00a7 1000) or final distribution (Prob. Code, \u00a7 1020) was sought, in either case the application may be made only by \u201cthe executor and administrator, or any heir, devisee or legatee, or the assignee, grantee or successor in interest of any heir, devisee, or legatee.\u201d (Prob. Code, \u00a7 1000; \u00a7 1020 is virtually identical.) The department is none of these. The department is at most a potential creditor of a devisee. <em>\u00a1</em></p>\n<p id=\"b280-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>We affirm the order denying the department\u2019s petition for distribution on the ground that the department was not authorized to make the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">Wood, P. J., and Lillie, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
