Furthermore, that six days before the notice of the motion for the dismissal of the appeal herein was served and filed by the clerk of this court, he had written a letter to the clerk of the trial court inclosing a check in payment of the cost of the transcript on appeal in another case, and in the same communication had requested the clerk to inform him if the transcript on appeal were ready in the instant case. On the other hand, a deputy clerk in charge of the \u201cTranscript Department\u201d in the office of the clerk of the trial court made affidavit in substance that after the notice of appeal herein had been filed, said deputy clerk left a message at the office of the attorney for appellant to the effect that arrangements should be made with the clerk of the trial court looking toward the payment or guaranteeing the payment of the costs for preparing the transcript on appeal; that no response was received from such message, and that on each of at least two other occasions the deputy clerk had telephoned the office of said attorney and had left a message to the same effect as the first message, and with the same result. In reply to such affidavit the attorney for appellant has filed his affidavit that no such message was ever received by him. In addition thereto, the clerk and stenographer in the office of the said attorney makes affidavit that it was her duty to receive all telephone calls in said office during regular office hours, and that no telephone message, such as was described in the affidavit of the deputy clerk, was ever received in such office.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">From such contradictory statements it is difficult (if possible) to determine which of the affiants is mistaken. The fact, which is undisputed, that the attorney for appellant had customarily been accorded the courtesy by the clerk of the trial court of permitting him to order his transcripts on appeal and on completion of each of such transcripts to pay the cost thereof without theretofore furnishing an undertaking in the matter, together with the fact that under such arrangement, a few days before the notice of the motion for the dismissal of the appeal herein was filed with the clerk of this court, the attorney for appellant had paid the costs of the transcript of another appeal and at the same time had requested information from said clerk as to when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>the transcript in the instant case would he ready, would indicate that, so far as the attorney for appellant was concerned, he had relied upon the custom as to the payment of costs of preparing transcripts on appeal theretofore existing between him and the clerk of the trial court and had had no intimation that such arrangement had been changed. Although the transcript on appeal may not have been filed within the time required by law, it is apparent that appellant, through her attorney, was acting in good faith. The delay occasioned by the default of the appellant did not occasion any alleged hardship on the respondent. Within a few days after the notice of motion herein was filed the transcript was prepared and made ready for presentation to the trial judge for his certification and approval as required by law, and the affidavit of the attorney for appellant shows that the appeal is meritorious and that it is prosecuted in good faith. In such circumstances, assuming (without deciding) that at the time when the notice of motion herein was filed the time allowed by law for filing the transcript on appeal had expired, we are of the opinion that the appellant should be relieved from her default and that the motion to dismiss the appeal should be denied. It is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Conrey, P. J., and York, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
