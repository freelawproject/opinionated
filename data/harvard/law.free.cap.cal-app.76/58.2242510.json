The defendants answered, and in their answer first they denied each of the allegations contained in each count in the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint; second, to each count they interposed a separate defense to the effect that the subject matter of that particular count in plaintiffs\u2019 complaint was a part of a larger transaction, to wit, a copartnership enterprise between the plaintiffs and the defendants as copartners; third, the defendants pleaded a defense to the effect that the subject matter of all the counts contained in the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint was a part of the subject matter of a larger transaction, to wit, said copartnership, and pleaded the facts constituting the copartnership and the business transactions had thereunder down to the twenty-fourth day of December, 1918, at which time the copartnership was dissolved ; that during the existence of said copartnership the plaintiffs received large sums of money for the account of the defendants and have refused to apply them as provided in the partnership agreement; and that an accounting should be had; fourth, defendants then pleaded seven counts against the plaintiffs, each being for a different claim for moneys alleged.to be due and owing to the defendants by reason of transactions had between the parties under the alleged co-partnership agreement. The defendants closed their answer with a prayer that an accounting be had, etc. The plaintiffs, answered the cross-complaint and thereafter the cause came on for trial before the court sitting with a jury. The jury returned a general verdict and many special verdicts. The verdicts were incorporated in a judgment in favor of the plaintiffs and against the defendants in the sum of $16,086.30, from that judgment the defendants have appealed and have brought up a bill of exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">From the same judgment the plaintiffs have appealed and have joined in bringing up the same record to support their appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>When the cause was called for trial it was stipulated between counsel that the special defense, to the effect that the plaintiffs and the defendants were copartners and that no accounting had ever been had, and that, therefore, no action could be maintained by one copartner against the other until such an accounting had first been had, should be tried by the trial court sitting without a jury and before calling a jury to try the other issues.

The defendants, for the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>reason, offered the same showing in support of a motion for judgment in favor of the defendants for costs. \u201cThe Court: The objection is overruled and your motion is denied. \u2019 \u2019 Thereafter the jury was called in and the court proceeded to hear the evidence on the issues presented by the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint and the answer of the defendants thereto. The first point assigned by the defendants is that the trial court erred in the rulings above set forth because the indentures quoted showed that the parties were partners. <em>(Chapman </em>v. <em>Hughes, </em>104 Cal. 302 [37 Pac. 1048, 38 Pac. 109] .) The plaintiffs have replied that under the facts the parties were not partners. <em>(Lyden </em>v. <em>Spohn-Patrick Co., </em>155 Cal. 177, 180 [100 Pac. 236].)</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">Although the respective contentions of counsel are interesting, we are not at liberty to pass on the question as to whether the parties were or were not partners. The cross-complainants were attempting to show that fact. They had introduced in that behalf only a part of their evidence. They were interrupted, by the ruling of the trial court. Conceding that the evidence introduced at the time of the interruption did not show the parties to be partners, it cannot be known what relation would have been shown to exist when all of the evidence of the cross-complainants had been introduced. Moreover, assuming for the purposes of this decision, that such evidence would not have disclosed the relation to be that of partners, it does not follow that the cross-complainants should have been denied the relief which they were asking.  The evidence which had been introduced, weighed in the face of a motion for a nonsuit, must be taken most strongly in favor of the cross-complainants. <em>(Hoff </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Pacific Co., </em>158 Cal. 596 [112 Pac. 53].) As to whether it showed the relation to be that of partners we will concede at once is debatable. Nevertheless it showed the relation to be of a fiduciary nature. Again, conceding that the relation shown was not that of partners, as that expression is used in our statute (Civ. Code, sec. 2395 et seq.), there is yet another relation, that of joint adventure, which is sometimes designated a limited partnership. <em>(Keys </em>v. <em>Nims, </em>43 Cal. App. 1 [184 Pac. 695]; 33 Cor. Jur. 839.) Many of the passages which we have italicized are the ordinary earmarks of a joint adventure contract. (33 Cor. Jur. 839, secs. 5, 6, 7,12, 14,16, 68, 79, 83, and 92.)  The fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>that the cross-complainants asked relief on the theory that the parties were partners did not preclude the trial court from giving them relief on the theory that the parties were joint adventurers. <em>(Butler </em>v. <em>Union Trust Co., </em>178 Cal. 195 [172 Pac. 601].) For the same reason that we may not at this time determine whether the relation existing between the parties was that of partnership, we cannot determine whether it was that of joint adventurers, nor can we determine that one party was acting as trustee for the other. The proof introduced by the appellants before they were interrupted tended to show that the plaintiffs were not entitled to recover all of their advances\u2014that the recovery of a substantial amount of those advances was by the terms of the contracts contingent on the result of the success of the enterprise. That result could not be known till an accounting was had. If, on a full hearing, it transpired that an accounting should be had, then it follows that in the meantime no action at law should be maintained by the plaintiffs to recover those unascertained and unmeasured sums. As far as we are at liberty to go, in view of the condition of the record, is to state that the evidence which the cross-complainants had introduced was of such a nature that the hearing on the cross-complaint should not have been interrupted until a full and complete hearing had been had thereon. <em>(Butler </em>v. <em>Union Trust Co., supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">In what we have said we are not unmindful of the rule that when balances have been completely ascertained an action at law can be maintained in some instances by the trustee or the beneficiary. (2 Perry on Trusts, sec. 843; 33 Cor. Jur., p. 866, sec. <em>83; Gleason </em>v. <em>White, </em>34 Cal. 258.) And in this connection we have not overlooked the fact that the first and second counts of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint are each alleged to be evidenced by certain promissory notes. However, it will also be noted in this connection that each of those notes was but a part of a larger transaction and part of which is evidenced by defendants\u2019 exhibit number 5, <em>supra. </em>Moreover, the cross-complaint sought an accounting of all of the affairs between the parties. Assuming that each $5,000 promissory note constituted a rest or a balance, nevertheless it is equally clear that the third count was addressed to the unliquidated, unascertained, and unsettled larger portion of the account existing between the parties. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>As the record stands the subject matter of the first count, of the second count and of the third count was so interwoven with the main transaction that at this time it appears that an action at law was probably not authorized until an accounting between the parties had first been had. <em>(Worms </em>v. <em>Lake, </em>120 Misc. Rep. 210 [198 N. Y. Supp. 861].)</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">The most of the remaining points presented by the parties grow out of certain matters that arose by reason of instructing the jury. As we have held that the trial court should have heard the application of the cross-complainants for an accounting, it is not likely that the same questions will arise again. \" For that reason those points need not be determined at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">The record discloses that the parties disagreed in construing the written contracts which they had executed. One instance of disagreement arose as to the meaning of defendants\u2019 exhibit 5 in so far as it purports to state the compensation to be paid for towing the \u201cJohn G. North\u201d to San Lucas Bay. The paragraph in question contains an erasure. The erasure was not accounted for by either party. No evidence Was offered regarding the circumstances that existed at the time the contract was written, and the record does not show from where the \u201cJohn G. North\u201d was to be towed. The trial court construed the contract as providing for tow-age from Port Los Angeles to Magdalena Bay. One party asserts that the name Los Angeles was stricken out and, consequently, the construction adopted by the trial court was error. The other party contends that the trial court inadvertently used the name \u201cLos Angeles\u201d when it should have used the name \u201cSan Diego.\u201d It is patent that this court cannot in this condition of the record ascertain the intentions of the parties if such intentions were different from those evidenced by the face of defendants\u2019 exhibit <em>5; </em>nor can this court fully understand said passage in the absence of the information above referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">Much of what we have said regarding the last item applies also to the items of expenditure which were made in payment of the alleged custom duties which the plaintiffs claim to have paid to a Mexican official and to the several items charged by the plaintiffs as salary paid to another Mexican official purporting to be for compensation for inspection by said official, but which services the defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>claim were never rendered. We do not understand the defendants to claim that the moneys were not paid out. We do understand them to claim that the moneys were paid under such circumstances that said payments were \u201cpurely gratuitous\u201d and therefore not chargeable against the defendants. <em>(Molloy </em>v. <em>Rourke, </em>83 Conn. 196 [76 Atl. 517].) Whether the parties occupied the relation one to the other of trustee and beneficiary, partners, or joint adventurers, the utmost good faith is required of the trustee in whom confidence is reposed. <em>(Jones </em>v. <em>Kinney, </em>146 Wis. 130 [Ann. Cas. 1912C, 200, 202, note, 131 N. W. 339]); but the appellants did not introduce evidence showing any lack\" of the utmost good faith by Mr. Coberly in making the payments. As the record stands, we cannot say that any of the payments made to Mexican officials were not proper charges in behalf of the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">The judgment is reversed; the defendants appealing to recover their costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">Nourse, J., and Langdon, P. J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">A petition by respondents to have the cause heard in the supreme court, after judgment in the district court of appeal, was denied by the supreme court on February 25, 1926.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
