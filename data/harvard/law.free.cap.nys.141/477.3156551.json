The defense was that the discharge was justified because of .plaintiff\u2019s misconduct. Defendant also counterclaimed for money loaned and advanced at plaintiff\u2019s request to pay plaintiff\u2019s subagents, and a separate counterclaim for conversion.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">The finding of the jury that plaintiff was wrongfully discharged is fully sustained by the evidence. The court held that the drawing account was a weekly salary of $35 a week, and that, if plaintiff was wrongfully discharged, he was entitled to recover said sum of $35 per week for the unexpired term of his contract, less $175 earned by him during that time at other employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">Defendant sought to prove under its counterclaim that defendant loaned to plaintiff sums aggregating $943 to pay plaintiff\u2019s subagents, who were in plaintiff\u2019s employ; but this evidence was excluded, and defendant excepted. This evidence was admissible, as tending to establish defendant\u2019s counterclaim, and the exclusion of such evidence constituted reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
