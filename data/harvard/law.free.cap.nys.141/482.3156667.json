The defendant, upon receiving the amount of the judgment and costs, gave plaintiff\u2019s clerk a receipt reading as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-15\">\u201cBy order o\u00ed execution issued in the Second District Court of the Borough of the Bronx, City of New York, in the case of John Isaacs v. David Glass, of 67 2d Ave., first name fictitious, I. have been paid the full amount of case under protest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-16\">\u201cRalph J. Hoffmeister, Marshal City of New York.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-17\">\u201cThis execution was issued on the 6th day of November, 1912; the case was tried on the 23d day of September, 1912.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-18\">The foregoing facts are substantially undisputed. Nevertheless judgment was given for the defendant. The claim of the respondent that the payment upon the execution was voluntary is not only against the weight of evidence, but it is effectually disposed of by the receipt given by him above quoted. There is no evidence given or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>claim made that the property upon which the defendant threatened to levy was that of the judgment debtor, and the judgment in his favor is wholly without warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
