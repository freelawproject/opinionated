Issue was joined about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>December 13, 1912. On December 26, 1912, the plaintiff served a notice of trial, and the cause was placed upon the calendar. The action is brought to recover damages sustained by plaintiff through the alleged negligence of the defendant, and the complaint contains allegations to the effect that the plaintiff\u2019s injuries were sustained at certain premises owned at the time by the defendant. The answer, inter alia, denies the ownership of the premises, and although the plaintiff asserts that his damages equal the sum of $5,000, a sum beyond the jurisdiction of the City Court, and that he desires to discontinue this action, owing to the recent decision in Lewkowicz v. Queen Aeroplane Co., 207 N. Y. 290, 100 N. E. 796, it would appear, from the uncontradicted statement of the defendant\u2019s attorney in his opposing affidavit used on the motion herein, that the action was sought to be discontinued because it had been brought against the wrong defendant. If that is the real reason, the payment of the costs of the action to date should have been imposed. If it is not the reason, chapter 210 of the Laws of 1913, amending section 319 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which provides for the removal of such an action from the City Couri to the Supreme Court, affords the plaintiff the requisite relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Order modified, by requiring as a condition for a discontinuance of the action the payment of the costs to date, and, as modified, affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements, without prejudice to the plaintiff to move, within 10 days after the service of a copy of the order entered herewith and notice of entry thereof in the City Court, and payment of $10 costs and disbursements of this appeal, in the Supreme Court for an order removing this cause to that court. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
