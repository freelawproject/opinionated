J.</author>\n<p id=\"AZ8s\">The action is for negligence in the relation of master and servant. The appeal is by the plaintiff from a judgment \u25a0entered upon a verdict against him. The plaintiff was injured by fall of a scaffold, which he was pulling up as a hoist, incident to work about a certain house. The-defendant admitted that he was a contractor for the performance of certain work on that house, and as such \u25a0contractor had charge, direction, and control of the said work. He further pleaded that the injuries, if any, were caused by the plaintiff\u2019s negligence, and, if by the negligence of any other, then by the negligence of a subcontractor, and that the ropes for the scaffolding were furnished by a fully competent and 'experienced subcontractor, who, on information and belief, was careful and prudent in his business. The plaintiff testified that Polakoff asked plaintiff if he wished to help him, and said that he had a job working for the defendant; that thereupon plaintiff went to work, and that Polakoff informed plaintiff that he (Polakoff) was working for the defendant. The defendant testifies that he had the work for placing a lintel on the premises; that he ordered the lintel from the factory, and took a mason (Polakoff) to do the work; and he read in evidence a contract with Polakoff for such work.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>The learned court, under exception, charged the following request of the defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-3\">\u201cIf the jury believes that Polakoff was a subcontractor, and that he had contracted to place that lintel, even if the defendant was present- at the time that it was placed, he is not liable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">The defendant in his answer\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-5\">\u201cadmits that he caused to be furnished certain ropes, scaffolding, pulleys, etc., but he denies that the same were furnished for the purpose and usage that the same were put to by the plaintiff or his employer, and that the same were rotten and of insufficient strength for the usage intended for the same.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">The plaintiff testifies that when he came to the premises he saw a scaffold lying on the ground, and a stone was on the scaffold; that he asked Polakoff, \u201cWhere is your boss?\u201d and that then the defendant came along. The plaintiff then said, \u201cI can\u2019t pull that myself ; you will have to have a third man to help in pulling that up;\u201d and that the defendant helped pull. The defendant said to .him, \u201cThe rope is strong enough to pull up,\u201d and told him to pull. When they had pulled about 15 or 20 feet, the rope broke; and theretofore he had asked the defendant if he was the boss, whereupon the defendant answered, \u201cYes.\u201d The defendant denied that he was present, admitted that he furnished the rope for the scaffold and had borrowed the scaffold from a painter, but denied that he had ever authorized Polakoff to use the scaffold for the purpose of a hoist.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">I think, even if the jury determined that Polakoff was a \"subcontractor for the lintel, that under the rule of Quigley v. Thatcher, 207 N. Y. 66, 100 N. E. 596, the testimony presented as a question of fact for the jury whether the defendant was liable for the safety of the scaffold. I do not decide that upon the evidence a verdict for either party would have been free-from interference either by the trial court or by the appellate court. I decide only that the issue for the jury was limited erroneously to the question of the status of Polakoff as a subcontractor for the lintel work.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-8\">The judgment and order must be reversed, and a new trial must be granted; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
