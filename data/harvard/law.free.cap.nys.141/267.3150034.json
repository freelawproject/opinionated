There follows a statement of proceedings had upon the settlement of the receiver\u2019s account, wherein certain referee\u2019s, stenographer\u2019s, and counsel fees were incurred by reason of objections filed to the account, and in which it was finally adjudged that there was a deficiency due to the receiver of $441.03, for which amount judgment was demanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-10\">The defendant demurs to the complaint, on the ground of misjoinder of parties plaintiff, and that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The learned justice of the Special Term in effect overruled the demurrer, and from his determination this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-11\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> While it has frequently been held that, where a receiver is appointed without authority of law, the party who was responsible for his appointment is liable for his fees and expenses (Weston v. Watts, 45 Hun, 219), \u201cthe mere inadequacy of the property, and its failure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>to realize at a sale sufficient amount to cover the costs and expenses of the receivership, will not render the plaintiff personally liable for such deficiency, where he has been guilty of no irregularity, and has properly invoked the jurisdiction of the court in the first instance\u201d (High on Receivers, \u00a7 809a). In Atlantic Trust Co. v. Chapman, 208 U. S. 360, 28 Sup. Ct. 406, 52 L. Ed. 528, 13 Ann. Cas. 1155, the above principle was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> It appears from the complaint that the receiver was properly appointed, and no liability of the defendant can be predicated upon irregularity or illegality of the proceedings. It is claimed that his liability arises from the fact, stated in the complaint, \u201cthat all of the said expenditures and excess of 'expenditures were incurred by the plaintiff herein for the benefit of and at the request of the defendant.\u201d As the account set forth shows that there was not sufficient money collected to defray the expenses of the receivership, there was no benefit to this defendant accruing therefrom, and he cannot be charged with the burdens and expenses on that ground. Assuming that he requested the plaintiff to make repairs, no liability would arise unless from the circumstances of the request could be implied a promise to pay. The receiver was in no sense the agent of this defendant, and was not amenable to his command or direction. It was his duty as an arm of the court to preserve the property from the income of the property, but not otherwise. This is not a case in which the receiver has been requested to do something outside of the usual scope of his duty, under a promise to pay for it. At the time the request was made it was certainly the intention of both parties that the expenses should be defrayed from the income of the property, and it was not foreseen that the receivership would terminate before sufficient funds were collected. No promise to pay can be implied in fact from the probable intention of the parties, and inasmuch as it does not appear that the discontinuance of the action was the fault of the defendant, no duty can be imposed by law upon him by reason thereof. No express promise to pay is alleged, and, as none can be implied, the complaint shows no ground for the defendant\u2019s alleged liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">The order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion denied, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
