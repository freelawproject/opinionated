The. record discloses no reason for such refusal. Under the stipulation, that is the sole reason why delivery has not been made by plaintiff under' the contract, and it is further agreed that by virtue of said agreement the Bavarian Realty Company had the option and right, when it came time for the delivery of said flooring, to' elect whether Western stock, \u201cAcorn Brand,\u201d at $55 per M., or Southern stock at $52.50 per M., should be delivered by plaintiff, which option said company refused and still refuses to exercise, although plaintiff is, and has at all times been, ready, willing, and able to deliver either of said items of flooring.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The defendant and guarantor of said contract now claims that there was no contract for the purchase of the flooring, but only an option, and that, as that option never was exercised, plaintiff cannot recover herein. As we view this contract, under any reasonable construction of its terms, there was an absolute contract by the Bavarian Realty Company to purchase 30,000 feet of white oak flooring. The only option which the company had was to choose between the alternative brands. Not having exercised this option, the right to elect in what manner the contract should be performed then passed to the plaintiff, whose good faith in selecting the lower-priced brand for delivery is not attacked herein. In Bishop tin Contracts (2d. Ed.) page 613, the general rule is laid down as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-5\">\u201cWe have seen that, under a contract in the alternative, the party, who by its interpreted terms is to take the step at which the choice of ways presents itself, necessarily and of law elects by which one the fulfillment shall be. One of the consequences whereof is that, if such party neglects to elect fulfilling, the right to choice passes thereupon to the other party, who may sue for the breach of the alternative he prefers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">Thus it has been held that where the obligor had an option as to alternative methods of payment, and failed to exercise same, the right of election as to the method of payment to be enforced passes to the obligee, who may enforce whichever one he will. Id. 329; McNitt v. Clark, <em>7 </em>Johns. 465.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">. [2] As under the stipulation the plaintiff has been at all times ready, willing, and able to deliver either of the brands of goods enumerated in the contract, including the brand ultimately selected by him for delivery thereunder, it was not necessary for him to segregate the goods so selected for delivery from the mass of which they might be a part. Gourd v. Healy, 206 N. Y. 423, 99 N. E. 1099.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> In Van Brocklen v. Smeallie, 140 N. Y. 70, 35 N. E. 415, it was held that the vendor of personal property has three remedies against the vendee in default. The seller may store the property for the buyer, and sue for the purchase price; he may sell the property as agent for the vendee, and recover any deficiency resulting; or he may keep the property as his own, and recover the difference between the contract price and the market price at the time and place of delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">In this case the seller has elected to follow the first of these three remedies. There having been a valid contract for the purchase of 30,000 feet of white oak flooring, and, upon the failure of the vendee to elect which of the alternative qualities he would take, the right to elect having been exercised by the vendor, and the vendor having at all times been ready to perform by delivery of the goods contracted so to be sold, he was entitled to recover from the vendee the purchase price thereof, to wit, $1,575.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> The defendant has guaranteed \u201cpayment and conditions of this contract.\u201d That can reasonably mean, not only that he guaranteed payment for goods actually delivered, but payment and performance of the conditions of the contract upon the part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>vendee when he (the guarantor) entered into this contract with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">It follows, therefore, that he is liable to the plaintiff for the sum which became payable from the Bavarian Realty Company upon its breach of the contract, namely, $1,575, for which amount plaintiff is entitled to judgment, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
