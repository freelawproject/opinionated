Tur on March 14, 1913, and a subpoena duces tecum was issued, directing him to produce at the same time certain books and papers, that he might make use of the same to refresh his recollection upon his examination. By the order it was provided that service of a copy thereof and of the affidavit \u00fcpon which it was granted should be made upon Tur within the state bn March 8th. That direction was duly complied with. A copy of the order and of the accompanying affidavit was not .\u2022served upon Tur\u2019s attorney until the following Monday (March 10th), .and the order for examination has been vacated because of the failure to make such service on the attorney on the same day as that on which service was directed to be made upon the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-16\">We think this was error. Section 873, Code- of Civil Procedure, refers to service upon the party to be examined, and prescribes the time within which the same shall -be made, but contains no reference to service upon the attorney. Section 875 requires that \u201ca copy of the order, and of the affidavit upon which it was granted, must be .served upon the attorney for each party to the action, in like manner .as a paper in the action.\u201d This does not refer to the time of service, but to the.method thereof. Where, therefore, the order requires service to be made upon the party to be examined, and the time when service to. be so made is therein specified, and complies with the provisions of\" the Code in that respect, the service upon the attorney for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>the party is not required to be made within the time limited by the order, but may be made within a reasonable time before the examination. We deem four days such a time.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">The order appealed from will therefore be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion to vacate the order of examination denied, with $10 costs. Settle order on notice. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
