Laws 1909, c. 40), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-6\">\u201cA person * * * who engages as dealer, gamekeeper, or player in any gambling or banking game, where money or property is dependent upon the result, * *. * is a common gambler.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">Section 275 of the Criminal Code provides that an indictment must contain:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-8\">\u201cThe title of the action, specifying the name of the court to which the indictment is presented, and the names of the parties; 2. A plain and concise statement of the act constituting the crime.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b858-9\">I think that the indictment was sufficient in form, and that a crime was charged under section 970 of the Penal Law. Phelps v. People, 72 N. Y. 334; People v. West, 106 N. Y. 293, 12 N. E. 610, 60 Am. Rep. 452; People v. King, 110 N. Y. 418, 18 N. E. 245, 1 L. R. A. 293, 6 Am. St. Rep. 389; People v. Weldon, 111 N. Y. 569, 19 N. E. 279; People v. Bright, 203 N. Y. 73, 96 N. E. 362, Ann. Cas. 1913A, 771; People v. Herlihy, 66 App. Div. 534, 73 N. Y. Supp. 236; People v. Adams, 85 App. Div. 390, 83 N. Y. Supp. 481.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-10\">The learned counsel for respondents directs our attention to a long line of cases holding that an indictment is bad which does not charge the crime and also state the act constituting the crime. This is the rule; but it has no effect on the question presented on this appeal, because the indictment charges the crime, viz., \u201ccommon, gamblers,\u201d and alleges the act constituting the crime, viz., that at a time and place specifically stated the defendants\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-11\">\u201cdid willfully, unlawfully, knowingly, and feloniously engage in a certain gambling game commonly called \u2018Klondike,\u2019 where money was dependent upon the result.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b858-12\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> But one crime is charged, and each defendant is charged with that crime. It follows that the decision of the learned County Court was erroneous, and that the order of the County Court of Kings-County, sustaining the demurrer, must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-13\">JENKS, P. J., and BURR and THOMAS, JJ., concur. CARR, J., dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
