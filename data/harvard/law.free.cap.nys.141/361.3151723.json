The judgment contained a stay of 60 days after entry and notice. A copy of the judgment with notice of entry was personally served on both the defendant and Charles Eno, his attorney, on December 13, 1912. The stay. expired February 11, 1913. The defendant promptly appealed from the judgment and moved this court for a stay pending such appeal, which motion was on January 31st denied with leave to apply at Special Term. Thereafter defendant applied to the Special Term for a stay, which application was denied. From the order entered on this motion defendant appealed, and the order was on March 14, 1913, affirmed by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">On February 11th defendant\u2019s attorney applied to the Presiding Justice of this court for an order for plaintiffs to show cause why an order should not be made suspending <em>the operation of the judgment, </em>until_ after the determination of the defendant\u2019s appeal from the order of the Special Term denying his motion for a stay. The proposed order to show cause as presented to the Presiding Justice contained the following clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-9\">\u201cIn the meantime, and until twenty days after the hearing and determination of this motion, let the operation of the judgment in the above-entitled action be and the same hereby is stayed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">Before the Presiding Justice signed the order, he struck out the words \u201ctwenty days after\u201d and also the words \u201clet the,\u201d and \u201coperation of,\u201d and inserted \u201cproceedings to enforce,\u201d so that the order as thus modified read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-11\">\u201cIn the meantime, and until the hearing and determination of this motion, proceedings to enforce the judgment in the above-entitled action, be and the same hereby is stayed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-12\">On February 13th, plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys informed defendant\u2019s attorney by letter that the stay had expired and that they would consider any failure to observe the injunction, as contempt of court. This letter defendant\u2019s attorney acknowledged on the' same day, in a letter saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-13\">\u201cYou were served on February 11, with an order to show cause staying the <em>enforcement of the judgment </em>until the determination of the motion which I made for a stay pending the appeal. * * * I assume that that operates as a stay and as a suspension and it was made for that purpose in view and such information was conveyed to the Judge who signed the order.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>On the following day, plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys replied to the foregoing letter, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-5\">\u201cAs appears from the order to show cause, Presiding Justice Ingraham struck out the stay of the operation of the judgment, but merely directed a stay of the proceedings to enforce the judgment. Under the circumstances, it is obvious that Presiding Justice Ingraham enjoined merely proceedings to punish for contempt and therefore any violation of the injunction contained in the final judgment since the 10th day of February, 1913, must be considered a contempt of court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A0g\">On February 18th plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys wrote to defendant himself \u2022calling his attention to the scope of the injunction contained in the judgment, and to the fact that his attorney \u201chas taken the position that the judgment has been suspended as to its operation.\u201d In the same letter, plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys further said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-7\">' \u201cLet us inform you that all that Presiding Justice Ingraham did was to enjoin proceedings to punish you for contempt pending the determination of the appeal from the order of Mr. Justice Ford denying your motion for the \u2022continuation of the suspension of the operation of the judgment. You will therefore take notice that the violation of the judgment is absolutely at your peril.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">The motion for the order now under review was heard at Special Term on March 12th. On the hearing, it was expressly conceded by the defendant\u2019s attorney in open court that the defendant had not respected the injunction, and that, after the expiration of the 60 days\u2019 stay contained in the judgment, he continued the use of the enjoined name practically as before.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">A bare recital of the foregoing facts makes it apparent that the plea \u2022of the defendant and his attorney that they misapprehended the scope \u2022of the order of the Presiding Justice, and that the violation of the injunction was due to their belief that said order operated as a stay, is without a shred of justification. The effect and purpose of the modification made by the Presiding Justice of the order presented to him for signature was perfectly plain, and could not have been misapprehended by any man of sufficient intelligence to gain admission to the bar. Furthermore, if it were possible to conceive that the defendant\u2019s attorney might, under some circumstances, have had a sincere doubt as to the true construction of that order, the fact that such construction was expressly called to his attention by the letter to him of February 14th from plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys would be sufficient to characterize his subsequent conduct. The letter of February 18th, from plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys to the defendant himself, in like manner, robs him \u2022of any opportunity to claim misapprehension or misunderstanding of any sort as to the continuing force of the injunction, and wholly defeats his attempt to protect himself by the statement in his attorney\u2019s affidavit that the latter advised him that the judgment was stayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">The case is one of wanton and inexcusable disregard of a solemn \u25a0order of this court without an exculpating circumstance of any kind. The defendant is clearly guilty of contempt, and should have been adjudged guilty thereof by the court at Special Term.'</p>\n<p id=\"b407-11\">The order should be reversed with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion to punish' granted with $10 costs, and the defendant fined $250 and to stand committed until paid.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
