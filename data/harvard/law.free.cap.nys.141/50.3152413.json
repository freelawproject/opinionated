J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqh\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The appeal raises the single question whether the terms imposed by the Special Term as a condition for an amendment of the answer are just. The action is to recover compensation for work done and for material furnished. At trial, the court ruled that the answer did not join issue upon the quantity of work done. The defendant\u2019s motion thereupon made for an amendment of his answer, so that it joined issue in that respect, was denied; but he was permitted to withdraw a juror in order that he might apply at Special Term. That court granted the motion, upon payment of $10 costs and of the fees for witnesses in attendance upon the day of trial. The terms are wholly inadequate. The order must be modified, by providing as a condition thereof that the defendant pay the costs of the action antecedent to the granting of the order. Bruns v. Brooklyn Citizen, 98 App. Div. 316, 90 N. Y. Supp. 701.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-10\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> 'The contention that the answer did not require amendment should not be considered, for the defendant, so far as this appeal is concerned, admitted in effect that his answer was insufficient, when he withdrew a juror and subsequently applied at Special Term for an amendment thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-11\">The order must be modified, without costs of the appeal to either party, by providing as a condition that the defendant within 10 days pay the costs of the action antecedent to the granting of the order, and answer within 20 days, both from the entry of our order of modification. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
