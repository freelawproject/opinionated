Defendants tendered a deed, and noted plaintiff\u2019s default on the contract. Defendants, sought to: introduce evidence that plaintiff\u2019s assignor did not have the $30,500.in cash required to be paid as the balance of the purchase price; that he never offered performance, and was unable to perform, which evidence was excluded and defendants excepted. There is'proof of an encroachment by a wooden fence and by an adjoining two-story frame building; but; this objection was not raised until after plaintiff\u2019s assignor had refused to take title, and after his default had been noted. The defendants\u2019 proof to the effect that plaintiff\u2019s assignor at the time of the default stated that he refused to take title, because he had been unable to negotiate a loan and could not raise the money, was not contradicted, nor was the assignor\u2019s admission of his default under the contract explained.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">It was error to exclude proof that plaintiff\u2019s assignor was unable to perform. ' To put the defendants in default, it was necessary either that plaintiff\u2019s assignor should make a tender, which they refused, or else that there was some incumbrance on the property, which could not be removed. Alpern v. Farrell, 133 App. Div. 278, 280-1, 117 \u00d1. Y. Supp. 706; Ziehen v. Smith, 148 N. Y. 558, 42 N. E. 1080. New objections to the title, made after the default, are not available to defeat the defendants\u2019 right to retain a forfeited deposit, unless it is shown that the objection could not have been obviated by the seller. Higgins v. Eagleton, 155 N. Y. 466, 472-4, 50 N. E. 287. It does not appear that it was beyond the power of the defendants to remove the encroachments of which plaintiff now complains.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Judgment reversed; and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellants to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">GERARD, J.-, concurs in result. PAGE, J., concurs on the first ground stated.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
