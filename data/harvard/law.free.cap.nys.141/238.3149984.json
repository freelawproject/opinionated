The complaint sets forth \u2022 the bills of lading, and, after alleging shipment of the consignment to the United States arid its arrival in Boston, Mass., sets forth the agreement in the bills of lading that the Harter Act (Act Feb. 13, 1893, c. 105, 27 Stat. 445, 4 Fed. St. Ann. p. 854 [U. S. Comp. St. 1901, p. 2946]), which provides in substance that a carrier may not exempt itself from liability for negligence in the loading, stowage, care, and custody of merchandise with which it is intrusted, shall govern the stipulations therein, when the merchandise is carried to the United States, and that any stipulation contrary to the provisions of Congress, and especially the Harter Act, shall in that event be inoperative. The answer denies damage arising from defendant\u2019s negligence, expressly admits in the sixth paragraph that the stipulation above referred to is in the bills of lading, and in the sixteenth paragraph sets up as a separate defense certain clauses of the bills of lading exonerating the defendant from liability, and providing that the contract shall be governed by British law.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-10\">The order appealed from strikes out the words \u201cor otherwise\u201d in paragraph 16 of the answer relating to such exemptions, and also the words, \u201cThis contract shall be governed by British law, except that,\u201d as irrelevant and redundant, pursuant to section 545 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The order also denies plaintiff\u2019s motion to strike out as irrelevant and redundant all of paragraph 17 of the answer, which sets up as a separate defense that the contract is to be governed by British law, and further directs that the answer be made more definite and certain, in that the defendant, instead of alleging the exempted clauses of the bills of lading, as it has done under subdivisions 1 and 2 of said sixteenth paragraph, should allege each affirmative defense, which should be separately numbered and contain a statement of the facts constituting such defense in ordinary and concise language, without repetition. The order further denies plaintiff\u2019s motion for a bill of particulars, without prejudice to a renewal thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-11\"><bracketnum>[1,2]</bracketnum> The parties having, by their own act, stipulated in the bills <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>of lading that the provisions thereof set'forth in the sixteenth paragraph of the answer should, upon shipment to the United States, which is admitted in the answer, be eliminated from the contract, the contract as so amended is to be deemed the contract between the parties, and upon the trial of the action the defendant, under the admissions contained in the answer, would not be entitled to introduce evidence in support of such allegations. Yet, though it is evident the denial of the motion to strike out may work great hardship and injustice to the plaintiff, in forcibly compelling him to go to the expense of taking by commission evidence which will be inadmissible on the trial, under the established rules of law governing the striking out of separate pleas as redundant and irrelevant, the order, so far as it strikes out the separate defense in the-sixteenth paragraph, cannot be sustained.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-5\">\u201cSection 545 of the Code of Civil Procedure does, not authorize a motion-to strike out an entire pleading or plea as irrelevant or redundant matter, but only irrelevant or redundant matter contained therein.\u201d Stroock Plush Co. v. Talcott, 129 App. Div. 14, 113 N. Y. Supp. 214. \"</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-6\">\u201cAn entire defense, even though insufficient in law, cannot be stricken out as irrelevant, redundant, or scandalous.\u201d Gibson v. McDonald, 139 App. Div. 51, 123 N. Y. Supp. 504.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">The order must therefore be modified, so as to1 deny the motion to strike out portions of the sixteenth paragraph of the answer, and, as so modified, affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements of appeal to the defendant appellant. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
