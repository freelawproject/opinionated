From an order of the New York City Court, denying a motion to resettle the clerk\u2019s minutes, so as to show that a verdict was rendered for defendant Henry Kuntz only, instead of in favor of all the defendants, and to resettle the judgment and order denying a motion for new trial, so as to show that the verdict was for defendant Kuntz only, and to resettle the judgment roll by inserting, certain papers alleged to have been omitted therefrom, plaintiff appeals.

The action was \"tried only as against defendant Kuntz, and judgment was rendered in favor of defendant Kuntz only; but the clerk\u2019s minutes read: \u201cVerdict by direction for the defendants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-16\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The appeal papers are defective, in that they contain neither the judgment roll nor the papers alleged to have been omitted. Plaintiff\u2019s time to appeal from the judgment and order denying motion for a new trial has expired. We therefore cannot reverse the order denying. the motion to' add papers to the judgment roll.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-17\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> There is nothing in the judgment or order which prejudicially affects the plaintiff appellant\u2019s rights. To resettle them nunc pro tunc, as requested, might in effect extend plaintiff\u2019s time to appeal, which the court had no power to do. Guarantee Trust Co. v. P. R. &amp; N. E. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>R. Co., 160 N. Y. 1, 7, 54 N. E. 575; Code, \u00a7 784. But the clerk\u2019s minutes do erroneously purport to show a verdict for all the defendants, instead of a verdict for Kuntz alone. This might bar an action .against, or be an adjudication in favor of, the other defendants. It .should therefore be corrected. Clark v. Scovill, 198 N. Y. 279, 285, 286, 91 N. E. 800, 802, 803. And to prevent any possibility of the \u25a0clerk\u2019s minutes being an adjudication of a broader determination than was involved, the order should be modified by directing that the clerk\u2019s minutes be amended so as to read, \u201cVerdict for the defendant Kuntz,\u201d in the place and stead of \u201cVerdict by direction \"for the defendants,\u201d and, as so modified, affirmed, without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
