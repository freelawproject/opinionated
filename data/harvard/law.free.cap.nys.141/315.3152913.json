The charges were substantial. The commissioner found the explanation insufficient. The proceedings taken were in conformity with the provisions of the statute. Under such circumstances, the court will not review, in a mandamus proceeding, the action of the commissioner, and determine whether he ought to have been satisfied with the explanation tendered. The demurrer to the alternative writ was properly sustained, but the order and the interlocutory judgment should not have granted leave to obtain a further writ upon the petition as filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">The judgment and order appealed from should therefore be modified, by striking out the leave granted, and, as so modified, affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
