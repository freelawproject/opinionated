Subsequent to the e'ntry of the decree the defendant changed the name of his business to \u201cLenox Dress Manufacturing Company,\u201d and continued it at the same place under that name. He then ceased to manufacture waists as separate garments at that place; but he continued to sell waists there which; he had manufactured at another place and designated by tags attached thereto as \u201cPreferential\u201d waists.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>Both the dignity of the court and the rights of a party at whose instance an injunction is issued require that it shall be fairly observed; and the court may and should punish a plain evasion, as well as a direct violation thereof. Mayor v. N. Y. &amp; S. I. Ferry Co., 64 N. Y. 622; Brown v. Braunstein, 86 App. Div. 499, 83 N. Y. Supp. 798; Hildreth v. McCaul, 70 App. Div. 615, 74 N. Y. Supp. 1075; Devlin v. Devlin, 69 N. Y. 212, 25 Am. Rep. 173; Fischer v. Blank, 81 Hun, 579, 31 N. Y. Supp. 10. The manufacture and sale of <em>dresses, </em>which includes waists, either as separate garments or united with skirts, under the name \u201cLenox Dress Manufacturing Company,\u201d was a plain violation of the decree, as was likewise the sale of waists at a place of business conducted under the name \u201cLenox Dress Manufacturing Company,\u201d notwithstanding the fact that the waists were manufactured elsewhere and were tagged with the name \u201cPreferential.\u201d It is inconceivable that the defendant could have acted in good faith toward the decree of the court in thus continuing business; and the inference is irresistible that in defiance of the decree of the court he refused to discontinue the use of the name \u201cLenox,\u201d and determined to secure whatever advantage or prestige he could in the use of that name in his business in manufacturing and selling waists, either as separate garments or attached to skirts and forming parts of dresses.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">It follows that the order should be reversed; with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion granted, with $10 costs, and that a formal order should be entered adjudging defendant guilty of contempt of court and fining him $250 therefor, and providing that he shall stand committed until the same is paid. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
