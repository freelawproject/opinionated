As a first separate defense, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>sets out that- plaintiff \u201coffered, as a physician and surgeon, to attend to the operation and treatment, and that the total expense of said operation and treatment would be the sum of $300.\u201d As plaintiff\u2019s claim for his individual services is $588, -this is, no doubt, a partial defense to that claim, but its relation to the assigned claims is- not clear. The second defense is, in substance, that plaintiff \u201cmisrepresented\u201d the nature of defendant\u2019s wife\u2019s disease, \u201crepresented\u201d also-that she would recover within two weeks, all of which was untrue, that plaintiff was not a surgeon, and that defendant\u2019s wife died. As a third separate defense, defendant pleads what is equivalent to malpractice, or rather want of good judgment and reasonable care on-plaintiff\u2019s part.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">After an' order permitting an omnibus examination of plaintiff on practically all the issues raised by these pleadings had been granted, the order was modified by permitting an examination only concerning the alleged agreement to render all the services necessary at a total cost of.$300.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-6\">It appears to me that the establishment of the agreement pleaded by defendant depends upon a conversation between plaintiff and defendant, as to which, manifestly, plaintiff\u2019s version must be different from defendant\u2019s, but of which defendant\u2019s testimony will be ample- and competent evidence. In that respect, therefore, the examination! of plaintiff should be denied. See Skolny v. Richter, 132 App. Div. 680, 117 N. Y. Supp. 297; also Kornbluth v. Isaacs, 149 App. Div. 108, 133 N. Y. Supp. 737, affirming, on the opinion below, an order of Mr. Justice Lehman.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-7\">As to the second separate defense, namely, the \u201cmisrepresentations,\u201d I am unable to understand how the statements claimed to have been made by plaintiff, as pleaded, can in any aspect be regarded as representations of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-8\">As to the third separate defense, namely, malpractice, and regardless of the question whether the issues thereby raised might be proved' under a general denial, I think that the defendant is entitled to examine the plaintiff.'</p>\n<p id=\"b942-9\">Order modified, by limiting the examination of- the plaintiff to the issues raised by defendant\u2019s third separate defense, and, as modified,, affirmed without costs to either party. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
