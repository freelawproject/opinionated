The defense relied upon at the trial was the statute of frauds, viz., that no valid sale was shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-20\">An order on a blank printed by defendant, with its name and address at the top, for the sale of the goods in question to the plaintiffs, giving the terms of sale, time of delivery, and price of each item of goods, was signed by one of the plaintiffs. At the foot of the order was a printed guaranty of the price, coupled with the privilege of canceling the order, signed, in print, with the name of defendant. An unsigned letter to plaintiffs\u2019 firm, with defendant\u2019s name and address on the letter head, acknowledging the entry of plaintiffs\u2019 order, was delivered to one of the plaintiffs. The defendant\u2019s president testified that the plaintiffs\u2019 order was placed upon its books as an order, but that its counsel later advised it that it was invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-21\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> A printed signature will answer the requirements of the statute of frauds, and where a trader who is in the habit of delivering printed bills of parcels, to which his name is prefixed, delivers one containing the necessary particulars of the contract, it is sufficient.
