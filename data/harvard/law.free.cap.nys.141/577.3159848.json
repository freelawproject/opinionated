No other permits to be granted by Mr. Hamilton, only to me, during the time specified.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-20\">\u201c[Signed] Lewis Smith, 162 Sherman Avenue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-21\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The action was brought to recover two installments under this contract. Appellant contends that the contract is invalid, as lacking mutuality, too indefinite, and without consideration. It is evident on the face of this contract that none of these objections have any merit whatever.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-22\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The appellant also contends that the dump referred to did not belong to the plaintiff, and the plaintiff did not have the right to use it, or allow any one else to use it. On the cross-examination of plaintiff, certain questions asked by defendant\u2019s counsel, tending to show that the plaintiff did not own the dump or have any control of it were ruled out. These questions should have been allowed, and because of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>the nonallowance of these questions the judgment must be reversed-</p>\n<p id=\"AxB\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
