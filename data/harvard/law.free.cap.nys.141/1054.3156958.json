The merits of the issues involved in the proceeding in which the surrogate\u2019s decree was made were not involved in the action in this court, and hence appellant, \u00e1s to such issues, was not concluded by the judgment therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-8\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Nor is this result affected by the fact that the Supreme Court had co-ordinate jurisdiction with the Surrogate\u2019s Court to settle the executor\u2019s account, inasmuch as the decree of that of the two' courts which first assumed jurisdiction would be binding upon the other, and an effectual bar to a second action. Upon the merits of the order appealed from, we are not satisfied with the decision made by the learned surrogate. Without intending to express any opinion upon the facts as they may ultimately appear, we think there was sufficient in the moving papers to have induced the learned surrogate to grant appellant\u2019s motion to set aside the decree settling respondent\u2019s accounts, and to give appellant a day in court to prove whatever facts she can, justifying a resettling of such accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-9\">The order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, the motion granted, and the proceedings remitted to the surrogate, to proceed in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-10\">DOWLING.
