The verdict was for the full amount of commissions claimed in each count and interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number><bracketnum>[1, 2]</bracketnum> The first cause of action is on an alleged oral contract; and the second is based on a contract in writing subsequently made. _ The claim under the oral contract is for commissions on sales amounting to $104,375, made to one Burchell in the months of January and February, 1908. It is not controverted that Burchell bought the paintings and other works of art on which plaintiff claims commissions of the decedent. The answer of the appellants, however, denied that there was' any contract by which the decedent was obligated to pay commissions; but they introduced no evidence. The learned counsel for the appellants contend with respect to the recovery on the first cause of action that the plaintiff was acting as the agent of the purchaser; that the evidence adduced to establish the oral contract with the decedent was not sufficiently clear and convincing to require the submission of the case to the jury in an action against an estate, and, if it was, then that the verdict on that issue is against the weight of the evidence; and that since an express contract to pay fixed commissions was alleged the court erred in permitting a recovery on quantum meruit. The first cause'of action is on an express contract to pay commissions of 10 per centum on all sales effected by the plaintiff. There is no evidence tending to show an express agreement with respect to the amount of the commissions. The court ruled that, if the plaintiff procured the purchaser under a contract of employment, he could recover the reasonable value of the services rendered; and on that issue both the testimony of experts and evidence with respect to the commissions customarily paid in that line of business were received over objection and exception duly taken by defendants. The evidence was uncontroverted that the services were worth 10 per centum, which was the usual commission. When this evidence was offered, counsel for defendants stated that he was not prepared to meet that issue, but he did not ask for an adjournment, and rested on the plaintiff\u2019s case without manifesting a desire or requesting an opportunity to obtain or offer evidence in rebuttal. It is well settled that in an action on an express contract a recovery may be had on quantum meruit (Sussdorff v. Schmidt, 55 N. Y. 319; Shirk v. Brookfield, 77 App. Div. 295, 79 N. Y. Supp. 225; Rubin y. Cohen, 129 App. Div. 395, 113 N. Y. Supp. 843); and that such evidence is competent to show the value of the services, and on the theory that the parties are presumed to have had the customary rate in mind in contracting (Walls v. Bailey, 49 N. Y. 464, 10 Am. Rep. 407; Newhall v. Appleton, 114 N. Y. 144, 21 N. E. 105, 3 L. R. A. 859; Reynolds v, Everett, 144 N. Y. 193, 39 N. E. 72; Rickerson v. Hartford Fire Ins. Co., 149 N. Y. 316, 43 N. E. 856; Underwood v. Greenwich Ins. Co., 161 N. Y. 424, 55 N. E. 936; Robinson v. N. Y. &amp; Texas S. Co., 63 App. Div. 217, 71 N. Y. Supp. 424).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> Burchell informed and wrote decedent on January 22, and 27, 1908, that plaintiff was his agent in purchasing paintings; but it is evident that he did not intend to concede that plaintiff was in his employ, for he never paid plaintiff any commission, and says that he merely meant that from time to time, when he desired a painting by a certain artist, he requested the plaintiff \"to look up the best he could find by that artist.\u201d But, if plaintiff was Burchell\u2019s agent, that fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>was not concealed from the decedent, and it would not relieve his estate from paying a commission to plaintiff, if decedent promised it in consideration of plaintiff\u2019s bringing Burchell to his store, which is all that plaintiff appears to have done in the premises, either for the decedent or for Burchell. All of the negotiations were conducted by Burchell personally in his own behalf, and for the decedent either by himself or by salesmen in the store, and plaintiff was neither vested with any discretion, concerning prices or terms of payment, by either of them, nor did hq take part or participate in any manner in negotiating any of the sales, and therefore the rule which precludes the recovery of commissions by an agent who acts for both parties does not apply. See Tieck v. McKenna, 115 App. Div. 702, 101 N. Y. Supp. 317; Jarvis v. Schaefer, 105 N. Y. 289, 11 N. E. 634; Knauss v. K. B. Co., 142 N. Y. 70, 36 N. E. 867. The information which the decedent thus received with respect to plaintiff\u2019s being agent for Burchell bears on the construction to be placed on the conversations and relations between plaintiff and decedent upon which employment of the former by the latter is predicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> The evidence tends to show that on or about the 14th of January, 1908, plaintiff brought Burchell, who had never been there before, to decedent\u2019s gallery and introduced him to Stollberg, the manager, who was in charge in the absence of the decedent; that they looked at some pictures casually, but Burchell did not then or thereafter purchase any of them; that plaintiff and Burchell called again on January 20th, and on that occasion decedent was present and exhibited pictures and other works of art and made sales to Burchell amounting to $3,250, and of the pictures exhibited at that time there were three, each painting by a different artist, and it appears that subsequently Burchell bought of decedent a picture by each of these artists aggregating $25,700, but it does not appear whether or not they were the same pictures by those artists exhibited to Burchell on-January 20th, when plaintiff was present; that they next called together February 17th, and looked at more pictures, one of which Burchell bought February 20th for $2,600, and a picture by Israels was exhibited at- that time, and it appears that on February 25th Burchell bought a painting by Israels of decedent for $29,250, but it does not appear whether or not this was the same painting exhibited to Burchell on February 20th, when plaintiff was present. There is no evidence that plaintiff on any occasion drew Burchell\u2019s attention to any picture or other work of art which he subsequently purchased, and of the total purchases aggregating $104,375, on which plaintiff has recovered commissions on the first cause of action, those which aggregate $5,850 are the only purchases of pictures and other works of art clearly shown by the evidence to, have been exhibited to or even seen by Burchell on any. occasion when \"plaintiff accompanied him to the -decedent\u2019s gallery. Burchell\u2019s interest in the other paintings and a bronze which he purchased appears to have been aroused on other occasions when he visited the gallery alone. There is no evidence that plaintiff assisted in the least in bringing about any of these sales, otherwise than by bringing Burchell to the gallery on the occasions specified, and at various other times. Stollberg testified that, when plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>tiff first brought Burchell to the gallery, plaintiff said to him as they were leaving, \u201cI brought in Mr. Burchell, and I expect to be looked after regarding commissions,\u201d to which he replied, \u201cI will see Mr. Schaus, and Mr. Schaus will see you;\u201d that he informed the decedent next day that plaintiff had called with Burchell, and that he had shown them several pictures, and that plaintiff \u201chad mentioned regarding his commission * * * that Mr. Clapp had said to me he expected his commission,\u201d and that the decedent said, \u201cThat is all right,\u201d but that he never communicated this to plaintiff. It was not shown that it was ever communicated to plaintiff, or that there was any conversation between him and decedent on the subject. Stollberg had made an affidavit with respect to this matter, from which he omitted what he testified the decedent said, and therefore, if that fact were of importance, it is doubtful whether it was satisfactorily established. But I fail to see its materiality since it was not communicated to plaintiff, or its communication to him authorized. It could not in and of itself be held to constitute an agreement with plaintiff to pay him commissions. Plaintiff\u2019s version of this conversation is that he told Stollberg that Burchell was his customer, and that he would expect Stollberg \u201cto look after\u201d him, and that he wanted \u201cmy commission,\u201d and that Stollberg said \u201cthat would be all right; T will see Mr. Schaus.\u2019 Burchell had no recollection of any conversation at that time. According to Stollberg, plaintiff and Burchell often came to the gallery when he was there, but he made none of the sales to Burchell, and nothing further was said about commissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">By a contract in writing made on the 24th day of February, 1908, the decedent employed plaintiff -for one year from March 1st thereafter to devote his entire time and energy to selling paintings and water colors on a salary and commission basis. Plaintiff worked for the decedent under that contract during the entire year, and neither demanded nor claimed to be entitled to the commissions now sought to be recovered by the first cause of action until after the expiration of that year. One Little, an employ\u00e9 of the decedent, testified that about the time the plaintiff left decedent\u2019s employ at the expiration of the written contract he overheard a dispute between them in which plaintiff said to decedent, \u201cMr. Schaus, you owe me more commissions on pictures sold to Mr. Burchell,\u201d to which decedent yelled out an reply, \u201cI paid you as much on those pictures as I am going to pay you,\u201d and that the plaintiff then said, \u201cYou must think I am a damn kid or you wouldn\u2019t treat me this way.\u201d The second cause of action is also for commissions on sales to Burchell in part, and it does not appear which commissions\u2014whether on pictures sold before -or after the employment in writing\u2014were the subject of this discussion. The same witness, however, testified- that about two months after plaintiff was employed for a year decedent asked \"him about the business; and, upon being told that it was dull, remarked, \u201cIt is a good thing that Clapp brought in Burchell, \u2022even if I had to pay him commissions on all sales.\u201d Another employ\u00e9 of decedent testified that in the month of February, 1908, he asked for an increase in salary, and decedent stated, among other things, that he could not increase his salary much at that time \u201con account of the sales made to Mr. Burchell would have to be\u2014at least, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>there would be commissions paid to Mr. Clapp, being the one bringing Mr. Burchell in.\u201d That indicates that the decedent intended to pay plaintiff some commissions, but it was not necessarily an admission of a binding agreement therefor. He may at that time have deemed it advisable from a business standpoint to do so, but have changed his mind when by the contract in writing he secured plaintiff\u2019s services for one year. Moreover, it does not appear, otherwise than by the statement itself, whether it was made before or after the employment for a year, and it may have related to that contract. The only other item of evidence tending to support the plaintiff\u2019s claim is an entry in the decedent\u2019s journal, made by his bookkeeper who was not called as a witness, under date of \u201cApril,\u201d 1908, under plaintiff\u2019s name, ae follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-3\">Commission allowed on sales as per instruction of Mr. H. Schaus.. $1,600</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">\u2014under which appears in pencil in the handwriting of the bookkeeper :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-5\">Should have been posted as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-6\">Expense a/c Gratification............................... $1,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-7\">\u201c Salary a/c..................................... 600 $1,600</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-8\">as per verbal statement made later by Mr. Hermann Schaus.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-9\">The ledger account of plaintiff on decedent\u2019s books contained an</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-10\">entry under date of April 30, 1908, of a credit to plaintiff \u201cBy Comm. #1 <em>/'r\\r\\ r\\r\\ </em>\u2018,i_ 1 1_ \u2022, __ <em>r </em>_ 11 _ <em>J </em>$1,600.00,\u201d with debit items as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-12\">1908 Mcb. 1.

M M ..174........................ $1,600 oo</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-14\">Payments of these amounts were shown to have been made to plaintiff by decedent by checks' on the respective dates, with the exception that the check for $1,000 is dated March 3, 1908. The decedent\u2019s cash book shows an entry under plaintiff\u2019s name, as follows: \u201cOn account $1,000, March 2nd,\u201d 1908. The attempt to destroy the admission contained in the original entry to the effect that the decedent was entitled to credit for $1,600 for commissions was not successful, for, assuming the entry to have been made the last day of April, the decedent would not then have been indebted to him for $600 on account of salary at $50 per week from March 1, 1908. Although the decedent thus admitted that he was obligated to pay plaintiff some commissions, we find therein no support for the claim for commissions, on all sales that might ever be made to Burchell after plaintiff accompanied him to' the decedent\u2019s gallery, whether in plaintiff\u2019s presence or absence and regardless of whether he took any part in drawing the attention of the purchaser to the painting or other work of art, recommending it to him, or in the negotiations. It would require most clear and convincing evidence to establish such a contract resting in parol. The evidence in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>record is not of that character, and therefore the recovery cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\"><bracketnum>[5]</bracketnum> The contract made February 24, 1908, provided that plaintiff should receive \u201cfive per cent, commission on all of his sales up to three thousand dollars and two and one-half per cent, commission on all of his sales over three thousand dollars.\u201d The second cause of action is for commissions at the rate of 5 per centum on three pictures sold to Burchell, and half commissions on three sold to a Mrs. Darden. One of the pictures which plaintiff sold to Burchell under the contract of employment in writing was not owned by the decedent, and another was returned long after the sale as the result of negotiations between him and the decedent and in liquidation of Burchell\u2019s indebtedness for it and other pictures and works of art. The plaintiff was entitled to commissions on unconditional sales made for the decedent regardless of ownership, and his right thereto could not be affected by a new contract under which the return of a picture was accepted. The third picture was imported to sell to Burchell, and the sale was effected by the plaintiff. The recovery of commissions on those three sales was fully warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">The plaintiff sold one painting to Mrs. Darden for more than $3,-000 February 9, 1909. The evidence satisfactorily shows that he sold the three others on which a recovery has been had on the second cause of action to her at the same time, but he claimed that he sold two of them to her on January 9, 1909. He received the lower rate of commissions on all of these sales, and now contends that they are to be regarded as separate sales, and that on the three, each of which sold for less than $3,000, he is entitled to the higher rate. The recovery on that theory manifestly was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\"><bracketnum>[6]</bracketnum> We are also of opinion that the presentation of the claim to the testator did not dispense with the necessity of presenting it to the executors, if plaintiff desired to recover costs against them. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7\u00a7 1835, 1836.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">The judgment and order should therefore be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to appellants to abide the event, unless the plaintiff stipulates to reduce the recovery to $622.27, the amount recovered on the second cause of action, less $134.37 and interest thereon from said February 9, 1909, to the date of the rendition of the verdict, and if he shall so stipulate then the judgment is modified accordingly and by striking out the costs, and affirmed without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">INGRAHAM, P.
