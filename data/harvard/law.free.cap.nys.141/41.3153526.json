J.</author>\n<p id=\"AdO\">Edmund S. Bailey, a resident of the county -of New York, died on November 4, 1908, leaving a last will and testament and two codicils thereto, which were admitted to probate by the surrogate of the county of New York. He left him surviving a widow, Susannah Gibson Bailey, and four children by a former wife. \"One of the testator\u2019s children, a son named Edmund Smith Bailey, died on January 5, 1912, at the age of 23 years, leaving a last will \u2022and testament which was duly admitted to probate, and which left substantially all his property to his trustees, the income to be paid to his wife for life and the remainder to his' issue, with a remainder over in default of issue to such person or persons as his wife should \u25a0designate by a last will and testament.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">The question presented on this appeal is as to what interest, if .any, of the estate of the testator, Edmund S. Bailey, passed under the will of his son, Edmund Smith Bailey, to the legatees or devisees therein named, and the question presented depends upon whether Edmund Smith Bailey took a vested remainder in the property left \"by the will of the testator, Edmund S. Bailey. The testator, as referred to in this opinion, will be Edmund S. Bailey, under whose will the trust was created. As before stated, the testator left two sons \u25a0and two daughters. One son died after the death of the testator under 30 years of age. I shall discuss this question on the assumption that the one object we have is to ascertain the intent of the testator, and that all so-called canons of construction are to give way in case that intent can be ascertained from the will; and for that purpose an -analysis of the will is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">By paragraphs 3 and 4 of the will the testator gave to the sons .certain articles of personal property, such as portraits, jewelry, and family heirlooms. The third clause recited:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-9\">\u201cAnd whereas my late wife\u2019s aunt Mrs. Jane V. C. Cooper died some years -since leaving a will by which she made certain provisions for the three elder of my children and no provision for my youngest child, Edmund S. Bailey, whereby should my property be equally divided among my children, he would not be so well off pecuniarily as the others, owing to the said provision made for -them by Mrs. Cooper, now in order to remedy such inequality, I provide that before division of my residuary real estate into shares .under the Ninth clause of this will, my trustees shall set apart therefrom for the benefit of my son Edmund S. Bailey, the sum or. value in their opinion of $20,000 and after the division of the balance of the said residuary estate into as many equal shares as I leave children or descendants of children under the said Ninth clause, the said $20,000 so first set apart shall be added -to the aliquot part of my son Edmund S. Bailey, in the balance of said residuary estate, and to be held for his benefit and to belong, to him, subject to the provisions as to the income and principal of my residuary estate, and the trust shares therein hereinafter contained.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>The testator then passes to what seemed to have been the predominant intent which controlled the disposition of his property; i. e., to provide for his wife. By the sixth clause of his will he gives all of his household furniture, books, linen, and plate, etc., to his wife absolutely, and then gives her the use of his house in the city for her life, free of all charges, taxes and assessments, which are to be paid by the trustees, to which by a codicil to the will he added a life estate in his country home on Long Island, also free from all charges, taxes, and assessments, which are to be paid by trustees. By the seventh clause of his will all the rest, residue, and remainder of the estate is given to trustees with detailed directions as to its investments. He directs that the trust fund shall continue during the life of his wife, and from the net income thereof the trustees shall pay to her quarterly $5,000, making an annual income of $20,000 a year. Here is the clearly expressed intention that his wife shall have these two houses free of all charges and $20,000 a year during her life, and there is to be no disposition of any of the income of the estate during the life of his wife until these specific provisions for his wife shall have been paid; no diminution of income shall affect the position of his wife and the interest of the children was subject to the interest of the wife during her life. Then follows a direction that out of any balance of income received from the residuary estate, after his wife has been provided for, the trustees should pay to Edmund the income earned from the $20,000, which the third clause of the will provided should belong to Edmund; that balance of net income shall be divided among his four children or descendants of children including the said Edmund, the trustees to apply such shares of income to tl.r use of those of his children or descendants who shall be infants and pay over to those of them who shall have reached majority the shares of income set apart for them, the descendant of any deceased child to take the share which the parent would havfe taken if living. There is, as to descendants, during life of the wife, the provision that the descendants of the deceased children should take the parent\u2019s share of the income. The testator in this provision had in mind the possibility of one of the children dying during the continuance of the trust estate leaving descendants; if a child died leaving descendants, the income was to be paid to the descendants. The income was to be divided, and that means from time to time as it accrued, into as many shares as he left children or descendants of children. So it seems to me that from time to time the trustees should make division and pay over to the children or descendants of child the share of income, and that provision was to continue during the term of the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">By the ninth clause provision is made for division of estate after the death of his wife, and for the final disposition of the trust estate. Upon the death of his wife he directs that the whole residuary estate, including real property left to wife or proceeds if sold, should be divided by trustees, subject to provision for the income of Edmund, \u201cinto as many equal shares as I shall leave children, or descendants of children, one share for the benefit of each child and one for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>benefit of the descendants taken together of any such deceased child,\u201d and the said shares shall be held and managed by my trustees and the income paid \"as directed. Here the testator seems to have had in mind the possibility of a child dying before the termination of the life estate of the wife of testator. But there was to be no division of the residuary estate until the death of his wife, and then the residuary estate was to be divided into as many shares as he sho\u201euld leave children or descendants of children. The residuary estate having been thus divided, the trustees were directed to hold each share during the infancy of the person for whom it was to be held, and to apply the income for the benefit of such persons, \u201cand as each of said beneficiaries reaches the age of twenty-one years, he or she shall be paid thereafter the net income of the trust share held for him or her; unless such person was born after my death, in which case he or she shall be paid the principal of the trust share held for him or her to the time of attaining majority.\u201d Further it is provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-5\">\u201cUpon tlie attaining of the age of thirty years by either of my sons, the principal of the share until that time held for such son shall after the death of my wife be paid over, transferred or cojtveyed to himand added: \u201cShould either of my sons or daughters at any time die before me, leaving lawful issue surviving, such issue shall take the same share of principal and the same share of income the parent, my son or daughter, would have taken under this will if living.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">The tenth clause relates to the shares of his two daughters, which were to be held in trust during their lives, except that $20,000 should be paid to each daughter upon her becoming 30 years of age, and this clause contained the provision that, in case of the death of a daughter, the share shall go to her issue, if any, in equal shares per stirpes, but, in case she shall leave no issue, .then the trust share to that time held for her shall go to \u201ca charitable corporation\u201d named. Thus the testator by most minute provisions provided for the disposition of the property to be held for each of his sons in the event of his son dying during the lifetime of the testator, and further provided for the shares to be held for his' daughters, making provision for the ultimate disposition of the trust property dependent upon the daughter\u2019s dying with or without issue. But it is also-to be noticed that with regard to the $20,000, which each daughter should receive at the age of 30, there was no provision made for the disposition of that sum in the event of the daughter dying before reaching that age. If a daughter should die before 30 years of age, she would not be entitled to receive this sum of $20,000, and there is no provision for any other disposition of that sum in that event. The eleventh and twelfth clauses of the will give to the executors and trustees power of sale of all the real property, and contain directions as to the management of the trusts. The fifteenth clause provided for the appointment of executors and trustees.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">The will was dated April 18, 1904. Testator\u2019s oldest son, the appellant, became 30 years of age January, 1912, and therefore apparently was 22 years of age when the will was made. Both daughters were under age and unmarried at the date of making of the will. The youngest son Edmund was 14 or 15 years at time will was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>made. The testator made two codicils to the will; first dated October 26, 1906, by which he left his country house to his wife as stated, the second codicil dated September 23, 1907, in which he substituted a new executor for Mr. Man, who had died in the meantime, in each \u25a0case republishing his will as modified by the codicil, and he died November 4, 1908, while his youngest son Edmund was still an infant. The testator\u2019s widow is still alive, but his youngest son died on or about January 5, 1912, about 23 years of age, leaving a last will and testament by which he gave all of his property to his executors in trust to pay the income thereof to his wife during her life with a remainder to her issue, or, in default of her issue, to such persons as his wife should appoint by her last will and testament. The court found that since the death of the testator the income had amounted to upwards of $60,000 a year; that the additional income beyond that required for the provisions for the wife was divided among the testator\u2019s children up to the death of the youngest son, January, 1912. The court below held that the testator\u2019s son Edmund was not divested of his interest in the estate, either in income or remainder, by his death before he reached the age of 30 years; that his interest in the income and remainder of the estate passed under his will, and during the lifetime of the testator\u2019s widow the income payable on one-fourth of the residuary estate, and the principal of such part, should be payable in such manner, as provided by the will of said Edmund, the testator\u2019s youngest son.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The disposition of the surplus of income and the ultimate disposition of the principal are provided for by different clauses of the will, and the provisions in relation to them are quite different. The testator arranged to divide the balance of the income into as many shares as he had children or descendants of children. This division \u25a0of income necessarily related to the period in which the income has been received, and is to be divided. There could be no division of income until it had been created by the return on the investments, .and then it was to be divided into as many shares as the testator \u25a0 had children or the descendants of children. That income was payable to the children and the descendants of a deceased child, and under this provision no one else could be entitled to any part thereof. The testator in express terms limits the payment of that income to a child or the descendants of a deceased child. Here is express provision made for his grandchildren in case the parent should be dead at any time during the continuance of the trust. There was no vesting of income. As this income came into existence and thus became the income of the estate, it was directed to be distributed to the four children, but after the death of the youngest son, without leaving \u25a0descendants there was no direction by the testator that the income should be paid to any one except brothers and sisters, and I can find no expression in this will indicating the intention to pay the surplus income during the life of his wife to any person other than those directed by the testator to whom it should be paid, namely, the children or the descendants of a deceased child.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> As to the corpus of the estate, the situation is somewhat dif<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>ferent. The property existed at the time of the death of the testator. He gave it to his executors in trust, with a direction to sell the real property, except that which he had given to his wife for life, and there was, therefore, an equitable conversion of the decedent\u2019s real estate. That was by the express provision of the will to continue in one trust during the life of his wife. The primary object of the testator was to insure to her the support which he intended she should receive. There was and could be no division of this estate -into-shares during the life of his wife, for during that period the whole of the estate was to be preserved to- produce the income, which he had provided should be paid to her. It was only the surplus or that which remained that was to be divided among his children. The testator evidently recognized the possibility of depreciation in value of the .property and diminution in income, either before or after his death. But, whatever might happen, the primary object of the trust and the preferential payment qf the income was to make good to the wife the amount of support that he intended she should receive.. Thus by express terms of the will the first division of the estate, the first vesting, or the first setting apart of the shares of each child was. to happen after the death of the wife. It was then that the share of each child should come into existence, and it seems to me that it was t-hen and then only that a share existed. It was on the death of his-wife that the trustees were to divide the property that they had held in one trust during the life of his wife into as many shares as he had children or descendants of children whose parent was dead, the descendants to take by way of representation. As before stated, when the will was made, his eldest son had just become of age, and we assume the other children were unmarried and minors, and the youngest son did not become of age until years after the testator died. But for the last clause of the ninth clause of the will I should have no-hesitancy in saying the testator had deliberately intended that this-provision for his children should be contingent upon their surviving their mother, the life beneficiary; but the further provision is that,, in the event of the death of \u00e1ny one of them before the death of their mother, the descendants of the one dying.should take by way of representation the parent\u2019s share. Undoubtedly the moment the testator\u2019s wife died the shares would vest, but it was to the condition then-existing that he directed the disposition of the estate and the ascertainment of just who were to become the owners of the shares, then-for the first time created. Therefore I am inclined, to the view that futurity was of the nature of this gift.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">I am well aware of a line of cases, of which Warner v. Durant, 76 N. Y. 133, Canfield v. Fallon, 43 App. Div. 561, 57 N. Y. Supp. 149, affirmed 161 N. Y. 623, 55 N. E. 1093, Vanderpoel v. Loew, 112 N. Y. 167, 19 N. E. 481, and Steinway v. Steinway, 163 N. Y. 183, 57 N. E. 312, are examples. But in each case the will was different from the will in question. Take the case of Vanderpoel v. Loew,. 112 N. Y. 167, 19 N. E. 481, which was greatly relied upon at Special Term and by the respondent upon this appeal. In that case the will provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>\u201cWhenever any1 one o\u00a3 my said children shall depart this life leaving lawful issue him or her surviving, them my said executors shall set apart one undivided one fourth part of all the rest, residue and remainder of my estate so invested for the benefit of my children as above mentioned * * * and shall invest the same in the way and manner above mentioned for the use and benefit of the issues of such deceased child * * and shall use and employ the rents, issues, profits and income thereof for its or their maintenance and education; or in case it or they shall be of a sufficient age to justify the same, then to pay over such rents, issues and profits to it or them, until it or they shall respectively arrive at the age of thirty years when the whole of the principal so set apart as above mentioned, or such part thereof as they may be respectively entitled to (if the issue shall consist of more than one) shall be paid over to it or them; to have and to hold the same to it or them, to its or their sole use, benefit and behoof forever.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">In that case the contested question was whether the power of alienation was suspended unlawfully, and the Court of Appeals held that the intention of the testator was to divide his estate into five separate trusts, no one of which was dependent upon more than two lives in being. But it was held that when the income and principal were given in equal shares, though out of one fund kept in solido for convenience of investment, the severance of the trust into its component parts has been adjudged, though the fund remains undivided. But in that case there was no postponement of the division of the estate into shares or the creation of the separate shares until the termination of the life estate. Immediately upon the death of the child, who was entitled to the income during his life, the executors were to set apart one-fourth part of the rest, residue, and remainder of the residuary estate for the use and benefit of the issue of such deceased child, and the fact that there was no direction to cut into as many parts as the children the testator left surviving did not prevent the court from decreeing such a severance immediately upon the death of the life beneficiary. Also, in that case, the beneficiary was-to receive the whole income until he arrived at the age of 30 years, when the principal was to be paid. Here there is no such provision until the death of the testator\u2019s widow, which is the first time at which the trustees can make a division of the estate. So in the case of Warner v. Durant, 76 N. Y. 133, testator gave the sum of $275,-000 to trustees to receive the rents, issues, and profits thereof, and during the continuance of the trust to pay annually 7 per cent, interest upon certain specified sums of money, of that $275,000, to several persons named, and at the expiration of five years to pay over the principal sum, upon which interest had been directed to be paid, to such persons to whom such interest money is directed to be paid. It was said by Folger, J.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-7\">\u201cWhere there is no gift but by a direction to executors or trustees to pay or divide, and to pay at a future time, the vesting in the beneficiary will not take place until that time arrives. Here the gift was at first to executors, to hold in trust for five years; at the expiration of that period to pay over to the legatee. But this rule does not act in this case; for there has been a distinction grafted upon it. It is this: Where the gift is to be severed instanter from the general estate, for the benefit of the legatee, and in the meantime the interest thereof is to be paid to him; that is indicative of the intent of the testator that the legatee shall at all events have the principal, and is to wait only for the payment, until the day fixed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>Speaking of the will in that case, the court said (76 N. Y. page 140):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-3\">\u201cThere was then a gift, though to executors in the first instance, of specified property at once to be severed from the bulk of the testator\u2019s estate for the benefit of the legatee, to be paid to him at the end of five years; and in the meantime the interest thereon to be paid to him. The intent of the testator, thus indicated, was that the legacy should vest in Oliver Blush at once.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">In this case the direction of the testator was to the direct contrary ; there is no division of any share of the estate until the death of the testator\u2019s wife, and then at once there comes into existence the several shares of the estate, then at once each share vests in a child whether he had arrived at the age of 30 years or not; but it seems to me that, until that time arrives, the distinction that had been grafted upon the rule indicated by Folger, J., did not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">So in Steinway v. Steinway, 163 N. Y. 183, 57 N. E. 312, the testator gave all his shares in the corporation of Steinway &amp; Sons to his executors to be held by them until January 1, 1904; one-fourth part for the benefit of his brother William, or in case of his death prior to January 1, 1904, to and for his children, with further provisions for the other shares of the stock. The court held that the shares vested absolutely in William\u2019s children at the time of the testator\u2019s death; the court saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-6\">\u201cThe import of the words employed is that each one of William\u2019s children is to take both income and principal in equal proportions and by that the testator meant that each one should take what he intended to give him separately and solely for himself or herself.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">That decision was based on Warner v. Durant, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">This case presents the same distinction between it and the case at bar as was noticed in the case of Warner v. Durant, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">On the other hand, we have a line of cases that seem to me to clearly hold that where the sole gift is a direction to pay over, convey, or transfer at a future time, and the interest of a legatee or a devisee is not to be severed from the corpus of the estate until the death of the life beneficiary, then there can be no vesting until the death of such life beneficiary. Delafield v. Shipman, 103 N. Y. 463, 9 N. E. 184; Schlereth v. Schlereth, 173 N. Y. 444, 66 N. E. 130, 93 Am. St. Rep. 616; Herzog v. Title G. &amp; T. Co., 177 N. Y. 86, 69 N. E. 283, 67 L. R. A. 146; Shipman v. Rollins, 98 N. Y. 311; Matter of Crane, 164 N. Y. 71, 58 N. E. 47; In re Baer, 147 N. Y. 348, 41 N. E. 702; Salter v. Drowne, 205 N. Y. 204, 98 N. E. 401.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-10\">We have pressed upon us in this case, both by the appellant and the respondents, certain so-called canons of construction which it is claimed should be applied in the construction of this will. Thus, it is said by the appellant that there is no direct devise or bequest in the will, but that the beneficiary takes by virtue of a direction to divide or convey, and that, therefore, there can be no vesting until the time of such division. On the other hand, the respondent contends that the law favors the vesting of estates, both real and personal, and the presumption is always against intestacy, and that such a'construction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>will be given to the will as will retain the testator\u2019s property in the hands of his descendants rather than in others not of his own blood. As I view it, all of these canons of construction have been applied as aids to ascertain the actual intention of the testator, and that, when within the four corners of the will such intention can be ascertained, effect must be given to it rather than applying established rules which will defeat such intention. The surplus income of the testator was to be divided among his children, and he had in mind the fact that one or more of his children might die during the lifetime of his wife, and so he provided that in the event of a child dying leaving issue the income should be paid to such issue. That was the only exception that he made to the general provision that the surplus income should be divided among his surviving children. Here the intention was clearly expressed, it seems to me, that the income should be paid to his own children, with the single exception that, where a child died leaving issue, th\u00e9 issue should take the parent\u2019s share of the income; and here care seems to have been taken to provide that no person should receive any part of this income, except a child or the descendants of a deceased child. Then, on the death of his wife, his primary intention having been fulfilled, the final disposition of his estate was provided for. The testator had two daughters and two sons. The shares of the two daughters were, with the exception of the $20,000, to be paid to each of them when they reached 30 years of age, to be held in trust during their lives and the remainder to be paid to their issue upon their death. Here again the testator has confined the class who would ultimately receive any portion of his estate to his own descendants; and the provision in relation to the distribution of his property among his sons seems to me to have been intended to carry out the same intention. If a son died before the testator, leaving issue, the issue was to take the parent\u2019s share. If a son died. after his death leaving issue, the issue would take the parent\u2019s share; but, if either of' his sons survived the testator\u2019s widow, there was to be set apart for that son at her death a share of his estate, and that share was to be held by the trustees until the son arrived at the age of 30 years, when it was to be conveyed or transferred to him. Undoubtedly upon the death of the widow a share for each son was then created. That son, if then 21 years of age, was to receive the whole income of the share until he became 30 years of age, and was then to receive the principal. If in the meantime he died leaving issue, the issue was to receive the share held for him, and undoubtedly, if the son was alive at the time of the death of the testator\u2019s widow, the share would vest upon her death, and would have been subject to his disposition either by transfer or by a testamentary disposition of it. But one of the testator\u2019s sons died without issue during the life of the widow; and to hold that the son so dying had power to dispose of such a share as would have been subsequently created for his benefit if he had survived his mother would defeat the whole intention of the testator and divert his property from his own descendants in opposition to the testamentary disposition that he intended. The distinction between this case and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>the case of Dickerson v. Sheehy, 141 N. Y. Supp. 35, decided herewith, seems to be crucial. There the beneficiary was entitled to receive the income of his share of the estate until the share should become payable, and there was no express direction that a division of the estate into shares should be postponed until the termination of the life estate. Here the division into shares can only take place upon the death of the testator\u2019s widow. A careful consideration of the whole will discloses, I think, that it was the intention of the testator that the death of a son prior to the death of his mother without leaving issue divested him of any interest in the estate, and that, therefore, nothing passed under the son\u2019s will.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> There is also a question presented upon the appeal of the testator\u2019s widow, but I think it clear that the testator\u2019s intention was that this provision for the widow was to be in lieu of all dower or interest in the estate; and that she is not entitled to the interest in the share of the deceased\u2019s son, but that as to that share the- testator died intestate, and it belongs to his three surviving children.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">It follows that the judgment appealed from should be reversed and judgment directed in accordance with this opinion, with costs to the plaintiffs and the appellants to be paid out of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">DAUGHDIN and CLARKE, JJ., dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">McLAUGHLIN, J.
