Sanford was plaintiff and the Anticlinal Rock Oil Company was defendant, and aggregate the sum of $1,363.44, together with interest thereon at the rate of 3 per cent, per annum from the 1st day of November, 1912.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-13\">[ 1 ] The memorandum opinion at Special Term shows that the motion was denied on the ground that all parties interested in the funds should be given notice thereof. This new section of the Code of Civil Procedure, as construed by the Court of Appeals (Matter of Walsh, 204 N. Y. 276, 97 N. E. 715), entitles the comptroller of the state to such an order, and does not require that notice of the motion be given to the parties interested in the funds. It is manifest that, if the funds are to remain in court, the Legislature, on the facts here presented, has commanded that they be transferred to the city chamberlain. The only conceivable theory upon which notice could be of avail, and therefore might properly be required, would be in a case where it is apparent that it is no longer necessary to retain the funds in court; but there is nothing in the record to indicate that such is this case, and it should not be assumed, for that would put the state to considerable expense to make personal service, or service by publication, on every such application.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>. [2] The rights of the parties interested in the funds are not affected in the least by the change of custodian, and since it is unquestionably within the power of the Legislature to designate the custodian of such funds (People v. Keenan, 110 App. Div. 537, 97 N. Y. Supp. 77, affirmed 185 N. Y. 600, 78 N. E. 1108; Matter of City of New York, 200 N. Y. 138, 93 N. E. 689; Matter of Walsh, supra; Matter of Walsh, 151 App. Div. 885, 135 N. Y. Supp. 1148), the motion should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> We do not agree, however, with the learned Deputy Attorney General that the costs and disbursements of this appeal should be paid out of the funds. On that question, certainly, the parties in interest would be entitled to be heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">It follows, therefore, that the order should be reversed, and motion granted, without costs of the appeal or of the motion. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
