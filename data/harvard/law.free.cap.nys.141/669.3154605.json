Y. Supp. 659), in which the defendant Runyon is the respondent, with the exception of those relating to <em>this </em>respondent\u2019s connection with the company, and his participation in the conveyance and .assignment of its property, and therefore the opinion on that appeal disposes of them in favor of the appellants. He was not a director, but was the treasurer of the company at the time a mortgage, alleged to have been given in violation of the statute, was executed. As a stockholder, he signed a consent to its execution, and it is alleged that he advised, ratified, approved, and assented to the execution of the mortgage, and that through its execution he received payment of a note of the corporation which he held for $2,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">It is quite - plain, I think, that, although he did not in his official capacity represent the corporation in the execution and delivery of the mortgage, and, therefore, did not as an officer of the corporation violate the statute, yet he was <em>concerned </em>in the disposition of the corporate property made thereby, for the words \u201cbe concerned in violating,\u201d as used in the statute, are equivalent to \u201cparticipate\u201d or \u201ctake part\u201d in violating. See U. S. v. Scott (C. C.) 74 Fed. 213. I am of opinion that an officer may, without acting officially, violate the statute by inducing other officers to transfer assets of the corporation in violation of law to himself or to another, at least when, as here alleged,- he is to and did derive a benefit therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">The determination of the Appellate Term, and order of the Special Term of the City Court, should therefore be reversed, with costs, and motion denied with costs. .</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">McLAUGHLIN and HOTCHKISS, JJ., concur.
