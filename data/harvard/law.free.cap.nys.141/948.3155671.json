Queen Aeroplane Co., 154 App. Div. 142, 138 N. Y. Supp. 983, affirmed 207 N. Y. 290, 100 N. E. 796, to justify the view that the court had no jurisdiction to issue the warrant. The amount should, however, be reduced to $2,000. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 682; Guarantee Co. v. Moore, 35 App. Div. 421, 425, 54 N. Y. Supp. 787.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-8\">The order should be reversed, and the warrant of attachment modified, by reducing the amount thereof to $2,000, with interest and costs, and the liability of the surety on the undertaking given to discharge the attachment limited to $2,000, with interest and costs, with $10 costs and disbursements of the appeal to the appellant. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
