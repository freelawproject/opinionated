On February 25, 1908, the defendant purchased a piano under a contract of conditional sale for $260, on payment of $5 in cash and $1 each week thereafter. All payments must be made at cashier\u2019s office of Bloomingdale Bros, or at sender\u2019s risk by registered mail to Bloomingdale Bros. Default is alleged to have occurred on June 21, 1912, leaving a balance of $76 due. A demand for the balance of the account was-made on October 11, 1912, part payment was promised by the defendant, but she failed to keep her promise.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">. Defendant testified that she told plaintiffs\u2019 representative that she could not pay weekly, but would pay as much as possible whenever1 she had the money; that he said \u201cAll right,\u201d and that she paid this-way until the final default; that at one time she skipped payment for 18 weeks at a time, and then would send $5, $10, or $15 at a time; that she told him she would pay whenever she had the money; that she was very often' in arrears. In rebuttal, plaintiffs\u2019 representative admitted being willing to take payments in bulk or monthly, as long as the account was kept up. At the time of the default on which the-foreclosure was brought, respondent was 43 weeks in arrears. In November, 1912, plaintiffs received a $10 money order from defendant, which they kept, but did not -collect.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-10\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The right of a conditional vendor or mortgagee of chattels to-foreclose upon the mortgagor\u2019s or vendee\u2019s default is riot waived by his having accepted payments that were waivers of prior defaults. Kraus v. Black, 56 Misc. Rep. 641, 642, 107 N. Y. Supp. 609.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-11\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> As the contract of conditional sale required all payments to be-made at the cashier\u2019s office of Blooriringdale Bros.' or by registered mail, no demand was necessary. McMullen v. Rafferty, 89 N. Y. 456; 9 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law (2d Ed.) 202, 203.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-12\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> If there was any promise to extend the payment of the installments due, upon payment of part of what the debtor was legally bound to pay, it was without consideration and unenforceable. Olmstead v. Latimer, 158 N. Y. 313, 319-321, 53 N. E. 5, 43 L. R. A. 685; Repelow v. Walsh, 98 App. Div. 320, 321, 90 N. Y. Supp. 651.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-13\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> The action was brought to recover the balance of the purchase-price of the piano and foreclose plaintiffs\u2019 lien therefor, and not to enforce any forfeiture. At any time up to the sale, defendant may redeem. Tweedie v. Clark, 114 App. Div. 296, 300, 99 N. Y. Supp. 856.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-14\">The cases arising where tenders of the amount due were refused, or payment of the amount due was made through a sale by the vendor, and actions for conversion brought by the vendee, are not in point. As against enforcement of a forfeiture, a receipt of part payment by</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>a vendor may be a waiver of any forfeiture occurring up to that time, at least until some further payment was due, or a demand therefor was made and refused, especially if a demand of payment was required before the forfeiture could be enforced. Hutchings v. Hunger, 41 N. Y. 155, 158; O\u2019Rourke v. Hadcock, 114 N. Y. 541, 550, 22 N. E. 33; Cunningham v. Hedge, 12 App. Div. 212, 215, 42 N. Y. Supp. 549; French v. Row, 77 Hun, 380, 384-386, 28 N. Y. Supp. 849.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\"><bracketnum>[5]</bracketnum> The receipt, holding for a time, and then the tender back on the trial of a money order, is not the receipt of a part payment, but a mere tender of part payment, which plaintiffs had the right to refuse or to tender back on the trial. Defendant could have demanded it \u201cback, if it was not collected within a reasonable time. Moreover, all payments were required to be made at the vendor\u2019s cashier\u2019s office, or by registered mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellants to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
