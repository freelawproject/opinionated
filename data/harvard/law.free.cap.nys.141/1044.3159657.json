The appellant refused to record the mortgage, on the ground that the amount tendered was insufficient, and contended that under section 256 of the Tax Law (Consol. Laws 1909, c. 60) he was entitled to receive a tax based upon the value of the property covered by the mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-9\">His contention in this respect was predicated upon a provision in the mortgage to the effect that all sums paid by the holder of the mortgage for the expense of any litigation to prosecute or defend the rights and liens created thereby should be paid by the mortgagor, together with interest thereon, at the rate of 6 per cent, per annum, \u201cand any such sum and the interest thereon shall be a lien on said premises prior to any right or title to, interest in, or claim upon said premises, attaching or accruing subsequent to the lien of this mortgage, and shall be deemed to be secured by this mortgage and by the bond which it secures\u201d; in other words, he insisted that this provision in the mortgage made the amount which it was given to secure indefinite, and not determinable from the terms of the mortgage itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-10\">The learned court at Special Term held that the provision in the mortgage referred to did not render the principal secured thereby indefinite or indeterminable, and that the appellant was not justified in refusing to record the mortgage, and directed that he do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-11\">I am of the opinion the order appealed from is right. Section 256 of the Tax Law provides that, \u201cif the principal indebtedness secured, or which by any contingency may be secured, by a mortgage is not determinable from the terms of the mortgage,\u201d then the tax shall be imposed upon the value of the property. The mortgage here given was to secure the payment of $1,250. This was \u201cthe principal sum.\u201d It constituted the indebtedness of the mortgagor, and the sum which he agreed to pay. The provision including expenses incurred in upholding the lien of the mortgage is not a part of the principal indebtedness, but a mere incident to it. It no more renders the principal indebtedness indeterminable than would the ordinary tax or insurance clauses, which provide that the mortgagee may pay the same and include the amount thereof in the lien of the mortgage. In each case the object sought to be accomplished is the payment in full of the indebtedness and nothing, more.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-12\">The order appealed from is therefore affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
