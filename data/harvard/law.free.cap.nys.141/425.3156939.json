On July 12, 1912, the only co-respondent appeared and demanded a copy of the complaint, which was served. The co-respondent answered, and moved to set aside the interlocutory judgment and to settle issues, and from the granting order this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-25\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The motion papers sliow that examinations by physicians reveal physical conditions in the co-respondent indicative of virginity. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>Plaintiff offered the testimony of several physicians that the described state does not prove that fact, but none states plainly that it is not evidence of it. Proof is the sum of evidence that establishes the fact to be ascertained. A fact itself may be so evidential as to prove an issue, or it may only tend to prove it. Does the co-respondent\u2019s condition tend to prove, although it does not establish\u2014that is, prove\u2014\u25a0 her innocence? The examining physician, appointed by the court, found intact the virginal membrane, but would not affirm or deny virginity. Another examining physician confirmed the general appearance of virginity; another predicated upon it his judgment that \u201cit would be absolutely impossible for an intercourse to have taken place\u201d; while another examiner declared that \u201cthis girl has never been interfered with by a man.\u201d Against such testimony that of several physicians is arrayed. Their opinion is that from the conditions discovered by the examining physicians \u201cit is impossible to state whether she ever, has had sexual intercourse\u201d.; that the presence of the intact hymen \u201cis not proof that a woman is a virgin.\u201d These experts do not state that such perfect condition is not valuable evidence of virginity, but that the \u201cmere presence\u201d does not establish it. The mere conditions may not assure an irrefragible conclusion, for there may be exceptions. As one of plaintiff\u2019s experts states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-5\">\u201cIt is possible, in certain eases, for intercourse to have occurred without any apparent disturbance of the hymen.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">But the determination of an issue of fact depends upon probabilities, and if the testimony of the examining physicians aid the probability of the co-respondent\u2019s chastity it should be heard, although there is a possibility that the physical phenomena do not imperatively demand her vindication.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> It may be again urged that the co-respondent cannot be permitted to intervene after the entry of the interlocutory judgment; but the statute makes the judgment the limit of her opportunity, and the court should abide by it. The motion of the co-respondent was to set aside the interlocutory judgment, but the denial does not affect the motion by her guardian ad litem.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">The order should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
