Proc. \u00a7 481, requires the complaint to contain a statement of the facts constituting each cause of action, and a demand of the judgment to which plaintiff supposes himself entitled. A complaint alleged a good cause of action for damages for breach of a broker\u2019s contract to repurchase bonds, but, instead of demanding damages for the breach, demanded judgment that defendant be directed to repurchase bonds at the selling price, with accrued interest, and such other relief as the court should deem just. <em>Held, </em>on demurrer on the ground that the complaint did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, that, as plaintiff had stated a cause of action for damages for breach of the contract, the mere fact that he asked for a judgment which the facts pleaded did not warrant did not defeat his right to be heard.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b717-14\">[Ed.

The plaintiff then demands judgment\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-9\">\u201cdirecting and requiring the defendants herein to repurchase the said bonds at the purchase price thereof, to wit, $500 and accrued interest each, and that plaintiff have such other and further relief in the premises as to this court seems just, together with the costs of this action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b718-10\">The defendants demur to this complaint upon the ground that it does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The demurrer has been overruled and the defendants appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-11\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> There does not seem to be any reasonable doubt that the complaint does make a \u201cplain and concise statement of the facts constitu\u00ed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>ing\u201d his cause of action. The defendants, aside from some captious criticism of the language used, which has no merit, practically concede that the complaint states sufficient facts to warrant the recovery of damages for a breach of the contract to repurchase the bonds; but it is urged that the character of the relief demanded is equitable, and that the pleading fails to show grounds for the specific performance of a contract which may be satisfied with a money judgment, relying upon the case of Black v. Vanderbilt, 70 App. Div. 16, 74 N. Y. Supp. 1095. In the very case relied upon, which has been questioned as authority, the court observes that it\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-5\">\u201cis true that a party is not to be turned out of court merely because he has failed to demand the precise remedy to which he is entitled, and that he may state in this complaint the facts upon which he relies in such a manner as to entitle him either to legal or equitable relief. But here no legal redress is demanded, and it conclusively appears that the complaint was framed for equitable relief alone.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">In the case now before us there are all of the facts necessary; to constitute a good cause of action for a breach of contract. The contract alleged was an agreement in writing on the part of the plaintiff to purchase these bonds at the par value thereof with accrued interest, and a promise on the part of the vendors to repurchase at the face value, with accrued interest, if the bonds failed to meet the requirements of such bonds; that is, if they failed to realize to the plaintiff the income or the value which he had a right to believe he was purchasing from the terms of the bonds themselves. The complaint alleges a failure of the bonds to realize to the plaintiff the interest promised upon their face, and a demand for the repurchase of the bonds, and a failure on the part of the defendants to perform. Clearly all that is lacking of a good complaint is the failure on the part of the plaintiff to demand damages, instead of a specific performance of the contract. The demand is for the repurchase of the said bonds \u201cat the purchase price thereof, to wit, $500 and accrued interest each,\u201d and this is a sum which could be computed easily, and is, practically, a demand for $2,000, with accrued interest upon this amount from the default in payment of the interest, and, if the allegation of the complaint on information and belief that the bonds are \u201cunsalable and of no value\u201d is true, the damages to the plaintiff would be the same amount as that which he asks.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> It is doubtful if the plaintiff has stated a good cause of action equitably, for he does not allege that there is not an adequate remedy at law; but he does state facts sufficient to constitute a good action at law, and the mere fact that he has asked for equitable relief does not defeat his right to be heard even where no answer has been interposed. The ground of the demurrer is not that the plaintiff has failed to state an equitable cause of action, but that he has failed to \u201cstate facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.\u201d There is no requirement of law that the demand for judgment shall be consistent with the facts stated; the plaintiff is to make \u201ca plain and concise statement of the facts constituting each cause of action, without unneces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>sary repetition,\u201d and a \"demand of the judgment to which the plaintiff supposes himself entitled.\u201d Section 481, Code of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">The plaintiff in this case appears to have supposed that he was entitled to a specific performance of the contract upon the facts alleged; but this mistake has nothing to do with the facts which he has well stated, and which, as we have seen, are sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The rule in Black v. Vanderbilt, supra, was questioned in Squiers v. Thompson, 73 App. Div. 552, 76 N. Y. Supp. 734, and that case was affirmed without opinion (172 N. Y. 652, 65 N. E. 1122); and, although it does not appear to have been necessary to the determination of the question (Gilbert v. Bunnell, 92 App. Div. 284, 289, 86 N. Y. Supp. 1123), we are of the opinion that the rule there laid down is not to be extended beyond the peculiar facts of that case, and, as we have already seen the rule was not intended to reach to a case where the whole error consisted merely in asking for a judgment which the facts pleaded did not warrant. .The demurrer goes to the question of the facts pleaded and their sufficiency to \u201cconstitute a cause of action.\u201d Section 488, Code of Civil Procedure. If any cause of action is well stated in its facts, a mere error in the supposition of the pleader as to the relief to which he is entitled is not a justification for throwing out the pleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">The interlocutory judgment and order appealed from should be affirmed,- with costs, with the usual leave to withdraw the demurrer and answer, upon payment of the costs of appeal and of the trial court. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
