It was consequently held that the claimant respondent had'not acquired a valid lien because he had not filed a notice of lien until December 13, 1906, which we deemed to be more than 30 days after the completion of the work. 135 App. Div. 598, 120 N. Y. Supp. 841. The Court of Appeals, upon the facts proven, reached a different conclusion as to the date of the completion of the work, and consequently reversed the judgment and ordered a new trial. 201 N. Y. 65, 94 N. E. 196, Ann. Cas. 1912A, 905. The evidence upon the new trial does not differ in any material respect from that presented upon the first trial, and therefore, what<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>ever our own views might be upon the evidence if the matter were res nova, we feel constrained to yield to the authority of the Court of Appeals and affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
