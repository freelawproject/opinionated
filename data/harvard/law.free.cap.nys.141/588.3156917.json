She testified that, when she entered upon the platform at the rear of the balcony in defendant\u2019s theater, it was \u201cdark,\u201d \u201cvery dark,\u201d so dark that she could not see any steps. The seats which she had purchased were in the fifth row from the front. There was a sharp conflict of evidence upon the question of the absence of light; but, as she has persuaded the jury to accept her testimony as true, she in turn must accept the consequences thereof. She had been in the theater before, and she knew that there were steps leading down from the platform to the said fifth row of seats. Notwithstanding this knowledge, and notwithstanding this darkness, to use her own words, she groped her way along. She neither asked for assistance to find her way, nor waited, as there was abundant time for her to do, until more lights had been turned on. Missing her footing at the top of the steps, she fell and was injured. Within the authorities she was guilty- of contributory negligence as matter of law, and the motion for a nonsuit should have been granted. Rohrbacher v. Gillig, 203 N. Y. 413, 96 N.
