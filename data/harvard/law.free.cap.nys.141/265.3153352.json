The third party, Walker, who is sought to be examined in this proceeding, is the trustee and brother-in-law of Cram, the judgment debtor. It is also alleged that the judgment debtor consented to the appointment of this receiver, and has consented to the entry of orders of the Supreme Court directing the receiver to pay over funds to one Lockwood, to whom Seward Webb had assigned his judgment, said Lockwood being asssociated with Sidney Harris, the attorney for Cram, and that the said Harris or Lockwood has then paid the funds over to the said -Cram.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">The allegation of these facts would seem to indicate that the court below had not abused its discretion, if it had the power to order the examination of this third party; for otherwise a judgment debtor, by \u25a0collusion with the plaintiff in one proceeding brought against him, could have a friendly receiver appointed, and thereafter cut off any further inquiry by other creditors into the matter of his assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">Appellant cites Matter of Steinmann v. Conlon, 150 App. Div. 708, 135 N. Y. Supp. 740, as conclusive, and it would seem that this case, following Sorrentino v. Langlois, 144 App. Div. 271, 128 N. Y. Supp. 1003, holds that, where a receiver has been appointed at the instance -of one judgment creditor, no examination of a third party can be had thereafter by any other creditor. We are therefore constrained to reverse the order appealed from.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion to vacate order for examination granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
