Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7 2750.5), the uninsured subcontractor may be liable in tort for injuries to the employee (\u00a7 3706). We reverse the judgment of the trial court which was entered pursuant to the subcontractor\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-11\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b675-12\">On January 19,1989, Julian Hernandez was working for Chavez Roofing, Inc., (Chevy), when he was killed by being crushed between a fork lift and a truck owned and operated by Chavez. The accident occurred near a job site <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1094\">*1094</page-number>for which Chavez had a subcontract for roofing. Chavez had neither a current contractor\u2019s license nor workers compensation insurance, but the general contractor, Braun and Associates, did.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">Hernandez\u2019s survivors brought a wrongful death action against Chavez and others. The original complaint alleged that Hernandez was an employee of Chavez, but the first amended complaint alleged that Hernandez was an independent contractor. Chavez moved for summary judgment on the ground that, as an employee of Chavez and Braun, Hernandez\u2019s exclusive remedy was in Braun\u2019s workers compensation insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">Plaintiffs opposed the motion on the grounds that there is a disputed question of fact whether Hernandez was Chavez\u2019s employee, and that, in any event, an employee is not prevented from bringing a tort action against an uninsured employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">The trial court granted the motion, and plaintiffs\u2019 appeal the ensuing judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">Section 3706 provides an exception to the usual rule that worker\u2019s compensation is the exclusive remedy of an employee or his dependents against his employer for injury or death occurring in the course of employment. (\u00a7\u00a7 3600, 3602.) Section 3706 provides, \u201cIf any employer fails to secure the payment of compensation, any injured employee or his dependents may bring an action at law against such employer for damages, as if this division did not apply.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b676-9\">In <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Foster </em>(1985) 165 Cal.App.3d 114 [211 Cal.Rptr. 305], a truck driver was employed by Foster, who was in the business of furnishing trucks and drivers to others. Foster furnished a truck and driver to Logex Trucking Company. Logex exercised such control over the driver as to also become the driver\u2019s employer. Logex had workers\u2019 compensation insurance but Foster did not. The driver was killed in a work related accident while in the employment of both parties. The driver\u2019s widow obtained workers\u2019 compensation benefits from Logex\u2019s insurer, and sued Foster for wrongful death.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-10\">The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Foster, but the Court of Appeal reversed, holding that the public policy requiring employers to carry workers\u2019 compensation insurance and the express language of section 3706 entitled the widow to maintain the action. <em>(Strickland </em>v. <em>Foster, supra, </em>165 Cal.App.3d at p. 118.)</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1095\">*1095</page-number>Chavez argues that <em>Strickland </em>does not apply here because it did not involve section 2750.5.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> That section has been interpreted to make an unlicensed subcontractor and its employees, employees of the general contractor for workers\u2019 compensation purposes. <em>(Blew </em>v. <em>Horner </em>(1986) 187 Cal.App.3d 1380, 1389 [232 Cal.Rptr. 660]; <em>Neighbours </em>v. <em>Buzz Oates Enterprises </em>(1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 325, 330 [265 Cal.Rptr. 788].) Chavez adds that section 3601<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> makes workers\u2019 compensation the exclusive remedy, with exceptions not relevant here, for injury or death to an employee caused by another employee. Chavez invites us to draw the conclusion that because it and Hernandez were both employees of Braun under section 2750.5, the plaintiffs\u2019 exclusive remedy is in Braun\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">The argument is unpersuasive. In effect Chavez wants us to declare that a violation of the law requiring a contractor\u2019s license can protect an employer from the consequences of a violation of the law requiring workers\u2019 compensation insurance. Under this approach more culpability means less liability. The uninsured employer who has a contractor\u2019s license could be sued in state court, but the uninsured employer who also has no contractor\u2019s license could not be sued in state court. Such a holding would do violence to the letter and spirit of laws governing both contractor\u2019s licensing and workers\u2019 compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">Section 2750.5 can create a dual employment relationship whereby a worker may be an employee of both a general contractor and a subcontractor. (Cf. <em>Neighbours </em>v. <em>Buzz Oates Enterprises, supra, </em>217 Cal.App.3d at p. 333.) The price that must be paid by each employer for immunity from tort liability is the purchase of a workers\u2019 compensation policy. (\u00a7 3706.) Chavez chose not to pay that price, so it should not be immune from liability. <em>(Neighbours </em>v. <em>Buzz Oates Enterprises, supra, 217 </em>Cal.App.3d at p. 334.)</p>\n<p id=\"b678-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1096\">*1096</page-number>The judgment is reversed.
