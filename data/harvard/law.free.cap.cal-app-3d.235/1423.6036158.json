Code, \u00a7 243.4, subd. (a)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On February 24, 1989, imposition of sentence was suspended and appellant was placed on probation for three years, with one year in county jail. He received credit for time served in jail and was released.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-13\">On October 9, 1990, appellant filed a motion for early termination of probation and to obtain release from penalties pursuant to sections 1203.3 and 1203.4, stating that he had complied with all terms of probation and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1425\">*1425</page-number>needed the conviction expunged to make him eligible for permanent resident status.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On October 25, 1990, the motion was denied.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b995-5\">A timely notice of appeal was filed on December 17, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b995-7\">\n<em>Appealability of the Order</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b995-8\">Citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Soukup </em>(1983) 141 Cal.App.3d 858 [190 Cal.Rptr. 635] (disapproved on other grounds in <em>In re Bakke </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 84, 88 [227 Cal.Rptr. 663, 720 P.2d 11]), respondent argues that the order denying a section 1203.4 motion is not appealable. Section 1237 provides that a defendant may appeal in the following circumstances: \u201c(a) From a final judgment of conviction .... A sentence, [or] an order granting probation, . . . shall be deemed to be a final judgment within the meaning of this section. ... HU (b) From any order made after judgment, affecting the substantial rights of the party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b995-9\">The court in <em>Soukup, supra, </em>141 Cal.App.3d 858 after deciding the merits of the issue raised, stated that the order should have been reviewed by means of a petition for writ of habeas corpus. The court stated that since the defendant had no right to the relief requested, no substantial rights were involved. We decline to follow this rule, since it requires a resolution of the merits of the appeal before it can be determined whether the order was appealable. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Chandler </em>(1988) 203 Cal.App.3d 782 [250 Cal.Rptr. 730], the court determined that an order denying section 1203.4 relief was appealable as an order made after judgment. The judgment in that case was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1426\">*1426</page-number>the order granting probation, where the period of probation had expired. The rule regarding appealability of such orders should not be otherwise merely because the probationary term has not yet expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-4\">In <em>In re Bine </em>(1957) 47 Cal.2d 814, 817 [306 P.2d 445], the Supreme Court stated that an order modifying probation is appealable as an order after judgment affecting substantial rights. The court distinguished <em>People </em>v. <em>Robinson </em>(1954) 43 Cal.2d 143 [271 P.2d 872], which held that an order revoking probation was not appealable because the purpose of a revocation order was to allow a final judgment to be entered. We find that the order denying appellant\u2019s motion is appealable as an order after judgment pursuant to the express language of section 1237.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-5\">\n<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b996-6\">The order appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-7\">Newsom, Acting P.
