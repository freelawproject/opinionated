J.</author>\n<p id=\"A5f\">\u2014In the wake of an unsuccessful defense of a civil suit (see <em>Ballou </em>v. <em>Master Properties No. 6 </em>(1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 65 [234 Cal.Rptr. 264]) and other matters, plaintiff Richard W. Traweek and related entities (collectively Traweek) filed two malpractice lawsuits against his former attorneys and accountants. In the first (the <em>Jacke </em>matter), Traweek sued the law firm of Finley, Kumble, Wagner, Heine, Underberg, Manley, Myerson &amp; Casey (Finley Kumble), Richard Williams (a Finley Kumble partner) and H. Clay Jacke, an attorney \u201cassociated as counsel\u201d for Traweek with Finley Kumble and Williams in the <em>Ballou </em>action. In the second lawsuit (the <em>Manatt </em>matter) filed almost one year later, Traweek sued the law firm of Manatt, Phelps, Rothenberg &amp; Phillips (Manatt Phelps), the accounting firm of Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Company (Leventhal), and more than one hundred individuals who were former partners of Finley Kumble.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">Approximately three weeks after the <em>Manatt </em>action was filed, Finley Kumble commenced chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings in New York. By virtue of a temporary restraining order and later a preliminary injunction obtained by the bankruptcy trustee, the automatic stay was extended to litigation against the individual partners of Finley Kumble in March 1988. The bankruptcy court\u2019s order, however, specifically provided that it did not \u201cpreclude commencing, maintaining, or prosecuting litigation against any other co-defendant of the Debtor or of the Debtor\u2019s Partners . . . .\u201d Thus in both cases, the action was stayed as to some defendants (Finley Kumble and the individual partners) but not others (Jacke, Manatt Phelps and Kenneth Leventhal).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">Both the <em>Jacke </em>and <em>Manatt </em>actions were assigned to the San Diego Superior Court\u2019s \u201cfast track\u201d program (see generally <em>Moyal </em>v. <em>Lanphear </em>(1989) 208 Cal.App.3d 491, 497-498 [256 Cal.Rptr. 296]) which calls for diligent court monitoring of the progress of the litigation. Fast track rules normally require the filing of a joint at-issue memorandum within 140 days of the filing of the answer. (Former San Diego County Super. Ct. Local Rule 10.7 (current rule 1.7).) Instead, Traweek filed certificates in both the <em>Jacke </em>and <em>Manatt </em>actions explaining that at-issue memorandums would not be filed because of the pending bankruptcy proceedings in New York. In both cases, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1132\">*1132</page-number>the court accepted Traweek\u2019s explanations and took the matter off calendar or otherwise stayed the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">In late 1989, the superior court issued orders to show cause why both cases should not be dismissed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In the <em>Jacke </em>matter, after being continued several times the hearing was held on January 24, 1990. Traweek\u2019s counsel explained that the bankruptcy stay was still in effect as to Finley Kumble and Williams, and that it was impractical to proceed against Jacke, the sole remaining defendant. After Judge Jones indicated he was inclined to dismiss the case without prejudice, the following colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-5\">\u201cThe Court: Look, I\u2019m not going to shoot this case in the head, I\u2019m only going to give it anesthesia. I\u2019m going to dismiss it without prejudice with leave to set aside the dismissal on good cause shown, as long as leave is filed within five years of the date of filing the complaint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-6\">\u201cWe\u2019re sitting here monitoring a dead case that\u2019s being held in another forum where the statute is tolled as long as there\u2019s a bankruptcy stay; where once it\u2019s out of stay, you make a motion ex parte to set aside the dismissal because the matter is now again capable of being litigated here and we have jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-7\">\u201cMr Todd [Traweek\u2019s counsel]: But there is another defendant whose case isn\u2019t in front of the bankruptcy court in New York.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-8\">\u201cThe Court: I\u2019m dismissing it as to that defendant and I\u2019m sure he has no objection that it will be set aside. It will come back alive if they get out of the bankruptcy court. But it\u2019s an entirely different case if Finley, Kumble never gets out of bankruptcy court than it is if it stays in. And if they never get out, then you can move to set it aside, and if you want to prosecute this one other defendant, you can.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-9\">\u201cI see no reason for us to wait and wait and call you down here and have people traveling down for a hearing in a court that has no jurisdiction because it\u2019s stayed, when all we do is dismiss it without prejudice to be set aside on good cause shown, as long as the motion\u2019s made within the five-year period, the date of the first filing. It just doesn\u2019t make sense for us <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1133\">*1133</page-number>to monitor a case in which somebody else has absolute control over it until we can do something.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-4\">\u201cMr. Todd: Well, that\u2019s the point, your Honor. Everybody nationwide has worked diligently to get the process in place so we can do something on it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-5\">\u201cThe Court: But you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. You don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s going to happen in February or June or December.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-6\">\u201cMr. Todd: You\u2019re right. I don\u2019t know that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-7\">\u201cThe Court: We\u2019ll have you down here every 45 days saying, \u2018How\u2019s it going?\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-8\">\u201cDo you want me to do that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-9\">\u201cMr. Todd: I think that\u2019s a better alternative than dismissing the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-10\">\u201cMr. Schmelter [Jacke\u2019s counsel]: I would prefer not to do that, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-11\">\u201cThe Court: I\u2019m going to dismiss it without prejudice with the dismissal to be set aside on good cause shown within five years of the date of filing. And that is dismissed as to all defendants without prejudice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-12\">In the <em>Manat\u00ed </em>matter, confusion over a substitution of counsel resulted in no one appearing for Traweek at the hearing. This was brought to the court\u2019s attention by opposing counsel at the hearing, but Judge Jones explained he \u201cwould dismiss it even under objection.\u201d His reasoning was similar to that which motivated his dismissal of the <em>Jacke </em>action:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-13\">\u201cI suspect that they will be coming back and moving to set aside. But why should we sit here and monitor this thing for maybe a year? And if it comes out of bankruptcy, fine, we\u2019ll open it up. That\u2019s good cause shown.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-14\">Traweek\u2019s new counsel filed an application to set aside the dismissal. In addition to explaining they had received no notice of the hearing, counsel indicated Traweek was willing to proceed to prosecute the action against the nonbankrupt defendants, i.e., Manatt Phelps and Kenneth Leventhal. In a minute order dated March 20, 1990, the court denied Traweek\u2019s application, again \u201cwithout prejudice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b716-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1134\">*1134</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">In <em>Moyal </em>v. <em>Lanphear, supra, </em>208 Cal.App.3d 491, this court considered the authority of the superior court to dismiss cases as a sanction for a plaintiff\u2019s failure to comply with local fast track rules.  We observed that, consistent with \u201clong-standing judicial policy,\u201d the Legislature has mandated that a dismissal sanction should be utilized \u201conly if it appears less severe sanctions would not be effective . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 502.) Noting that a dismissal often forces the client to pay for the sins of the lawyer, we explained: \u201cThe drastic measure of dismissal should only be used where there is a clear showing that the client is the cause of counsel\u2019s failure to comply with local fast track rules, e.g., where the client will not cooperate with or supply necessary material to his or her attorney or where no other reasonable sanction will produce compliance with the rules and orders of the court.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 503.)</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Defendants Manatt Phelps and Kenneth Leventhal attempt to cast this as a case in which the court finally dismissed an action after repeated failures by the plaintiff to comply with applicable local rules. Even if the record would support such a construction, dismissal would be inappropriate under the reasoning of <em>Moyal </em>because the court never sought to induce compliance by means of a sanction short of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">The record makes clear, however, that the dismissal of this case had nothing to do with the plaintiff\u2019s failure to comply with the fast track rules. Indeed, the plaintiff here was never told he had done anything wrong. Rather, this is a case in which the superior court, for a time, was comfortable accepting the plaintiff\u2019s assertion that because each of the two actions was automatically stayed as to some defendants, it was impracticable to prosecute either action against the remaining nonbankrupt defendants. However, as the cases grew older the court became understandably concerned with the effect of an interminable bankruptcy stay on the management of its calendar. To deal with this issue the trial court placed such cases into a category entitled \u201cdismissal without prejudice.\u201d This type of dismissal was not intended to be a <em>real </em>dismissal, but merely a method of dealing with such cases to dispense with the need for periodic court monitoring. The dismissal will be set aside if either (1) the bankruptcy stay is lifted, or (2) the plaintiff decides he can proceed separately against the nonbankrupt defendants, provided of course that the motion to set aside is brought within five years of the filing of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">We recently considered a variant of this \u201cadministrative dismissal\u201d practice in <em>Sugimoto </em>v. <em>Exportadora de Sal, S.A. de C.V. </em>(1991) 233 Cal.App.3d 165 [284 Cal.Rptr. 275]. There, the superior court dismissed an action which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1135\">*1135</page-number>had been removed to federal court based on the same docket-clearing rationale proffered here. As the superior court judge explained to the plaintiff in that case, \u201c \u2018You\u2019re only one of about 500 that we have done this to ... . This is our administrative practice.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 167.) We held the dismissal was improper because the superior court lacked jurisdiction to do anything other than stay the action pending the resolution of the federal case.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\">For similar reasons, the court here lacked the power to dismiss these cases as to any of the defendants subject to the federal bankruptcy stay. The law is clear that a nonbankruptcy court may not dismiss but may only stay an action in which a defendant has filed for bankruptcy. (See, e.g., <em>Piel </em>v. <em>Harvard Interiors Manufacturing Co. </em>(8th Cir. 1974) 490 F.2d 1272 and <em>Chubb Pacific Indemnity Group </em>v. <em>Twin Lakes Village, Inc. </em>(1982) 98 Nev. 521 [654 P.2d 530], reversing dismissals without prejudice.)</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">As to the nonbankrupt defendants, while the court did not lack the power to dismiss, those dismissals were similarly inappropriate. The only issue before the court should have been whether it was impracticable for Traweek to proceed separately against the nonbankrupt defendants. If it was not, the court was obligated to provide Traweek with reasonable notice of his resumed obligations and a reasonable opportunity to comply. If it was impracticable, the actions should have been stayed as to those defendants as well. In either situation, the cases should have remained pending in the superior court.  As we explained in <em>Sugimoto, </em>\u201cA \u2018dismissal\u2019 and a \u2018stay\u2019 are not the same. When a court orders a \u2018stay\u2019, the action, although dormant, remains pending in that court. Following a \u2018dismissal\u2019 the action is no longer pending.\u201d (233 Cal.App.3d at p. 168.)</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">The fact that the court specified the conditions on which the dismissal would be set aside does not make it any more appropriate. Indeed, Traweek\u2019s agreement to one of those conditions\u2014separately prosecuting the nonbankrupt defendants\u2014inexplicably did not result in the setting aside of the dismissal when it was requested. (See <em>ante, </em>p. 1133.) Moreover, the court indicated it would only set aside the dismissal if the request was made within five years of the filing of the complaint. Yet subdivision (b) of Code of Civil Procedure section 583.340 specifically excludes from the five-year trial requirement any time during which \u201c[prosecution or trial of the action was stayed or enjoined.\u201d In addition, the statutory \u201cimpracticability\u201d exception (\u00a7 583.340, subd. (c)) may extend to other nonbankrupt defendants as well. (See, e.g., <em>Rim Forest Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>Woodside Construction Co. </em>(1987) 190 Cal.App.3d 454, 468-470 [235 Cal.Rptr. 443]; cf. <em>Kaye </em>v. <em>Mount La Jolla Homeowners Assn. </em>(1988) 204 Cal.App.3d 1476,1485 [252 Cal.Rptr. 67].) A stay of the proceedings, with or without periodic court monitoring, would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1136\">*1136</page-number>ensure that Traweek receives a fair opportunity to have his case decided on its merits once the Finley Kumble bankruptcy is resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">The involuntary dismissal of a civil case has potentially serious consequences for the citizen who has sought to redress his or her grievances in a court of law. It signifies the unfavorable termination of the lawsuit, a refusal to resolve the merits of the dispute. As we explained in <em>Moyal, </em>a court considering the dismissal of a case must have a substantial reason significant enough to overcome the legislative and judicial policy of this state that litigation should be disposed of \u201con the merits rather than on procedural grounds.\u201d <em>(Denham </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 557, 566 [86 Cal.Rptr. 65, 468 P.2d 193]; see <em>Moyal, supra, </em>208 Cal.App.3d at p. 502.) Here the trial court\u2019s concern with administrative efficiency is insufficient justification for the dismissal of a plaintiff\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">Judgments reversed.
