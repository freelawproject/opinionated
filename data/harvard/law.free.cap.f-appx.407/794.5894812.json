The district court found that Clark\u2019s allegations failed to state a claim, and that they lacked any arguable basis in law or fact and thus were dismissible under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-15\">On November 19, 2009, Clark named a long-list of private individuals and public entities as defendants in a complaint for, apparently, the violation of his civil rights. The wide range of those named in the lawsuit includes the Houston Police Department, Children\u2019s Protective Service, Bristol West Specialty Insurance Company, Wilshire Credit Corporate, Chase Home Finance LLC, two attorneys from New York and New Jersey, two Houston-based assistant district attorneys, People Need the Lord Ministries, and a motel, to name a few. After finding the twice-amended pleadings \u201cunintelligible\u201d and replete with \u201crambling commentary,\u201d the district court dismissed the action for failing to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-16\">On appeal, Clark claims for the first time that his suit is brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. In the section where he claims this, however, he only identifies one person \u2014 a Harris County Superi- or Court judge, who is not a captioned defendant in these proceedings \u2014 as liable under that provision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He then provides twenty-one pages of wandering narrative that spans a host of subjects, people, and events. Clark claims, for example, that he has fallen victim to a conspiracy of the \u201cGypsy mafia\u201d and the \u201cRoma Gypsy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>Task Force,\u201d who has \u201cblack balled [him] from society.\u201d Then, providing almost no citations to legal authority, Clark asserts multifarious claims, including racial discrimination, RICO violations, illegal foreclosure, defamation, forgery, extortion, child endangering, fraud, civil rights violations, legal malpractice, breach of contract, false statements, and sexual discrimination.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The accompanying pleadings are, to put it charitably, confusing, ambiguous, and insufficient to give this court notice of what he is appealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">Parties before this court must comply with the standards of Rule 28 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. Accordingly, the appellant\u2019s brief must contain \u201ca statement of the issues presented for review,\u201d Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(5), and an argument setting forth \u201cappellant\u2019s contentions and the reasons for them, with citations to the authorities and parts of the record on which the appellant relies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>28(a)(9)(A). Although we liberally construe <em>pro se </em>briefs, such litigants must still brief the issues and reasonably comply with the standards of Rule 28 in order to preserve them. <em>Longoria v. Dretke, </em>507 F.3d 898, 901 (5th Cir.2007); <em>Grant v. Cuellar, </em>59 F.3d 523, 524 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">In this case, the brief is grossly non-compliant with Rule 28. First, even though Clark provides a section entitled \u201cStatement of the issue,\u201d that section merely attempts to raise a new cause of action against a judge not party to this lawsuit. Clark fails to provide elsewhere a list of the issues presented for review in this appeal. Second, the body of Clark\u2019s brief contains almost no citations to legal authority or to the record in support of his claims. Rather, he merely asserts the titles of causes of action amidst factual narrative, without coupling them with legal support. Finally, besides general grievances about the district court\u2019s \u201crefus[al] to enforce the United States Constitution,\u201d Clark does not identify error relating to the district court\u2019s reasons for dismissing his case. In sum, Clark fails to present and argue properly any issues in his appellate brief. Consequently, we consider those issues to be abandoned. <em>United States v. Beaumont, </em>972 F.2d 553, 563 (5th Cir.1992). We thus affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b823-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b823-12\">. The basic allegation is that the judge violated his civil rights.
