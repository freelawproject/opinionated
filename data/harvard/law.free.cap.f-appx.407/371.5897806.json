On appeal, Jackson argues that her sentence was both procedurally and substantively unreasonable. Jackson contends that the sentence was procedurally unreasonable because the district court failed to identify the correct legal standard in finding that she violated the conditions of her supervised release. Specifically, she asserts that the district court merely found that she was guilty of the charged violations \u201cunder the totality of the circumstances.\u201d According to Jackson, her sentence also was substantively unreasonable because it was \u201cgreater than necessary to achieve the goals of sentencing as outlined in [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b400-12\">Ordinarily, we review a sentence imposed upon revocation of supervised release for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d 1105, 1106-07 (11th Cir.2006). Our \u201csubstantive review of sentences is deferential\u201d and \u201conly look[s] to see if the district court abused its discretion by committing a clear error in judgment.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1165 (11th Cir.2010) <em>(en </em>banc). Review for abuse of discretion applies to \u201call sentences, whether within or without the guidelines....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1186 (citing <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 46, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-13\">We review arguments raised for the first time on appeal for plain error. <em>United States v. Bacon, </em>598 F.3d 772, 777 (11th Cir.2010). An argument will not be preserved for appeal unless the appellant stated it clearly \u201cenough to inform the district court of the legal basis for the objection. ...\u201d <em>United States v. Massey, </em>443 F.3d 814, 819 (11th Cir.2006). Under plain-error review, we can only make corrections if there is an error, that is plain, and that affects substantial rights. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.2005). If these criteria are met, we have the discretion to correct the error, but only if it \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 736, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1779, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993) (quotation and alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-14\">A sentence may be procedurally or substantively unreasonable. <em>Gall, 552 U.S. </em>at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. A sentence may be procedurally unreasonable if the district court (1) improperly calculates the guide<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>line range, (2) treats the Guidelines as mandatory, (3) fails to consider the appropriate \u00a7 3553(a) factors, (4) selects a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or (5) fails to adequately explain the chosen sentence, including an explanation for any deviation from the guidelines range. <em>Id. </em>A district court, however, is not required to state that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553 factors or to discuss each factor. <em>United States v. Dorman, </em>488 F.3d 936, 938 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">In reviewing the substantive reasonableness of a sentence, we consider \u201cthe totality of the circumstances\u201d to determine whether the sentence achieves the goals outlined in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Sarras, </em>575 F.3d 1191, 1219 (11th Cir.2009). A sentence may be substantively unreasonable where a district court \u201cunjustifiably relied\u201d on a single \u00a7 3553(a) factor, failed to consider relevant factors, chose the sentence arbitrarily, or considered impermissible factors in selecting the sentence. <em>Id. </em>Although the district court must provide a \u201csufficiently compelling\u201d justification to support a sentence that varies outside the Guidelines, we will not presume that a sentence outside the Guidelines is unreasonable. <em>United States v. Mateos, </em>623 F.3d 1350, 1366 (11th Cir.2010). In addition, the text of \u00a7 3553(a) requires the district court to \u201cimpose a sentence <em>sufficient, </em>but not greater than necessary\u201d to comply with the goals of sentencing as outlined in that section. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (emphasis added). Accordingly, \u00a7 3553(a) requires \u201cnot merely that a sentencing court when handing down a sentence be stingy enough to avoid one that is too long, but also that it be generous enough to avoid one that is too short.\u201d <em>Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1197.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">After reviewing the record and reading the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that the district court did not plainly err in failing to state the standard of proof that applied at sentencing, and even if the court had applied the wrong standard, the record amply supported the court\u2019s finding that Jackson violated the terms of her supervised release. In addition, we conclude that the district court did not impose a sentence that was \u201cgreater than necessary\u201d to achieve the goals of \u00a7 3553(a), and, given the need to protect the public and Jackson\u2019s history of violations of both probation and supervised release, the district court did not plainly err in sentencing Jackson above the guideline range. Accordingly, we affirm Jackson\u2019s total sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
