The district court dismissed the claims against some of the defendants without prejudice for failure to state a claim. The district court noted, and its docket sheet reflects, that claims remain pending against numerous defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">Because the district court dismissed some but not all claims and defendants, we must sua sponte examine whether we have jurisdiction to consider the appeal. <em>See Martin v. Halliburton, </em>618 F.3d 476, 481 (5th Cir.2010). We have jurisdiction over appeals from (1) final orders pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291; (2) orders that are deemed final due to a jurisprudential exception, such as the collateral order doctrine; (3) interlocutory orders specified in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a); and (4) interlocutory orders that are properly certified for appeal by the district court pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b) or \u00a7 1292(b). <em>Dardar v. Lafourche Realty Co., </em>849 F.2d 955, 957 (5th Cir.1988); <em>Save the Bay, Inc. v. U.S. Army, </em>639 F.2d 1100, 1102 &amp; n. 3 (5th Cir.1981). The order from which Acosta appeals does not fall within any of these categories, so we lack jurisdiction to consider the appeal, and the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">Acosta\u2019s motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis on appeal is DENIED. His motion for appointment of counsel is also DENIED. <em>See Schwander v. Blackburn, </em>750 F.2d 494, 502-03 (5th Cir.1985).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b866-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
