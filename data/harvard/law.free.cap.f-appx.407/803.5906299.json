The district court denied Heyliger IFP status, finding that his appeal was not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). To obtain leave to proceed IFP on appeal, Heyliger must show that he is a pauper and that he will present a nonfrivolous issue for appeal. <em>See Carson v. Polley, </em>689 F.2d 562, 586 (5th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-20\">Pursuant to a plea agreement, Heyliger pleaded guilty to conspiring to distribute a mixture containing cocaine base (\u201ccrack\u201d). His total offense level was 33, he had a Category IV criminal history, and his guidelines range of imprisonment was 188-235 months. The Government filed a motion for a downward departure under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 for substantial assistance, and the district court granted the motion, sentencing Heyliger to 121 months of imprisonment. Heyliger filed a motion under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) seeking a reduced sentence based on Amendments 706 and 711 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which lowered the applicable guidelines range for crack offenses. The district court denied the motion, finding that releasing Heyliger earlier would cause an unwarranted danger to the public. The district court based its finding on Heyliger\u2019s criminal history and the seriousness of his criminal offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">Heyliger now argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion based on his uncounted criminal history. He also argues that his crime was exactly the type that is covered by the guidelines amendments and that the district court therefore improperly considered the seriousness of his offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">\u201cSection 3582(c)(2) permits a district court to reduce a term of imprisonment when it is based upon a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by an amendment to the Guidelines, if such a reduction is consistent with the policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>United States v. GonzalezBalderas, </em>105 F.3d at 981, 982 (5th Cir.1997). The decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Cooley, </em>590 F.3d 293, 295 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">The district court\u2019s decision to deny Heyliger\u2019s motion was not an abuse of discretion, as the record reflects that the district court gave due consideration to the motion as a whole and implicitly considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1010 (5th Cir.1995). One of these factors is \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant.\u201d \u00a7 3553(a)(1). Thus, the district court properly considered Heyliger\u2019s uncounted criminal history and the nature of the offense, in connection with which Heyliger possessed a firearm. Although the district court was authorized to reduce Heyliger\u2019s sentence, it was not compelled to do so. See <em>Cooley, </em>590 F.3d at 297.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-9\">Heyliger has not shown that he will present a nonfrivolous issue for appeal, and his request for leave to proceed IFP is DENIED. <em>See Carson, </em>689 F.2d at 586. Because his appeal is frivolous, it is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b832-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
