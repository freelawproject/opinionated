Because Albarenga failed to exhaust his administrative remedies for these claims by raising them before the BIA, our court lacks jurisdiction to consider them. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); see <em>Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>260 F.3d 448, 452-53 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">Albarenga also contends he is entitled to withholding of removal because of past, and likelihood of future, persecution on account of his membership in a particular social group: individuals who refuse to join gangs in El Salvador. When the BIA affirms the IJ\u2019s denial, based in part on the IJ\u2019s opinion, as it did in this case, our court reviews both decisions. <em>See, e.g., Zhu v. Gonzales, </em>493 F.3d 588, 593 (5th Cir.2007). We review the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s determinations Albarenga is <em>not </em>eligible for withholding of removal under the substantial evidence standard. <em>Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 903 (5th Cir.2002). That standard \u201crequires only that the BIA\u2019s decisions be supported by record evidence and be substantially reasonable\u201d. <em>Shaikh v. Holder, </em>588 F.3d 861, 863 (5th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">To establish eligibility for withholding of removal, an alien must show \u201c\u2018it is more likely than not\u2019 that his life or freedom would be threatened by persecution on account of one of the five categories mentioned under asylum\u201d. <em>Efe, </em>293 F.3d at 906 (quoting 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(1)). The protected categories are \u201crace, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion\u201d. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A); <em>Jukic v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 747, 749 (5th Cir.1994). That Albarenga has <em>not </em>shown membership in a particular social group is supported by the record and is substantially reasonable. <em>See Shaikh, </em>588 F.3d at 863. Because he has <em>not </em>demonstrated a protected ground was a central reason for the alleged persecution, Albarenga has <em>not </em>demonstrated the IJ and BIA erred in denying withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-9\">DISMISSED FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION IN PART; DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b870-38\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
