He now appeals his sentence of 36 months\u2019 imprisonment. He argues that the sentence is unreasonable because the district court failed to consider all the factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and failed to provide a proper \u201cStatement of Reasons.\u201d Thus, Sandoval-Mercado challenges only the process by which the district court imposed the sentence \u2014 he makes no argument as to the substantive reasonableness of the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-15\">We review a district court\u2019s imposition of a sentence under the deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). To assess whether a sentence is procedurally reasonable, we determine whether the district court committed any \u201csignificant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the [sentencing] Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence. ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. The district court need not have discussed each \u00a7 3553(a) factor individually, but need only have acknowledged that it considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). As the Supreme Court explained in <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u201c[t]he sentencing judge should set forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decision-making authority.\u201d 551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Thus, the law leaves much to the district judge\u2019s \u201cown professional judgment.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b402-16\">Sandoval-Mercado argues that the sentencing judge \u201conly provided a boilerplate Statement of Reasons that was unresponsive and silent to the issues presented in the Sentencing Hearing.\u201d But we find that the statements of the district judge during sentencing are sufficient to meet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>any procedural requirements: Upon sentencing Sandoval-Mercado, the district court acknowledged that it had considered the pre-sentence investigation report with its advisory guidelines and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Because we find no procedural error,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing Sandoval-Mercado to 36 months\u2019 imprisonment. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b403-16\">. Ordinarily, once we determine that the district court\u2019s decision was procedurally sound, we next consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. However, a party abandons any issue that it has not clearly delineated in its initial appellate brief. <em>Fed. Sav. and Loan Ins. Corp. v. Haralson, </em>813 F.2d 370, 373 n. 3 (11th Cir.1987). We will not reach the issue of substantive reasonableness because Sandoval-Mercado did not argue it here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
