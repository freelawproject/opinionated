Davis (\u201cDavis\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment dismissing his claims under Title VII against his employer, Defendant-Appellee SVC Manufacturing Inc. (\u201cSVC\u201d). Reviewing the record <em>de novo, Williams v. Wynne, </em>533 F.3d 360, 365 (5th Cir.2008), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-16\">Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Davis made out a <em>prima facie </em>case of race discrimination, he has failed to meet his burden to show that SVC\u2019s legitimate non-discriminatory reason for terminating his employment was pretext. <em>Turner v. Baylor Richardson Med. Ctr., </em>476 F.3d 337, 345 (5th Cir.2007) (outlining the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>burden shifting framework for analyzing Title VII cases). He contends that SVC failed to follow its own policy when it refused to allow him to enter the Employee Assistance Program instead of firing him. But \u201c[a] defendant\u2019s failure to follow its own policy is not probative of discriminatory animus in absence of proof that the plaintiff was treated differently than other non-minority employees because Title VII does not protect employees from the arbitrary employment practices of their employer, only their discriminatory impact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation omitted). And, aside from Davis\u2019s conclusory statements that he believed he was treated differently because of his race, he has adduced no evidence to demonstrate racial animus. <em>Auguster v. Vermilion Parish Sch. Bd., </em>249 F.3d 400, 403 (5th Cir.2001) (internal quotation omitted) (\u201cThis court has consistently held that an employee\u2019s \u2018subjective belief of discrimination\u2019 alone is not sufficient to warrant judicial relief.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b856-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
