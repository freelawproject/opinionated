By moving to proceed IFP, Cobb is challenging the district court\u2019s certification decision that his appeal was not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Our inquiry into an appellant\u2019s good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Cobb also moves for the appointment of counsel on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">Cobb was convicted of one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute crack cocaine and two counts of distribution of crack cocaine. After his original sentence was vacated on direct appeal, he was resentenced on remand to concurrent imprisonment terms of 360 months on the conspiracy count and 240 months on each of the distribution counts. That sentence was affirmed on direct appeal. In May 2005, the district court granted a motion by the Government for a reduction of Cobb\u2019s sentence pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35 based on Cobb\u2019s substantial assistance to the Government. The district court reduced Cobb\u2019s imprisonment term to 300 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">With respect to Cobb\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, the district court determined that the application of Amendments 706 and 711 lowered Cobb\u2019s total offense level to 38, which resulted in an adjusted guidelines range of 235 to 293 months of imprisonment. In denying relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), the district court reasoned that a further reduction to Cobb\u2019s sentence should not be awarded following his prior reduction under Rule 35 and that Cobb\u2019s 300-month imprisonment term was appropriate considering the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, in light of the seriousness of his offense and the danger he would pose to the community if released earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">Cobb contends that the district court abused its discretion by denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion based in part on his receipt of a prior reduction pursuant to the Government\u2019s Rule 35 motion. He asserts that he should be resentenced within his adjusted guidelines range. Cobb also argues that the district court violated <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and its progeny by making factual findings based on a preponderance of the evidence standard. He further challenges the district court\u2019s factual findings regarding the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and contends that the district court failed to consider his favorable post-sentencing conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-8\">Cobb has failed to show that he will raise a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <em>See Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 220. After noting that Cobb had received a reduction pursuant to Rule 35, the district court indicated that no \u201cfurther reduction should be awarded,\u201d which reflects that the district court was aware of its authority to grant a further reduction but declined to do so. <em>See United States v. Cooley, </em>590 F.3d 293, 297 (5th Cir.2009). The district court was not compelled to grant a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), and its denial of Cobb\u2019s motion did not constitute an abuse of discretion. <em>See id. </em>Additionally, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings are not full resentencings, and the principles of <em>Booker </em>and its progeny do not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings. <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2690-94, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010); <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 238 (5th Cir.2009). Cobb\u2019s arguments regarding the district court\u2019s consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and his post-sentencing conduct are not supported by the record and do not present a nonfrivolous issue for appeal. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 673 &amp; n. 11 (5th Cir.2009). The interests of justice do not require the appointment of counsel on appeal because Cobb\u2019s appeal does not involve complicated or unresolved issues. <em>Cf. United States v. Robinson, </em>542 F.3d 1045, 1052 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-11\">Because Cobb has failed to show that he will raise a nonfrivolous issue on appeal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>his IFP motion is DENIED. His motion for appointment of counsel is DENIED. His appeal is frivolous and is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b817-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
