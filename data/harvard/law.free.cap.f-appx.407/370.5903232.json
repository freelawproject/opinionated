Bolden\u2019s guidelines range was calculated to be 162 to 181 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-21\">At sentencing the district court took into account Bolden\u2019s lack of prior convictions, the support he received from his family, his cognitive impairments, his remorsefulness, and the seriousness of the offenses he committed. In light of those considerations, district court imposed a 60-month concurrent sentence on the two carjacking counts and a consecutive 84-month sentence on the firearm count for a total sentence of 144 months imprisonment. Bolden contends that the district court did not adequately account for his cognitive impairments and that his 144-month sentence is substantively unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to comply with the purposes of sentencing as set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-22\">\u201cSince the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>[U.S. </em>u] <em>Booker </em>[543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) ] decision it has been \u2018pellucidly clear that the familiar abuse-of-discretion standard of review now applies to appellate review of sentencing decisions.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1188 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc) (quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 46, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)). \u201c \u2018A district court abuses its discretion when it (1) fails to afford consideration to relevant factors that were due significant weight, (2) gives significant weight to an improper or irrelevant factor, or (3) commits a clear error of judgment in considering the proper factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Campa, </em>459 F.3d 1121, 1174 (11th Cir.2006) (en banc). \u201cIn the context of sentencing, the proper factors are set out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and a district court commits a clear error in judgment when it weighs those factors unreasonably, arriving at a sentence that does not achieve the purposes of sentencing as stated in \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1189 (quotation marks omitted). \u201cWe may set aside a sentence only if we determine, after giving a full measure of deference to the sentencing judge, that the sentence imposed truly is unreasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1191. The burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable lies with the party who challenges it. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1189 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Bolden has failed to show that his 144-month sentence is substantively unreasonable. Bolden\u2019s sentence represents a downward variance of 18 months below the low end of his applicable guidelines range of 162 to 181 months, and his sentence is 36 months below the statutory maximum of 15 years imprisonment. The district court fully explained its rationale in sentencing Bolden to 144 months, stating that it had considered Bolden\u2019s individual characteristics, including his familial support. The district court expressly stated that \u201cin fashioning this sentence in determining what\u2019s reasonable\u201d it considered Bolden\u2019s lack of criminal history and recognized that \u201che has some cognitive impairment.\u201d The district court did not commit a clear error of judgment in balancing the \u00a7 3353(a) factors. Instead, the court\u2019s statements during the sentence hearing clearly show its understanding that the \u201cgoal is to lock in a sentence that is not too short and not too long, but just right to serve the purposes of \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1197.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
