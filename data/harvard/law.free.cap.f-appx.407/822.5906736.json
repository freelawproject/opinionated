Baquedano argues that he is eligible for withholding of removal because he experienced past persecution and has a well-founded fear of future persecution based on his religion, membership in a particular social group, and political opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">Baquedano did not argue in his appeal to the BIA that he was targeted based on his religion, political opinion, and membership in a particular economic and social class. Therefore, he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies as to these issues, and we lack jurisdiction to consider them. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>260 F.3d 448, 452-53 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">Even assuming that Baquedano exhausted these claims and demonstrated that he was targeted based on his religion, political opinion, or membership in a particular economic and social class, the record does not compel a conclusion contrary to the BIA\u2019s finding that Baquedano did not show past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See Zhu v. Gonzales, </em>493 F.3d 588, 594 (5th Cir.2007). For the forgoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b850-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
