His sole argument on appeal is that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to advise him to plead guilty and by failing to secure a plea bargain agreement with the Government. He seeks vacatur of his conviction and a new trial. Alternatively, he requests a remand so that an evidentiary hearing can be conducted as to his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-24\">As a general rule, this court will not consider an ineffective-assistanee-of-counsel claim that was not raised in district court. <em>United States v. Higdon, </em>832 F.2d 312, 313-14 (5th Cir.1987). Moreover, the Supreme Court has emphasized that a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion is the preferred method for raising a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>Massaro v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 503-04, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003). As the record for this case is not sufficiently developed to qualify for an exception to that general rule, we decline to consider Moreno\u2019s ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim in this appeal without prejudice to his ability to raise this claim in a \u00a7 2255 motion. Also, in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s stated preference for resolution of such claims via a \u00a7 2255 motion, we deny Moreno\u2019s alternative request for a remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-25\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b854-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
