But Reinhard\u2019s investment business fell on hard times in the early 2000s, and amid allegations of mismanagement, he filed for bankruptcy in 2006. Two years later, after a lengthy investigation by the Internal</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-15\">Revenue Service, a federal grand jury returned a 23-count indictment charging Re-inhard with bank fraud under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1014 and failing to disclose assets to the bankruptcy trustee, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(3).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Reinhard pleaded guilty to both charges.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1010-16\">The district court, after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guideline concerning victim losses, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l), increased Reinhard\u2019s offense level by 12, sentenced him at the top of the applicable guidelines range to 51 months in prison, and issued a restitution order.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In this appeal, Reinhard challenges the district court\u2019s application of \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l) and presents two questions for our consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-17\">First, after filing for bankruptcy in 2006, Reinhard failed to disclose that he owned three valuable glass sculptures. The works were appraised at $40,000 each in 2004, but one of them sold at auction for only $24,000 in 2007. Did the district court err by using the works\u2019 2004 appraisal value to measure the bankruptcy estate\u2019s loss?</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-18\">Second, Reinhard defaulted on a loan that his bank had modified in reliance on false documentation he submitted. Rein-hard contends that the bank was going to lose money anyway before the loan was modified. Did the district court err by attributing the bank\u2019s loss to Reinhard\u2019s fraud? If so, was the corresponding order of restitution improper?</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-19\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-20\">We begin our analysis with the loss attributable to Reinhard\u2019s bankruptcy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>fraud. The district court determined that the bankruptcy estate\u2019s loss on the undisclosed sculptures was $120,000: three times the $40,000 appraisal figure for each work.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court\u2019s determination is a factual finding that we review for clear error. <em>United States v. Cabrera, </em>172 F.3d 1287, 1292 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-4\">Reinhard concedes that the estate\u2019s loss should be measured by the value of the undisclosed artworks,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> but he argues that the district court clearly erred by relying on outdated appraisals in a sinking economy. He contends that the $24,000 auction price was a more appropriate measure of each work\u2019s value.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-5\">There is something to be said for Rein-hard\u2019s argument, but we see no clear error in the district court\u2019s finding that the appraisals were a better measure of value. For one thing, just as the 2004 appraisals may have overstated the sculptures\u2019 2006 value, the 2007 sale price may have understated the works\u2019 2006 value. And although auction prices are often good indicators of market value, Reinhard sold the work at issue here online, through eBay. Unlike a gallery sale or live auction \u2014 in which buyers would have been able to see the sculpture in person \u2014 the online auction reduced the work to a flat, digital representation. The Government presented a reasonable estimate of the bankruptcy estate\u2019s loss,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the court did not err by finding that formal appraisals were a better indication of value here than an online auction price.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-11\">With respect to Reinhard\u2019s bank fraud, the following facts were established before sentencing. Reinhard financed the purchase of a 2000 Sea Ray pleasure boat with a loan from SouthTrust Bank.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In 2003, Reinhard decided to reduce his debt-servicing burden by selling the Sea Ray and using the proceeds to buy a smaller 2004 Contender boat. To secure financing for the deal, Reinhard provided SouthTrust with what purported to be a copy of his 2001 federal tax return. Relying on that document, SouthTrust agreed to modify the terms of the original loan by accepting a $95,000 payment on the outstanding principal and substituting the Contender for the Sea Ray as collateral.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-12\">But the document Reinhard gave to the bank had never been filed with the IRS. Moreover, where the return he gave the bank showed $944,000 in adjusted gross income, the return he had actually filed reported only $389,000. According to an IRS investigator\u2019s conversation with the bank\u2019s president, had the bank been given Reinhard\u2019s <em>real </em>tax return, it never would have approved the loan modification. And when Reinhard defaulted on the modified loan, SouthTrust was left with a deficiency of over $147,000.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1012-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>A. <em>Sentencing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1012-4\">Reinhard contends that the bank was going to lose money regardless of whether it modified the loan, and he argues that the district court erred by attributing a loss that the bank would have incurred anyway (when he defaulted on the original loan) to his fraud. The Government, on the other hand, insists that Reinhard should be held responsible for any loss that the bank incurred on the loan as modified. In other words, the Government prefers a simpler loss calculation: \u201cWhile it may be true that the bank was ultimately in a better position in relation to its loan to the defendant after the Contender transaction, the evidence established that the bank ultimately lost $147,240.76.\u201d Appellee\u2019s Br. 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-5\">We are skeptical of the Government\u2019s argument,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> but we need not decide the issue here. In calculating the advisory range of sentences under the Guidelines, the district court increased Reinhard\u2019s offense level by 12 points because the total loss attributable to his bank and bankruptcy frauds was $357,817, or between $200,000 and $400,000. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(1). In addition to the bank\u2019s $147,000 deficiency, that figure included the $120,000 bankruptcy loss associated with the undisclosed artworks and other, undisputed losses of over $90,000. Even if we concluded that the district court had erred by holding Reinhard responsible for the deficiency, the total loss would still exceed $210,000 \u2014 which would warrant the same 12-point offense-level adjustment that the district court applied. Because a mistake on this point would not have affected Reinhard\u2019s sentence, any error was harmless. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Raad, </em>406 F.3d 1322, 1323 n. 1 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-9\">B. <em>Restitution</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1012-10\">The district court also ordered Reinhard to pay the bank over $171,000 in restitution, which included the $147,000 deficiency along with interest and attorney\u2019s fees. The Mandatory Victims Restitution Act requires a sentencing court to order the defendant to compensate his victims for any financial losses \u201cresulting\u201d from his crimes. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A. The question here is whether the district court clearly erred in its finding that the bank\u2019s exposure to the deficiency resulted from Reinhard\u2019s fraud. <em>See United States v. Hasson, </em>333 F.3d 1264, 1270 (11th Cir.2003) (\u201cWe review factual findings underlying a restitution order for clear error.\u201d).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1012-11\">In defense of the award, the Government adopts the same argument it made concerning loss under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(1): Reinhard should pay for the bank\u2019s losses regardless of whether it \u201cwas ultimately in a better position in relation to its loan\u201d after the modification. Appellee\u2019s Br. 21. But that simplistic approach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>would run afoul of express language in the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act, which authorizes restitution only for losses \u201cresulting\u201d from the \u201coffense.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A(b)(l); <em>cf. United States v. Dickerson, </em>370 F.3d 1330, 1335 (11th Cir.2004) (\u201cA federal district court has \u2018no inherent authority to order restitution, and may do so only as explicitly empowered by statute.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>United States v. Hensley, </em>91 F.3d 274, 276 (1st Cir.1996))). Defaulting on a loan is not a crime, and holding Reinhard responsible for what the bank \u201cultimately\u201d lost \u2014 even if the modification may have <em>saved </em>it money \u2014 would be to hold him responsible for loss resulting not from the offense itself, but from a preexisting and lawful business relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-5\">Reinhard\u2019s offense was making false statements during his application for a loan modification.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> And the only loss that could fairly be said to have resulted from that offense is loss proximately caused by the modification itself, as opposed to the original loan. As the district court said, \u201cif there was a loss that was already going to be incurred anyway, then that\u2019s not attributable to the later fraud.\u201d Sentencing Tr. 6; <em>see also United States v. Liss, </em>265 F.3d 1220, 1231 (11th Cir.2001) (\u201cAn award of restitution must be based on the amount of loss actually caused by the defendant\u2019s conduct.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-6\">When the defendant challenges the amount of a victim\u2019s loss for the purposes of a restitution award, the Government bears the burden of proving that loss by a preponderance of the evidence. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(e). Here, therefore, the Government had to prove that the bank\u2019s losses on the modified loan exceeded those the bank would have incurred when Reinhard defaulted on the original loan. The only evidence the Government produced on this point was testimony that the bank never would have modified the loan if it had known that Reinhard submitted a false tax return with his application.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-9\">On the other side of the scale was conflicting testimony from the same witness that the bank agreed to the modification \u201cbecause it was actually reducing the bank\u2019s risk with respect to the [original] loan.\u201d Sentencing Tr. 49. And although the financial particulars of the modification are hazy, rough figures in the record support Reinhard\u2019s contention that the bank benefitted from the transaction. We know from the modification agreement, for instance, that the outstanding balance on the original loan was around $327,000. And testimony at the sentencing hearing revealed that Reinhard gave the bank $95,000 to facilitate the modification, under the terms of which the bank financed the purchase of a $265,000 boat with a $233,000 loan. This development not only reduced the bank\u2019s overall exposure; it also left the bank with a fully secured loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-10\">Although the deficiency when Reinhard defaulted means that the modified loan eventually <em>became </em>undersecured, the record does not support a finding that the modification left the bank undersecured at the outset. Accordingly, unless the loan was at least as oversecured before the modification as it was afterward, none of the bank\u2019s loss on the deficiency can be attributed to Reinhard\u2019s fraud. And by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>failing to show that the modified loan was any riskier than the original,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the Government failed to present enough evidence to support the district court\u2019s finding that the bank\u2019s loss was properly charged to Rein-hard\u2019s crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\">Notwithstanding the Government\u2019s failure to discharge its burden of proof on this issue, the district court concluded that <em>all </em>of the bank\u2019s loss on the deficiency resulted from the fraud. This finding not only discounted the possibility \u201cthat the bank was going to take a loss anyway,\u201d Sentencing Tr. 63, it also assumed, without any evidence, that the bank would have taken <em>no </em>loss if Reinhard had defaulted on the loan under its original terms. The record, at least in its current state, thus leaves us \u201cwith the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Bessemer City, </em>470 U.S. 564, 573, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985), <em>quoted in United States v. Robertson, </em>493 F.3d 1322, 1330 (11th Cir.2007). This was clear error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-6\">Because the district court committed, at most, only harmless error with respect to the victim-loss calculations under the Guidelines, we affirm Reinhard\u2019s sentence. But in light of our conclusion that the court clearly erred in its finding that Rein-hard\u2019s bank fraud \u201cresult[ed] in damage or loss\u201d to SouthTrust, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A(b)(l), we vacate the restitution award in favor of the bank and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1014-9\">AFFIRMED in part, VACATED in part, and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1010-11\">.
