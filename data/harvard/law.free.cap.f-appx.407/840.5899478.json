Robinson, federal prisoner # 11224-035, appeals the denial of his 28 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion regarding his jury-trial conviction for conspiracy to possess, with intent to distribute, 50 grams or more of crack cocaine, and his resulting 324-month sentence. The district court granted a certif\u00edcate of appealability for \u201cwhether petitioner was prejudicially denied the effective assistance of counsel in violation of the Sixth Amendment in connection with the advice provided concerning the sentencing guidelines\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">For a \u00a7 2255 claim for ineffective assistance of counsel (IAC), the district court\u2019s conclusions of law are reviewed <em>de novo; </em>its findings of fact, for clear error. <em>United States v. Molina-Uribe, </em>429 F.3d 514, 518 (5th Cir.2005). An evidentiary hearing was held for Robinson\u2019s IAC claim, at which he and his trial counsel testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">A district court\u2019s IAC conclusions are mixed questions of law and fact, subject to <em>de novo </em>review. <em>United State v. Faubion, </em>19 F.3d 226, 228 (5th Cir.1994). To prevail on an IAC claim, defendant must show: his counsel\u2019s performance fell below objective standards of reasonableness and, therefore, was deficient; <em>and </em>he was prejudiced by that performance. <em>E.g., Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 700,104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Regarding the first prong, defendant must overcome a \u201cstrong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">Robinson claims IAC by asserting counsel: failed to advise him on the maximum sentence he faced under the Sentencing Guidelines; did not inform him of the specific sentencing ranges for proceeding to trial and pleading guilty; and told him the sentencing range would be the same whether he proceeded to trial or pleaded guilty. Robinson notes his sentencing range would have been 235-293 months had he pleaded guilty, rather than the 324-405 months he faced following trial; and he maintains he would have pleaded guilty had he been so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-10\">The record reflects the district court did not err in ruling counsel\u2019s performance was <em>not </em>deficient. <em>Cf. United States v. Grammas, </em>376 F.3d 433, 435-37 (5th Cir.2004) (holding performance deficient where counsel grossly underestimated defendant\u2019s sentencing exposure if he were found guilty at trial); <em>United States v. Herrera, </em>412 F.3d 577, 579-82 (5th Cir.2005) (remanding for district court to determine whether counsel\u2019s 27-month miscalculation constitutes deficient performance). Robinson failed to show his counsel underestimated his sentencing exposure, much less <em>grossly </em>did so. Counsel advised Robinson he was facing a substantial sentence whether he pleaded guilty or proceeded to trial (20-year range for guilty-plea; in excess of 20 years for going to trial), and informed him he could receive substantial reductions in his sentence for acceptance of responsibility and substantial assistance. Further, counsel testified: he repeatedly advised Robinson it would be in his best interest to plead guilty; but, despite counsel\u2019s efforts, Robinson was adamant about proceeding to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b868-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
