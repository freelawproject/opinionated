Dec. 22, 2009), <em>aff'g </em>No. A094 787 512 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Feb. 5, 2008). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">Li challenges the agency\u2019s denial of his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief. Under the circumstances of this case, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as supplemented and modified by the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>See Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 522 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). The applicable standards of review are well-established. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4); <em>see also Manzur v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>494 F.3d 281, 289 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">I. Past Persecution</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">We find no error in the agency\u2019s determination that the harm Li allegedly suffered in China was not sufficiently severe to rise to the level of persecution. <em>See Ivanishvili v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>433 F.3d 332, 341 (2d Cir.2006) (\u201c[Persecution does not encompass mere harassment\u201d); <em>cf. Baba v. Holder, </em>569 F.3d 79, 81 (2d Cir.2009) (\u201cDaily beatings, a near-starvation diet, and a death threat, administered by the national police during a week-long detention in harsh prison conditions ... satisfy the standard for persecution ....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-11\">II. Well-Founded Fear of Persecution</p>\n<p id=\"b567-12\">We also find no error in the agency\u2019s determination that Li failed to establish a well-founded fear of future persecution given his failure to provide reasonably available corroboration. \u201cIn determining whether the applicant has met [his] burden, the [agency] may weigh the credible testimony along with other evidence of record,\u201d and where the agency \u201cdetermines that the applicant should provide evidence that corroborates otherwise credible testimony, such evidence must be provided unless the applicant does not have the evidence and cannot reasonably obtain the evidence.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(ii). Here, the BIA pointed out that the letter Li\u2019s parents provided failed to mention his alleged detention in 2004 or that police sought to arrest him in 2005, despite his testimony that they had knowledge of both of these events. Moreover, the agency found that Li failed to provide an affidavit from the friend he allegedly visited after his encounter with Chinese officials, despite the fact that the friend now lives in Canada and Li remains in contact with this person. Thus, the agency did not err in finding that Li failed to provide adequate and reasonably available corroboration for his claimed fear of futui\u2019e persecution. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b567-13\">Additionally, we are unpersuaded by Li\u2019s assertion that, under the REAL ID Act, the IJ erred in failing to afford him notice of the corroboration she found lacking and an opportunity to remedy this evidentiary shortcoming. We have held that the IJ\u2019s designation of missing corroboration need not be done prior to the disposition of an alien\u2019s claim. <em>See Chuilu </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number><em>Liu v. Holder, </em>575 F.3d 193, 198-99 (2d Cir.2009). Although the Coui't in <em>Chuilu Liu </em>limited its holding to pre-REAL ID Act cases, Li points to no language in the REAL ID Act providing for the notice requirement he urges. Moreover, such a requirement would contradict the immigration court\u2019s rule that all supporting evidence be filed in advance of the merits hearing and would require the IJ to conduct two merits hearings in many cases, causing considerable delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">Furthermore, contrary to Li\u2019s argument, the agency specifically considered his fear of future persecution based on his testimony that he will join an underground church upon return to China and inevitably be arrested for proselytizing to others, and reasonably determined that Li\u2019s fear was too speculative to be objectively reasonable. <em>See Jian Xing Huang v. U.S. INS, </em>421 F.3d 125, 128-29 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">Finally, because Li was unable to show the objective likelihood of persecution needed to make out an asylum claim, and because his claims for withholding of removal and CAT relief were based on the same factual predicate as his asylum claim, he was necessarily unable to meet the higher standard required to succeed on a claim for withholding of removal or CAT relief. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Gomez v. INS, 947 </em>F.2d 660, 665 (2d Cir.1991); <em>see also Yang, </em>426 F.3d at 523.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
