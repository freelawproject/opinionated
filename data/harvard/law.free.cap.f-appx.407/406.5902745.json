However, the ALJ afforded those findings little weight because they contradicted the record on the whole, which demonstrated that Goodman\u2019s mental condition had no more than a minimal effect on his ability to do basic work activities. <em>See Brady v. Heckler, </em>724 F.2d 914, 920 (11th Cir.1984). The ALJ provided specific and detailed reasons for this finding, which Goodman does not challenge on appeal and which we conclude are supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Moore v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1212 (11th Cir.2005). We further find no reversible error in the ALJ\u2019s use of the Medical Vocational Guidelines instead of a vocational expert when determining Goodman\u2019s ability to perform jobs in the national economy. <em>See Passopulos v. Sullivan, </em>976 F.2d 642, 648 (11th Cir.1992). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b434-16\">. \"[W]e review <em>de novo </em>the legal principles upon which the Commissioner's decision is based. However, we review the resulting decision only to determine whether it is supported by substantial evidence. Substantial evidence is less than a preponderance, but rather such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Moore v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1211 (11th Cir.2005) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b434-22\">. Goodman also argues that chronic pain and neuropathy were severe impairments, but we do not address these arguments because he failed to raise them in the district court. <em>See Jones v.
