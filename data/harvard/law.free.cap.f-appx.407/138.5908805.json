In 2009 the United States Supreme Court decided the case of <em>Nijhawan v. Holder, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2294, 174 L.Ed.2d 22 (2009), and held that, when evaluating offenses under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 (a)(43)(M)(i), courts should treat the references to \u201cvictim or victims\u201d and a monetary loss in excess of $10,000 \u201cnot ... [as] an element of the fraud or deceit crime,\u201d but as \u201creferences] to the particular circumstances in which an offender committed a (more broadly defined) fraud or deceit crime on a particular occasion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2297-98. In determining whether these circumstances were present in a particular case, the Court also indicated that the decisionmaker would not be limited to reviewing the record of conviction, but could also consider a restitution order. <em>Id. </em>at 2303. Here, <em>Nijhawan </em>is controlling. The Board of Immigration Appeals did not err in affirming the Immigration Judge\u2019s reliance on the order of restitution to find that Petitioner\u2019s conviction for unlawful use of means of identification, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(a)(7), constituted an aggravated felony conviction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(M)(i). Therefore, we lack jurisdiction to review Petitioner\u2019s final order of removal. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b167-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
