Perkins moves for appointment of counsel on appeal and to file a supplemental brief. The Government moves for summary affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-21\">Relying on <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), Perkins argues that <em>Booker </em>is applicable to \u00a7 3582(c) proceedings and that the Guidelines governing \u00a7 3582(c) proceedings are advisory, not mandatory. These issues are foreclosed. <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2692, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010); <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 236-39 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>(5th Cir.), <em>cert.denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 180 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"AnA\">Perkins further argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion to reduce his sentence due to his career offender status because his sentence was \u201cbased on\u201d the cocaine base guidelines. This issue is foreclosed. <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>591 F.3d 789, 790 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"AEt\">In a related issue, Perkins argues that the district court clearly erred by finding that he was a career offender. He contends that he was not a career offender because one of the two prior controlled substance offenses used to determine his career offender status was a conviction for simple possession and was not a controlled substance offense. Perkins may not use his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to challenge the district court\u2019s application of the career offender enhancement in its calculation of his original sentence by arguing that the prior stat\u00e9 conviction used to impose the career offender enhancement was not a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d under \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>See United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1011 (5th Cir.1995); <em>see also Doublin, </em>572 F.3d at 238.</p>\n<p id=\"AEQF\">Perkins also argues that the district court abused its discretion by not fully considering the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and by not making other appropriate findings. Section 3582(c)(2) permits the discretionary modification of a defendant\u2019s sentence in certain cases where his guidelines range has been subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>Doublin, </em>572 F.3d at 237. In those cases, the district court may reduce the sentence after considering the applicable factors of \u00a7 3553(a) and the pertinent guideline policy statements. <em>Id. </em>Because Perkins was sentenced as a career offender, the district court did not have the discretion to consider reducing his sentence, and so the district court was not required to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The only finding required was made, that Perkins was sentenced as a career offender and not entitled to a reduction in his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"AWqv\">Lastly,Perkins argues that he had a right to appointed counsel in the district court. He contends that the amendments to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)\u2019s procedures governing \u00a7 3582(c) proceedings have made the proceedings more complex and so <em>United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1011 (5th Cir.1995) should not be controlling. Recently, this court suggested that \u201c[t]he question ... of whether a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion triggers either a statutory or constitutional right to an attorney \u2014 in either this court or the district court \u2014 is a different question now than it was before the [2008] amendments to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b),\u201d because the amendments allow district courts to exercise discretion in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, where previously they had none. <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>542 F.3d 1045, 1052 (5th Cir.2008).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nonetheless, because Perkins was not even eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), we conclude that the district court did not need to exercise discretion to deny his motion, and thus he was not entitled to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"AkB\">Accordingly, we DENY Perkins\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel on appeal be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>cause it would not serve the interests of justice. <em>See United States v. Robinson, </em>542 F.3d 1045,1051-52 (5th Cir.2008). His motion to file a supplemental brief is also DENIED. The Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b872-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
