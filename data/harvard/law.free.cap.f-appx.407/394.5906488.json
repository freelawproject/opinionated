After review, we reverse and remand for additional proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-22\">A claimant for SSI benefits must prove he is disabled. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.912. The Social Security regulations provide a five-step evaluation process for determining whether a claimant is disabled. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.945(a). The Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) must evaluate (1) whether the claimant engaged in substantial gainful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>activity; (2) whether the claimant has a severe impairment; (3) whether the severe impairment meets or equals an impairment in the Listing of Impairments; (4) whether the claimant has the residual functional capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d) to perform his past relevant work;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and (5) whether, in light of the claimant\u2019s RFC, age, education and work experience, there are other jobs the claimant can perform. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920(a)(4); <em>see also Phillips v. Barnhart, </em>357 F.3d 1232, 1237 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">Here, the ALJ determined at steps one through three that McCrea had not engaged in substantial gainful activity since September 26, 2005, and had these severe impairments that did not meet or equal a listed impairment: polysubstance abuse; a history of bladder cancer \u2014 post resection with urostomy placement and residual right testicular pain; hypertension; depressive disorder; and estimated borderline intellectual functioning. At step four, the ALJ concluded that McCrea had the RFC to perform his past relevant work as a janitor and, thus, was not disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">A. Past Relevant Work</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">On appeal, the Commissioner concedes that the ALJ\u2019s finding that McCrea could return to his past relevant work is not supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">At step four, a claimant will be found not disabled if he can return to his past relevant work. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920(a)(4)(iv). Past relevant work is work: (1) that the claimant performed within the last fifteen years, (2) that lasted long enough for the claimant to learn how to do the work, and (3) that was performed at the level of substantial gainful activity. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.965(a). Substantial gainful activity is work that \u201cinvolves doing significant physical or mental activities\u201d that is done \u201cfor pay or profit.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.972(a)-(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-13\">In evaluating whether the claimant\u2019s past work is substantial gainful activity, the ALJ\u2019s \u201cprimary consideration will be the earnings [the claimant] derive[d] from the work activity.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.974(a)(1). Under the regulations\u2019 earnings guidelines, a claimant\u2019s earnings (in 2001 and each year thereafter) ordinarily will show that he engaged in substantial gainful activity if the earnings were more than the previous year or the average monthly earnings were more than $700, adjusted for changes in the national average wage index. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.974(b)(2)(i)-(ii), <em>see also id. </em>\u00a7 416.974a (explaining that to determine whether a claimant is doing substantial gainful activity, the ALJ will average monthly earnings).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-15\">Here, it is not clear from McCrea\u2019s testimony or the disability reports how long McCrea worked as a janitor between 1990 and 2005 (the fifteen-year period before he filed his application) or how much he earned from this work. McCrea testified that he (1) performed janitorial services \u201coff and on since 1974\u201d; (2) was incarcerated from 1987 to 2003, during which time he built wheelchairs; and (3) worked as a janitor in Pensacola in 2004. During the hearing, the ALJ did not question McCrea to determine the exact nature of his janitorial work. Additionally, McCrea earned approximately $5,000 ($416 per month) in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>2004, less than the $700 average monthly earnings needed to constitute substantial gainful activity for that year. Accordingly, the ALJ did not have the information needed to determine whether McCrea\u2019s prior work as a janitor qualified as substantial gainful activity and thus was past relevant work that McCrea could perform.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">The ALJ has an obligation to develop a full and fair record. <em>Graham v. Apfel, </em>129 F.3d 1420, 1422 (11th Cir.1997). Remand for further development of the record is appropriate when there are evidentiary gaps that result in prejudice. <em>Brown v. Shalala, </em>44 F.3d 931, 935 (11th Cir.1995). Given that the record lacks substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s finding that McCrea could perform past relevant work as a janitor, remand is appropriate. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g); <em>Jackson v. Chater, </em>99 F.3d 1086, 1092 (11th Cir.1996) (explaining that a \u201cremand to develop a full and fair record in accordance with law is a sentence-four remand\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">B. McCrea\u2019s Bias Allegations</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">McCrea contends our remand should be with instructions to assign the case to a different ALJ because the original ALJ allegedly demonstrated bias during the hearing. <em>See Miles v. Chater, </em>84 F.3d 1397, 1400 (11th Cir.1996) (explaining that a claimant is entitled to an impartial ALJ); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.940 (disqualifying an ALJ who \u201cis prejudiced or partial with respect to any party or has any interest in the matter pending for decision\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As evidence of bias, McCrea points to statements the ALJ made during the hearing as to the effect of drug use on a claimant\u2019s eligibility for benefits. Specifically, the ALJ noted that the treating physician\u2019s notes indicated that McCrea had tested positive for cocaine and marijuana. After McCrea admitted he had used \u201cdope\u201d three weeks earlier to treat his pain, the ALJ stated that claimants who use drugs are not eligible for benefits and that he would not consider McCrea\u2019s mental impairments because they were caused by drug use.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-10\">The Commissioner concedes that the ALJ misstated the law as to the evaluation of evidence of drug addiction. Under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(2)(C) and its implementing regulations, only after the ALJ determines that a claimant is disabled and finds medical evidence of drug addiction does the ALJ \u201c \u2018determine whether ... drug addiction ... is a contributing factor material to the determination of disability.\u2019 \u201d <em>Doughty v. Apfel, </em>245 F.3d 1274, 1279 (11th Cir.2001) (quoting 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1535). The \u201ckey factor\u201d in this \u201c \u2018materiality determination\u2019 \u201d is \u201cwhether the claimant would still be found disabled if he stopped using drugs or alcohol.\u201d <em>Id.; see also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1535(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-11\">However, the ALJ\u2019s misstatements do not show that the ALJ was biased against McCrea such that he did not receive a full and fair hearing. First, during the hearing, despite these misstatements, the ALJ did not focus exclusively on McCrea\u2019s drug use and allowed McCrea to testify about his mental impairments, mainly his depression, in addition to his physical impairments. Second, the ALJ did not repeat these misstatements in his written opinion. Indeed, the ALJ\u2019s written opinion summarized the evidence of McCrea\u2019s mental im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>pairments, determined that McCrea\u2019s substance abuse, depression and borderline intellectual functioning were serious impairments, gave substantial weight to a doctor\u2019s mental residual functional capacity assessment and included McCrea\u2019s limitations due to his mental impairments in the RFC finding. Finally, because the ALJ concluded, at step four, that McCrea was not disabled, the ALJ did not reach the \u201cmateriality determination\u201d of \u00a7 423(d)(2)(C), which occurs only if the ALJ concludes a claimant is disabled. For this reason, the ALJ\u2019s written opinion had no reason to consider the effect of McCrea\u2019s drug use on his eligibility for benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">Accordingly, we reverse the district court\u2019s judgment and remand the case with instructions that it be returned to the Commissioner for further development of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b423-14\">. We review the Commissioner\u2019s decision to determine whether it is supported by substantial evidence and applies the correct legal standards. <em>Crawford v. Comm'r of Soc. Sec., </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1158 (11th Cir.2004). \"Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). Determining whether a remand is necessary is a <em>de novo </em>proceeding. <em>Smith v. Bowen, </em>792 F.2d 1547, 1550 (11th Cir.1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b424-8\">. RFC is the most a claimant can do despite any physical or mental limitations caused by the impairment and its related symptoms. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.945(a)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b424-16\">. The Commissioner initially raised this issue in a motion to remand. This Court denied the motion to remand so that McCrea\u2019s claim that the ALJ showed bias, which we discuss <em>infra, </em>could be addressed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b425-8\">. The Commissioner argues that McCrea waived his bias claim by failing to object to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation (\"R &amp; R\u201d) that concluded McCrea\u2019s bias claim lacked merit. Where, as here, the appellant failed to object to an R &amp; R, we review the findings of fact only for plain error or manifest injustice, but still review the legal conclusions <em>de novo. See United States v. Roberts, </em>858 F.2d 698, 701 (11th Cir.1988); <em>United States v. Warren, </em>687 F.2d 347, 348 (11th Cir.1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
