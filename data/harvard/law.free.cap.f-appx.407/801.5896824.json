Pursuant to his plea agreement, Lerma waived his right to appeal his conviction or sentence, although he reserved the right to raise claims of ineffective assistance of counsel or prosecutorial misconduct. On appeal, Lerma asserts that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance, which potentially resulted in his failure to receive a sentence at the bottom of the applicable guidelines range. Lerma also apparently contends that his 76-month sentence violated his due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-21\">The record is insufficiently developed to allow consideration at this time of Lerma\u2019s ineffective assistance claims. <em>See United States v. Cantwell, </em>470 F.3d 1087, 1091 (5th Cir.2006). As for Lerma\u2019s allegations that he was denied due process, such claims are barred by the waiver-of-appeal provision in his plea agreement, which was knowing, voluntary, and enforceable. <em>See United States v. Bond, </em>414 F.3d 542, 544 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. McKinney, </em>406 F.3d 744, 746 (5th Cir.2005); Fed. R.CrimP. 11(b)(1)(N). Consequently, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b829-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
