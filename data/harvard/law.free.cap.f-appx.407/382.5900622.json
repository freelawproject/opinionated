Rojas-Ramirez argues his bottom-of-the-Guidelines-range sentence is substantively unreasonable because the sentence overstates his criminal history and overemphasizes his negative personal characteristics. After review, we affirm Rojas-Ramirez\u2019s sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b411-21\">Rojas-Ramirez fails to demonstrate his sentence is substantively unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. In fashioning the sentence, the district court stressed Rojas-Ramirez\u2019s recidivist violation of U.S. immigration law, Rojas-Ramirez\u2019s violence toward his family, and the need for a \u201cserious penalty\u201d to deter repetitious violation of the U.S. immigration laws. Rojas-Ramirez has entered the United States illegally at least three times in the past 30 years and has been deported twice. The 57-month sentence occupies the bottom of the applicable Guidelines range of 57 to 71 months, and we ordinarily expect such a sentence to be reasonable. <em>See United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). Because Rojas-Ramirez\u2019s sentence is supported by the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing Rojas-Ramirez to 57 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b411-16\">. We review a final sentence imposed by the district court for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1245 (11th Cir.2005). Reasonableness review is akin to the deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
