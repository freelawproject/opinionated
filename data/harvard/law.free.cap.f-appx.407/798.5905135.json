He appeals the 188-month sentence imposed upon his conviction. He argues that the district court erred in (1) determining the drug quantity attributable to him under the Guidelines, (2) applying a two-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 SBl.l(c) on the basis that he occupied a leadership role, (3) applying a two-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.4 for use of a minor in connection with the offense; and (4) denying him safety-valve relief under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"A2j\">Salazar has not shown that the district court clearly erred in holding him accountable for more than 3 but less than 10 kilograms of heroin for purposes of sentencing. <em>See United States v. Betancourt, </em>422 F.3d 240, 246 (5th Cir.2005); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 (applying a base offense level of 34 to offenses involving at least 3 kilograms but less than 10 kilograms of heroin). Salazar conceded that the instant offense involved 2.476 kilograms of heroin. The record supports that he previously completed at least two smuggling trips for the same organization \u2014 which was associated with other attempts to smuggle heroin \u2014 and was paid identically for this trip and each of his prior trips. Thus, the district court could have inferred that Salazar smuggled a similar amount of heroin on each trip. <em>See United States v. Medina, </em>161 F.3d 867, 877 (5th Cir.1998). Because the record supports that Salazar\u2019s prior trips involved at least .524 kilograms of heroin, the district court\u2019s quantity finding was plausible in light of the record as a whole. <em>See Medina, </em>161 F.3d at 877.</p>\n<p id=\"A3H\">Salazar\u2019s challenge to the two-level adjustment pursuant to \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) also lacks merit. A defendant qualifies for a \u00a7 3B1.1 adjustment if he was the organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of one or more other participants. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment. (n.2). While Salazar asserts that he and his wife participated equally in the instant offense, the record supports that Salazar recruited his wife to participate in the offense because he believed that her participation would reduce the likelihood of detection. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3B1.1, comment, (n.4) (noting that two-level adjustment is warranted if defendant, inter alia, recruits accomplices). Moreover, the record indicates that Salazar directed his wife with respect to the manner in which the offense should be completed, i.e., he instructed his wife regarding the logistics of the offense and commanded her to perform particular acts. <em>See United States v. Turner, </em>319 F.3d 716, 725 (5th Cir.2003). Thus, Salazar has not shown that the district court clearly erred in applying an enhancement under \u00a7 3Bl.l(c). <em>See United States v. Rose, </em>449 F.3d 627, 633 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"Ay1-\">Salazar\u2019s contention that he should not have been assessed an adjustment under \u00a7 3B1.4 is likewise unavailing. Section 3B1.4 provides that a defendant who \u201cused or attempted to use a person less than eighteen years of age to commit the offense or assist in avoiding detection of, or apprehension for, the offense\u201d is subject to a two-level sentence enhancement. \u00a7 3B1.4. While Salazar argues that his child merely was present during the smuggling attempt, Salazar hid the heroin within a child car seat on which his son was seated during the attempt. The district court plausibly could have inferred that the child was included to reduce suspicion and to facilitate passage across the border without agents detecting the presence of heroin. <em>See United States v. Mata, </em>624 F.3d 170, 175 (5th Cir.2010). Because the record does not contain the basis for the sentencing judge\u2019s decision to deny Salazar\u2019s wife a similar \u00a7 3B1.4 adjustment, we are unable to determine whether any disparity in the application of the adjustment was unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>Finally, Salazar\u2019s contention that the district court erred when it denied him a safety valve reduction is without merit. Salazar argues that the district court\u2019s determination that he was not eligible for a safety valve reduction was based on its erroneous conclusion that he was an organizer or leader. Because the district court did not clearly err in determining that Salazar was an organizer or leader pursuant to \u00a7 3Bl.l(c), he was ineligible for a safety valve reduction. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 501.2(a)(4). Therefore, Salazar has not shown clear error. <em>See United States v. Miller, </em>179 F.3d 961, 963-64 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b827-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
