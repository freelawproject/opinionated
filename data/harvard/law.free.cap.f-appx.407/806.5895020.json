The parties agree that the relevant issue is when Osei agreed to plead guilty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>to a 1996 state charge of credit card abuse. If a plea agreement was \u201cmade\u201d before April 24, 1996, then Osei would be eligible for relief under former \u00a7 212(c); if a plea agreement was made on a later date, then he would not be eligible for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">Because Osei is removable based on a prior firearm conviction, we lack jurisdiction to consider the BIA\u2019s determination that Osei is ineligible for a waiver of inadmissibility. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C). Although this provision does not preclude review of constitutional claims and questions of law, <em>see </em>\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D), we find that Osei has not made any arguments in his brief raising a colorable constitutional claim or a question of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">Accordingly, Osei\u2019s petition for review is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b834-23\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
