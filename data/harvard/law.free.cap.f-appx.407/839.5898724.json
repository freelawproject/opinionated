The district court dismissed the claim as frivolous and for failure to state a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>claim pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <em>\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). </em>Wolters\u2019s motion is a challenge to the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith. See <em>Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). This court\u2019s inquiry into whether the appeal is taken in good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Because the district court dismissed Wolters\u2019s claim as both frivolous and for failure to state a claim, review is de novo. See <em>Geiger v. Jowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 373 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">Wolters has failed to show that he is entitled to relief on his retaliation claim. Wolters does not state when his grievances were filed and against whom they were filed. Nor does he state when the allegedly retaliatory actions occurred, merely referring to \u201cfalse reports\u201d and other \u201cforms of retaliatory conduct.\u201d He has thus failed to set forth a chronology of events from which retaliation may plausibly be inferred. <em>See Woods v. Smith, </em>60 F.3d 1161, 1166 (5th Cir.1995). Wolters\u2019s conclusional allegations, based on his personal belief, that he had been retaliated against are not sufficient to state a valid claim of retaliation. <em>See Jones v. Greninger, </em>188 F.3d 322, 325 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">Wolters\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and, thus, frivolous. <em>See Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 219-20. Because the appeal is frivolous, it is dismissed. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. Wolters is cautioned that the dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a strike under \u00a7 1915(g), as does the district court\u2019s dismissal as frivolous. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). He, therefore, has two strikes under \u00a7 1915(g). Wolters is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he \u201cis under imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-9\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b867-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
