The BIA\u2019s determination that an alien is not eligible for withholding of removal is a factual finding reviewed under the substantial evidence standard. <em>Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>298 F.3d 899, 903 (5th Cir.2002). \u201cWe will affirm the B[IA]\u2019s decision unless the evidence compels a contrary conclusion.\u201d <em>Carbajal-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>78 F.3d 194, 197 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">Pena contends that he is entitled to withholding of removal because he established past persecution and a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of his membership in a particular social group, to wit: El Salvadorans who refuse to join guerrilla-based gangs.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Contrary to his assertion, Pena has not demonstrated that he is a member of a particular social group. <em>See Mwembie v. Gonzales, </em>443 F.3d 405, 414-15 (5th Cir.2006). The suggested group upon which his claim is founded is too general to comprise a particular social group for immigration purposes. <em>See id.; see also Sanchez-Trujillo v. INS, </em>801 F.2d 1571, 1576-77 (9th Cir.1986). Accordingly, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Pena was not entitled to withholding of removal. <em>See Efe, </em>293 F.3d at 903.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b851-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.

To the extent that Pena renews his claim, raised for the first time in his administrative appeal to the BIA, that he fears future persecution on account of religion and political opinion, this court will not consider it. <em>See In re J-Y-C-, </em>24 I. &amp; N.
