Nezianya contends: he has met the criteria required for a motion to reopen; and the BIA erred by failing to consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-21\">The BIA has authority to reopen removal proceedings, subject to a 90-day filing period, upon a motion filed pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c). Failure to file within the 90-day filing period does not preclude reopening such proceedings, however, as long as one of four exceptions applies. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3). The BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen is reviewed for abuse of discretion; its factual findings, for substantial evidence. <em>See, e.g., Panjwani v. Gonzales, </em>401 F.3d 626, 632 (5th Cir.2005). Because Nezianya\u2019s motion to reopen was untimely and failed to meet any of the exceptions set forth in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3), the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying that motion as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-22\">Nezianya also maintains the BIA erred by failing to exercise its authority <em>sua sponte </em>to reopen his removal proceedings. Because 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) provides the BIA with complete discretion in determining whether to reopen, our court lacks jurisdiction to review a challenge to the BIA\u2019s refusal to exercise its authority under \u00a7 1003.2(a). <em>E.g., Lopez-Dubon v. Holder, </em>609 F.3d 642, 647 (5th Cir.2010), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(16 Nov. 2010) (No. 10-658); <em>Ramos-Bonilla v. Mukasey, </em>543 F.3d 216, 219-20 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>Nezianya claims this lack of jurisdiction constitutes a due-process violation. In his motion to reopen, Nezianya sought the opportunity to apply for adjustment of status. Contrary to Nezianya\u2019s assertion, \u201c[our] circuit has repeatedly held that discretionary relief from removal, including an application for an adjustment of status, is not a liberty or property right that requires due process protection\u201d. <em>Ahmed v. Gonzales, </em>447 F.3d 433, 440 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b874-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
