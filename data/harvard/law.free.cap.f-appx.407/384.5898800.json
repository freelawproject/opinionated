Zheng originally applied for asylum based on political opinion, but her application was denied, and the BIA dismissed her appeal. She then moved the BIA to reopen proceedings based on her adoption of Falun Gong. On October 14, 2009, the BIA denied this motion, concluding Zheng failed to establish changed country conditions and, thus, her filing was untimely. She did not petition this Court to review that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Zheng did, however, move the BIA to reconsider its decision and to reopen proceedings. She relied primarily on articles about China targeting Falun Gong practitioners abroad and a notice her parents received from Chinese authorities reporting Zheng\u2019s activities within the United States and demanding that Zheng stop practicing Falun Gong and return to China to accept punishment. The BIA denied the motions, and Zheng timely petitioned this Court for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">Zheng contends that the BIA erroneously denied her motion for reconsideration because she had shown an error of fact or law in its previous conclusion that she failed to establish changed country conditions to excuse the untimeliness of her first motion to reopen. With respect to her second motion to reopen, Zheng argues that she submitted evidence to the BIA that sufficiently established changed country conditions and that the motion was, therefore, exempt from the timely filing requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">\u201c We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reconsider for abuse of discretion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Calle v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>504 F.3d 1324, 1328 (11th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Assa\u2019ad v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>332 F.3d 1321, 1341 (11th Cir.2003)). We also review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>Jiang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>568 F.3d 1252, 1256 (11th Cir.2009). Thus, our review is limited to determining whether the BIA\u2019s exercise of discretion was arbitrary or capricious. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">\u201cA motion to reconsider shall state the reasons for the motion by specifying the errors of fact or law in the prior [BIA] decision and shall be supported by pertinent authority.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1); <em>see also </em>INA \u00a7 240(c)(6)(C), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(C). \u201c[M]erely reiterating arguments previously presented to the BIA does not constitute \u2018specifying ... errors of fact or law\u2019 as required for a successful motion to reconsider.\u201d <em>Calle, </em>504 F.3d at 1329 (quoting 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-10\">\u201cA motion to reopen proceedings shall state the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted and shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1); <em>see also </em>INA \u00a7 240(c)(7)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(B). A motion to reopen \u201cmust be filed no later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be reopened____\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2); <em>see also </em>INA \u00a7 240(c)(7)(C)(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i). However, the 90-day time limitation does not apply to a motion to reopen based upon \u201cchanged circumstances arising in the country of nationality or in the country to which deportation has been ordered, if such evidence is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the previous hearing.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3) (ii); <em>see also </em>INA \u00a7 240(c)(7)(C)(ii), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>As an initial matter, we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s October 14, 2009 decision denying Zheng\u2019s first motion to reopen because she did not petition for review within 30 days of the entry of that order. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 242(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1); <em>Dakane v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1272 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (explaining that the period for filing a petition for review is mandatory and jurisdictional). Accordingly, Zheng\u2019s petition is dismissed to the extent she challenges the BIA\u2019s October 14, 2009 decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">In support of her motion for reconsideration, Zheng relied on the same arguments that she presented in support of her first motion to reopen \u2014 the underlying motion to be reconsidered. Because merely reiterating the same arguments previously presented to the BIA does not specify an error of fact or law, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Zheng\u2019s motion for reconsideration. <em>See Calle, </em>504 F.3d at 1329.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">Likewise, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Zheng\u2019s second motion to reopen. The evidence she presented, though suggesting changes in Chinese policy <em>abroad, </em>did not represent a material change in conditions <em>within </em>China. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(h) (stating an exemption to the 90-day time limitation where the movant presents evidence of \u201cchanged circumstances <em>arising in </em>the country of nationality or in the country to which deportation has been ordered....\u201d) (emphasis added). Instead, this evidence merely illustrates a continuation of China\u2019s more than decade-long crackdown on Falun Gong. Consequently, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in finding Zheng failed to present material evidence of changed country conditions and in denying the motion as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">Accordingly, Zheng\u2019s petition is DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
