Zhao explains in his brief that he no longer seeks to proceed against the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, whom he named as a defendant in his first amended complaint. Accordingly, we need not address the district court\u2019s dismissal of the claims against her. <em>See Easton v. Sanders, </em>67 F.3d 97, 99 &amp; n. 2 (5th Cir.1995). Liberally construed, Zhao\u2019s argument is that the district court erred by failing to permit him to file his second amended complaint raising additional claims against two new defendants \u2014 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s Houston Field Office and one of its employees. <em>See </em>Fed.R.CivP. 15(a)(2). The district court did not explicitly decide whether Zhao should have been granted leave to amend. However, we construe the court\u2019s ruling granting the motion to dismiss as implicitly denying leave, <em>see Norman v. Apache Corp., </em>19 F.3d 1017, 1021-22 (5th Cir.1994), a decision we review for abuse of discretion, <em>Ashe v. Corley, </em>992 F.2d 540, 542-43 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-17\">The district court\u2019s reasons for declining to allow Zhao leave to amend are apparent from the record. <em>See id. </em>The court explained in its order dismissing the action that the statute of limitations bars Zhao\u2019s civil rights and common law tort claims and that he failed to state a claim under the new theories he purported to raise in the second amended complaint. On appeal, Zhao argues for the first time that the \u201ccontinuing violations doctrine\u201d renders his claims timely. Zhao fails to explain, however, why he could not have brought this issue to the attention of the district court or why refraining from addressing it now would result in a miscarriage of justice; accordingly, we decline to consider this argument. <em>See Matter of HECI Exploration Co., Inc., </em>862 F.2d 513, 521-22 (5th Cir.1988). Moreover, Zhao does not argue on appeal that his second amended complaint stated a claim under any of the new theories that he advanced in that pleading; thus, has abandoned those issues. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-18\">Zhao also seeks to add a claim that he is an \u201cinnocent owner\u201d under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 801, 881, but he may not raise a new claim on appeal that he did not raise in the district court unless failure to address the claim would result in a clear miscarriage of justice. <em>See Black v. North Panola School Dist., </em>461 F.3d 584, 587, 593 (5th Cir.2006). There is no showing of clear miscarriage of justice. By failing to move for recusal in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>the district court, Zhao has also abandoned any argument that the district judge should have recused himself. <em>See Andrade v. Chojnacki, </em>338 F.3d 448, 454 (5th Cir.2003). Finally, Zhao\u2019s challenge to the multidistrict litigation panel\u2019s decision refusing to transfer his case is not properly before this court. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1407(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b814-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
