J.</author>\n<p id=\"Asm\">Petitioner, Continental Casualty Company (Continental), seeks a writ of mandate compelling the trial court to vacate its order determining that Continental owed a duty to defend a particular lawsuit filed against its insureds, the real parties in interest, Paragon Homes, Inc., and related individuals and entities.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Continental also seeks an order requiring the trial court to grant Continental\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Paragon\u2019s complaint against Continental for declaratory relief, breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. These claims all arose out of Continental\u2019s refusal to provide a defense to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>Paragon in certain litigation filed in 1994 against Paragon by FN Development Company (Alpha) and related entities.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">As we review this record, it is clear that FN Development was a partner or joint venturer with Paragon in a number of development and construction projects and the FN Development action was brought against Paragon to resolve certain economic disputes then existing, to dissolve their several business relationships and to provide an accounting of their mutual affairs.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> One of the matters of financial dispute was the proper allocation of losses arising from construction defect claims asserted by purchasers of homes in several of the aforesaid development and construction projects. As we explain, the general liability policy issued by Continental did not cover any of the claims made by FN Development and thus Continental had no duty to provide a defense thereto. Therefore, the trial court should have denied Paragon\u2019s motion for a summary adjudication of Continental\u2019s defense duty and, instead, granted Continental\u2019s summary judgment motion. We will therefore issue a writ directing the trial court to take such action.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Factual and Procedural Background<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Beginning in 1979, FN Development and Paragon entered into a partnership to construct residential and commercial properties. In pursuit of such partnership goals, the parties entered into numerous development management agreements (DMA\u2019s) to define and govern their respective rights and liabilities as to particular development projects.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>Although the partnership was, for a time, extremely successful, the ultimately poor performance of some of the development projects caused FN Development to decide to terminate its relationship with Paragon. The performance problems which caused FN Development so much distress arose, at least in part, from a number of construction defect claims made by purchasers of homes in several of the development projects built by the Paragon-FN Development partnership. These claims, many of which were manifested in litigation filed by such purchasers, are hereafter referred to generally as the construction defect claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">In July 1994, FN Development sued Paragon seeking declaratory relief, dissolution of their joint ventures and an accounting.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The complaint explained that the parties had numerous disputes and disagreements over matters that have a material and significant affect on the development, construction, marketing and sale of the development projects.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">The fourth count in the FN Development action was labeled \u201cdeclaratory relief-liability for construction defects,\u201d and alleged that various homeowners that bought Paragon homes built under the DMA\u2019s had asserted claims for construction defects. FN Development sought a judicial declaration that Paragon was \u201cwholly liable for any and all construction defects arising from any of the projects subject to the Paragon DMAs.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It also alleged that Paragon was obligated to contribute $3,225 million to a reserve for <em>jfuture </em>construction defect liabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>Continental had previously issued a commercial general liability insurance policy to Paragon that also insured the Paragon/FN Development partnership<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> with an effective period of October 2, 1986, through October 2, 1988.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>The defense of the construction defect claims had been tendered to Continental and it had undertaken to defend and settle them. </em>Paragon, however, after being served with the FN Development action, also tendered the defense of that action to Continental on July 3, 1997. Paragon\u2019s tender of the defense of the FN Development action was just 27 days before it was scheduled to go to trial.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Continental ultimately denied coverage on December 17, 1997.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">Paragon responded by bringing this action against Continental (and a number of its other insurers) for defense and indemnity coverage on July 3, 1998. In its fourth amended complaint (filed in August 2000), Paragon alleged that it was insured under Continental\u2019s policy and that Continental had breached that policy by denying coverage for the FN Development action and refusing to provide a defense. Paragon further alleged that a jury trial had been held in the FN Development action in November 1997 and the construction defect claims were litigated in the sixth cause of action for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>dissolution and accounting, instead of under the fourth count for declaratory relief;<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Paragon had been held liable for 50 percent of the construction defect losses in the sum of $1,612,500.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">Continental moved for summary judgment, arguing that in its action FN Development was not seeking to recover for property damage, but rather was suing to dissolve its multiple business and partnership relationships with Paragon. Further, Continental argued that because the FN Development action sought to apportion profits and losses between business partners under the DMAs, there was no accidental conduct. In short, Continental argued that its policy simply did not provide any potential for coverage for the claims asserted in the FN Development action. Thus, it had no duty to provide Paragon with a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">At the same time, Paragon filed a motion for summary adjudication of Continental\u2019s duty to defend the FN Development action.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Paragon argued that Continental had a duty to provide a defense because (1) FN Development had alleged that Paragon was wholly liable for the construction defect claims; (2) Continental was aware of these claims as it had already accepted their defense on behalf of the Paragon-FN Development partnership; and (3) the FN Development action essentially sought indemnity or contribution for construction defect losses. Therefore, Continental had a duty to defend. Paragon claimed approximately $10 million in defense costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">The trial court agreed with Paragon, denied Continental\u2019s motion for summary judgment and granted Paragon\u2019s motion for summary adjudication. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>Citing <em>Vandenberg v. Superior Court </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 815 [88 Cal.Rptr.2d 366, 982 P.2d 229] (Vandenberg) and <em>AIU Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 807 [274 Cal.Rptr. 820, 799 P.2d 1253] <em>(AIU), </em>the trial court held that coverage obligations may arise from contractual obligations and that a legal obligation to pay may arise from a cause of action asserting equitable relief (e.g., an action for declaratory relief or for partnership dissolution and accounting). The court further found: \u201cIn this case there is no question that the construction defects for which FN sought a declaration placing liability on Paragon were property damage within the meaning of the policy. [Continental] in fact assumed the defense of the homeowners\u2019 direct action against Paragon. . . . HQ The lawsuit by FN against Paragon was a partnership action, but the fourth cause of action sought a declaration of liability for the costs of any construction defects for which FN would be held liable .... It does not matter that the word \u2018indemnity\u2019 was not used. The FN suit sought to make Paragon legally liable to pay the cost of the property damage to the homeowners. FO The fact that the specific relief sought was declaratory does not vitiate coverage. ft[] And the question is, \u2018good heavens, are the insurers now going to have to get involved in partnership dissolution actions?\u2019 I think the answer to that is, \u2018yes.\u2019 That\u2019s the way I read the cases. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">A notice of the December 11, 2000 ruling was mailed on December 22, 2000. Continental filed a timely petition for writ relief. On February 28, 2001, we issued an order to show cause, stayed all further proceedings in the trial court, and set the matter on calendar for argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">Continental argues that there is no coverage, under the policy it issued to the Paragon-FN Development partnership, for claims asserted by one partner against the other arising from a dispute as to the respective liability of the partners for actual or potential partnership debts or losses. The FN Development action, at least as is relevant to the coverage issue, seeks to impose the entire liability for all construction defect claims upon Paragon. To the extent that there is coverage for such claims under Continental\u2019s policy, Continental is already providing a defense. To the extent that such claims are not covered by liability insurance, then they become partnership obligations which must be shared or allocated between the partners as provided in their several partnership agreements or under relevant principles of law. That, however, is not a claim or dispute for which coverage is provided under the partnership\u2019s general liability policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">Paragon responds by arguing that the disputed liabilities all arise from the construction defect claims, the existence of which led FN Development to its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>decision to end the partnership relation with Paragon, and Continental has already conceded that such claims (or at least many of them) are covered under its policy. Since FN Development is doing nothing more than asserting a claim of liability for covered claims, Paragon is entitled to a defense. The fact that the assertion of FN Development\u2019s claim of liability is based on contract (the partnership agreements) cannot preclude Paragon\u2019s entitlement to coverage, given the principles recently articulated by the Supreme Court in <em>Vandenberg, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th 815. As already noted, the trial court agreed with this position.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">We, however, come down on the side of Continental. As we explain, Paragon\u2019s argument would turn basic insurance principles on their head and is based on a misapplication of <em>AIU </em>and a misunderstanding of <em>Vandenberg. </em>We therefore will grant the requested writ relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">1. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">This writ comes to us after the trial court denied Continental\u2019s motion for summary judgment.  The purpose of such a motion is to expedite litigation and eliminate needless trials. <em>(Hood v. Superior Court </em>(1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 319, 323 [39 Cal.Rptr.2d 296].) It must be granted \u201cif all the papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (c); <em>Villa v. McFerren </em>(1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 733, 741 [41 Cal.Rptr.2d 719].) After examining documents supporting a summary judgment motion in the trial court, this court independently determines their effect as a matter of law. <em>(Villa v. McFerren, supra, </em>35 Cal.App.4th at p. 741.)</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">Where the facts are undisputed, the court can resolve the question of law in accordance with general summary judgment principles. <em>(Adams </em>v. <em>Paul </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 583, 592 [46 Cal.Rptr.2d 594, 904 P.2d 1205].) \u201cAbsent a <em>factual </em>dispute as to the meaning of policy language, which we do not have here, the interpretation, construction and application of an insurance contract is strictly an issue of law.\u201d <em>(Century Transit Systems, Inc. v. American Empire Surplus Lines Ins. Co. </em>(1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 121,125 [49 Cal.Rptr.2d 567].)</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">A liability insurer\u2019s duty to defend will arise when a suit against an insured <em>potentially </em>seeks damages within the coverage of the policy. <em>(LaJolla Beach &amp; Tennis Club Inc. </em>v. <em>Industrial Indemnity Co. </em>(1994) 9 Cal.4th 27, 43 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 100, 884 P.2d 1048].) An insurer, however, need not defend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>if the third party complaint cannot by any conceivable theory raise a single issue which would bring it within policy coverage. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 43.) Thus, the settled rule is that where a pleading against the insured raises the <em>potential </em>for coverage, the insurer must provide a defense. <em>(Montrose Chemical Corp. v. Superior Court </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 287, 295 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 467, 861 P.2d 1153].) In order to prevail on a motion for the summary adjudication of the duty to defend, \u201cthe insured need only show that the underlying claim <em>may </em>fall within policy coverage.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 300, italics added.) The critical test, however, is \u201cwhether the underlying action for which defense and indemnity is sought potentially seeks relief <em>within the coverage of the policy. </em>[Citation.]\u201d <em>(La Jolla Beach &amp; Tennis Club, Inc. v. Industrial Indemnity Co., supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th at p. 44, original italics omitted, italics added.) However, \u201c[t]he duty to defend depends on whether there is potential liability based on the <em>facts </em>pled in the complaint or [otherwise] known to the insurer. There is no duty \u2018where the only potential for liability turns on a resolution of a legal question . . . .\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(McLaughlin </em>v. <em>National Union Fire Ins. Co. </em>(1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1132, 1151 [29 Cal.Rptr.2d 559].)</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">As we now discuss, the facts pled in Paragon\u2019s complaint, as well as the undisputed facts reflected in the record before us, provide no legal basis for a viable claim of coverage under Continental\u2019s policy. Continental, having already provided a defense for the construction defect claims as to which a potential for coverage did exist, had no legal obligation to defend Paragon in FN Development\u2019s action seeking to allocate the burden of what are necessarily (vis-a-vis Continental) <em>uninsured </em>claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">2. <em>The FN Development Action Seeks to Enforce a Claim for Intangible Economic Interests, Not \u201cProperty Damage </em>\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">In the present case, FN Development sued Paragon to recover economic losses resulting from the operation of their partnership business, not for property damage. It is settled that property damage coverage under a liability policy, such as the one issued here by Continental, extends only to physical injury to, or destruction or loss of use of, tangible property. \u201cDamage for lost profits, loss of investment or other harm to one\u2019s economic interest constitute injuries to <em>intangible </em>property which by definition fall outside the scope of the policy. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(McLaughlin </em>v. <em>National Union Fire Ins. Co., supra, </em>23 Cal.App.4th at p. 1150, italics in original.) The FN Development action essentially sought to end the business relationship with Paragon and apportion profits and losses in accordance with their existing agreements. Nowhere in its complaint did FN Development allege that <em>it </em>had sustained property damage. Rather, it sought a declaration that Paragon was \u201cwholly\u201d liable for certain obligations incurred by the partnership, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>is, the construction defect claims. This is essentially a claim relating to the proper <em>apportionment of a partnership loss </em>between partners.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">To put it more specifically, FN Development was seeking to hold Paragon responsible for Paragon\u2019s alleged share of partnership losses arising from the construction defect claims. For at least two reasons there was no <em>potential </em>for coverage. First, there was never a possibility that Paragon would be held liable to FN Development for causing <em>property damage </em>since no claim was made for physical injury to tangible property.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Second, and most significantly, the only asserted construction defect claims that would necessarily be involved in the FN Development action were those claims that were <em>not </em>covered under Continental\u2019s policy. As the trial court acknowledged (and Paragon does not dispute), all of the asserted construction defect claims that were potentially covered under Continental\u2019s policy were in fact already being defended by Continental. Thus, the real undisclosed rationale for Paragon\u2019s argument is that Continental had an indirect obligation to defend Paragon from claims that Continental had no obligation to defend when those same claims had been asserted directly by the injured third party homeowner claimants. To sanction Paragon\u2019s claim of coverage would be to impose on Continental a liability that it never agreed to assume.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">In support of its argument that Continental did have a duty to defend claims asserted in the FN Development action, Paragon cites <em>Val\u2019s Painting &amp; Drywall, Inc. v. Allstate Ins. Co. </em>(1975) 53 Cal.App.3d 576 [126 Cal.Rptr. 267] <em>(Val\u2019s Painting). </em>In <em>Val\u2019s Painting, </em>one of Val\u2019s employee\u2019s was injured when he fell from scaffolding rented by a third party vendor, Ray-Cron. Ray-Cron, which had required Val\u2019s to sign an indemnity agreement as a condition of the scaffolding rental, filed a cross-complaint against Val\u2019s alleging Val\u2019s was liable for any injury because (1) it was Val\u2019s negligence that resulted in the injuries, and (2) Val\u2019s indemnity agreement required it to indemnify Ray-Cron for any injury resulting from the use of the scaffolding.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">Val\u2019s tendered the defense of the cross-complaint to its insurer under its comprehensive general liability insurance policy. The tender was denied. The appellate court concluded that two possible theories could be detected from the cross-complaint\u2014implied and contractual indemnity. The court held that because the cross-complaint arose out of a suit for damages for bodily injury, <em>a risk which was of the nature and kind covered by the policy, </em>the insurer had a duty to defend even though ultimately it might not be liable to indemnify the insured. <em>(Val\u2019s Painting, supra, </em>53 Cal.App.3d at 584.)</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\"><em>Val\u2019s Painting </em>is instructive in teaching that a claim for indemnity may create the potential for coverage if the claim arose out of a suit for damages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>for a risk of the nature and kind covered by the policy. Here, however, FN Development was not really seeking to enforce a claim of indemnity. It was attempting to allocate a partnership loss arising from the existence of construction defect claims which necessarily were <em>not </em>covered by any liability policy issued by Continental. The covered claims would not contribute to partnership losses; to the extent of Continental\u2019s policy limits, such claims were (or would be) necessarily settled or otherwise satisfied by Continental.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">FN Development sought to impose this burden on Paragon through an action for a dissolution, an accounting and declaratory relief. Thus, in the present case, Paragon is essentially asking Continental to defend a dissolution action between partners simply because (at least some of) the partnership losses can be <em>traced back </em>to construction defect claims that homeowners were litigating against the partnership in other lawsuits. Continental, however, had already provided a defense to these suits, at least to the extent that they asserted construction defect claims that were actually or potentially covered under Continental\u2019s policy.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> That, of course, was <em>not </em>the case in <em>Val\u2019s Painting. </em>The cross-complaint for indemnity in that case was simply the vehicle by which the injured third party\u2019s claim was asserted against the insured. The insured was thereby effectively brought into the injury action as another defendant and its insurer had a clear obligation to provide a defense. Obviously, these are not the circumstances before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Nonetheless, Paragon asserts FN Development\u2019s partnership claims created a <em>potential </em>for coverage because FN Development sought to hold Paragon liable for the economic consequences of property damage. For example, Paragon argues that FN Development settled some homeowner claims prior to the filing of the FN Development action, and then sought reimbursement for those payments.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We do not believe, however, that such allegations provide a legal basis for establishing coverage under Continental\u2019s policy. If Continental\u2019s policy actually covered such claims, then FN <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>Development\u2019s claim for reimbursement should have been made directly to Continental. If Continental had <em>no </em>coverage exposure for such a direct claim, it must follow that a potential for coverage could not be created by the indirect assertion of that claim in a partnership lawsuit against Paragon. This conclusion is fully supported by case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">In <em>Giddings v. Industrial Indemnity Co. </em>(1980) 112 Cal.App.3d 213 [169 Cal.Rptr. 278], the insureds became embroiled in a series of lawsuits that arose out of their business relationships. The various litigants sought to recover for the reduced value of corporate holdings, misappropriation of corporate property, waste of corporate assets, and other related conduct. The policies at issue covered property damage. The court held that the policies did not afford coverage for intangible economic interests and thus there was no duty to defend or indemnify in connection with the various lawsuits because there was no property damage. The court further held that economic losses do not constitute damage or injury to tangible property covered by a comprehensive general liability policy. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 219.)</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\"><em>Ticor Title Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Employers Ins. of Wausau </em>(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 1699 [48 Cal.Rptr.2d 368] reached a similar conclusion. <em>Ticor </em>involved underlying litigation between Technical Equities Corporation (TEC) and Ticor Title (Ticor). TEC alleged that Ticor had acted negligently in the preparation and recording of certain documents and thereby facilitated the scheme of certain TEC\u2019s directors and officers in a scheme to loot and defraud the company. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1702-1703.) Ticor sought coverage from its liability insurer by arguing that the allegations against Ticor included allegations that it had facilitated the looting, converting, and misappropriation of corporate assets including \u201creal property and subsidiary manufacturing companies that produced rubber and metal products.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p 1710.) In rejecting Ticor\u2019s argument that the litigation should be viewed as a claim of property damage, the court emphasized that the underlying complaint did not suggest that TEC was seeking recovery for \u201closs of use of tangible corporate property.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1712.) Instead, \u201cthe loss which the estate suffered at Ticor\u2019s hands was an <em>economic </em>loss\u2014the plummet in TEC\u2019s value in the pernicious hands of Stem &amp; Company.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>italics added.)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">The Supreme Court has also recently endorsed this same proposition. <em>Waller v. Truck Ins. Exchange, Inc. </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 1 [44 Cal.Rptr.2d 370, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>900 P.2d 619], involved underlying litigation between business associates that decided to go their separate ways. The court determined that allegations based on various business and contract transgressions did not create any potential for coverage under the standard general liability policy. The court further held \u201cthe focus of coverage for property damage is therefore the property itself, and does not include intangible economic losses, violation of antitrust laws or performance of contractual obligations.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 17.)</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">As the foregoing authorities demonstrate, in evaluating whether or not an insurance company has a duty to defend a particular lawsuit, California courts have consistently analyzed the nature of the transactions between the parties to the lawsuit. In this regard, when the fundamental nature of those transactions is economic, California courts have refused to find a duty to defend the lawsuit even though the litigation will encompass issues relating to property damage. For example, in <em>Miller v. Western General Agency, Inc. </em>(1996) 41 Cal.App.4th 1144 [49 Cal.Rptr.2d 55], the claimant sued the insured Millers in connection with the sale of their home. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1147.) The claimant alleged that the Millers had failed to disclose the existence of defective plumbing that had subsequently failed and caused \u201cdamage to real and personal property.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1148.)</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">The Millers asked their liability insurer to defend the claimant\u2019s lawsuit but the insurer refused. Ruling that there was no duty to defend, we held in <em>Miller </em>that \u201c[t]he basis for . . . complaint is not the alleged defective plumbing, although it might otherwise have been a part of [the claimant\u2019s] damages. What they are suing for is the tortious fraudulent conduct of the Millers which simply does not fall within the coverage of Central-National\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>policy.\u201d <em>(Miller </em>v. <em>Western General Agency; Inc., supra, </em>41 Cal.App.4th at p. 1151.)</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">Just as in <em>Miller, </em>the basis of the FN Development action was not construction defect based liability. It was not asking the court to find that Paragon or anyone else had negligently damaged anyone\u2019s home.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Instead, FN Development and Paragon (through their several insurers, including Continental) were defending homeowners\u2019 construction defect lawsuits in other cases. In the FN Development action, FN Development asked the court to interpret the various agreements it and Paragon had executed over the years, and then render an appropriate accounting between them which allocated sole liability to Paragon for what necessarily had to be <em>uninsured </em>construction defect claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">In addition, it is also clear that the FN Development action arose from the several financial and partnership transactions between FN Development and Paragon, not from an accident causing damage to FN Development property. (See <em>Safeco Ins. Co. of America </em>v. <em>Andrews </em>(9th Cir. 1990) 915 F.2d 500, 502 [\u201cAlthough the defective condition of the property is an element of [the asserted] claims, the defects cannot, even when interpreting the policy broadly, be considered the <em>cause </em>of [the claimant\u2019s] damages. The cause of the damage was [the insured\u2019s] alleged misrepresentations, which are not an \u2018occurrence\u2019 or a \u2018peril insured against\u2019 under the terms of the policy\u201d].) FN Development\u2019s action did not involve any occurrence or accident. To the contrary, it sought to dissolve the partnership in the face of irreconcilable economic differences with Paragon. Thus, by asking the court to interpret the various partnership documents, and then render an accounting, FN Development was seeking economic relief, not claiming property damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">3. <em>Neither AIU Nor Vandenberg Supports Paragon\u2019s Position</em></p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">The trial court appears to have relied heavily on the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>AIU </em>and <em>Vandenberg </em>in arriving at its conclusion that a basis for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>coverage existed under Continental\u2019s policy. We do not believe either of these cases supports the trial court\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">While it is true that the <em>AIU </em>court sanctioned a coverage claim for a suit <em>in equity </em>prosecuted against an insured, it does not follow that <em>AIU </em>would impose coverage in <em>every </em>equitable case. As already noted, Continental\u2019s policy promised coverage of a suit seeking sums \u201cthat the insured becomes <em>legally obligated </em>to pay <em>as damages </em>because of . . . <em>property </em>damage\u201d (italics added) which occurs during the policy period and is <em>caused </em>by an <em>occurrence. AIU </em>held that equitable orders (e.g., mandatory injunctions and orders compelling reimbursement of cleanup costs to the government) requiring the cleanup and remediation of toxic pollution caused by an insured\u2019s business activities would constitute damages that an insured was legally obligated to pay. <em>(AIU, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d at pp. 824-828, 833, 836-837, 840-841.) \u201cBecause California has generally abandoned the traditional distinction between courts of equity and courts of law [citations], even a legally sophisticated policyholder might not anticipate that the term \u2018legally obligated\u2019 precludes coverage of equitably compelled expenses.\u201d <em>(AIU, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d at p. 825.) In short, the <em>AIU </em>court concluded that the phrase \u201clegally obligated\u201d meant \u201crequired of the insured,\u201d <em>whether at law or in equity. (Id. </em>at pp. 824-825; see also <em>Aerojet-General Corp. </em>v. <em>Transport Indemnity Co. </em>(1997) 17 Cal.4th 38, 62 [70 Cal.Rptr.2d 118, 948 P.2d 909].)</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Thus, the cost of compliance with such court orders was insurable and was covered under the provisions of a general liability policy. Nothing in <em>AIU, </em>however, suggests that the claim asserted against an insured still did not have to arise from <em>property damage </em>sustained by the claimant during the policy period which was caused by an occurrence (i.e., an <em>accident </em>or continued or repeated exposure to harmful conditions). In other words, reliance on the principles articulated in <em>AIU </em>does nothing more than beg the question of whether <em>a covered claim for property damage </em>has been asserted. It certainly does not answer it. Given general coverage principles, <em>AIU </em>provides no assistance to Paragon.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">The same conclusion applies to the <em>Vandenberg </em>decision. In that case, the Supreme Court specifically discussed the term \u201clegally obligated to pay as damages\u201d as that phrase is used in a general liability policy. It did so in the context of a liability insurer\u2019s denial of coverage for damages awarded against an insured on the ground that the damages were assessed on a <em>contractual </em>theory. The insurer, citing a number of Court of Appeal decisions, had argued that the phrase \u201clegally obligated to pay as damages\u201d referred only to a liability based upon a breach of duty imposed by law, that is, based on <em>tort </em>not on contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>The insured in <em>Vandenberg </em>was held liable for the breach of a long-term real property lease based on the contamination of soils located on the leased property and the underlying groundwater.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The court held, however, that whether the third party\u2019s claim was based on tort or contract was not the proper question. Rather, it was the <em>\u201cnature of the damage and the risk involved, </em>in light of particular policy provisions, [which would] control coverage.\u201d <em>(Vandenberg, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 839, italics added.) The court specifically rejected the proposition that the phrase \u201c \u2018legally obligated to pay\u2019 \u201d necessarily excluded coverage for liability arising from a breach of contract. <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201cThis phrase had usually been construed to mean <em>liability imposed in a definite sum by a final judgment </em>against the assured. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>italics added.) To conclude, however, that such phrase could only refer to a tort claim asserted against the insured would ignore settled principles of insurance contract interpretation. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\"><em>Vandenberg </em>applied that principle: \u201cA reasonable layperson would certainly understand \u2018legally obligated to pay\u2019 to refer to any obligation which is binding and enforceable under the law, whether pursuant to contract or tort liability. Further, a reasonable layperson, cognizant that he or she is purchasing a \u2018general liability\u2019 insurance policy, would not conclude such coverage term only refers to liability pled in tort, and thus entirely excludes liability pled on a theory of breach of contract. Under general insurance principles, we must interpret the phrase \u2018legally obligated to pay as damages\u2019 in accordance with the ordinary and popular sense, not the legalistic, and erroneously premised, interpretation of the language urged by insurers.\u201d <em>(Vandenberg, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 840.)</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Quoting several commentators with approval, the <em>Vandenberg </em>court concluded, \u201c \u2018[Wjhether a particular claim falls within the coverage afforded by a liability policy is not affected by the form of the legal proceeding. Accordingly, the legal theory asserted by the claimant is immaterial to the determination of whether the risk is covered.\u2019 [Citation.] . . . \u2018The expression \u201clegally obligated\u201d connotes legal responsibility that is <em>broad </em>in scope. It is directed at civil liability . . . [which] can arise from either unintentional (negligent) or intentional tort, under common law, statute, or contract.\u2019 [Citation.] . . . \u2018The coverage agreement [which] embraces \u201call sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages is intentionally broad enough to include the insured\u2019s obligation to pay damages for breach of contract as well as for tort, within limitations imposed by</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>other terms of the coverage agreement (e.g. bodily injury and property damage as defined, caused by an occurrence) and by the exclusions . . . .\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Vandenberg, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 841, italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\"><em>Vandenberg </em>said no more than whatever the interpretation to be given to the term \u201clegally obligated,\u201d it must be broad enough to include \u201cdamages for breach of contract as well as for tort.\u201d <em>(Vandenberg, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 841.) The court was only making the simple point that it was not the \u201cform of the proceeding\u201d <em>(ibid.) </em>that would control coverage, but rather that the issue would be resolved by a determination as to whether the acts of the insured had created a <em>risk covered under the policy </em>which resulted in either bodily injury or <em>property damage to another. </em>If those requirements were satisfied, it would not matter that the third party claimant\u2019s theory of recovery was based on contract rather than on tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Given this understanding of <em>Vandenberg, </em>we can only conclude that it likewise provides no support for Paragon\u2019s argument for coverage. It is not that FN Development\u2019s claim was based on contract (i.e., the several partnership agreements) which precludes coverage, but rather the failure of the complaint in the FN Development action to seek <em>damages </em>for <em>property damage </em>caused by an <em>occurrence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">The order to show cause is discharged.

[ID In consideration of the above, we must respectfully decline to participate in the defense and/or indemnity of Paragon Homes, Inc. in the above-captioned litigation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b398-7\">FN Development\u2019s Fourth Cause of Action for declaratory relief had previously been dismissed pursuant to a stipulation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b398-8\">In its pleading, Paragon alleged that \u201c[w]ith respect to the construction defect claims, a stipulation was entered into after trial dismissing those claims asserted in the Fourth Cause of Action. However, with respect to the Sixth Cause of Action, it was determined that the Paragon entities owed to the FN entities $1,612,500.00 for liability for damage resulting from construction defects. The FN entities were permitted to introduce at trial the fact of pending construction defect litigation against plaintiffs and the FN entities, and evidence of proof of actual construction defects. As a result, an element of damages for such construction defects was included in the judgment against MVE/SECO 3 &amp; 4 Associates and plaintiffs were found to be obligated for 50% of a $3,225,000.00 <em>loss attributable </em>to construction defects, or $1,612,500.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">It thus appears, from Paragon\u2019s own allegations, that FN Development\u2019s efforts to hold Paragon <em>solely </em>liable for the construction defect claims failed. We assume that the apparent equal division of the burden (after the cognizable amount was first determined as a part of the accounting process) resulted from either the provisions of the parties\u2019 several agreements or the application of general partnership law principles.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b398-10\">We note that, according to the declaration of Paragon\u2019s counsel filed in support of its motion for summary adjudication, all but one of Paragon\u2019s other primary insurers had agreed to defend the FN Development action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b403-6\">The record does not disclose any argument or contention by Paragon that Continental has failed or refused to provide a defense to any of the underlying construction defect claims asserted against the Paragon-FN Development partnership where a potential for coverage existed under the Continental policy.

What Paragon does not say, however, is that construction on this project started in <em>1990\u2014two years after Continental\u2019s policy expired. </em>Indeed, there is some suggestion in the record that the entire amount attributable to construction defect claims that was included in the judgment against Paragon (see fn. 12, <em>ante) </em>arose from the Mountain View East project.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b404-7\">There are several other cases employing similar reasoning. In <em>Devin v. United Services Auto. Assn. </em>(1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1149 [8 Cal.Rptr.2d 263], the Devins were sued for failing to disclose that a house was \u201csliding, slipping, settling, sinking, fracturing and buckling.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1153.) The court refused to find that the lawsuit involved claims of damage to property. Instead, the court reasoned that the buyers of the home were alleging that the Devins had caused \u201ca pecuniary loss\u2014the lost fair market value of the house.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1158.)</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\"><em>American Internat. Bank v. Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co. </em>(1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 1558 [57 Cal.Rptr.2d 567] provides another example. In that case, the court held that a general liability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>insurer had no duty to defend a bank that was sued for allegedly mishandling a loan which caused the claimants to lose the use of property they had purchased at considerable expense. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1562.) The court rejected the insured bank\u2019s effort to characterize the claims as property damage. Instead, the court found that there was no duty to defend because the bank had allegedly caused the claimants to suffer economic loss, not actual property damage. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1572.)</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">Finally, in <em>Allstate Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Interbank Financial Services </em>(1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 825 [264 Cal.Rptr. 25], the defendant <em>Interbank </em>allegedly gave bad advice with respect to certain tax shelter investments regarding thoroughbred racehorses. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 827.) It was sued by the investors, who alleged that they had been given improper advice and that Interbank had \u201c \u2018failed to properly manage and care for the plaintiff\u2019s personal property,\u2019 \u201d which had allegedly \u201c \u2018been negligently and carelessly damaged.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 830.) The court refused to find that Interbank\u2019s liability insurer had a duty to defend the lawsuit. Instead of focusing on potential derivative harm to the racehorses, the court focused on the specific allegations of the lawsuit pertaining to bad investment advice. After identifying the fundamentally economic nature of the transaction, the court held that \u201calthough the insureds attempt to characterize the claims differently, the clear bases of the complaints are that the insureds gave poor professional advice and that the plaintiffs lost money in a tax shelter investment.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 830-831.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b406-8\">Paragon makes much of the fact that FN Development was allowed to put on evidence concerning the construction defect claims during the trial of the accounting and dissolution cause of action. However, the record makes clear FN Development\u2019s purpose in tendering such evidence. It was because the <em>existence, </em>rather than the specific merits, of such litigation had an impact on the financial issues that the court was asked to address by FN Development\u2019s complaint. Such evidence provided a basis for FN Development\u2019s claimed right to terminate its agreements with Paragon and was relevant to the question of the market value of the various projects as well as the financial performance of, and the risks inherently involved in, those projects. As Paragon itself argued (in support of its motion in the trial court to dismiss FN Development\u2019s Fourth Cause of Action for declaratory relief), \u201cThis is a partnership fiduciary duty and accounting case, not a construction defect case.\u201d FN Development also emphasized that it \u201cdid <em>not </em>seek <em>damages </em>for claims of construction defects.\u201d Thus, we find the receipt of evidence concerning the existence and status of the construction defect claims in the FN Development action provides no support for Paragon\u2019s arguments here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b408-7\"> In <em>Vandenberg, </em>the lessor had alleged, and an arbitrator had subsequently held, that the lessee\u2019s improper installation, maintenance and use of waste oil storage tanks on the leased property had caused the contamination of soils and groundwater and the lessee\u2019s acts constituted a breach of the lease agreements.
