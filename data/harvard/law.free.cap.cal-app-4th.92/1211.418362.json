We hold the declarations were properly received, so the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-8\">The Katelarises own land along Santiago Canyon Road in an unincorporated area of Orange County.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> They believe improvements to the county\u2019s roadside drainage system spewed water onto their property, causing damage. In July 1997, their attorney submitted a claim to the county, a statutory prerequisite to filing suit. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 945.4.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> By letter dated July 16, 1997, the county acknowledged receipt of the claim, and stated it would send notice of its response within 45 days. On September 11, 1997, somewhat past the 45-day mark, the county mailed a letter to counsel denying the claim. The letter also stated that any action on the claim had to be filed within six months of the date the letter was mailed, pursuant to section 945.6, subdivision (a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-9\">Suit was filed on April 3, 1998, beyond the six-month period, and the county moved for summary judgment on the ground the action was barred by the statute of limitations. To establish mailing of the notice of rejection, the county offered the declaration of Sunny Bittle, assistant claims manager in its risk management department. Bittle declared, \u201cI caused to be prepared and mailed to plaintiffs\u2019 counsel a Notice of Rejection of plaintiffs\u2019 claim.\u201d Bittle added that she was familiar with the mailing policies and procedures of the department and knew that correspondence was deposited in the mail on the day it was dated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-10\">The Katelarises objected to Bittle\u2019s declaration as lacking personal knowledge, since she did not say she prepared the notice or mailed it. Counsel also denied receiving the notice, arguing the case was subject to the longer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1214\">*1214</page-number>two-year statute of limitations applicable when written notice of rejection is not given. (\u00a7 945.6, subd. (a)(2).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-4\">In response, the county offered a second declaration from Bittle, along with one from Matthew Winkler. Bittle addressed preparation of the notice, and Winkler the mailing of it. Bittle\u2019s second declaration stated: \u201cI typed the letter into my computer\u201d and printed out two copies, one on letterhead \u201cwhich I mailed\u201d to counsel at his office address.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-5\">Winkler is an office technician in the county\u2019s risk management department, responsible for processing outgoing mail. Winkler described his regular routine for mailing correspondence. Several times a day, he would make the rounds and pick up outgoing mail from employees\u2019 desks. Winkler would then type envelopes, enclose the letters, seal the envelopes, affix the required postage, and place the letters in a box provided by the United States Post Office in the lobby of his building. Winkler concluded his declaration by saying that \u201c[t]o the best of my knowledge, on September 11, 1997, I followed the above described procedure .... The letter to [counsel] dated September 11,1997 would have been mailed as described in this procedure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-6\">The Katelarises filed no evidentiary objection to these supplemental declarations, but at argument on the motion contended the declarations failed to present admissible evidence that the notice was mailed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The trial judge disagreed, granted the motion, and entered judgment dismissing the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-7\">The Katelarises argue there was no admissible evidence the notice of rejection was ever mailed. They assert Bittle\u2019s first declaration lacks personal knowledge, and her second declaration should be disregarded because it contradicts both her earlier declaration and Winkler\u2019s declaration. They assert Winkler\u2019s evidence was inadmissible for failure to demonstrate personal knowledge that the notice was mailed. They are mistaken. Bittle\u2019s second declaration, and Winkler\u2019s, were admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-8\">Written notice of rejection of a claim may be either by personal delivery or mailing to the address of the claimant, or to an address designated in the claim. (Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 913, 915.4.) If by mail, the document is to be deposited in a United States Post Office or other enumerated mail-receiving facility, in a sealed envelope, properly addressed, with postage paid. \u201cThe . . . notice shall be deemed to have been presented and received at the time of the deposit.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 915.2.) Proof of mailing may be in the manner prescribed in Code of Civil Procedure, section 1013a (the statute that specifies the methods for proof of service by mail). (Gov. Code, \u00a7 919.2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1215\">*1215</page-number>Bittle\u2019s first declaration is undeniably insufficient, since it states she \u201ccaused\u201d the notice to be prepared and mailed. That conclusion does not establish personal knowledge, and the declaration was not admissible. But the remaining declarations were.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-4\">The second Bittle declaration reveals Bittle was indeed the individual who prepared the notice. The Katelarises claim Bittle changed her story\u2014first claiming she caused the notice to be mailed and later that she mailed it\u2014so a trial is required. We do not see it that way. Bittle\u2019s second declaration clarified the earlier one, supplying the personal knowledge previously lacking. There is nothing contradictory in changing \u201cI caused to be mailed\u201d to \u201cI mailed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-5\">The Katelarises next argue Bittle\u2019s second declaration contradicts Winkler\u2019s because each claims to have mailed the letter, but that conjures up a controversy where none exists. In fact, Bittle\u2019s second declaration changes her statement that she \u201ccaused\u201d the letter to be mailed to a statement that she mailed it. Winkler\u2019s explains how letters are mailed in that office\u2014which gives definition to Bittle\u2019s use of the term\u2014and, in so doing, provides the evidence that amounts to legal proof of mailing\u2014the details of how correspondence was picked up, processed, and deposited in the mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-6\">As to Winkler, the Katelarises argue he was not competent to testify about mailing because of his statement that to the best of his knowledge, he followed his regular procedure for collecting, processing, and depositing mail on September 11, 1997. They rely on <em>Bowden </em>v. <em>Robinson </em>(1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 705, 719-720 [136 Cal.Rptr. 871], but that case is distinguishable. There, the court rejected a declaration of a corporate officer that asserted \u201c[t]o the best of my knowledge,\u201d certain individuals were never elected as corporate officers, and \u201c[t]o the best of my knowledge\u201d he never said shares could legally be issued in California. The <em>Bowden </em>declaration is obviously suspect, since the question of what corporate officers were elected would be easily verifiable from corporate records. And, as the court observed, it was unclear with regard to the statement about the issuance of shares whether the declarant meant that he did not recall making the representation, or was affirmatively saying he never uttered it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-7\">So the court held the declaration in question was inadequate to show who the company\u2019s corporate officers were. It did <em>not, </em>however, hold that the phrase somehow magically nullifies whatever statement follows it. It merely held, correctly, that the phrase \u201cto the best of my knowledge\u201d introduces an element of uncertainty which, under certain circumstances, can be lethal. Indeed, the <em>Bowden </em>court invalidated another statement in the declaration\u2014 which also used the phrase \u201cto the best of my <em>knowledge\u201d\u2014not </em>on the basis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1216\">*1216</page-number>that it was not based on personal knowledge, but on the basis it was a lay opinion on a matter of law. Obviously, if appellant\u2019s reading of the first part of <em>Bowden </em>were correct, the lay opinion analysis would not have been necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-4\">The trial court was able to evaluate the phrase \u201cto the best of my knowledge\u201d as used in this context and decide whether it injected uncertainty into the declaration. It found no such uncertainty, and we find no reason to quarrel with its judgment. Winkler\u2019s statement seems clearly to state he followed the normal business practice for collecting and processing mail on the date of the notice. That was sufficient. Proof of service by mail does not require personal knowledge. Rather, it is enough for an individual to testify to the business practice for collecting and processing outgoing mail. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1013a.) That is what was done here. Winkler\u2019s declaration was properly admitted and considered by the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-5\">The declarations offered in support of the motion for summary judgment were properly admitted, and they support the finding that notice of rejection was mailed on September 11,1997.  The Katelarises\u2019 action is barred by the statute of limitations.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1010-7\">The decision appealed from is affirmed. Respondent is entitled to costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-8\">Sills, P. J., and Rylaarsdam, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-9\">A petition for a rehearing was denied November 15, 2001, and the opinion was modified to read as printed above.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1007-11\">The facts are drawn from the parties\u2019 respective statements of undisputed facts and the papers submitted on the motion for summary judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1007-12\">A11 further statutory references are to the Government Code, unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1008-9\">The Katelarises\u2019 brief states they objected to Bittle\u2019s second declaration, and Winkler\u2019s, on the ground of competency, but the transcript of the hearing reveals no such objection was ever made.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1010-10\">In their reply brief, the Katelarises raise two new arguments not set out in their opening brief. First, they contend that the county\u2019s failure to send notice of rejection within 45 days after the claim was received, as required by section 912.4, means the statute of limitations is the two-year period applicable when no written notice of rejection is given. (\u00a7 945.6, subd. (b).) This is plainly wrong. The two-year statute only applies when <em>no written notice is sent. </em>Written notice given at any time triggers the six-month limitations period, even if it is beyond the 45-day period in which a public entity is supposed to act upon claims. <em>(Glorietta Foods, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of San Jose </em>(1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 835 [195 Cal.Rptr. 355].) Second, the Katelarises argue that apart from lacking personal knowledge, Winkler\u2019s declaration fails to satisfy Code of Civil Procedure section 1013a.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-11\">We decline to consider either argument under the rule that an issue is waived when not raised in appellant\u2019s opening brief. <em>(Tisher v. California Horse Racing Bd. </em>(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 349, 361 [282 Cal.Rptr. 330].)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
