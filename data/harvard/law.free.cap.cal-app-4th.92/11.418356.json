Code, \u00a7 2800.2) and one count of driving with more than 0.08 percent alcohol in his blood (Veh. Code, \u00a7 23152, subd. (b)), admitted a prior prison term enhancement (Pen. Code, \u00a7 667.5, subd. (b)) and two prior convictions for driving under the influence (DUI), and was sentenced to an aggregate term of four years in prison. On appeal, defendant challenges orders requiring him to pay $400 for the costs of court-appointed counsel and to report to the parole office in Kern County upon his release from prison. For the reasons stated below, we shall modify the judgment and affirm the judgment as modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">The facts of the underlying offenses are irrelevant to the issues raised on appeal. In March 2000, while on parole from Kern County, defendant was charged with evading a police officer, driving under the influence of alcohol, and driving with more than 0.08 percent alcohol in his blood. The complaint also alleged defendant had served three prior prison terms and suffered two prior DUI convictions. At his initial arraignment, the court appointed a contract public defender to represent defendant. At that time, defendant signed a form indicating that when his case was concluded the court would hold a hearing to determine whether he had the ability to repay the county for all or a part of his attorney\u2019s services.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">In May 2000, at the time set for the preliminary hearing, defendant agreed to plead no contest to the first and third counts and to admit the two prior DUI convictions and one prior prison term, in exchange for dismissal of the second count and the two other prior prison term allegations. The probation report recommended that defendant pay a $1,000 restitution fine pursuant to Penal Code section 1202.4, subdivision (b), with a second $1,000 restitution fine suspended pursuant to Penal Code section 1202.45. Although the report formally recommended that the court order defendant to report to the parole office nearest his last legal residence upon his release from prison, the\\ report also suggested that because defendant had committed the instant offenses specifically so that he could be paroled in Butte County, he should instead be paroled in Bakersfield. The probation report contained nothing about whether defendant should be ordered to pay for the services of his attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">At a sentencing hearing in September 2000, after sentencing defendant to four years in prison, the court ordered as follows: \u201cAttorney\u2019s fees will be in the standard amount of four hundred dollars. You are ordered to pay a restitution fund fine to the State of California in the amount of two hundred fifty dollars. That same amount will be ordered and stayed pending successful completion of your parole which will be for a minimum of three years. flD Upon you |&gt;zc] release from prison within forty-eight hours of that release you are ordered to report to the parole office in Kern County.\u201d Defense counsel did not object to any of these orders.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b34-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">I<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">Defendant asserts the trial court erred in ordering him to report to the parole office in Kern County upon his release from prison because the court has no authority to establish conditions of parole, such as the place of parole. The People agree, asserting the trial court had no authority to direct defendant to report to a specific parole office upon his release from prison. For the reasons that follow, we accept the People\u2019s concession and find the trial court erred in ordering defendant to report to the parole office in Kern County upon his release.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">Penal Code section 3003 dictates that \u201c[e]xcept as otherwise provided in this section, an inmate who is released on parole shall be returned to the county that was the last legal residence of the inmate prior to his or her incarceration.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 3003, subd. (a).) The paroling authority (either the Board of Prison Terms or the Department of Corrections) has the authority to decide whether an inmate should be returned to another county. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 3003, subd. (b).) No such authority is vested in the court. When the court imposes a determinate prison sentence under Penal Code section 1170, the court is required to \u201cinform the defendant that as part of the sentence after expiration of the term he or she may be on parole for a period as provided in Section 3000.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1170, subd. (c).) In only one circumstance, however, is the court authorized to direct the defendant to report to a particular parole office. Under subdivision (a)(3) of Penal Code section 1170, when \u201cthe amount of preimprisonment credit ... is equal to or exceeds any sentence imposed pursuant to this chapter, . . . [t]he court shall advise the defendant that he or she shall serve a period of parole and order the defendant to report to the parole office closest to the defendant\u2019s last legal residence, unless the in-custody credits equal the total sentence, including both confinement time and the period of parole.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1170, subd. (a)(3).)</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">Here, the trial court ordered defendant to report to the parole office in Kern County. If defendant\u2019s presentence credits had equaled or exceeded the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>four-year prison term the court imposed, the court would have been required under subdivision (a)(3) of Penal Code section 1170 to order defendant \u201cto report to the parole office closest to the defendant\u2019s last legal residence.\u201d Furthermore, the court\u2019s order directing defendant to report to the parole office in Kern County might have been proper so long as there was sufficient evidence in the record to support a finding that defendant\u2019s \u201clast legal residence\u201d was in Kern County rather than Butte County. In this instance, however, where defendant\u2019s presentence credits were less than the prison term the court imposed, the court had no authority to order defendant to report to a parcticular parole office. The choice of county in which defendant is to serve his term of parole following his incarceration is a matter for the paroling authority under Penal Code section 3000.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">Accordingly, the trial court erred in ordering defendant to report to the parole office in Kern County upon his release from prison. We shall modify the judgment to strike that aspect of defendant\u2019s sentence. Because the abstract of judgment does not reflect the court\u2019s order that defendant report to the parole office in Kern County upon his release from prison, no amendment to the abstract is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">The order directing defendant to report to the parole office in Kern County upon his release from prison is stricken and the judgment is affirmed as modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">Sims, Acting P. J., and Hull, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b33-8\">On the issue of attorney fees, the following box is checked on the \u201cSentencing/Disposition Minute Order\u201d: \u201cCounsel advises that $400.00 in expenses have been incurred &amp; Court finds that to be a reasonable sum. The matter is referred to Butte County Collections to determine defendant\u2019s ability to pay.\u201d In keeping with the transcript of the sentencing hearing, however, the abstract of judgment indicates only the following: \u201cDefendant to pay Public Defender costs of $400.00.\u201d Because the minute order appears to contain boilerplate language, we believe the transcript of the sentencing hearing and the abstract of judgment more accurately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>reflect the court\u2019s actual order in this case.
