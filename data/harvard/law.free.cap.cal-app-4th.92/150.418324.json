We treated the petition as a motion for relief from default under rule 39. IB of the California Rules of Court, consolidated it with the appeal, and requested respondent to serve and file opposition to the motion. On May 31, 2001, we granted the motion, and ordered that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>appeal be treated as a petition for writ of mandate, timely filed pursuant to California Rules of Court, rule 39.IB.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">Emmanuel was bom approximately 12 weeks prematurely on June 6, 2000, and was detained a few days later. According to the disposition report prepared by respondent, Mother had a long history of dmg abuse, and at the time Emmanuel was bom, she was serving a one-year term for a parole violation that included a failure to take her psychotropic medication and participate in counseling. Mother is schizophrenic, and regularly takes Haldol, Cogentin,. and Trazodone.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">Mother has two other children, Donnell, bom in 1986, and Christopher, bom in 1992, both of whom have been dependents of the court since 1993. Reunification services were offered in the case of Donnell and Christopher, but later terminated due to Mother\u2019s failure to comply with a court-ordered case plan. Since 1992, they have been in the care of their maternal grandmother, who has been their legal guardian since approximately 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">Mother testified at the disposition hearing. She denied that failure to take her medication or participate in counseling was the basis of her parole violation. She testified that she had changed residence without notifying her parole officer, missed one doctor\u2019s appointment, and contacted her mother, although she was prohibited from doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">Prior to the parole violation, Mother\u2019s last incarceration had been in 1998. At the time of the disposition hearing, she was still in prison, where she claimed to be attending a parenting course and having completed four one-hour classes. She testified that she was not in counseling, because the prison did not offer it. Mother admitted that she had not tried to reunify with Donnell and Christopher, but said she intentionally refrained from doing so, because she had things to deal with, and they were in good care.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">The juvenile court denied reunification services pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code section 361.5, subdivision (b)(2) and (10). Mother contends that there was no substantial evidence to support an order under Welfare and Institutions Code section 361.5, subdivision (b)(2), which provides that reunification services need not be ordered when the court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that the parent is suffering from a mental disability, as described in chapter 2 (commencing with \u00a7 7820) of part 4 of division 12 of the Family Code, such that she is incapable of utilizing those services. Such a finding must be supported by evidence given by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>two qualified mental-health experts. (See <em>In re Rebecca H. </em>(1991) 227 Cal.App.3d 825, 830 [278 Cal.Rptr. 185]; Fam. Code, \u00a7 7827.) Having submitted no expert evidence, respondent concedes Mother\u2019s first point, but contends that the juvenile court\u2019s order was correct under subdivision (b)(10).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Mother contends that the juvenile court erred in failing to provide reunification services under Welfare and Institutions Code section 361.5, subdivision (b)(10), based solely upon a finding that reunification services were previously terminated when she failed to reunify with Emmanuel\u2019s brothers, without also considering her subsequent efforts to address the cause of their removal from her custody.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> She asks us to weigh in on the side of Division One of the Fourth District Court of Appeal, which held in <em>Shawn S. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 1424 [80 Cal.Rptr.2d 80], that it is not enough to prove under subpart (A) of subdivision (b)(10), that reunification services had been terminated after the parent had failed to unify with her other children, following the removal of the other children from that parent pursuant to section 361. The <em>Shawn S. </em>court interpreted the provision to require an additional finding that the parent \u201chas not subsequently made a reasonable effort to treat the problems that led to removal of the [sibling].\u201d <em>(Shawn S., supra, </em>67 Cal.App.4th at p. 1427.)</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">Mother asks us to reject the conflicting interpretation of Welfare and Institutions Code section 361.5, subdivision (b)(10) made by the Fifth District Court of Appeal in <em>Marshall M. v. Superior Court </em>(1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 48 [88 Cal.Rptr.2d 891]. That court explained that the syntax of subdivision (b)(10) creates an ambiguity: the \u201creasonable effort\u201d phrase at the end of subdivision (b)(10) might be read to apply to both subparts (A) and (B) of the subdivision, or just to subpart (B). <em>(Marshall M., supra, </em>at p. 53.) The court expressly rejected the interpretation of <em>Shawn S., </em>and construed it as applying solely to subpart (B). <em>(Marshall M., supra, </em>at pp. 54-55.) It held that \u201cthis subdivision permits the juvenile court to deny reunification services in either of two distinct situations. One is where a sibling was in a permanent plan as a result of the parent\u2019s failure to reunify (\u00a7 361.5, subd. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>(b)(10)(A)). Another is where the parent\u2019s rights as to a sibling were terminated and the parent failed to make reasonable efforts to address the problems that led to that sibling\u2019s removal (\u00a7 361.5, subd. (b)(10)(B)).\u201d <em>(Marshall M. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>75 Cal.App.4th at p. 56.)</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">Respondent contends that the juvenile court did, in fact, make the additional finding required by the <em>Shawn S. </em>court, that Mother had not made a reasonable effort to treat the problems that led to the removal of Emmanuel\u2019s brothers. Mother counters that the court found merely that she did not make an effort to reunify with Donnell and Christopher. She contends that the \u201creasonable efforts\u201d phrase, if applied to Welfare and Institutions Code section 361.5, subdivision (b)(10)(A), requires the lack of reasonable effort to have occurred subsequent to the failure to unify.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Mother\u2019s contention demonstrates the weakness in the <em>Shawn S. </em>reasoning. Welfare and Institutions Code section 361.5, subdivision (b)(10)(A) refers to the \u201ctermination of reunification services for any siblings . . . because the parent or guardian failed to reunify with the sibling . . . after the sibling or half-sibling had been removed from that parent or guardian pursuant to Section 361. . . .\u201d In order to reunify, a parent must make a reasonable effort to treat the problems that led to the sibling\u2019s removal. (See <em>Marshall M. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>75 Cal.App.4th at pp. 56-57.) Thus, the distinction between failure to make reasonable efforts to reunify and to failure to make reasonable efforts to address the cause of the removal is one without a discernible difference. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 57.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">This point is well illustrated here. The brothers were originally detained because Mother was hospitalized because of her mental illness and because their father\u2019s whereabouts was unknown. The court allowed her to live in the home of her mother, the boys\u2019 guardian, and ordered her to remain in therapy and take her medications. Her failure to obey court orders led to the termination of reunification services, and consent to live in the guardian\u2019s home was rescinded in 1994, when Mother was found using crack cocaine in the home. Thus, Mother\u2019s failure to obey court orders intended to address her mental illness and her failure to make reasonable efforts to reunify are one and the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">We conclude, as the <em>Marshall </em>court did, that the juvenile court was not required to determine whether Mother\u2019s subsequent efforts were reasonable, prior to denying reunification services under Welfare and Institutions Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>section 361.5, subdivision (b)(10)(A). (See <em>Marshall M. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>75 Cal.App.4th at p. 55; see also <em>In re Jasmine C. </em>(1999) 70 Cal.App.4th 71, 76 [82 Cal.Rptr.2d 493].) Once a parent has failed to avail herself of the opportunity to reunify, \u201cthe general rule favoring reunification is replaced by a legislative assumption that offering services would be an unwise use of governmental resources.
