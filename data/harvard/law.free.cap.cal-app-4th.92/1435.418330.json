(Nutmeg) is in the business of providing financial advice and underwriting for companies \u201cgoing public\u201d with their stock through an initial public offering (IPO).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendant McGladrey &amp; Pullen (McGladrey) is a firm of certified public accountants which performed accounting and auditing services for American Diversified Holdings, Inc. (AmDiv) in connection with AmDiv\u2019s IPO.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1232-6\">In the fall of 1997 McGladrey and AmDiv devised a scheme by which AmDiv could launch its IPO based on false information contained in its financial reports.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At the heart of this scheme was AmDiv\u2019s representation it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1439\">*1439</page-number>possessed $11 million in assets derived from the sale of a bearer note.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> McGladrey participated in this scheme by assisting AmDiv to prepare a financial statement showing $11 million in proceeds from the sale of the bearer note \u201cwithout ever properly confirming whether such funds actually existed.\u201d Later, conducting an \u201cindependent audit\u201d of the very financial records it had participated in preparing, McGladrey affirmed the existence of the proceeds from the bearer note.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This affirmation by McGladrey was false and known by it to be false because McGladrey had never verified the existence of the bearer note or its proceeds.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1233-6\">McGladrey also assisted AmDiv in preparing and filing other pre-IPO reports with the Securities and Exchange . Commission (SEC), which contained materially false information concerning AmDiv\u2019s financial strength, the state of the company\u2019s development and its ability to execute its business plan.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1233-7\">In November 1998 Nutmeg agreed to provide underwriting services to AmDiv in connection with AmDiv\u2019s IPO. Nutmeg entered into this agreement with AmDiv based on the false or misleading financial records and other documents prepared and audited by McGladrey.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The false and misleading statements in these documents were material to Nutmeg\u2019s decision to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1440\">*1440</page-number>undertake the IPO and were made by McGladrey with the knowledge and intent Nutmeg would rely on them in making its decision. Nutmeg did in fact rely on these false and misleading statements in agreeing to assist in AmDiv\u2019s IPO.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1234-4\">While proceeding with the steps necessary for the IPO, Nutmeg raised questions about AmDiv\u2019s accounting practices. In response to Nutmeg\u2019s concerns, McGladrey assisted AmDiv in the preparation of a letter assuring Nutmeg \u201cthe statements set forth in the registration statement [with the SEC] that are not legal in nature are true and correct . . . and that there are no omissions or misrepresentations of any material facts contained therein, nor are there any omissions of fact necessary in order to make the statements made in the registration statement not misleading.\u201d These statements were untrue and McGladrey was aware these untrue statements would be communicated to Nutmeg, and intended Nutmeg to rely upon them.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1234-5\">AmDiv subsequently terminated Nutmeg\u2019s services and refused to pay the fees due Nutmeg in the sum of approximately $775,000.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This action followed against AmDiv, McGladrey and AmDiv\u2019s attorneys.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1234-6\">McGladrey demurred to the complaint on the ground Nutmeg\u2019s claim is barred under the decision in <em>Bily </em>because Nutmeg did not and cannot allege <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1441\">*1441</page-number>it was McGladrey\u2019s client, it had any direct contact with McGladrey concerning any of the matters alleged in the complaint, or that it was an intended recipient of McGladrey\u2019s audit reports relating to the financial statements of AmDiv.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-6\">The trial court sustained McGladrey\u2019s demurrer without leave to amend and subsequently entered judgment for McGladrey. Nutmeg filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-8\">I. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1235-9\">We note at the outset a well-established rule. When a demurrer to a complaint is sustained without leave to amend the complaint is reviewed de novo to determine whether, liberally construed, it states a cause of action under any conceivable theory, or could be amended to do so.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> As we shall explain below, the trial court erred in sustaining the demurrer to Nutmeg\u2019s complaint for three independent reasons. First, Nutmeg\u2019s complaint falls outside <em>Bily\u2019s </em>\u201cintended reliance\u201d limitation on liability for independent audits,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> because it alleges McGladrey was more than an independent auditor. In essence, the complaint alleges McGladrey knowingly assisted AmDiv in preparing false or misleading financial reports and then, in an audit of the reports it had prepared, certified those reports as fairly representing the company\u2019s financial position. Second, even under the \u201cintended reliance\u201d rule in <em>Bily, </em>we conclude the allegations in the complaint are sufficient to state a cause of action for negligent misrepresentation. Third, the complaint falls outside the \u201cintended reliance\u201d rule because it alleges <em>intentional </em>misrepresentation on the part of McGladrey. Intentional misrepresentation is not subject to the \u201cintended reliance\u201d rule applicable to negligent misrepresentation.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1235-10\">II. <em>Bily\u2019s Limitation on Liability for Negligent Misrepresentation Only Applies to Those Conducting Independent Audits; It Does Not Apply to Those Who Prepared the Underlying Financial Reports</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1235-13\">The Supreme Court began its opinion in <em>Bily </em>by stating the issue: \u201cWe granted review to consider whether and to what extent an accountant\u2019s duty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1442\">*1442</page-number>of care in the preparation of <em>an independent audit </em>of a client\u2019s financial statements extends to persons other than the client.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The court explained an \u201caudit,\u201d for purposes of its opinion \u201c \u2018is a verification of the financial statements of an entity through an examination of the underlying accounting records and supporting evidence.\u2019 . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In an audit, \u201c \u2018an accountant reviews financial statements prepared by a client and issues an opinion stating whether such statements fairly represent the financial status of the audited entity.\u2019 . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> An auditor, the court observed, \u201cis a watchdog, not a bloodhound. . . . As a matter of commercial reality, audits are performed in a client-controlled environment. The client typically prepares its own financial statements; it has direct control over and assumes primary responsibility for their contents. . . . Because the auditor cannot in the time available become an expert in the client\u2019s business and record-keeping systems, the client necessarily furnishes the information base for the audit.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1236-4\">Given the limited \u201csecondary\u201d role of the auditor in the financial reporting process,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> the Supreme Court concluded the auditor\u2019s liability to third parties also must be limited. Otherwise, the auditor would be subjected to \u201cmultibillion-dollar professional liability that is distinctly out of proportion to . . . the fault of the auditor . . . and ... the connection between the auditor\u2019s conduct and the third party\u2019s injury . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Accordingly, the court held \u201can auditor\u2019s liability for general negligence in the conduct of an audit of its client financial statements is confined to the client.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The court further held an auditor\u2019s liability to third parties for negligent misrepresentation is confined to those representations \u201c \u2018made with the intent to induce plaintiff, or a particular class of persons to which plaintiff belongs, to act in reliance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1443\">*1443</page-number>upon the representation in a specific transaction, or a specific type of transaction, that [the auditor] intended to influence.\u2019 \u2019,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1237-6\">The limitations <em>Bily </em>imposed on auditor liability are not applicable to the present case. Here, according to the allegations in the complaint, McGladrey did not simply conduct an independent audit of AmDiv\u2019s financial statements. Rather, McGladrey participated in the <em>creation </em>of these financial statements.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1237-7\">Specifically, the complaint alleges McGladrey <em>\u201cmanipulated American Diversified financial information </em>as to include as an asset in financials for American Diversified for the year end August 1998, the purported proceeds of the sale of the bearer note in an amount in excess of $11 million even though neither [McGladrey nor AmDiv\u2019s attorneys] had ever properly verified whether the note existed or whether the proceeds had been received by American Diversified.\u201d (Italics added.) McGladrey, it is alleged, included the $11 million \u201cas an asset of American Diversified only after demanding the information and documents, and being threatened with losing the opportunity to remain as American Diversified\u2019s accountants . . . .\u201d The complaint further alleges McGladrey \u201cassisted [AmDiv] in filing the reports necessary to publicly sell stock in [AmDiv], which reports included materially false information concerning the financial strength of [AmDiv] . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-8\">Taking the allegations of the complaint to be true, as we must,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Nutmeg alleges McGladrey participated in the preparation of AmDiv\u2019s most significant financial records and then conducted a purported \u201cindependent audit\u201d of the records it prepared. Under these circumstances McGladrey is not entitled to the protection from liability to third parties which the Supreme Court, in <em>Bily, </em>extended to independent auditors. McGladrey\u2019s role was not \u201csecondary,\u201d but primary.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> It did not simply \u201c \u2018review [] financial statements prepared by a client;\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> it prepared the financial statements it reviewed. Indeed, under the facts alleged it would be difficult for McGladrey to claim it conducted an \u201cindependent audit\u201d as the Supreme Court used that term in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1444\">*1444</page-number><em>Bily </em>or to draw a meaningful distinction between McGladrey\u2019s \u201caudit\u201d and its preparation of the financial records.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1238-4\">Accordingly, we hold where an \u201coutside\u201d or \u201cindependent\u201d accountant prepares as well as audits a corporation\u2019s financial records it is liable for negligent misrepresentation to those third parties who reasonably and foreseeably relied on the financial records, the audit, or both.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Here, Nutmeg alleged it relied on both the audit and the underlying financial records.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1238-5\">HI. <em>The Allegations in the Complaint Are Sufficient to State a Cause of Action for Negligent Misrepresentation Under the Intended Reliance Rule</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1238-7\">The principal holding in <em>Bily </em>is that a third party seeking to recover damages from an independent auditor based on negligent misrepresentations in the audit must plead and prove \u201c \u2018[t]he representation [was] made with the intent to induce plaintiff, or a particular class of persons to which plaintiff belongs, to act in reliance upon the representation in a specific transaction, or a specific type of transaction, that defendant intended to influence.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Under this \u201cintended reliance\u201d rule, a defendant \u201c \u2018is deemed to have intended to influence [its client\u2019s] transaction with plaintiff whenever defendant knows with substantial certainty that plaintiff, or the particular class of persons to which plaintiff belongs, will rely on the representation in the course of the transaction.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1238-8\">Nutmeg\u2019s complaint alleges McGladrey knew and intended Nutmeg would rely on McGladrey\u2019s audit and other statements regarding AmDiv\u2019s financial condition in agreeing to act as underwriter for AmDiv\u2019s IPO. Nutmeg did in fact rely on the audit and other statements by McGladrey in taking on the AmDiv IPO.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-9\">These allegations are sufficient under <em>Bily </em>to establish a duty of care to Nutmeg on the part of McGladrey. Indeed, an auditor\u2019s liability for negligent misrepresentation does not require proof the audit was intended to influence the particular plaintiff. Rather, a complaint for negligent misrepresentation is sufficient if it alleges the audit was intended to influence \u201c \u2018the particular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1445\">*1445</page-number>class of persons to which plaintiff belongs.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> IPO underwriters are a sufficiently \u201cnarrow and circumscribed class of persons\u201d for purposes of an auditor\u2019s duty of care under <em>Bily. </em>Furthermore, McGladrey is a large and experienced accounting firm and it undoubtedly knew one purpose of its audit was to attract a prestigious investment banker to underwrite AmDiv\u2019s IPO.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> McGladrey also could reasonably foresee an underwriter would rely upon the representations in its audit report. Given the complex nature of the audit function,<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> \u201c \u2018[u]nderwriters [are generally] entitled to rely on [the auditor\u2019s] expertise.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1239-6\">Contrary to McGladrey\u2019s argument on appeal, Nutmeg was not required to allege AmDiv instructed McGladrey to prepare an audit report specifically for Nutmeg, or Nutmeg asked McGladrey to conduct an audit on Nutmeg\u2019s behalf, or Nutmeg directly asked McGladrey about McGladrey\u2019s ability to pay Nutmeg\u2019s underwriting fees. All Nutmeg needed to allege was McGladrey knew and intended Nutmeg, or the class of IPO underwriters, to rely on its audit report.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Nutmeg\u2019s complaint made this allegation.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1239-7\">McGladrey next argues it owed no duty to avoid making negligent misrepresentations to Nutmeg because Nutmeg is precisely the kind of sophisticated consumer identified in <em>Bily </em>as being able to protect itself through private ordering. McGladrey draws this argument from the Supreme Court\u2019s explanation why an auditor is not liable to third parties for general negligence. The court contrasted the \u201cpowerless consumer\u201d in product liability cases to investors, creditors and others who read and rely on audit reports and financial statements and concluded the latter \u201coften possess considerable sophistication in analyzing financial information\u201d and can \u201cprivately order\u201d the risk of inaccurate financial reporting by contractual agreements with the client or the client\u2019s auditor or commission its own auditor or investigator.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> The court did not hold or even suggest a plaintiff\u2019s ability to engage in private ordering precluded it from recovering for negligent misrepresentation if it fell within the limited class of persons to whom an auditor owed a duty of care, i.e., those persons whom the auditor knew would rely on its representations in transacting business with its client. Rather, the court said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1446\">*1446</page-number>no unfairness results to those who are excluded from this limited class because they have other methods of protecting their interests through \u201cprivate ordering.\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1240-4\">Finally, McGladrey contends an auditor owes a duty of care only to such third persons as are \u201cspecifically intended beneficiaries of the audit report who are known to the auditor and for whose benefit it renders the audit report.\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Nutmeg cannot recover for negligent misrepresentation, McGladrey maintains, because the facts pled in the complaint show, as a matter of law, Nutmeg was not the \u201cspecifically intended beneficiary\u201d of the audit report nor was the audit report intended to influence Nutmeg\u2019s agreement to underwrite AmDiv\u2019s IPO. Nutmeg admits in its complaint AmDiv submitted the audit report to the SEC as part of AmDiv\u2019s registration requirement under the 1933 Securities Act. The act\u2019s purpose is to protect investors, not underwriters.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Therefore, McGladrey concludes, the audit report was intended to benefit or influence investors in their decision whether to purchase shares of AmDiv in the IPO, not to benefit or influence an underwriter such as Nutmeg in its decision whether to underwrite AmDiv\u2019s IPO.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-5\">McGladrey reads <em>Bily </em>too narrowly. It assumes an audit report only can have one intended beneficiary and only can influence one type of transaction. We find nothing in <em>Bily </em>to support these assumptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-6\">As previously noted, the Supreme Court\u2019s principal concerns in <em>Bily </em>were to \u201c \u2018avoid limitless liability out of all proportion to the degree of [the auditor\u2019s] negligence\u2019 \u201d while holding the auditor liable \u201cin situations where it clearly intended to undertake the responsibility of influencing particular business transactions involving third persons.\u201d<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> To address these concerns, the court adopted the \u201cintended reliance\u201d rule from the Restatement Second of Torts. In the court\u2019s view, the advantage of the Restatement rule over a rule of general foreseeability is that the Restatement rule gives the commercial supplier of information, e.g., an auditor, information \u201cas to the nature and scope of the client\u2019s transactions that may expand the supplier\u2019s exposure liability.\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> This information is critically important, the court said, \u201c \u2018because the risk of liability to which the supplier subjects himself by undertaking to give the information ... is vitally affected by the number and character of the persons, and particularly the nature and the extent of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1447\">*1447</page-number>proposed transaction.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> If, for example, the client informs the auditor the audit will be used to obtain a bank loan the auditor may be held liable to the lending bank even though the client did not name that specific bank to the auditor and may have submitted the audit to numerous banks in negotiating for a loan.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> If, on the other hand, an accounting firm customarily performs an annual audit of a corporation for no particular purpose but knows the corporation may employ the audit for a wide variety of aims and the audit may be relied upon by a wide variety of persons, the auditor is not liable to a bank which relies on the audit to make a loan to the corporation.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1241-6\">Thus, under the Restatement rule, as interpreted in <em>Bily, </em>liability for an auditor\u2019s negligent misrepresentation in an audit report is limited to \u201cthose situations in which the supplier undertakes to supply information to a third party whom [it] knows is likely to rely on it in a transaction that has sufficiently specific economic parameters to permit the supplier to assess the risk of moving forward.\u201d<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> Under this test for liability it is immaterial how many classes of persons will be exposed to the audit and how many classes of transactions will be influenced by it, <em>so long as </em>these classes have \u201csufficiently specific parameters\u201d to allow the auditor to assess the scope of its liability when it undertakes the audit and thus engage in its own \u201cprivate ordering\u201d to manage the risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-7\">In the present case, the complaint alleges McGladrey knew it was preparing financial statements and an audit to be used in connection with an IPO and knew Nutmeg would be relying on these documents in determining whether to act as underwriter for the offering. <em>Bily </em>does not require Nutmeg to allege AmDiv told McGladrey the name of the underwriter who would be relying on its reports or allege AmDiv specifically told McGladrey an underwriter would be involved in the IPO. <em>Bily </em>only requires McGladrey knew \u201cwith substantial certainty\u201d Nutmeg or the particular class of persons to which Nutmeg belongs, i.e., underwriters, would rely on the reports in the course of preparing the IPO.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> As previously noted, it can be inferred McGladrey knew there would be an underwriter for the IPO based on the customary manner in which IPO\u2019s are generated and McGladrey\u2019s experience as a public accounting firm. The fact McGladrey knew the SEC would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1448\">*1448</page-number>also rely on the audit report in deciding whether to authorize the IPO does not cancel out McGladrey\u2019s liability to Nutmeg.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-4\">IV. <em>The Complaint Alleges a Cause of Action for Intentional Misrepresentation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1242-6\">The Supreme Court, in <em>Bily, </em>recognized even an independent auditor is not shielded by the \u201cintended reliance\u201d rule in cases of intentional misrepresentation.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> \u201c[T]he liability of auditors to third parties presents different policy considerations when intentional fraud is involved. ... By joining with its client in an intentional deceit, the auditor thrusts itself into a primary and nefarious role in the transaction.\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> Thus, the court held, an independent auditor is subject to liability for representations \u201c \u2018made with the intent to defraud plaintiff, or a particular class of persons to which the plaintiff belongs, whom defendant intended <em>or reasonably should have foreseen </em>would rely upon the representation.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1242-7\">A complaint for intentional misrepresentation may allege either \u201cthe auditor\u2019s actual knowledge of the false or baseless character of its opinion\u201d or the auditor had \u201c \u2018no belief in the truth of the statement, and [made] it recklessly, without knowing whether it is true or false . . . .\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> Nutmeg\u2019s complaint alleges both actual knowledge of falsity and reckless disregard for the truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-8\">The complaint alleges McGladrey prepared an audit report for submission as part of AmDiv\u2019s required registration statement with the SEC in which McGladrey stated it had \u201caudited the balance sheets of American Diversified and its subsidiaries [and] \u2018in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to . . . present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of American Diversified . . . and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the period indicated in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.\u2019 \u201d This statement was false.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> The audit and the underlying financial reports contained numerous material misstatements and did not fairly represent the financial position of AmDiv. Among other things, McGladrey confirmed AmDiv\u2019s assets included $11 million from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1449\">*1449</page-number>proceeds of the sale of a bearer note without ever verifying whether such a bearer note existed or whether AmDiv had actually received the proceeds. \u201c[A]t all relevant times,\u201d the complaint alleges, McGladrey was \u201caware that American Diversified had no real value or functionality as a company, that any stock of American Diversified would be essentially worthless, and that an American Diversified IPO could not take place legitimately.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-6\">Nutmeg further alleges \u201cthe material misrepresentations and omissions set forth [in the complaint] were made intentionally . . . recklessly and without reasonable grounds for believing such statements to be true . . . .\u201d In support of this allegation, Nutmeg alleges McGladrey, in return for \u201cthe promise of substantial future business\u201d from AmDiv, agreed \u201cto ignore [its] professional obligations\u201d and, \u201cwithout any reasonable basis for doing so, confirmed that the proceeds from the bearer note of approximately $11 million had been correctly stated by . . .

In response to these inquiries and \u201cto thwart the discovery of their scheme and misrepresentations\u201d defendants, including McGladrey, \u201cassisted American Diversified in preparing a modification to its contract with Nutmeg . . . which represented and warranted that \u2018the statements set forth in the registration statement [filed with the SEC] that are not legal in nature are true and correct</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-10\">The complaint alleges a cause of action for intentional misrepresentation.

The first statement was false because McGladrey did not follow generally accepted accounting principles in confirming the existence of the $11 million. As a result the second statement could not have been made with a good faith belief in its truth but rather was made recklessly without knowing whether it was true or false.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> It is alleged McGladrey made the representations with the specific intent to defraud Nutmeg and Nutmeg relied on those representations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-4\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-5\">The judgment is reversed.

(Ferris et al., <em>An Analysis and Recommendation for Prestigious Underwriter Participation in IPOs </em>(1992) 17 J. Corp. L. 581, 582-583 (hereafter Ferris).) In some cases the underwriter will purchase the entire offering for resale to the public; in other cases the underwriter will purchase only a percentage of the offering. (Ferris, at pp. 583-584.) In either case, the underwriter has both monetary and reputational capital at risk in the offering and is keenly interested in the financial soundness of the company. The company is interested in producing a solid financial report in order, among other things, to attract a prestigious underwriter whose involvement will lend credibility and interest to the IPO.
