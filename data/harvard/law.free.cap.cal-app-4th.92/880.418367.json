J.</author>\n<p id=\"AMu\">On August 31, 1999, a jury found appellant Michael Eddie Towey guilty of felony transportation of methamphetamine and the misdemeanors of possession of marijuana, being under the influence of a controlled substance, and giving false identification to a police officer. The trial court found as true enhancement allegations of a prior serious or violent felony conviction for attempted robbery, a prior conviction for possession for sale of a controlled substance, and prior prison terms for both of these convictions. Appellant was sentenced to an 11-year prison term.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-8\">Appellant filed a timely appeal claiming (1) the trial court erred by not obtaining appellant\u2019s personal waiver of the use of CALJIC Nos. 2.60 and 2.61, (2) proper instructions about proof of the required mental states were not given, (3) the trial court erred by not giving sua sponte instructions regarding voluntary intoxication, (4) he was not under \u201cdetention\u201d for purposes of Penal Code section 148.9<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> at the time he falsely identified himself to a police officer, (5) the transportation of methamphetamine conviction was not supported by substantial evidence, (6) the transportation of methamphetamine conviction must be reversed because the trial court did not give CALJIC Nos. 3.00 or 3.01 regarding aiding and abetting, (7) the trial court erred by failing to advise appellant of his Boykin-Tahl-Yurko<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> rights before his admission of the enhancement allegations, (8) the use of CALJIC No. 17.41.1 infringed upon appellant\u2019s constitutional right to trial by jury, and (9) the use of CALJIC No. 17.42 prohibiting the jury from considering the penalties or punishments was prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-9\">We will affirm the convictions, reverse the findings of the enhancement allegations and remand for further proceedings. In the published portion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>this opinion we address the issue of whether a defendant must personally waive the giving of CALJIC Nos. 2.60 and 2.61 regarding a defendant not testifying. The facts of this case are unnecessary to the published portion of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">Facts<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b755-8\">\n<em>Personal Consent of Defendant Is Not Required to Forgo the Use of CAUIC Nos. 2.60 and 2.61</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b755-9\">Appellant presents the novel question of whether or not the trial court erred when it accepted defense counsel\u2019s waiver of a request for CALJIC Nos. 2.60 (Defendant Not Testifying\u2014No Inference of Guilt May be Drawn) and 2.61 (Defendant May Rely on The State of The Evidenc\u00e9) without obtaining a personal waiver from appellant. The record reflects the following discussion of defense counsel\u2019s waiver of these two instructions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-10\">\u201cMs. Fochetti [deputy district attorney]: Also, we were going to\u2014I would request the defendant put his waiver\u2014or the defense attorney put his waiver of requesting CALJIC instructions 2.60 and 2.61 on the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-11\">\u201cMr. Oliver [defense counsel]: That\u2019s true, I specifically do not request that for the defendant. Tactically, I find that I think it\u2019s less beneficial to\u2014to give those instructions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-12\">\u201cThe Court: Okay.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b755-13\">In <em>People v. Ernst </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 441 [34 Cal.Rptr.2d 238, 881 P.2d 298], the Supreme Court held that a defendant\u2019s right to a jury trial can only be waived personally by the defendant. A personal waiver of the right to trial by jury is explicitly required by the California Constitution. (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 16.) Case law also requires personal waivers for other \u201cfundamental\u201d rights of a personal nature. \u201cIt is for the defendant to decide such fundamental matters as whether to plead guilty [citation], whether to waive the right to trial by jury [citation], whether to waive the right to counsel [citation], and whether to waive the right to be free from self-incrimination [citation]. As to these rights, the criminal defendant must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>admonished and the court must secure an express waiver; as to other fundamental rights of a less personal nature, courts may assume that counsel\u2019s waiver reflects the defendant\u2019s consent in the absence of an express conflict. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re Horton </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 82, 95 [284 Cal.Rptr. 305, 813 P.2d 1335], fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">Outside of a handful of \u201cfundamental\u201d rights of a personal nature, an accused surrenders control over defense strategies and tactics in his case to defense counsel. <em>(In re Horton, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d at p. 95.) For example, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Bradford </em>(1997) 14 Cal.4th 1005, 1052 [60 Cal.Rptr.2d 225, 929 P.2d 544], the Supreme Court ruled a trial court has no duty \u201cto sua sponte inform [a defendant] of his right to testify and to obtain an express personal waiver of that right.\u201d One factor distinguishing the right to a jury trial from the right to testify is the absence of a provision in the California Constitution requiring an express personal waiver of the right to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">While recognizing that the instructions relate to the fundamental right concerning self-incrimination and to the presumption of innocence, we conclude the right to have the jury instructed using CALJIC Nos. 2.60 and 2.61 is not, in itself, a \u201cfundamental right of a personal nature\u201d that requires an express personal waiver by a defendant. First, no provision of the California Constitution or California case law explicitly requires an express personal waiver by a defendant of the right to have the jury instructed under CALJIC Nos. 2.60 and 2.61.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">Second, as recognized by the parties, decisions concerning which instructions to request and which instructions to waive generally are matters of tactics. The record in this case shows defense counsel\u2019s reason for not requesting the instructions was tactical. The Supreme Court has recognized that it is debatable whether or not a defendant receives an advantage from an instruction forbidding the jury to draw any inference of guilt from the defendant\u2019s failure to testify because it draws the jury\u2019s attention to his silence. (See <em>People v. Gardner </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 843, 854 [79 Cal.Rptr. 743, 457 P.2d 575].) As a result, California courts have not imposed a sua sponte duty to give the instructions. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Holt </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 619, 687 [15 Cal.4th 1385a, 63 Cal.Rptr.2d 782, 937 P.2d 213].) In light of the treatment historically given to the instructions currently set forth in CALJIC Nos. 2.60 and 2.61, the right to have those instructions given cannot be characterized as a \u201cfundamental\u201d right, much less the equivalent of any of the four fundamental rights of a personal nature identified in <em>In re Horton, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d at page 95, which require a personal waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">Accordingly, we will not create a new duty requiring trial courts to seek, sua sponte, personal waivers from defendants when their attorneys request CALJIC Nos. 2.60 and 2.61 not be given.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>II-IX<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">The convictions are affirmed and the findings of the enhancement allegations are reversed and remand for further proceedings consistent with this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">Wiseman, J., and Cornell, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b754-10\">All further statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b754-11\"><em>Boykin v.
