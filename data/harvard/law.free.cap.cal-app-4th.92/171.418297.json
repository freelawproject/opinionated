The three strikes law is one example. (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12, subds. (b)-(e).) Petty theft with a prior is another. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 666.)

The magistrate held him to answer, but the superior court found \u201cno evidence\u201d of three \u201cseparate violations . . . which resulted in convictions\u201d of DUI and set aside the ensuing information. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 995.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>) A timely People\u2019s appeal followed. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1238, subd. (a)(1).)</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">The issue on appeal is whether pleading and proof at the preliminary hearing of three \u201cseparate violations . . . which resulted in convictions\u201d of DUI is necessary to prosecute and punish a fourth DUI as a felony. Defendant argues it is necessary. The Attorney General argues it is not. In the alternative, the Attorney General argues pleading and proof at the preliminary hearing of a pending DUI complaint and two \u201cseparate violations . . . which resulted in convictions\u201d of DUI is adequate if three \u201cseparate violations . . . which resulted in convictions\u201d of DUI will exist by the time of conviction of a fourth DUI.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">Our analysis of California\u2019s historical framework for charging a felony by information persuades us that pleading and proof at the preliminary hearing of three \u201cseparate violations . . . which resulted in convictions\u201d of DUI is a constitutional and statutory condition precedent to prosecution and punishment of a fourth DUI as a felony. We affirm the superior court order setting aside the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">(1) <em>Legislative history of section 23550</em></p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">The \u201cfundamental task of statutory construction is to \u2018ascertain the intent of the lawmakers so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Cruz </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 764, 774-775 [55 Cal.Rptr.2d 117, 919 P.2d 731].) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>If the language is clear, the plain meaning of the words is determinative, and there is ordinarily no need to look beyond the statute itself. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Benson </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 24, 30 [74 Cal.Rptr.2d 294, 954 P.2d 557].) If the language is ambiguous, the courts may \u201cresort to extrinsic sources, including the ostensible objects to be achieved and the legislative history.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Coronado </em>(1995) 12 Cal.4th 145, 151 [48 Cal.Rptr.2d 77, 906 P.2d 1232].)</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Section 23550 authorizes felony punishment of a fourth DUI that occurs within seven years of commission of three \u201cseparate violations . . . which resulted in convictions\u201d of DUI, but the statute does not specify when pleading and proof of those conditions precedent to felony punishment shall occur. (\u00a7 23550, subd. (a).) The Attorney General argues the opening words of the statute\u2014\u201cIf any person is convicted of a violation of Section 23152\u201d\u2014show that pleading and proof of the three \u201cseparate violations . . . which resulted in convictions\u201d of DUI is not necessary at the preliminary hearing since \u201cthe time at which to inquire about any other convictions is the point at which the defendant is convicted, and not earlier.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">A legislative intent to impose harsher penalties for successive DUI\u2019s is readily inferable from section 23550\u2019s legislative history. The statute, originally enacted as section 23175, authorized a harsher misdemeanor penalty for a fourth DUI within five years of three \u201cprior offenses which resulted in convictions\u201d of DUI. (Stats. 1983, ch. 637, \u00a7 3, p. 2546.) By subsequent amendment, the statute applied to three \u201cseparate violations . . . which resulted in convictions\u201d of DUI without regard to whether they were priors (Stats. 1984, ch. 1205, \u00a7 3, p. 4130; Stats. 1984, ch. 1417, \u00a7 2.5, p. 4984, operative July 1, 1985), then changed from five years to seven years the time between the new offense and the three \u201cseparate violations . . . which resulted in convictions\u201d of DUI (Stats. 1986, ch. 1117, \u00a7 6, p. 3934), then authorized felony punishment by evolving from a misdemeanor to a wobbler (Stats. 1988, ch. 599, \u00a7 1, p. 2160; Stats. 1988, ch. 1553, \u00a7 2, p. 5580<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>), and then was repealed and reenacted as section 23550 with no significant change in text (Stats. 1998, ch. 118, \u00a7\u00a7 41, 84). Nowhere in the legislative history, however, do we find an intent to authorize a prosecution leading to harsher recidivist penalties before three \u201cseparate violations . . . which resulted in convictions\u201d of DUI exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">(2) <em>The section 23550 enhancement and an analogous enhancement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">The cornerstone of the prosecutor\u2019s opposition to defendant\u2019s Penal Code section 995 motion in the superior court was <em>People </em>v. <em>Snook </em>(1997) 16 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>Cal.4th 1210 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 615, 947 P.2d 808]. That case analyzed the legislative intent of section 23217, a statute the Legislature enacted while changing the trigger for harsher punishment of a DUI from three \u201cprior offenses which resulted in convictions\u201d of DUI to three \u201cseparate violations . . . which resulted in convictions\u201d of DUI without regard to whether they were priors.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>(People v. Snook, supra, </em>at p. 1218; see Stats. 1984, ch. 1205, \u00a7 14, p. 4136.) <em>Snook </em>found a legislative intent to permit felony punishment \u201cregardless of the order in which the offenses were committed and the convictions obtained.\u201d <em>(People v. Snook, supra, </em>at p. 1213.) On appeal, however, the Attorney General concedes neither <em>Snook </em>nor any other published case addresses the issue whether pleading and proof at the preliminary hearing of three \u201cseparate violations . . . which resulted in convictions\u201d of DUI is necessary to prosecute and punish a fourth DUI as a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">Both parties cite <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Mendella) </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 754 [191 Cal.Rptr. 1, 661 P.2d 1081] <em>(Mendella), </em>in which the Supreme Court announced, in the Attorney General\u2019s words, a \u201cbroad rule\u201d making enhancement allegations subject to a Penal Code section 995 motion. <em>(Mendella, supra, </em>at pp. 758-763, superseded by statute on another point as stated in <em>In re Jovan B. </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 801, 814, fn. 8 [25 Cal.Rptr.2d 428, 863 P.2d 673].) The three \u201cseparate violations . . . which resulted in convictions\u201d of DUI are enhancement allegations, not elements of the crime. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Coronado, supra, </em>12 Cal.4th at p. 152, fn. 5; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bowen </em>(1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 102, 105-106 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 40]; <em>People v. Weathington </em>(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 69, 87-90 [282 Cal.Rptr. 170].)</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">The prosecutor in <em>Mendella </em>filed a complaint that charged assault with a deadly weapon or by force likely to produce great bodily injury (GBI) but that alleged no GBI enhancement. <em>(Mendella, supra, </em>33 Cal.3d at p. 757; Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 245, subd. (a)(1), 12022.7, subd. (a).) Skeptical of the accused\u2019s denial of intent to cause injury, the magistrate held him to answer. <em>(Mendella, supra, </em>at p. 757.)</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>Once the ensuing information in <em>Mendella </em>added a GBI allegation to the original assault charge, the accused filed (1) a Penal Code section 995 motion on the ground the prosecutor adduced insufficient evidence of GBI at the preliminary hearing, and (2) a Penal Code section 739 motion on the ground an information can charge an offense, but cannot allege an enhancement, that was not in the complaint at the time of the preliminary hearing.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>(Mendella, supra, </em>33 Cal.3d at p. 757; Pen. Code, \u00a7 12022.7, subd. (a).) The superior court granted the Penal Code section 739 motion, ruling that a Penal Code section 995 motion can challenge an offense but not an enhancement. <em>(Mendella, supra, </em>at pp. 758, 763.)</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">The Supreme Court in <em>Mendella </em>examined the transition from the indeterminate sentencing law (ISL) to the determinate sentencing law (DSL) and found nothing in the \u201chistory or form\u201d of the DSL that intimated a legislative intent \u201cto deprive the defendant of the opportunity\u201d the ISL traditionally recognized \u201cfor pretrial challenges of enhancement allegations.\u201d <em>(Mendella, supra, </em>33 Cal.3d at p. 763.) The court noted, too, that Penal Code section 995 draws no distinction between an offense and an enhancement and held that to allow the prosecutor \u201cto indiscriminately charge enhancements without subjecting such allegations to judicial scrutiny under a [Penal Code] section 995 motion is to undermine\u201d procedural guaranties that \u201cimplement the defendant\u2019s due process right to a pretrial determination of probable cause.\u201d <em>(Mendella, supra, </em>at pp. 758-759; see <em>Ervin </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1981) 119 Cal.App.3d 78, 89 [173 Cal.Rptr. 208].) The court vacated the order setting aside the enhancement under Penal Code section 739 since the record contained sufficient evidence of GBI to withstand a Penal Code section 995 motion. <em>(Mendella, supra, </em>at pp. 757-758, 765.)</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">(3) <em>History of the requirement of pleading and proof at the preliminary hearing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\"><em>Mendella </em>fits squarely within the constitutional and statutory framework for charging a felony by information. Among the components of that framework are Penal Code sections 871 and 872. Penal Code section 871 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>\u201cIf, after hearing the proofs, it appears either that no public offense has been committed or that there is not sufficient cause to believe the defendant guilty of a public offense, the magistrate <em>shall </em>order the complaint dismissed and the defendant to be discharged.\u201d (Italics added.) Penal Code section 872, subdivision (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cIf, however, it appears from the examination that a public offense has been committed, and there is sufficient cause to believe that the defendant is guilty, the magistrate <em>shall </em>malee or indorse on the complaint an order . . . \u2018that he or she be held to answer to the same.\u2019 \u201d (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">Both statutes use the word \u201cshall,\u201d which generally refers to a mandatory duty. <em>(Common Cause </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1989) 49 Cal.3d 432, 443 [261 Cal.Rptr. 574, <em>111 </em>P.2d 610].)  The accused is entitled to the benefit of every reasonable doubt in questions of statutory construction. <em>(Keeler </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 619, 631 [87 Cal.Rptr. 481, 470 P.2d 617, 40 A.L.R.3d 420], superseded by statute on another ground as stated in <em>Wilson v. Kaiser Foundation Hospitals </em>(1983) 141 Cal.App.3d 891, 897, fn. 6 [190 Cal.Rptr. 649]; <em>In re Tartar </em>(1959) 52 Cal.2d 250, 257 [339 P.2d 553].)  Applying those established rules of statutory construction, we consider mandatory the magistrate\u2019s Penal Code sections 871 and 872 duties. (See 4 Witkin &amp; Epstein, Cal. Criminal Law (3d ed. 2000) Pretrial Proceedings, \u00a7\u00a7 147, 148, 151, pp. 350, 351, 354.)</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">To discharge those duties, the magistrate must hold the accused to answer if the evidence at the preliminary hearing shows three \u201cseparate violations . . . which resulted in convictions\u201d of DUI but must dismiss the complaint if the evidence fails to show three \u201cseparate violations . . . which resulted in convictions\u201d of DUI. (See Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 871, 872; Veh. Code, \u00a723550.) The standard of proof is \u201csufficient cause,\u201d which \u201cis generally equivalent to that \u2018reasonable or probable cause\u2019 required to justify an arrest\u201d but which \u201cneed not be sufficient to support a conviction.\u201d <em>(Williams v. Superior Court </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 1144, 1147 [81 Cal.Rptr. 761, 460 P.2d 961].)</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">The original 1879 California Constitution mandated that felonies \u201cshall be prosecuted by information, after examination and commitment by a Magistrate, or by indictment, with or without such examination and commitment, as may be prescribed by law.\u201d (Cal. Const, of 1879, art. I, \u00a7 8.) That mandate embodies the pleading and proof requirement that Penal Code sections 871 and 872 introduced a century and a half ago and that article I, section 14 of the California Constitution continues to the present: \u201cFelonies shall be prosecuted as provided by law, either by indictment or, after examination and commitment by a magistrate, by information.\u201d (Stats. 1851, ch. 29, \u00a7\u00a7 163-164, p. 230; Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 14 (pertinent part), added by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>initiative, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 5, 1974), commonly known as Prop. 7; see Assem. Const. Amend. No. 60, Stats. 1974 (1973-1974 Reg. Sess.) Res. ch. 90, pp. 3736-3740.)</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">An early case emphasized that compliance with the constitutional and statutory requirements of pleading and proof is the sine qua non of superior court jurisdiction to try an accused on a felony information: \u201cBefore any accused person can be called upon to defend himself on any charge prosecuted by information, he is entitled to a preliminary examination upon said charge, and the judgment of the magistrate before whom such examination is held as to whether the crime for which it is sought to prosecute him has been committed, and whether there is sufficient cause to believe him guilty thereof. These proceedings are essential to confer jurisdiction upon the court before whom he is placed on trial. To say that he was accorded a fair trial upon an information filed against him without a substantial compliance with these jurisdictional requirements, and, therefore, that there had been no miscarriage of justice, hardly meets the situation. Such an argument would apply with equal force to the validity of the conviction upon an information filed by the district attorney in a case where no preliminary examination at all had been held. Such practice would result, in legal effect, in wiping out all provisions of the constitution and the Penal Code providing for preliminary examination, and in clothing the district attorney with unlimited authority to file information against whomsoever in his judgment he might consider guilty of crime.\u201d <em>(People v. Bomar </em>(1925) 73 Cal.App. 372, 378 [238 P. 758].)</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">The constitutional mandate \u201c \u2018protects a person from prosecution in the absence of a prior determination by either a magistrate or a grand jury that such action is justified.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Jones v. Superior Court, supra, </em>4 Cal.3d at p. 664.) A statute in force for almost a century complements the constitutional mandate by specifically prohibiting amendment of the \u201cinformation so as to charge an offense not shown by the evidence taken at the preliminary examination.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1009 (Pen. Code, former \u00a7 1008); Stats. 1911, ch. 257, \u00a7 1, p. 436; Stats. 1927, ch. 608, \u00a7 1, p. 1040; Stats. 1941, ch. 497, \u00a7 2, p. 1809; Stats. 1951, ch. 1674, \u00a7\u00a7 76-77, p. 3842; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(Alvarado) (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 464, 472 [255 Cal.Rptr. 46].)</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">The \u201cclear purpose\u201d of the protections inherent in the constitutional and statutory framework for charging a felony by information is \u201cto give the accused a preliminary hearing either before a grand jury or before a committing magistrate, and to deny to the district attorney the right to force an accused to trial before a jury upon an information which is not within the scope of the evidence taken.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Fyfe </em>(1929) 102 Cal.App. 549, 553 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>[283 P. 378]; see Cal. Const., former art. I, \u00a7 8; Pen. Code, former \u00a7 1008.) Those protections, which are \u201cmandatory\u201d and \u201cin whole harmony\u201d with one another, require \u201cexamination and commitment by a magistrate as a prerequisite to the filing of an information by the district attorney.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Fyfe, supra, </em>at p. 555.)</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">In light of those protections, we turn to the statute at issue, section 23550, which authorizes felony punishment of an offender with three \u201cseparate violations . . . which <em>resulted </em>in convictions\u201d of DUI. (\u00a7 23550, subd. (a), italics added.) The statute does <em>not </em>authorize felony punishment of an offender with three separate violations which <em>will result </em>in convictions of DUI. By arguing the three \u201cseparate violations . . . which resulted in convictions\u201d of DUI \u201cneed only be proven at the time of conviction on the charged offense,\u201d the Attorney General equates \u201csufficient cause\u201d of a pending DUI complaint with \u201csufficient cause\u201d of a DUI that <em>resulted </em>in conviction. That is entirely too reminiscent of the Queen\u2019s retort to the King in Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-5\">\u201c \u2018Let the jury consider their verdict,\u2019 the King said, for about the twentieth time that day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-6\">\u201c \u2018No, no!\u2019 said the Queen. \u2018Sentence first\u2014verdict afterwards.\u2019 \u201d (Carroll, Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland (1865) ch. XII, Alice\u2019s Evidence.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">(4) <em>Legislative enactment of a felony convictions exception to the requirement of pleading and proof at the preliminary hearing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">At the end of the Roaring Twenties, the Legislature enacted a statutory exception to the requirement of pleading and proof at the preliminary hearing so as to allow amendment of a pending information that fails to charge all of an accused\u2019s <em>felony </em>convictions. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 969a;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Stats. 1927, ch. 631, \u00a7 1, p. 1064.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>) The Legislature has not enacted an analogous statute for misdemeanor convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>Despite the absence of an analogous statute, the Attorney General argues public policy considerations require that the magistrate have the authority to hold an accused to answer even if the three \u201cseparate violations . . . which resulted in convictions\u201d of DUI do not yet exist. The Attorney General argues the absence of that authority would lead to the absurdity of \u201crewarding] a defendant who was able to accumulate DUI violations faster than our courts were able to process the cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">As if to intimate we might carve out a misdemeanor convictions exception to the requirement of pleading and proof at the preliminary hearing, the Attorney General argues footnote 9 in <em>Mendella </em>\u201ccarved out an exception for prior felony convictions\u201d from the \u201cbroad rule\u201d that enhancement allegations are subject to a Penal Code section 995 motion <em>(Mendella, supra, </em>33 Cal.3d at pp. 758-763): \u201cThe People are particularly concerned that they will be required to charge and prove prior convictions at the preliminary hearing stage. A specific statutory provision, however, permits amendment of the information and rearraignment of the defendant \u2018Whenever it shall be discovered that a pending indictment or information does not charge all prior felonies of which the defendant has been convicted . . . .\u2019 (Pen. Code, \u00a7 969a . . . .) Nothing in this opinion is intended to question this statutorily authorized procedure.\u201d <em>(Mendella, supra, </em>33 Cal.3d at p. 764, fn. 9, italics omitted, boldface added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">Quite to the contrary, footnote 9 in <em>Mendella </em>simply took note of the role Penal Code section 969a has played since 1927 in the constitutional and statutory framework for charging a felony by information. The Supreme Court carved out no exception there.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">The Attorney General argues <em>People v. Shaw </em>(1986) 182 Cal.App.3d 682 [227 Cal.Rptr. 378] differentiated between enhancements like GBI that are transactionally related to the charged offense and enhancements like convictions that are not. In reliance on Penal Code section 969a and on footnote 9 in <em>Mendella, Shaw </em>held <em>\u201cMendella </em>does not mandate proof of a prior felony conviction at the preliminary hearing as a precondition to its later charge and proof at trial.\u201d <em>(People v.

The opinion held in the negative, finding no persuasive reason Why Penal Code section 969a should not apply to a three strikes case. <em>(Miranda v. Superior Court, supra, </em>at p. 909.) <em>Miranda's </em>reliance on Penal Code section 969a, like <em>Shaw's, </em>makes the case inapposite to the question on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">(5) <em>Absence of a misdemeanor convictions exception to the requirement of pleading and proof at the preliminary hearing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">The Attorney General admits Penal Code section 969a creates an exception only for felony convictions but nonetheless argues \u201cstrict adherence\u201d to that statute \u201cwould yield absurd results,\u201d and section 23550 \u201cshould not turn on such fortuitous circumstances as the classification of pending cases as felonies or misdemeanors.\u201d Nowhere in section 23550 do we find a legislative intent even vaguely validating that argument.  \u201c[I]t should not be presumed that the legislative body intends to overthrow long-established principles of law unless such intention is made clearly to appear either by express declaration or by necessary implication.\u201d <em>(People v. Davenport </em>(1985) 41 Cal.3d 247, 266 [221 Cal.Rptr. 794, 710 P.2d 861], superseded by statute on another ground as stated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Crittenden </em>(1994) 9 Cal.4th 83, 140 and fn. 14 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 474, 885 P.2d 887].)</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">The statutory language that creates another enhancement is corroborative. As section 23550 authorizes felony punishment for a person who is \u201cconvicted\u201d of a new violation of section 23152 and who has three \u201cseparate violations . . . which resulted in convictions\u201d of DUI, so Penal Code section 12022.7 authorizes an additional three-year sentence for a person who is \u201cconvicted\u201d of a new felony and who inflicts GBI.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Attorney General argues the opening words of section 23550\u2014\u201cIf any person is convicted of a violation of Section 23152\u201d\u2014show \u201cthe time at which to inquire about any other convictions is the point at which the defendant is convicted, and not earlier,\u201d but the analogous argument that the time at which to inquire about GBI is \u201cthe point at which the defendant is convicted, and not earlier,\u201d would lead to absurdities like separate pleading and proof of that enhancement and a separate trial on that enhancement. (Cf. <em>Mendella, supra, </em>33 Cal.3d at pp. 758-763.)</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>We respect the legislative intent that if similar statutes have similar language the meaning of that language is the same. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wells </em>(1996) 12 Cal.4th 979, 985 [50 Cal.Rptr.2d 699, 911 P.2d 1374].) \u201cWe must select the construction that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the Legislature, with a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute, and avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jenkins </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 234, 246 [40 Cal.Rptr.2d 903, 893 P.2d 1224].)</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">That the Legislature has not enacted an analogous statute for misdemeanor convictions in the three-fourths of a century since the enactment of Penal Code section 969a could stem from the intrinsic conceptual intricacy of that task. The Attorney General argues that \u201cthe time at which to inquire about any other convictions is the point at which the defendant is convicted, and not earlier,\u201d but \u201c[d]ue process of law requires that an accused be advised of the charges against him in order that he may have a reasonable opportunity to prepare and present his defense and not be taken by surprise by evidence offered at his trial.\u201d <em>(In re Hess </em>(1955) 45 Cal.2d 171, 175 [288 P.2d 5]; see <em>In re Oliver </em>(1948) 333 U.S. 257, 273 [68 S.Ct. 499, 507-508, 92 L.Ed. 682]; 4 Witkin &amp; Epstein, Cal. Criminal Law, <em>supra, </em>Pretrial Proceedings, \u00a7 <em>111, </em>p. 382.) To comport with due process, the Attorney General\u2019s argument implies that after a finding of guilt of a fourth DUI, a separate trial is necessary on the three \u201cseparate violations . . . which resulted in convictions\u201d of DUI.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">Yet do the opening words of section 23550\u2014\u201cIf any person is convicted of a violation of Section 23152\u201d\u2014manifest a legislative intent to create a hybrid offense for which an accused could be guilty of a fourth DUI at a misdemeanor trial but be lawfully subject to a felony sentence if a trier of fact at a separate trial were later to find true three \u201cseparate violations . . . which resulted in convictions\u201d of DUI? A sea change like that in the criminal law could hardly make its way through the Legislature without copious comment from legislative committees, the Legislative Counsel, the Legislative Analyst, and criminal justice professionals. The Attorney General cites none.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">Or do the opening words of the statute manifest a legislative intent to take an accused to trial on a felony charge without pleading and proof of the three \u201cseparate violations . . . which resulted in convictions\u201d of DUI without which, of course, there simply is no felony? The Attorney General so intimates by stating \u201c[t]he issue on appeal is whether driving under the influence . . . can be charged as a felony when the third violation is still pending at the time the fourth is committed.\u201d Yet on the concomitant due process issue\u2014whether the criminal justice system can subject a person to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>the rigors of a felony trial before affording any opportunity to inquire whether the conditions precedent to felony prosecution and punishment even exist\u2014the Attorney General is silent. We do not infer from the opening words of the statute any legislative intent to so transform the criminal justice system.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">In passing, <em>Miranda </em>intimated that statutes like former section 23175 and petty theft with a prior require pleading and proof at the preliminary hearing of misdemeanor convictions. <em>(Miranda v. Superior Court, supra, </em>38 Cal.App.4th at pp. 907-908; Pen. Code, \u00a7 666.) In another case, the Court of Appeal noted, with the parties in agreement, that \u201cas a matter of procedural necessity the People must adduce evidence at the preliminary hearing of prior convictions that serve to elevate a charged offense from a misdemeanor to a felony.\u201d <em>(Thompson </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 144, 149-150 [110 Cal.Rptr.2d 89].) \u201cAlthough prior convictions alleged pursuant to such statutes are neither elements of the charged offenses [citations], nor directly or transactionally related to the charged offense, proof of the prior conviction is required so that the parties and the court may know whether to treat the charged offense as a misdemeanor or a felony.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 150.) We agree, but we are aware of no case that squarely so holds. Nor do the parties cite us to one.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Section 23550 does not, of course, expressly require pleading and proof at the preliminary hearing of three \u201cseparate violations . . . which resulted in convictions\u201d of DUI. Nonetheless, \u201ca pleading and proof requirement <em>should </em>be implied as a matter of statutory interpretation and <em>must </em>be implied as a matter of due process.\u201d <em>(People v. Hernandez </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 194,197 [249 Cal.Rptr. 850, 757 P.2d 1013], italics added, superseded by statute on another point as noted in <em>People v. Rayford </em>(1994) 9 Cal.4th 1, 8-9 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 317, 884 P.2d 1369], and disapproved on another ground in <em>People v.

Guerrero </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 343, 347-349 [243 Cal.Rptr. 688, 748 P.2d 1150], as stated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Burton </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 843, 863 [258 Cal.Rptr. 184, 771 P.2d 1270]; 3 Witkin &amp; Epstein, Cal.

I, \u00a7 14 (former \u00a7 8).)</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">We are sympathetic with the Attorney General\u2019s concern that \u201ca defendant should not benefit by committing DUI violations faster than his convictions can be processed by the courts.\u201d The Legislature has responded to that concern by enacting section 23550 to permit felony punishment of a fourth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>DUI \u201cregardless of the order in which the offenses were committed and the convictions obtained.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Snook, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 1213.) If an accused with fewer than three \u201cseparate violations . . . which resulted in convictions\u201d of DUI attains that number after the filing of a misdemeanor DUI complaint, amendment of the complaint to charge a felony is permissible. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Snook, supra, </em>at pp. 1213-1214; 2 Witkin &amp; Epstein, Cal. Criminal Law, <em>supra, </em>Crimes Against Public Peace and Welfare, \u00a7 225, pp. 770-771.) If the Legislature were to choose to address the Attorney General\u2019s concern in other ways, that is the branch of government with the authority to initiate the necessary enactments, constitutional or statutory or both.
