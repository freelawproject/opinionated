Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b785-9\">In 1994, Charles T. Black<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Corinne E. Black (the Blacks), then 68 and 67 years of age respectively, entered into a reverse mortgage with Freedom Investment Fund, Inc. (Freedom Investment), using their home as the basis for the mortgage. In 1998, the Blacks, as trustees for the Charles T. Black and Corinne E. Black Trust Agreement, brought this action against Freedom Investment and a host of other corporations, companies and individuals, alleging that the manner of their marketing of the reverse mortgage violated various state laws. The defendants moved for summary judgment, arguing that the Blacks\u2019 claims were preempted by three federal statutes and their implementing regulations: the Alternative Mortgage Transaction Parity Act of 1982 (the Parity Act) (12 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3801-3806), the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) (Pub.L. No. 90-321, \u00a7 101 (May 29, 1968) 82 Stat. 146; see also 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1601-1667f) and the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980 (DIDMCA) (Pub.L. No. 96-221, \u00a7 1 (Mar. 31, 1980) 94 Stat. 132 (codified as amended in scattered sections of 12 U.S.C. &amp; 15 U.S.C.)). The trial court granted the motion. This appeal followed. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-10\">II. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b785-11\">A. <em>Reverse Mortgages</em></p>\n<p id=\"b785-12\">Reverse mortgages have been described as a financial planning device for the elderly who are often \u201chouse rich, but cash poor.\u201d (See Hammond, <em>Reverse Mortgages: A Financial Planning Device for the Elderly </em>(1993) 1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>Elder LJ. 75, 76 (hereafter Hammond).) A reverse mortgage can address this dilemma by providing a means for converting home equity into cash. <em>(Ibid.) </em>In a reverse mortgage, as in a conventional mortgage, the mortgagee or lender advances money to the borrower or mortgagor. However, in a reverse mortgage the borrower is often times not obligated to repay any portion of the loan or the interest on the loan amount until the property is sold, the loan matures or the borrower dies or experiences an extended absence from the premises. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 86; see also 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1602(bb).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>) The interest on the borrowed sums is added to the principal loan amount and the lender acquires a lien against the house in the amount of the initial principal and accumulated interest. (Hammond, <em>supra, </em>1 Elder L.J. at p. 86.)</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">B. <em>The Blacks\u2019 Reverse Mortgage</em></p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">On March 28, 1994, the Blacks entered into a reverse mortgage with Freedom Investment, a nonfederally chartered lender, secured by a deed of trust on their home, then valued at $1,060,000. Pursuant to this transaction, the Blacks received $305,455 and Freedom Investment received an interest equal to 70.75 percent of the \u201cmaturity value\u201d of the mortgaged property.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> From the $305,455 that the Blacks borrowed, they paid $11,249.89 as a loan origination fee and $5,583.47 in other fees, taxes and expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">The loan amount of $305,455 was calculated as the present value of $749,950 (representing 70.75 percent of the value of the Blacks\u2019 home) using a 3.75 percent discount rate over a period of 24.4 years (the Blacks\u2019 joint life expectancy). In other words, $305,455 brought forward with 3.75 percent interest for each year of the Blacks\u2019 joint life expectancy should equal $749,950.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b786-8\">The amount ultimately due on the loan, however, would most likely exceed $749,950. If the home appreciated in value, Freedom Investment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>acquired an interest in a portion of that appreciation, thus increasing the amount ultimately due on the loan and simultaneously increasing the interest rate on the initial borrowed sum.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">Moreover, the interest rate was 3.75 percent only if one of the Blacks survived for the length of their joint life expectancy of 24.4 years and continued to reside at their house. However, if they did not, the effective interest rate would exceed 3.75 percent because the Blacks\u2019 liability was 70.75 percent of the maturity value of their home regardless of the actual duration of the mortgage (subject to a limited exception).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">C. <em>The Annuity</em></p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">The Blacks used $178,333.33 of the loan proceeds to purchase an annuity from the Union Labor Life Insurance Company (Union Labor Life), the terms of which provided for monthly payments of $1,701.30 for life provided that the Blacks made a second payment on the annuity four years later in the amount of $105,926.48. If the Blacks failed to make the second payment, the monthly annuity benefit was reduced to $719.58. The Blacks apparently did not make this second payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-8\">D. <em>This Litigation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b787-9\">1. <em>The parties</em></p>\n<p id=\"b787-10\">The Blacks filed this action against 15 defendants.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Blacks contend, without citation to the record, that they dismissed their complaint as to five defendants and took the defaults of four defendants, including Freedom Investment. The defendants that allegedly remained thereafter, and which are the respondents herein, are ULLICO, Inc., MRCo, Inc., Union Labor Life, Financial Freedom Senior Funding Corporation (Financial Freedom Senior Funding), Beverly Mirtle, and James R. Mahoney. The complaint alleges an intricate relationship between the corporate respondents and Freedom Investment and concludes that the individuality and separateness of these entities ceased and that they should not be permitted to adhere to the fiction of their separate existence. As to the individual respondents, the complaint alleges that Mirtle was a salesperson for Freedom Investment and Mahoney the executive vice-president of Financial Freedom Senior Funding.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>2. <em>The allegations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">The Blacks\u2019 complaint includes causes of action for elder abuse (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 15600 et seq.), unlawful business practices (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17200),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> fraudulent concealment and negligent misrepresentation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The complaint generally alleges that respondents used \u201cdeceptive advertising [and] misleading transactional documents\u201d and that the reverse mortgage was \u201cwritten in a manner which was designed to disorient, confuse, and upset the average homeowner . . . .\u201d The complaint identifies the following representations as false and misleading: (1) assurances of uninterrupted monthly annuity income, (2) guarantees of the highest monthly payments and the lowest fees and expenses of any home equity conversion plan being offered, and (3) promises of no prepayment charge and the preservation for the Blacks of 25 percent of the home\u2019s future value. The complaint also alleges that Freedom Investment used an unreasonably low projection of home appreciation for its illustrations and inaccurately described the tax characterization of the reverse mortgage transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">Another component of the complaint is its allegation that Freedom Investment did not advise the Blacks that they would effectively be prepaying interest inasmuch as Freedom Investment immediately acquired a 70.75 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>percent interest in the home even though the amount disbursed to the Blacks was a much smaller amount.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">3. <em>The motion for summary judgment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">Respondents moved for summary judgment solely on the ground that the Parity Act, DIDMCA, TILA and their related regulations preempted the Blacks\u2019 causes of action.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Blacks opposed the motion and interjected numerous objections to the evidence on which the motion relied. The trial court granted the motion, concluding that federal law preempted the subject matter of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">m. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b789-8\">A. <em>General Principles of Preemption</em></p>\n<p id=\"b789-9\">The supremacy clause of the United States Constitution (art. VI, cl. 2) grants Congress the power to preempt state law. <em>(Crosby </em>v. <em>National Foreign Trade Council </em>(2000) 530 U.S. 363, 372 [120 S.Ct. 2288, 2293, 147 L.Ed.2d 352].) \u201cWhether federal law preempts state law is fundamentally a question whether Congress has intended such a result. [Citations.] HQ The \u2018starting presumption\u2019 is that Congress has not so intended. [Citations.] [f] Preemption of state law by federal law is found in \u2018three circumstances.\u2019 [Citations.] HQ First, there is so-called \u2018express preemption\u2019: \u2018Congress can define explicitly the extent to which its enactments pre-empt state law.\u2019 [Citations.] HQ Second, there is so-called \u2018field preemption\u2019: \u2018[S]tate law is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>pre-empted where it regulates conduct in a field that Congress intended the Federal Government to occupy exclusively.\u2019 [Citations.] HQ Third, there is so-called \u2018conflict preemption\u2019: \u2018[S]tate law is pre-empted to the extent that it actually conflicts with federal law.\u2019 [Citations.] Such conflict must be \u2018of substance and not merely trivial or insubstantial.\u2019 [Citation.] It exists when it is \u2018impossible ... to comply with both state and federal requirements\u2019 [citations] or when state law \u2018stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives\u2019 underlying federal law [citations]. Although \u2018state law is pre-empted to the extent that it actually conflicts with federal law\u2019 [citation], it is preempted only to that extent and no further [citation].\u201d <em>(Peatros v. Bank of America </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 147, 157-158 [91 Cal.Rptr.2d 659, 990 P.2d 539].)</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">\u201cFederal regulations have no less pre-emptive effect than federal statutes.\u201d <em>(Fidelity Federal Sav. &amp; Loan Assn. </em>v. <em>de la Cuesta </em>(1982) 458 U.S. 141, 153 [102 S.Ct. 3014, 3022, 73 L.Ed.2d 664].) An agency may preempt state law through regulations that are within the scope of its statutory authority and that are not arbitrary. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 153-154 [102 S.Ct. at pp. 3022-3023].)</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">Regardless of whether the alleged preemption arises by statute or by regulation, courts are reluctant to infer preemption in ambiguous cases. (See <em>Maryland v. Louisiana </em>(1981) 451 U.S. 725, 746 [101 S.Ct. 2114, 2128-2129, 68 L.Ed.2d 576]; <em>Elsworth </em>v. <em>Beech Aircraft Corp. </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 540, 548 [208 Cal.Rptr. 874, 691 P.2d 630] <em>(Elsworth); </em>Tribe, American Constitutional Law (3d ed. 2000) \u00a7 6-28, p. 1175.) It is, therefore, \u201cthe burden of the party claiming that Congress intended to preempt state law to prove it\u201d <em>(Elsworth, supra, </em>37 Cal.3d at p. 548). Particularly in an area of law traditionally occupied by the states, such as the exercise of a state\u2019s police powers, \u201cCongress\u2019s intent to preempt must be \u2018clear and manifest\u2019 to preempt state law .... [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Spielholz v. Superior Court </em>(2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 1366, 1371-1372 [104 Cal.Rptr.2d 197] <em>(Spieholz).) </em>Laws concerning consumer protection, including laws prohibiting false advertising and unfair business practices, are included within the states\u2019 police power, and are thus subject to this heightened presumption against preemption. (See <em>California </em>v. <em>ARC America Corp. </em>(1989) 490 U.S. 93, 101 [109 S.Ct. 1661, 1665, 104 L.Ed.2d 86] [unfair business practices]; <em>Smiley v.

The Parity Act is one of those three statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">Congress enacted the Parity Act in 1982 after finding that \u201cincreasingly volatile and dynamic changes in interest rates\u201d had \u201cseriously impaired the ability of housing creditors to provide consumers with fixed-term, fixed-rate credit secured by interests in real property . . . .\u201d (12 U.S.C. \u00a7 3801(a)(1); see also Pub.L. No. 97-320, \u00a7 802 (Oct. 15, 1982) 96 Stat. 1545.) Congress concluded that the availability of loans other than traditional fixed-rate, fixed-term transactions was essential to an adequate supply of loans secured by residential property (12 U.S.C. \u00a7 3801(a)(2), 3802(1)) and that federally chartered depository institutions had already been given permission to engage in such alternative mortgage financing (12 U.S.C. \u00a7 3801(a)(3)).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-8\">In light of these findings, Congress enacted the Parity Act \u201cto eliminate the discriminatory impact that . . . regulations [authorizing federal institutions to engage in alternative mortgage financing] have upon nonfederally chartered housing creditors and provide them with parity with federally chartered institutions by authorizing all housing creditors to make, purchase, and enforce alternative mortgage transactions so long as the transactions are in conformity with the regulations issued by the Federal agencies.\u201d (12 U.S.C. \u00a7 3801(b).)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b791-9\">The substance of the Parity Act is found in title 12 United States Code section 3803, which provides in relevant part as follows; \u201cIn order to prevent discrimination against State-chartered depository institutions, and other non-federally chartered housing creditors, with respect to making . . . alternative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>mortgage transactions, housing creditors may make . . . alternative mortgage transactions, except that this section shall apply\u2014 HQ (1) with respect to banks, only to [transactions made in accordance with certain regulations issued by the Comptroller of the Currency]; HQ (2) with respect to credit unions, only to [transactions made in accordance with other regulations issued by the National Credit Union Administration Board]; HQ (3) with respect to all other housing creditors . . . only to transactions made in accordance with regulations governing alternative mortgage transactions as issued by the Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision for federally chartered savings and loan associations, to the extent that such regulations are authorized by rulemaking authority granted to the Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision with regard to federally chartered savings and loan associations under laws other than this section.\u201d (12 U.S.C. \u00a7 3803(a).)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> On the subject of preemption, the Parity Act provides that \u201c[a]n alternative mortgage transaction may be made by a housing creditor in accordance with this section, notwithstanding any State constitution, law, or regulation.\u201d (12 U.S.C. \u00a7 3803(c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">A note to the statute that created the Parity Act directed \u201cthe Comptroller of the Currency, the National Credit Union Administration,\u201d and the predecessor to the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS), the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (see <em>United States v. Gaubert </em>(1991) 499 U.S. 315, 317-318, fn. 1 [111 S.Ct. 1267, 1271, 113 L.Ed.2d 335]), to \u201cidentify, describe, and publish those portions or provisions of their respective regulations that are inappropriate for (and thus inapplicable to), or that need to be conformed for the use of, the nonfederally chartered housing creditors to which their respective regulations apply . . . .\u201d (Pub.L. No. 97-320, \u00a7 807(b) (Oct. 15, 1982) 96 Stat. 1545). The OTS\u2019s current response to the note\u2019s instruction appears in 12 Code of Federal Regulations part 560.220 (part or section 560.220) and is as follows: \u201cPursuant to 12 U.S.C. 3803, housing creditors . . . may make alternative mortgage transactions as defined by that section and further defined and described by applicable regulations identified in this section, notwithstanding any state constitution, law, or regulation.

Respondents argue that part 560.220 does not define the scope of preemption. They instead rely on title 12 United States Code section 3803(c) and the purpose of the Parity Act to argue that nonfederally chartered institutions should enjoy the same preemption of state claims that federally chartered institutions receive under the statute applicable to them\u2014the Home Owners\u2019 Loan Act of 1933, 12 United States Code section 1461 et seq. (HOLA). According to respondents, preemption under HOLA is broad enough to preclude the Blacks\u2019 claims had they been brought against federal institutions and that the Parity Act extended to state-chartered housing creditors that same protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">3. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b793-8\">We begin by considering whether the Parity Act expressly preempts claims such as the ones presented in this case. The Parity Act permits an alternative mortgage transaction to be made by a housing creditor \u201cin accordance with [12 United States Code section 3803,] notwithstanding any State constitution, law or regulation.\u201d (12 U.S.C. \u00a7 3803(c); see also 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 560.220.) Transactions that are \u201cin accordance with\u201d section 3803 are those that are made \u201cin accordance with regulations governing alternative mortgage transactions as issued by the Director of the [OTS] for federally chartered savings and loan associations . . . .\u201d (12 U.S.C. \u00a7 3803(a)(3).) Had that language been included expressly in the preemption provision rather than by inference only, the provision would have read: an alternative mortgage transaction may be made by a housing creditor in accordance with regulations governing alternative mortgage transactions as issued by the Director of the OTS for federally chartered savings and loan associations, notwithstanding any state constitution, law or regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>This language is susceptible to at least two interpretations. On one hand, the phrase \u201cstate constitution, law, or regulation\u201d is modified with the adjective \u201cany,\u201d supporting the argument that the preemption provision precludes all state regulation of alternative mortgage transactions involving state-chartered housing creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">On the other hand, the phrase \u201cany state constitution, law, or regulation\u201d can be interpreted as implicitly limited to those that prohibit or impede alternative mortgage transactions or that <em>conflict </em>with federal regulations deemed applicable to nonfederally chartered housing creditors, i.e., the regulations that the transaction must be made \u201cin accordance with.\u201d This interpretation would leave broad room for state regulation because there are only four federal regulations with which the transactions of housing creditors must comply. (See \u00a7 560.220.)</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">Other provisions of the Parity Act support the latter interpretation. The Parity Act requires housing creditors to be \u201clicensed under applicable State law\u201d and \u201csubject to the applicable regulatory requirements and enforcement mechanisms provided by State law.\u201d (12 U.S.C. \u00a7 3802(2).) Here, for example, certain housing creditors in California are required to be licensed under the California Finance Lenders Law (see Fin. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 22000, 22100, [requiring license for finance lenders], 22009 [defining finance lenders as including persons engaged in the business of making consumer loans], 22203 [defining consumer loan as including certain loans secured by real property]). That law establishes permissible charges and fees on loans (Fin. Code, \u00a7 22306), prohibits false, misleading or deceptive statements (Fin. Code, \u00a7 22161), and provides that unconscionable loans violate the statute (Fin. Code, \u00a7 22302). When Congress enacted the Parity Act, it was surely aware that such forms of state regulation then existed or, at least, could come into existence in the future because it had no control over the changes and developments that states could subsequently make to their regulatory schemes. Given the breadth accorded the states in regulating \u201chousing creditors\u201d in 12 United States Code section 3802, the preemption language of 12 United States Code section 3803(c) can certainly be interpreted as not extending to state laws that concern aspects of those transactions other than those addressed by the four applicable federal regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">However, we need not conclude that this is the only reasonable interpretation of the Parity Act\u2019s preemption language in order to reject express preemption in this case. \u201cAs is always the case in our pre-emption jurisprudence, where \u2018federal law is said to bar state action in fields of traditional state regulation, ... we have worked on the \u201cassumption that the historic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>police powers of the States were not to be superseded by the Federal Act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(California Div. of Labor Standards Enforcement v. Dillingham Constr. N.A., Inc. </em>(1997) 519 U.S. 316, 325 [117 S.Ct. 832, 838, 136 L.Ed.2d 791], quoting <em>Rice v.

Co. </em>v. <em>Kalo Brick &amp; Tile Co. </em>(1981) 450 U.S. 311, 317 [101 S.Ct. 1124, 1130, 67 L.Ed.2d 258] [\u201cPreemption of state law by federal statute or regulation is not favored \u2018in the absence of persuasive reasons\u2014either that the nature of the regulated subject matter permits no other conclusion, or that the Congress has <em>unmistakably so </em>ordained.\u2019 \u201d (Italics added)]; <em>Elsworth, supra, </em>37 Cal.3d at p. 548 [\u201cCourts are reluctant to infer preemption, and it is the burden of the party claiming that Congress intended to preempt state law to prove it.\u201d].) As our analysis has illustrated, the preemption language of the Parity Act does not contain a clear manifestation of congressional intent to preempt all state laws concerning the terms and marketing of alternative mortgage transactions. Absent such clear manifestation, the Parity Act does not expressly preempt claims such as those brought by the Blacks in . this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">The Parity Act and part 560.220 do not impliedly preempt the Blacks\u2019 claims either. The regulations deemed applicable to nonfederally chartered housing creditors are so limited in number as to be insufficient to occupy the field (see \u00a7 560.220). (Cf. <em>ITEL Containers Int\u2019l Corp. </em>v. <em>Huddleston </em>(1993) 507 U.S. 60, 70-71 [113 S.Ct. 1095, 1102, 122 L.Ed.2d 421] [concluding the federal regulatory scheme at issue in that case was not sufficiently pervasive to occupy the field].)</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">The last form of preemption is conflict preemption. This form of preemption can exist through direct conflict, which respondents do not contend exists here, or when state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress, which respondents contend will occur here. (See <em>Spielholz, supra, </em>86 Cal.App.4th at p. 1371.) Whether state law creates such an obstacle turns on Congress\u2019s purposes and objectives in enacting the Parity Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">Congress expressly stated that the purpose of the Parity Act was to \u201celiminate the discriminatory impact that those regulations have upon non-federally chartered housing creditors\u201d and to provide nonfederally chartered housing creditors \u201cwith parity with federally chartered institutions by authorizing all housing creditors to make, purchase, and enforce alternative mortgage transactions so long as the transactions are in conformity with the regulations issued by the Federal agencies.\u201d (12 U.S.C. \u00a7 3801(b).) Respondents argue that this language indicates that the purpose of the Parity Act is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>the achievement of absolute parity with federally chartered lending institutions. Thus, if those entities enjoy complete preemption of state regulation of their transactions, so should state-chartered lending institutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">We are not persuaded by respondents\u2019 expansive view of Congress\u2019s purpose in enacting the Parity Act. Of course, absolute parity would achieve the results that Congress sought, but so would much less, such as simply authorizing nonfederally chartered housing creditors to engage in alternative mortgage financing. The statute as a whole, in particular the permission retained by the states to regulate housing creditors (see 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 3802(2)), counsels against respondents\u2019 generous interpretation of congressional purpose, an interpretation that would permit nonfederally chartered housing creditors to present information to borrowers in a misleading, distorted or even inaccurate fashion with impunity because of the lack of <em>federal </em>regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">For similar reasons, respondents\u2019 contention that the goal of the Parity Act is national uniformity in the regulation of state-chartered housing lenders with respect to alternative mortgage transactions is also flawed. Given the dearth of applicable federal regulations, the national uniform standard for state-chartered housing lenders would be \u201canything goes.\u201d That is hardly a uniform standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">Moreover, different treatment of federally and nonfederally chartered housing creditors is reasonable given that they are very differently situated. \u201c[Sjavings associations are subject to a comprehensive regime of regular examination, supervision, and enforcement to determine their compliance with applicable laws and regulations[,]\u201d while \u201c[n]on-depository institution state housing creditors are not.\u201d (65 Fed.Reg. 17811, 17816 (Apr. 5, 2000).)</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">This distinction is significant. For example, in <em>Spitz v. Goldome Realty Credit Corp. </em>(1991) 210 Ill.App.3d 215 [155 Ill.Dec 43, 569 N.E.2d 43], affirmed (1992) 151 IU.2d 71 [175 Ill.Dec 727, 600 N.E.2d 1185], the court considered whether HOLA preempted an Illinois statute upon which the plaintiff relied in suing a subsidiary service corporation of a federal savings association. (569 N.E.2d at p. 45.) In that case \u201c[t]here [was] no question that the doctrine of preemption applie[d] with respect to the parent corporation [citation]; nor [did] the parties dispute that there [was] exclusive federal regulation of federally chartered savings associations and that the Bank Board ha[d] the exclusive and plenary power to \u2018regulate all the aspects of the operations of Federal associations.\u2019 [Citation.] At issue [was] whether the preemption that applie[d] to the parent federal savings associations [was] applicable to the state chartered subsidiary service corporation.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 46.)</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>The court concluded that service corporations did not enjoy the same broad preemption of state law as their federally chartered parent organizations, reasoning as follows: \u201c[N]either Congress nor the Bank Board has attempted to set forth a comprehensive regulatory scheme for service corporations as they did for their federally chartered parent associations. Recognizing the lack of such a comprehensive scheme, it is difficult to conceive that Congress and the Bank Board would only regulate the home mortgage activities of service corporations in selected areas if they did not intend to subject these entities to additional state regulation. An intent to preempt without providing a comprehensive regulatory scheme could lead to the intolerable result of permitting service corporations to perform lending activities, which are traditionally highly regulated, unfettered by <em>any </em>regulation.\u201d <em>(Spitz v. Goldome Realty, supra, </em>569 N.E.2d at p. 48; see also <em>Spitz </em>v. <em>Goldome Realty, supra, </em>600 N.E.2d at p. 1187 [\u201cAlthough service corporations are regulated by the Bank Board, they are not regulated to the same extent as federal associations.\u201d].) Similarly, here, it would be odd indeed to provide to nonfederally chartered housing creditors, entities that are subject to little federal regulation, the same relief from state regulation that HOLA affords heavily regulated federally chartered institutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">We reject respondents\u2019 interpretation of congressional purpose and conclude that Congress sought to permit nonfederally chartered housing creditors to engage in alternative mortgage financing so long as they complied with applicable federal regulations. Permitting the Blacks to pursue their claims does not stand as an obstacle to that purpose. The Blacks\u2019 complaint challenges the adequacy and completeness of disclosures and representations regarding the reverse mortgage. These claims do not seek to prohibit or impede the making of alternative mortgage transactions that comport with the applicable federal regulations; they simply require adequate disclosures. Nor do their claims tread on the areas of federal regulation applicable to nonfederally chartered housing creditors, namely, late charges, prepayments and prepayment penalties, loan adjustments, and disclosures for variable rate transactions. (See \u00a7 560.220.) Conflict preemption simply does not apply in this instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">Our conclusion that the Parity Act does not expressly, impliedly or through conflict preempt the Blacks\u2019 claims is consistent with the OTS\u2019s interpretation of the preemptive scope of part 560.220.  We defer to a federal agency\u2019s construction of its own regulations and the statute it is charged to administer. (See <em>Udall </em>v. <em>Tollman </em>(1965) 380 U.S. 1, 16-17 [85 S.Ct. 792, 801, 13 L.Ed.2d 616].)  Last year, the Director of OTS issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking in which she explained that \u201c[t]he Parity Act . . . authorizes housing creditors to make alternative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>mortgage loans as long as the transactions are \u2018in accordance with\u2019 appropriate and applicable OTS regulations. The Act does not grant housing creditors the same powers as federal savings associations outside of the context of alternative mortgage transactions. Even within that context, state law governs those aspects of a housing creditor\u2019s operations not covered by regulations designated as applicable to alternative mortgage transactions under the Parity Act. The limited role the Parity Act plays in the overall regulation of housing creditors has not always been clearly understood.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> (65 Fed.Reg., <em>supra, </em>at pp. 17815-17816.)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">Respondents contend that <em>National Home Equity Mortg. Ass\u2019n v. Face </em>(4th Cir. 2001) 239 F.3d 633 <em>(Face) </em>and <em>Shinn v. Encore Mortg. Services, Inc. </em>(D.N.J. 2000) 96 F.Supp.2d 419 <em>(Shinn) </em>support their preemption argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">The <em>Face </em>decision does not provide us much assistance because the case concerned the preemption of a state law limiting prepayment fees (see <em>Face, supra, </em>239 F.3d at p. 635), a subject addressed in a federal regulation specifically identified in part 560.220 as applicable to nonfederally chartered housing creditors. That regulation permits prepayment fees so long as they are agreed to in the loan agreement. (See <em>Face, supra, </em>239 F.3d at p. 639.) Thus, conflict preemption was manifest. The state sought to avoid this result by arguing that the Parity Act does not preclude states from regulating areas that are not peculiar to alternative mortgage transactions, that is, that apply to common traditional fixed-rate, fixed-term transactions as well as alternative mortgage transactions. <em>(Face, supra, </em>239 F.3d at p. 636.) The court concluded that the regulation of prepayment penalties was within the regulation of alternative mortgage transactions and that the Parity Act therefore preempted the state law limiting prepayment fees. <em>(Face, supra, </em>239 F.3d at pp. 638, 640.)</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">The <em>Face </em>decision also opines, however, that part 560.220 \u201cis not a provision that defines the scope of federal preemption. Rather, it defines the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>gate through which the non-federally chartered housing creditors must pass in order to obtain the benefits of the Parity Act. If a state lender conforms to the regulations listed in the regulation implementing \u00a7 807(b) [\u00a7 560.220], then it will enjoy the preemptive protection that the Act grants in 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 3803(c).\u201d <em>(Face, supra, </em>239 F.3d at p. 640.) However, because the state law at issue in that case limited prepayment fees, a subject expressly covered by an applicable federal regulation, the court did not need to consider, as we must, the scope of \u201cthe preemptive protection that the Act grants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">Moreover, the framing of the question in the <em>Face </em>case demonstrates that that court did not reach a result contrary to the one we adopt here. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals explained: \u201cThe particular issue presented in this case is whether a non-federally chartered institution in Virginia may require and enforce a prepayment fee in a mortgage agreement notwithstanding Virginia\u2019s limitation on prepayment penalties as contained in Virginia Code \u00a7\u00a7 6.1-330.83 and 6.1-330.85. The resolution of this issue depends on whether the OTS has issued regulations authorizing prepayment fees as part of its regulations for alternative mortgage transactions, because if it has authorized the collection of prepayment fees in alternative mortgage transactions, then Virginia may not apply its law proscribing such prepayment fees if the non-federally chartered housing creditor has otherwise complied with the requirements of the Parity Act.\u201d <em>(Face, supra, </em>239 F.3d at p. 638.) Thus, the Fourth Circuit found it necessary to consider whether the Virginia statute conflicted with a federal regulation pertaining to alternative mortgage transactions. Here, we have no such conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\"><em>Shinn </em>is similarly uninstructive because it also considers whether the Parity Act preempts a state law prohibiting prepayment fees. <em>(Shinn, supra, </em>96 F.Supp.2d at p. 422.) The plaintiffs in <em>Shinn </em>argued that the Parity Act only preempts state laws that completely prohibit or obstruct the creation of alternative mortgage transactions. <em>(Shinn, supra, 96 </em>F.Supp.2d at p. 425.) The court concluded that the language of the statute did not \u201csupport plaintiffs\u2019 narrow interpretation of the statute\u2019s preemptive effect\u201d and concluded that New Jersey\u2019s prepayment law was preempted by the Parity Act. <em>(Shinn, supra, 96 </em>F.Supp.2d at pp. 425-426.)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">Here, the Blacks\u2019 claims relate to matters that are <em>not addressed </em>by the federal regulations that part 560.220 identifies as applying to nonfederally chartered housing creditors. Thus, <em>Face </em>and <em>Shinn, </em>cases considering preemption in that context, are inapposite and, for the reasons given above, we conclude that the Parity Act does not preempt the Blacks\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>C. <em>Alleged Preemption under TILA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">Respondents also contend that the Blacks\u2019 claims are. preempted by TILA. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">Clearly, there is no express preemption. Rather than limiting the applicability of state law, TILA emphasizes the continued role of state law, stating that it does \u201cnot annul, alter, or affect the laws of any State relating to the disclosure of information in connection with credit transactions, except to the extent that those law's are inconsistent with the provisions of this subchapter and then only to the extent of the inconsistency.\u201d (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1610(a)(1); see also 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1610(b) [\u201cexcept to the extent that those State laws are inconsistent with any provisions of section 1639 of this title, and then only to the extent of the inconsistency.\u201d].) A federal regulation implementing TILA explains, in relevant part, that \u201c[a] State law is inconsistent if it requires a creditor to make disclosures or take actions that contradict the requirements of the Federal law . . . [and] [a] State law is contradictory if it requires the use of the same term to represent a different amount or a different meaning than the Federal law, or it if requires the use of a term different from that required in the Federal law to describe the same item.\u201d (12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.28(a)(1) (2001).)</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">Respondents argue that a state law like Business and Professions Code section 17200 would impose subjective standards of \u201cunfairness,\u201d thus contradicting the requirements of federal law. Even if the disclosures provided to the Blacks met all of the requirements of TILA and its implementing regulations, which are known as Regulation Z (see 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226 (2001)), an inconsistency or contradiction with federal law does not exist merely because the state requires disclosures in <em>addition </em>to those required by and under TILA. (Cf. 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.28(a)(1); see also 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226, Supp. I\u2014Off. Staff Interpretation \u00a7 226.28(a)(3), p. 434 [\u201cGenerally, State law requirements that call for the disclosure of items of information not covered by the Federal law, or that require more detailed disclosures, do not contradict the Federal requirements.\u201d].) Respondents\u2019 vague assertions of a contradiction between state and federal law are insufficient to satisfy their burden of proving Congress\u2019s intent that TILA preempt claims such as those brought by the Blacks. (See <em>Elsworth, supra, </em>37 Cal.3d at p. 548.)</p>\n<p id=\"b800-8\">Respondents also rely on 12 Code of Federal Regulations part 226.28(a)(2)(i) (2001), which provides: \u201cState law requirements are inconsistent with the requirements contained in sections 161 (Correction of billing errors) or 162 (Regulation of credit reports) of the Act [(15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1666 or 1666a)] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>and the implementing provisions of this regulation and are preempted if they provide rights, responsibilities, or procedures for consumers or creditors that are different from those required by the Federal law.\u201d Respondents latch onto the word \u201cdifferent\u201d and argue that state laws that are merely \u201cdifferent\u201d from federal laws are preempted by TILA. But by its express terms, 12 Code of Federal Regulations part 226.28(a)'(2)(i) concerns correction of billing errors and regulation of credit reports, two aspects of lending that are not at issue here. Respondents have not established that TILA or its regulations expressly preempt the Blacks\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">Implied preemption has no application here either. TILA preempts only \u201cinconsistent\u201d state laws, thus implicitly negating occupation of the field. (See <em>Mason </em>v. <em>General Finance Corp. of Virginia </em>(4th Cir. 1976) 542 F.2d 1226, 1230.)</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">Nor does conflict preemption apply in this instance. As we have explained, respondents have not identified any direct conflict. Moreover, the purpose of TILA, relevant to this action, is the assurance of \u201ca meaningful disclosure of credit terms so that the consumer will be able to compare more readily the various credit terms available to him and avoid the uninformed use of credit. . . .\u201d (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1601(a).) Stated more generally, TELA is designed to protect consumers from inaccurate and unfair credit practices. (See <em>Fairley </em>v. <em>Turan-Foley Imports, Inc. </em>(5th Cir. 1995) 65 F.3d 475, 477.) The Blacks\u2019 claims advance this purpose, rather than thwart it.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">Our conclusion is consistent with decisions reached by federal courts. In <em>Williams </em>v. <em>First Government Mortg. &amp; Investors </em>(D.C. Cir. 1999) 176 F.3d 497, a borrower brought suit under the District of Columbia Consumer Protection Procedures Act (CPPA), alleging that the lender knowingly took advantage of his inability to protect his interests in the loan transaction and knowingly made him a loan he could not repay with any reasonable probability. <em>(Williams, supra, </em>176 F.3d at p. 498.) The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia rejected the argument that TILA preempted the borrower\u2019s CPPA claims. <em>(Williams, supra, </em>176 F.3d at pp. 499-500.) The court explained that TILA and CPPA \u201chave quite different purposes and impose quite different requirements. TELA mandates the disclosure of certain documents in lending transactions. [Citation.] The CPPA provides substantive protections for borrowers against unconscionable loan terms and provisions. [Citation.] Nothing in TELA or its legislative history suggests that Congress intended the Act\u2019s disclosure regime to provide the maximum protection to which borrowers are entitled nationwide; states <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>remain free to impose greater protections for borrowers. . . . We thus hold that TILA does not preempt the CPPA and that TILA compliance does not immunize lenders . . . against CPPA liability. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 500.)</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">The United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois reached a similar result in <em>Heastie </em>v. <em>Community Bank of Greater Peoria </em>(N.D.Ill. 1988) 690 F.Supp. 716 <em>(Heastie). </em>In that case, an elderly woman sued a mortgage company and mortgage lender under the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act (Consumer Fraud Act), alleging predatory lending practices, such as the use of misrepresentations in order to exact \u201coppressive\u201d finance charges in the refinancing of her home loan. (See <em>Heastie, supra, </em>690 F.Supp. at p. 717.) Defendants argued that TILA preempted the Consumer Fraud Act claim. <em>(Heastie, supra, </em>690 F.Supp. at p. 720.) The court rejected this argument, reasoning in part as follows: \u201cObviously, compliance with both the TILA and the Consumer Fraud Act is not a physical impossibility\u2014compliance with the TILA does not imply a violation of the Consumer Fraud Act. It also seems that the Consumer Fraud Act promotes rather than hinders the goals of the TILA. The Consumer Fraud Act prohibits, <em>inter alia, </em>\u2018deceptive practices [employed] in the conduct of any trade or commerce . . .\u2019 [citation], thereby promoting the TILA\u2019s goal of \u2018the informed use of credit,\u2019 [citation], in a range of conduct larger than that covered by the disclosure provisions in the TILA.\u201d <em>(Heastie, supra, </em>690 F.Supp. at p. 721.)</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">Consistent with these decisions and our own understanding of TILA and its implementing regulations, we conclude that TILA does not preempt the Blacks\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">D. <em>Alleged Preemption Under DIDMCA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b802-8\">Lastly, respondents contend that to the extent the Blacks claim that the loan origination fees, interest charges and the large cash advance fee were unfair and unconscionable, their claims are preempted. Respondents\u2019 motion for summary judgment similarly focused solely on the preemptive effect of DIDMCA on these limited aspects of the Blacks\u2019 claims. However, the Blacks concede that they do not challenge the fees or interest rates themselves. Given that respondents do not contend that DIDMCA preempts any other aspect of the Blacks\u2019 claims, we find no DIDMCA preemption on this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>IV.

The parties do not dispute that this definition includes reverse mortgage transactions. Their agreement appears reasonable inasmuch as alternative mortgage transactions include debts that can mature over an interval shorter than the amortization schedule and in which the lender shares in the equity and sometimes the appreciation in the mortgaged property. (See 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 3802(1)(B) &amp; (Q.) The Office of Thrift Supervision has also concluded that the Parity Act covers reverse mortgages.

(See 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 3804.) The OTS has concluded that California did not opt out of application of the Parity Act (see OTS, interpretative letter (May 3,1996) p. 6) and the parties do not argue otherwise.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b798-8\">Respondents urge us not to take judicial notice of this notice of proposed rulemaking.

We therefore reject respondents\u2019 argument and grant the Blacks\u2019 request to take judicial notice of portions of the Federal Register. In all other respects, we deny the Blacks\u2019 motion for judicial notice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b798-9\">Additionally, in 1997, an interpretative letter issued by the OTS similarly explained that under the Parity Act, \u201c[a]s long as the Company complies with the requirements of. . .

If OTS interprets the Parity Act as preempting all state restrictions, the use of the adjectives \u201cconflicting\u201d and \u201cinconsistent\u201d would have been unnecessary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b799-8\">Respondents also cite <em>First Gibraltar Bank, FSB </em>v. <em>Morales </em>(5th Cir. 1994) 19 F.3d 1032, but that decision has been vacated (see <em>First Gibraltar Bank, FSB </em>v. <em>Morales </em>(5th Cir. 1995) 42 F.3d 895).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
