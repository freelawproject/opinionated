J.</author>\n<p id=\"AT5\">Defendant William Joseph Garrett pled guilty to a residential burglary, a second degree burglary, and a vehicle theft all occurring in 1998, and the trial court found true five \u201cThree Strikes\u201d priors. The court sentenced defendant to 25 years to life in state prison on May 12, 2000, after the March 7, 2000 passage of Proposition 21 amended the definition of serious felony burglary, Penal Code section 1192.7, subdivision (c)(18)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (hereafter section 1192.7(c)(18)). On appeal, defendant asserts that his prior second degree residential burglaries were not strike priors under newly amended section 1192.7(c)(18).</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-8\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-9\">On March 30, 1998, someone entered the home of Aldo and Heidi Oliveri through a kitchen window (outside of which defendant\u2019s fingerprint was found) and took \u201ceverything.\u201d A fur coat, jewelry, two wallets containing cash, Social Security cards, credit cards, the main telephone with the answering machine, a camcorder and other electronic equipment, and \u201ca lot of my husband\u2019s technical equipment\u201d were taken. A month later, three stolen checks were forged and a phone card was used by a couple who had obtained the phone card from defendant. Defendant was charged with residential burglary (\u00a7\u00a7 459, 460, subd. (a)) in Santa Clara County Superior Court case No. 206612.</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-10\">On the morning of May 12, 1998, the director of the KinderCare Learning Center (KinderCare) found a side window of the building broken and a security bar removed from the door. Missing were KinderCare\u2019s computer system, credit card, ajar of quarters, several checks made out to KinderCare, diapers, food, and KinderCare\u2019s 1997 Ford van. Defendant was arrested while driving the van later the same day. The KinderCare gas card was found in a fanny pack in the van and the quarters were found in defendant\u2019s pocket. Defendant was charged in Santa Clara County Superior Court case No. 205682 with burglary (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 459, 460, subd. (b)) and vehicle theft (Veh. Code, \u00a7 10851, subd. (a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1421\">*1421</page-number>Both cases alleged five 1980 to 1982 prior residential burglary convictions under the Three Strikes law (\u00a7\u00a7 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12) and two prison priors (\u00a7 667.5, subd. (b)). The five \u201cserious felon[ies] and/or . . . violent felon[ies]\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12) were alleged as \u201cburglary of an inhabited dwelling house\u201d in Santa Clara County Superior Court case Nos. 80439, 76523, 85784, and 78076.</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-5\">Pursuant to a plea bargain, defendant pled guilty to all charges. The priors in case No. 205682 were dismissed. At a court trial, all five strike priors were found true in case No. 206612 and the prison priors were dismissed. Defendant\u2019s Romero<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>motion requesting the court to exercise its discretion and strike the priors was denied. Defendant received the 25-year-to-life sentence for the residential burglary and concurrent with it two 2-year terms for the KinderCare burglary and the vehicle theft. This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-6\">Application of Section 1192.7(c)(18)</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-7\">Defendant contends the sentence of 25 years to life violates his rights to due process and freedom from cruel and unusual punishment because none of his prior convictions were \u201cserious\u201d felonies as defined in section 1192.7, subdivision (c) as amended by the enactment of Proposition 21. The version of section 1192.7(c)(18) in effect when defendant committed the current crimes defined as a \u201cserious felony\u201d a \u201c[b]urglary of an inhabited dwelling house, vessel, as defined in the Harbors and Navigation Code, which is inhabited and designed for habitation, floating home, as defined in subdivision (d) of Section 18075.55 of the Health and Safety Code, trailer coach, as defined by the Vehicle Code, or the inhabited portion of any other building.\u201d (Stats. 1998, ch. 754, \u00a7 1.) Proposition 21 changed that to \u201cany burglary of the first degree.\u201d (\u00a7 1192.7(c)(18).) As applied to defendant\u2019s case, the March 2000 amendment to section 1192.7(c)(18) is ameliorative, and therefore is controlling. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Roberts </em>(1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1462, 1466 [29 Cal.Rptr.2d 771].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-8\">Defendant reasons that because Proposition 21 amended section 1192.7(c)(18) \u201cto define serious felony burglaries in terms of an \u2018offense\u2019\u2014 i.e., \u2018first degree burglary\u2019\u2014rather than in terms of \u2018conduct,\u2019 . . . the rationale central to Jackson\u2019s[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] holding that the legislative body enacting the law was concerned with \u2018conduct\u2019 and not \u2018offenses\u2019 has been eliminated. Therefore, there is no need to \u2018go behind\u2019 a judgment of conviction for \u2018second degree\u2019 burglary in order to determine the residential nature of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1422\">*1422</page-number>conduct.\u201d Defendant maintains that the trial court erred in considering the record of conviction to determine whether his prior burglaries were residential.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-4\">Plaintiff counters by tracing the changes to section 1192.7(c)(18) from its inception in June 1982 as part of Proposition 8 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cruz </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 764, 772 [55 Cal.Rptr.2d 117, 919 P.2d 731] <em>(Cruz)) </em>to the passage of Proposition 21. Plaintiff claims this historical backdrop \u201cshows the following principles, which we submit are not open to dispute: (1) the original purpose of section 1192.7(c)(18) was to include all <em>residential </em>burglaries in the list of serious felonies; (2) subsequent legislation has confirmed the broad scope of section 1192.7(c)(18); and (3) courts will not presume that the original purpose of the section has been narrowed or diluted as the unintended consequence of subsequent legislation.\u201d (Original italics.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-5\">\u201cAs in any case involving statutory interpretation, our fundamental task here is to determine the Legislature\u2019s intent so as to effectuate the law\u2019s purpose. [Citation.] We begin by examining the statute\u2019s words, giving them a plain and commonsense meaning. [Citation.] We do not, however, consider the statutory language \u2018in isolation.\u2019 [Citation.] Rather, we look to \u2018the entire substance of the statute ... in order to determine the scope and purpose of the provision .... [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.] . . . We must harmonize \u2018the various parts of a statutory enactment ... by considering the particular clause or section in the context of the statutory framework as a whole.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Murphy </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 136, 142 [105 Cal.Rptr.2d 387, 19 P.3d 1129].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-6\">\u201c \u2018[L]anguage that appears unambiguous on its face may be shown to have a latent ambiguity.\u2019 [Citation.] In such a case, a court may turn to customary rules of statutory construction, the \u2018 \u201cwider historical circumstances,\u201d \u2019 or legislative history for guidance, keeping in mind the \u2018 \u201cconsequences that will flow from a particular interpretation.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.] It is not always preferable to rely on the literal meaning of the words used. \u2018 \u201c[I]t is a settled principle of statutory interpretation that language of a statute should not be given a literal meaning if doing so would result in absurd consequences which the Legislature did not intend.\u201d [Citations.] . . . Thus, \u201c[t]he intent prevails over the letter, and the letter will, if possible, be so read as to conform to the spirit of the act.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People v. Townsend </em>(1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 1390, 1395 [73 Cal.Rptr.2d 438].)  \u201cWe interpret initiative measures using the ordinary rules and canons of statutory construction. [Citation.] Thus, \u2018our primary purpose is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the voters who passed the initiative measure. [Citations.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Yeroushalmi </em>v. <em>Miramar Sheraton </em>(2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 738, 747-748 [106 Cal.Rptr.2d 332].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1423\">*1423</page-number>The original version of section 1192.7(c)(18) listed \u201cburglary of a residence\u201d as a serious felony. At that time, first degree burglary was defined in section 460, subdivision 1, as the nighttime burglary of an inhabited dwelling or trailer coach, or the inhabited portion of any building. <em>(Cruz, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at p. 770; Stats. 1978, ch. 579, \u00a7 23, p. 1985.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-5\">The nighttime requirement for first degree burglary was eliminated from section 460, subdivision 1, in 1982. (Stats. 1982, ch. 1290, \u00a7 1, p. 4774; Stats. 1982, ch. 1297, \u00a7 1, p. 4786.) Thereafter, the question arose whether a residential burglary which occurred in the daytime prior to the 1982 change qualified as a serious felony conviction under section 1192.7(c)(18) for purposes of the five-year sentence enhancement authorized by section 667, subdivision (a). The Supreme Court found the intent of the electorate was to treat all residential burglaries as \u201cserious\u201d felonies and concluded that section 1192.7(c)(18) referred \u201c \u2018not to specific criminal offenses, but to the criminal conduct described therein.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Cruz, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at p. 773, quoting <em>Jackson, supra, </em>37 Cal.3d at p. 832.) The court further concluded that the 1986 amendment of section 1192.7(c)(18), which deleted the reference to \u201cburglary of a residence\u201d and substituted \u201cburglary of an inhabited dwelling house, or trailer coach as defined by the Vehicle Code, or inhabited portion of any other building\u201d (Stats. 1986, ch. 489, \u00a7 1, p. 1809), was not intended \u201cto narrow the application of the \u2018burglary of a residence\u2019 serious felony enhancement,\u201d but rather \u201cwas intended simply as a clarification of the existing provision.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cruz, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at p. 774.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-6\">Section 460 attained its pre-Proposition 21 language after 1989 and 1991 amendments.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Section 1192.7(c)(18) attained its pre-Proposition 21 language in 1998 when the Legislature amended it to conform to section 460 in 1998. The development of the two statutes is shown in the table below:</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-7\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1424\">*1424</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-4\">The 1989 change to section 460 raised the issue whether burglary of an inhabited vessel qualified as a \u201cserious felony\u201d under the 1986 version of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1425\">*1425</page-number>section 1192.7(c)(18) then in effect which read \u201c[B]urglary of an inhabited dwelling house or trailer coach as defined by the Vehicle Code, or inhabited portion of any other building.\u201d (Stats. 1986, ch. 489, \u00a7 1, p. 1809.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-6\">That question was answered in the affirmative in 1996 in <em>Cruz, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at page 779. <em>Cruz </em>stated that the electorate and Legislature shared an intent to deter recidivism involving the \u201cdangerous crime\u201d of \u201cresidential burglary\u201d and that both California and out-of-state authority broadly interpreted the term \u201cburglary of an inhabited dwelling house.\u201d When the Legislature explicitly added inhabited vessels to those protected by the first degree burglary law under section 460, it did not intend to narrow the interpretation of the term \u201cinhabited dwelling house\u201d used in section 1192.7(c)(18) to exclude inhabited vessels. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Otherwise, the amendments to section 460 would have the anomalous and absurd result of simultaneously ensuring that burglaries of inhabited vessels were explicitly included among those dwellings deserving of the same punishment as all other first degree burglaries, while narrowing the scope of serious felony enhancements to exclude burglaries of inhabited vessels. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1219-7\">As the court observed, \u201cNothing contained in the subsequent amendment to section 460 was intended to limit the applicability of the section 1192.7(c)(18) enhancement. The amendment to section 460 was intended, rather, to ensure that vessels would receive the <em>same </em>protection as other habitations. We would contravene the intent and purpose of the Legislature that amended section 460 in 1989, if . . .we were to construe the Legislature\u2019s addition of language to section 460 (mandating equivalent first degree treatment for burglary of an inhabited vessel and burglary of a land-based residence) as having exactly the <em>opposite </em>effect with respect to the enhancement provisions of section 1192.7(c)(18). Sound principles of statutory construction dictate against our arriving at such an unreasonable conclusion.\u201d (Cr<em>uz, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at p. 783, original italics.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-8\">Proposition 21 came 18 years after the voters enacted Proposition 8, in which they declared their intent to treat all \u201cresidential\u201d burglaries as serious felonies <em>(Cruz, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at p. 772) and six years after Proposition 184, in which the voters enacted section 1170.12 mandating increased punishment for recidivists in the Three Strikes law. Section 1170.12 was preceded by the statement: \u201c \u2018It is the intent of the People of the State of California in enacting this measure to ensure longer prison sentences and greater punishment for those who commit a felony and have been previously convicted of serious and/or violent felony offenses.\u2019 \u201d (Historical and Statutory Notes, 50B West\u2019s Ann. Pen.

In the \u201cAnalysis by the Legislative Analyst,\u201d voters were informed that Proposition 21 \u201crevises the lists of specific crimes defined as serious or violent offenses, thus making most of them subject to the longer sentence provisions of existing law related to serious and violent offenses. In addition, these crimes would count as \u2018strikes\u2019 under the Three Strikes law.\u201d (Voter Information Guide, Primary Elec.

Proponents of the initiative told voters that Proposition 21 would \u201ctoughen the law to safeguard you and your family.\u201d (Guide, <em>supra, </em>Argument in Favor of Prop. 21, p. 48.) Ballot summaries and the \u201cAnalysis by the Legislative Analyst\u201d in the Guide are recognized sources for determining the voters\u2019 intent. <em>(Hodges </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 109, 116 [86 Cal.Rptr.2d 884, 980 P.2d 433].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-5\">Defendant states these notes provide \u201cunpersuasive[] argu[ment]\u201d that the voters intended to keep the construction of section 1192.7(c)(18) consistent with its historical construction.

(4) expands the list of violent and serious offenses for which longer prison sentences are given\u201d (Guide, <em>supra, </em>Quick Reference Voter Guide, Prop. 21, p. 6), the Legislative Analyst\u2019s statements that Proposition 21 \u201crevises the lists of specific crimes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1427\">*1427</page-number>defined as serious or violent offenses, thus making most of them subject to longer sentence provisions . . .\u201d and the chart\u2019s explanation that Proposition 21 <em>\u201c[a]dds crimes to the serious and violent felony lists, thereby making offenders subject to longer prison </em>sentences.\u201d (Guide, <em>supra, </em>Analysis by the Legislative Analyst, Prop. 21, pp. 46-47, Figure 1, p. 47, original italics.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-5\">The only fact defendant musters in support of his interpretation of Proposition 21 is the Legislative Analyst\u2019s statement that Proposition 21 <em>\u201crevises </em>the lists of specific crimes . . . making <em>most of them </em>subject to the longer sentence provisions of existing law . . . .\u201d (Guide, <em>supra, </em>Analysis by the Legislative Analyst of Prop. 21, pp. 46-47, italics added.) Defendant reasons, \u201c[t]he amendment to the burglary language should not be considered an \u2018addition\u2019 to the list of \u2018serious felonies,\u2019 because \u2018residential\u2019 burglary was already on the list. The amendment traded one type of burglary for another, rather than making an additional type of burglary a \u2018serious felony.\u2019 \u201d \u201cThe ameliorative effect of this amendment is to remove from consideration as strikes \u2018second degree\u2019 burglary convictions for offenses committed before January 1, 1983. \u2018Second degree\u2019 burglaries committed prior to that date have routinely been the subject of litigation in order to determine whether they were residential in nature and therefore \u2018serious felonies\u2019 for sentencing purposes. [Citations.] Any \u2018first degree\u2019 burglary committed after that date is, by definition, residential in nature [citations] and has, therefore, not resulted in much litigation, [f ] . . . [H] By amending the language of section 1192.7, the voters have indicated an intent that those defendants, like appellant, whose only \u2018strikes\u2019 consist of old \u2018second degree\u2019 burglary convictions, dating from prior to January 1, 1983, should not come within the \u2018Three Strikes\u2019 sentencing scheme because the benefit to society is outweighed by the cost of adjudicating and incarcerating them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-6\">To prevail, defendant must overcome heavy contrary authority.

Before 1982, when \u201cburglary of a residence\u201d was a serious felony but section 460, subdivision 1, defined first degree burglary as the nighttime burglary of an inhabited dwelling, \u201c[t]he upshot . . .

(See \u00a7 668.5.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>) <em>People </em>v. <em>Murphy </em>points out that \u201cboth the electorate and the Legislature have enacted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1432\">*1432</page-number>other criminal statutes that define the triggering conduct or circumstance by express reference to\u201d a violation of a specific statute. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Murphy, supra, </em>25 Cal.4th at p. 143.) \u201cThus, the electorate and the Legislature have both shown that they know how to use language expressly requiring a violation of [a specific statute] when that is their intent.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Indeed, Proposition 21 changed other subdivisions of section 1192.7, subdivision (c) to refer to specific code sections. (See \u00a7 1192.7, subd. (c)(29) and (31).) Proposition 21 could have changed subdivision (c)(18) to read \u201cany violation of section 460(a)\u201d similarly to subdivisions (47), (38), and (40). Since it did not, we interpret the language chosen as evidencing a desire to continue providing additional punishment for pre-1983 <em>\u201cconduct, </em>not a specific crime\u201d <em>(People v. Guerrero </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 343, 355 [243 Cal.Rptr. 688, 748 P.2d 1150], original italics) as well as post-1982 residential burglaries, and to obviate the need to amend section 1192.7(c)(18) every time section 460, subdivision (a) is altered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-4\">If we agreed with defendant that the purpose of the Proposition 21 change to section 1192.7(c)(18) was to define the serious felony burglary to avoid litigation over pre-1982 second degree burglaries or to give leniency to a class of by now middle-aged or elderly residential burglars who plied their trade before 1983, we run counter to the established interpretation of the words \u201cmak[e] <em>offenders subject to longer prison sentences.\u2019\u2019'\u2019 </em>(Guide, <em>supra, </em>Figure 1\u2014Prop. 21 Summary of Fiscal Effects of Major Provisions, p. 47, original italics.) We also would be saying that the electorate before 2000 wanted <em>all </em>residential burglaries to add to the punishment of a recidivist, but in 2000, without saying so, changed its mind contrary to the stated intent in the ballot pamphlet and in previous case law. We may not make this leap.  \u201c \u2018[T]he drafters who frame an initiative statute and the voters who enact it may be deemed to be aware of the judicial construction of the law that served as its source.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Superior Court (Arevalos) </em>(1996) 41 Cal.App.4th 908, 914 [48 Cal.Rptr.2d 833].) \u201cIt seems to us unlikely that the [electorate] intended to turn into lottery winners offenders who happened to commit their offenses during a lucky . . . window of time.\u201d <em>(People v. Superior Court (Blanquel) </em>(2000) 85 Cal.App.4th 768, 772 [102 Cal.Rptr.2d 429].) \u201cAnd the [ballot argument] confirms our impression in that regard.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1226-5\">Where uncertainty regarding a statute\u2019s construction exists, the court must consider the consequences that will flow from a particular interpretation. <em>(Holmes v. Jones </em>(2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 882, 889 [100 Cal.Rptr.2d 138].) The consequences we have considered confirm our opinion that defendant\u2019s wishful thinking is just that: wishful.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-6\">Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-7\">Defendant also challenges the sufficiency of the evidence that four of the five prior convictions were for burglaries of a residence. He contends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1433\">*1433</page-number>that his admissions that he entered \u201ca house, located at 1185 Koch Lane, San Jose\u201d and \u201ca residence, located at 1643 Dry Creek Road, San Jose,\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Garrett </em>(Super. Ct. Santa Clara County, 1980, No. 78076)), \u201ca house, located at 1527 Foxworthy Avenue, San Jose\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Garrett </em>(Super. Ct. Santa Clara County, 1982, No. 85754)), and \u201can apartment, located at 2435 Rinconada #8, San Jose\u201d <em>(People v. Garrett </em>(Super. Ct. Santa Clara County, 1980, No. 76523)) did not constitute an admission that \u201cany of the locations . . . was \u2018currently used for dwelling purposes.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-5\">We examine the documentary exhibits received in evidence at the trial on the prior convictions in the light most favorable to the judgment below to determine whether they disclose substantial evidence\u2014that is, evidence which is reasonable, credible and of solid value\u2014such that a reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Castellanos </em>(1990) 219 Cal.App.3d 1163, 1174-1175 [269 Cal.Rptr. 93].) Transcripts from preliminary hearings are part of the entire record of conviction and are admissible in evidence. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Reed </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 217 [52 Cal.Rptr.2d 106, 914 P.2d 184].) Charging documents in conjunction with a no contest plea may be considered in determining the truth of a residency allegation. <em>(People v. Castellanos, supra, </em>219 Cal.App.3d at p. 1171.) A defendant\u2019s admissions in a probation report may be considered to determine the nature of a burglary. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Myers </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 1193 [22 Cal.Rptr.2d 911, 858 P.2d 301]; <em>People v. Castellanos, supra, </em>219 Cal.App.3d at p. 1175.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-6\">In case Nos. 78076 and 85754, defendant admitted entering the Foxworthy house \u201cwith intent to commit theft,\u201d the \u201cresidence, located at . . . Dry Creek Road . . . with intent to commit theft,\u201d and the Koch Lane \u201chouse, with intent to commit theft.\u201d The terms \u201cresidence\u201d and \u201cinhabited dwelling house\u201d for purposes of a serious felony are equivalent. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Castellanos, supra, </em>219 Cal.App.3d at p. 1175.) Defendant admitted entering each of these houses with intent to commit theft, which allows for the inference that these were not empty structures containing nothing worth stealing, but were inhabited. His admission why he entered the houses \u201cprovided evidence from which a rational trier of fact could make an inference of residence.\u201d <em>(People v. Goodner </em>(1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1324, 1333 [9 Cal.Rptr.2d 543].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-7\">In case No. 76523, defendant admitted burglarizing an apartment and admitted to the probation officer that his intent was to steal marijuana and money. He denied \u201cdoing damage to Mr. Alexander\u2019s apartment and said all he took was a necklace which he did not sell as it was confiscated by the investigating officer.\u201d \u201cAn apartment is listed within section 459 as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1434\">*1434</page-number>residential area subject to its provisions. [Defendant] argues the term \u2018apartment\u2019 fails to prove that structure was inhabited for purposes of satisfying the requisite \u2018inhabited dwelling\u2019 component of residential burglary. [Citation.] This argument merely affects the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility.
