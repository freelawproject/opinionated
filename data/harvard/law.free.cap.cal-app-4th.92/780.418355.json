J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJj\">On December 13, 1989, the first of several informations was filed in Fresno County Superior Court against appellant Carl Franklin Harrison. On November 2, 1994, a jury convicted him as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>\u2014 Count one: Penal Code<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> section 286, subdivision (c) (forcible sodomy with child under age 14 and more than 10 years younger than Harrison; victim Tony R.).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-5\">\u2014 Counts two through six: Section 288a, subdivision (c) (forcible oral copulation with child under age 14 and more than 10 years younger than Harrison; victim Tony R.).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-6\">\u2014 Counts seven and eight: Section 288a, subdivision (c) (victim Victor R.).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-7\">\u2014 Count nine: Section 286, subdivision (c) (victim Victor R.).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-8\">\u2014 Count ten: Section 288a, subdivision (c) (victim Jeffrey R.).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-9\">\u2014 Counts eleven and twelve: Section 288a, subdivision (c) (victim Andrea G.).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-10\">\u2014 Count thirteen: Section 288, subdivision (a) (lewd and lascivious act on child under age 14; victim Andrea G.).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-11\">\u2014 Count fourteen: Section 261, subdivision (a)(2) (forcible rape; victim Janiva P.).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-12\">\u2014 Count sixteen: Section 242 (battery, a lesser included offense of \u00a7 273.5 (infliction of corporal injury on cohabitant); victim Cynthia E.).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-13\">\u2014 Count seventeen: Section 207, subdivision (b) (kidnapping a child under age 14 for the purpose of committing a violation of \u00a7 288; victim Sylvia G.).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-14\">\u2014 Counts eighteen through twenty-one and twenty-three: Section 288, subdivision (a) (victim Sylvia G.).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-15\">\u2014 Count twenty-two: Section 243.4 (sexual battery, a lesser included offense of \u00a7 288, subd. (a); victim Sylvia G.).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-16\">With respect to counts one through fourteen, eighteen through twenty-one, and twenty-three, the jury also found true the special allegation that in committing the offenses, Harrison engaged in substantial sexual conduct with a child under age 14 (\u00a7 1203.066, subd. (a)(8)). The jury acquitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>Harrison of count fifteen, which charged a violation of section 288, subdivision (b) (forcible lewd and lascivious act on child under age 14; victim Janiva P.) as an alternative to count fourteen.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">Harrison was sentenced to a total unstayed term of 121 years in prison and ordered to pay a $4,000 fine. He filed a timely notice of appeal. He now raises numerous issues, all of which fall into one of three general categories: motions for substitution of appointed counsel, competency proceedings, and trial. For the reasons which follow, we will affirm the judgment in its entirety, with the exception that we will order vacated the vexatious litigant finding and order issued July 17, 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">Facts<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">I, II*</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b668-9\">\n<em>Marsden Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b668-10\">A. <em>Denial of 1991 and 1994 Marsden </em>Motions*</p>\n<p id=\"b668-11\">B. <em>Vexatious Litigant Finding</em></p>\n<p id=\"b668-12\">On June 19, 1992, Harrison was found to be incompetent in case Nos. 410784-3 and 433352-2, and conservatorship proceedings were instituted. Harrison subsequently submitted a petition for writ of habeas corpus in case No. 410784-3, as well as a \u201cDemand for Hearing on issues of Wei. Inst. Code 5008 and 5350. [Sic.]\u201d On July 17, 1992, Judge Nunez issued the following order in case No. 410784-3, entitled \u201cOrder Prohibiting Further Filings in Propria Persona\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-13\">\u201cHaving read and considered the numerous motions, petitions, and other documents submitted in propria persona by Carl Harrison plus relevant court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>documents on file in this and related matters, the Court finds that the defendant is represented by an attorney of record, defendant\u2019s actions have become vexatious within the meaning of section 391 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and defendant currently is not qualified to represent himself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-5\">\u201cIt Is Therefore Ordered that the County Clerk shall not accept any further documents for filing submitted in propria persona by Carl Harrison unless leave has first been obtained from the Presiding Judge of this Court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">The order was filed on July 20, 1992. Insofar as the record shows, it was issued on the court\u2019s own motion, without prior notice to the parties or hearing. Thereafter, Harrison continued to submit various documents and motions (including pursuant to <em>People </em>v. <em>Marsden </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 118 [84 Cal.Rptr. 156, 465 P.2d 44] <em>(Marsden)), </em>some of which took the form of letters written to specific judges, and others, which were stamped \u201creceived\u201d instead of \u201cfiled.\u201d Some appear in the clerk\u2019s transcript on appeal without any stamp, while others appear in the correct chronological order for the date placed on the motion by Harrison, but are file-stamped March 15, 1995, after he was sentenced. Harrison withdrew two <em>Marsden </em>motions, dated February 11 and March 6, 1994, on March 10, 1994, during his hearing on restored competence.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">Harrison now contends Judge Nunez exceeded his statutory authority by issuing a vexatious litigant order in a criminal case, and that the error requires reversal because it had the effect of precluding consideration of any of Harrison\u2019s <em>Marsden </em>motions that were submitted between the date of the order and the motion of October 4, 1994. We agree there was error, but conclude reversal of the judgment is not required.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-9\">The vexatious litigant statutes (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 391 et seq.) were first codified in 1963. <em>(Camerado Ins. Agency, Inc. v. Superior Court </em>(1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 838, 841 [16 Cal.Rptr.2d 42]; Stats. 1963, ch. 1471, \u00a7 1, p. 3038.) These statutes, which are constitutional <em>(In re Whitaker </em>(1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 54, 56 [8 Cal.Rptr.2d 249]), \u201cwere enacted to require a person found to be a vexatious litigant to put up security for the reasonable expenses of a defendant who becomes the target of an obsessive and persistent litigant whose conduct can cause serious financial results to the unfortunate object of his or her attack. The purpose of the statutory scheme is to deal with the problem created by the persistent and obsessive litigant who has constantly pending a number of groundless actions, often against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>the judges and other court officers who decide or were concerned in the decision of previous actions adversely to him. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Childs v. PaineWebber Incorporated </em>(1994) 29 Cal.App.4th 982, 993 [35 Cal.Rptr.2d 93].)</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">The vexatious litigant scheme recently was synopsized in <em>McColm </em>v. <em>Westwood Park Assn. </em>(1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 1211, 1215-1216 [73 Cal.Rptr.2d 288]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-5\">\u201cThe vexatious litigant statute authorizes a \u2018defendant\u2019 to bring a motion to require a \u2018plaintiff\u2019 to furnish security. Defendant must prove that the plaintiff is a \u2018vexatious litigant\u2019 and that there is no reasonable probability that plaintiff will prevail in the litigation. ([Code Civ. Proc.,] \u00a7 391.1.) The statute contemplates a hearing to determine whether the plaintiff qualifies as \u2018vexatious\u2019 ([Code Civ. Proc.,] \u00a7 391.2) and instructs the court to require security if it finds plaintiff has no reasonable probability of prevailing. Security is \u2018for the benefit of the moving defendant\u2019 and in \u2018such amount and within such time as the court shall fix.\u2019 ([Code Civ. Proc.,] \u00a7 391.3.) If security is not furnished as ordered, the \u2018litigation\u2019 shall be dismissed as to the \u2018defendant for whose benefit it was ordered furnished.\u2019 ([Code Civ. Proc.,] \u00a7 391.4.) .... [ID ... [1D</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-6\">\u201cSection 391.7, added in 1990 (Stats. 1990, ch. 621, \u00a7 3, pp. 3072-3073), furnished the courts an additional resource for addressing vexatious litigant problems. This newer section operates beyond the pending case and affects the litigant\u2019s future filings. It authorizes a court to \u2018enter a prefiling order which prohibits a vexatious litigant from filing any new litigation in the courts of this state in propria persona without first obtaining leave of the presiding judge of the court where the litigation is proposed to be filed.\u2019 ([Code Civ. Proc.,] \u00a7 391.7, subd. (a).)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-7\">\u201cWhen a prefiling order is in force, \u2018[t]he presiding judge shall permit the filing of such litigation only if it appears that the litigation has merit and has not been filed for the purposes of harassment or delay. The presiding judge may condition the filing of the litigation upon the furnishing of security for the benefit of the defendants . . . .\u2019 ([Code Civ. Proc.,] \u00a7 391.7, subd. (b).) If the clerk mistakenly files any litigation presented by a litigant who is subject to a prefiling order, the litigant may be required to seek the presiding judge\u2019s permission to proceed. ([Code Civ. Proc.,] \u00a7 391.7, subd. (c).) The clerk of any court issuing a prefiling order is to provide a copy of such order to the Judicial Council, which maintains and disseminates annually a list of persons subject to such orders. ([Code Civ. Proc.,] \u00a7 391.7, subd. (d).)\u201d (Fns. omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>In the case at bench, it appears Judge Nunez was attempting to issue a prefiling order, as contemplated by Code of Civil Procedure section 391.7. Before there can be a prefiling order, however, there must be a \u201cvexatious litigant\u201d within the contemplation of the code.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> While a court may enter a prefiling order on its own motion, the statutes do not appear to envision that a court may, on its own motion, find a plaintiff to be a vexatious litigant in the first instance. Insofar as the record shows, and assuming Harrison could qualify as a \u201cplaintiff\u2019 within the meaning of the statutes,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> no \u201cdefendant\u201d made an appropriate motion,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and no hearing was held. Accordingly, the order was procedurally defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">There is an even more basic flaw. The vexatious litigant statutes apply to \u201clitigation,\u201d which is expressly defined as \u201cany <em>civil </em>action or proceeding, commenced, maintained or pending in any state or federal court.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 391, subd. (a), italics added.) The Legislature long ago drew a distinction between civil and criminal actions (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 24), and it gave them mutually exclusive statutory definitions (\u00a7 683; Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 30-31; <em>In re Bittaker, supra, </em>55 Cal.App.4th 1004, 1009). By expressly limiting the definition of \u201clitigation,\u201d for purposes of the vexatious litigant statutes, to \u201cany civil action or proceeding,\u201d the Legislature excluded criminal cases from the ambit of Code of Civil Procedure section 391 et seq. Thus, the vexatious litigant statutes may properly be employed <em>only </em>in civil cases. (See <em>McColm v. Westwood Park Assn., supra, </em>62 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1216, 1219; <em>In re Bittaker, supra, </em>55 Cal.App.4th at p. 1009; <em>Childs </em>v. <em>PaineWebber Incorporated, supra, </em>29 Cal.App.4th at p. 992; <em>Camerado Ins. Agency, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>12 Cal.App.4th at pp. 843-844.) They may not be used in criminal cases. (See <em>In re Bittaker, supra, </em>55 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1009-1012 [Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 391 et seq. inapplicable to petitions for writ of habeas corpus].)</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">The People contend the vexatious litigant statutes are made applicable by section 9 of the Penal Code, and ask how else Harrison can attempt to enforce the provisions of Code of Civil Procedure section 170 et seq.  Section 9 provides: \u201cThe omission to specify or affirm in this Code any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>liability to damages, penalty, forfeiture, or other remedy imposed by law and allowed to be recovered or enforced in any civil action or proceeding, for any act or omission declared punishable herein, does not affect any right to recover or enforce the same.\u201d This section simply means that \u201cthe failure to specify civil remedies in the Penal Code does not affect the availability of such remedies.\u201d <em>(Heritage Cablevision of Cal., Inc. v. Pusateri </em>(1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 517, 522 [45 Cal.Rptr.2d 191].) In other words, an act may be both a crime and a tort; the wrongdoer may be both convicted of the crime and held liable civilly for the tort; and the failure to specify a penalty for the crime does not affect the right to recover civilly for the tort. (1 Witkin &amp; Epstein, Cal. Criminal Law (3d ed. 2000) Introduction to Crimes, \u00a7 4, p. 15.) Section 9 does not make the vexatious litigant statutes applicable to criminal proceedings. As for Code of Civil Procedure section 170 et seq., nothing in the language of those statutes expressly limits them to a particular type of action. In fact, Code of Civil Procedure section 170.5, subdivision (f) broadly defines \u201cproceeding\u201d as \u201cthe action, case, cause, motion, or special proceeding to be tried or heard by the judge,\u201d while Code of Civil Procedure section 170.6, subdivision (1) refers to a disqualified judge trying \u201cany civil <em>or criminal </em>action or special proceeding of any kind or character . . . .\u201d (Italics added.) Clearly, the disqualification statutes are not analogous to the vexatious litigant provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">We do not mean to suggest a court is required to accept each and every motion presented by a defendant in a criminal case who is represented by counsel.  To the contrary, \u201ca party who is represented by counsel has no right to be heard personally [citation]. . . .\u201d <em>(In re Cathey </em>(1961) 55 Cal.2d 679, 684 [12 Cal.Rptr. 762, 361 P.2d 426]; see also <em>People v. Merkouris </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 540, 554-555 [297 P.2d 999].) A trial court may, in its discretion and upon a showing of good cause, permit a party who is represented by counsel to participate in conducting the case, but it should not do so unless it determines \u201cthat in the circumstances of the case the cause of justice will thereby be served and that the orderly and expeditious conduct of the court\u2019s business will not thereby be substantially hindered, hampered or delayed.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mattson </em>(1959) 51 Cal.2d 777, 797 [336 P.2d 937].) Where the party is not permitted personally to participate in conducting the case, pro se filings by that party may be returned unfiled <em>(People </em>v. <em>Clark </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 41, 173 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 554, 833 P.2d 561]) or, if filed, may be stricken <em>(People v. Mattson, supra, </em>51 Cal.2d at p. 798).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">There is, however, one exception to the rule that motions of parties represented by counsel must be filed by such counsel: courts must \u201caccept and consider pro se motions regarding representation, including requests for new counsel. (Cf. <em>People v. Marsden, supra, </em>2 Cal.3d 118.) Such motions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>must be clearly labeled as such, and must be limited to matters concerning representation. [Courts] will not consider extraneous matters even in such documents unless submitted by counsel.\u201d <em>(People v. Clark, supra, </em>3 Cal.4th at p. 173.)</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">In the present case, then, the court had the authority to refuse to file or consider pro se motions and other documents presented by Harrison that related to the conduct of the case (for example, motions to dismiss), albeit not by way of Code of Civil Procedure section 391 et seq. The court did not, however, have the power to prohibit Harrison from submitting <em>Marsden </em>motions, nor was it free to ignore those motions once they were presented. Any order to the parties and/or clerk\u2019s office should have made clear the exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">Citing <em>People v. Hale </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 531, 541 [244 Cal.Rptr. 114, 749 P.2d 769] [\u201conce a doubt has arisen as to the competence of the defendant to stand trial, the trial court has no jurisdiction to proceed with the case against the defendant without first determining his competence\u201d], the People question whether the court had jurisdiction to resolve any issue other than competency, since, at the time the order in question was issued, Harrison had been declared incompetent and had not yet been restored to competence. It is unclear whether the People are suggesting the court lacked jurisdiction to issue a vexatious litigant finding, or that it lacked jurisdiction to proceed on Harrison\u2019s requests to substitute counsel. If the former, any lack of jurisdiction is immaterial since the order was erroneous in any event.  If the latter, we disagree: the California Supreme Court has made it clear that \u201cwhile the trial court may not \u2018proceed with the case against the defendant\u2019 before it determines his competence in a section 1368 hearing [citation], it may and indeed <em>must </em>promptly consider a motion for substitution of counsel when the right to effective assistance \u2018would be substantially impaired\u2019 if his request were ignored. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Stankewitz </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 72, 88 [270 Cal.Rptr. 817, 793 P.2d 23].) Thus, the fact Harrison had been declared incompetent did not mean the court was entitled to ignore Harrison\u2019s <em>Marsden </em>motions. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">As Harrison points out, the record on appeal contains <em>Marsden </em>motions that appear to have been submitted prior to October 4, 1994, and yet were not acted upon. Moreover, Harrison mentioned to the court on at least two occasions (to Judge Kane on March 10, 1994, and to Judge O\u2019Neill on July 18, 1994) that his papers were not being accepted for filing. From this, Harrison concludes he is entitled to a reversal because the trial court failed to comply with the requirements of <em>Marsden, supra, </em>2 Cal.3d 118.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>To the extent any <em>Marsden </em>motions were not filed because of Judge Nunez\u2019s prefiling order, Harrison was not precluded from presenting those motions to the court. There is nothing in the record to indicate Harrison attempted to comply with the order\u2019s requirement that he obtain the presiding judge\u2019s permission to have the documents filed. More importantly, and regardless of whether the motions were not heard because they were not filed or because Harrison had been declared incompetent, we find no cause for reversal because of what took place in a hearing conducted by Judge O\u2019Neill on July 18, 1994:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-4\">\u201cThe Court: Listen to me, Mr. Harrison. If there is that issue, which you still wish to raise, just prepare your Marsden motion, send it to me, I will make sure it is in the file at the time of the hearing on these motions and it will be heard at the same time. 0Q . . . 0Q</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-5\">\u201cThe Court: All I am telling you, <em>if you want a Marsden hearing you send it to me, I\u2019ll make sure it is in the file. And on August 17th at the same time that all of your other motions are heard we will hear that </em>one.\u201d (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">Harrison has not shown that any of his concerns with counsel were so pressing that he was prejudiced because they were not heard immediately, that he could not have resubmitted his motions prior to the August 17 hearing,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> or that he was unable to submit further complaints about counsel to Judge O\u2019Neill. Some of his complaints, being exceedingly repetitious, were in fact ruled upon in later hearings. To the extent any earlier complaints were not heard, any error was cured by Harrison\u2019s failure to raise them at the hearings on his subsequent motions. (See <em>People v. Lloyd </em>(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 724, 731-732 [6 Cal.Rptr.2d 105].)</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">II, III<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b674-9\">The order declaring Harrison a vexatious litigant is vacated.
