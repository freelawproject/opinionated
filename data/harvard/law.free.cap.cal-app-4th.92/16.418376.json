J.</author>\n<p id=\"AV\">In this case, we consider whether five statutory programs that fall within the general rubric of \u201caffirmative action\u201d violate state and federal principles of equal protection and are contrary to article I, section 31, of our state Constitution, added by the adoption of Proposition 209 at the November 1996 General Election (hereafter Proposition 209).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-9\">The litigation, commenced by Governor Pete Wilson in his official capacity as Governor, challenges the statutory schemes on the ground that they impermissibly establish classifications and preferences based on race, ethnicity, and gender. The statutes at issue are Government Code section 8880.56, applicable to the State Lottery Commission; Government Code sections 16850 through 16857, applicable to the sale of state bonds; Government Code sections 19790 through 19799, applicable to the state civil service; Education Code sections 87100 through 87107, applicable to the California Community Colleges; and Public Contract Code sections 10115 through 10115.15, applicable to state contracting.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-10\">Plaintiff Ward Connerly (hereafter plaintiff) was later permitted to join the lawsuit as a taxpayer litigant, and he continued the litigation after Governor Wilson left office.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-11\">The trial court found invalid a portion of the statutory scheme applicable to the sale of government bonds and all of the statutory scheme applicable to state contracting, but otherwise rejected plaintiff\u2019s constitutional objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>Plaintiff appeals from the judgment to the extent that it rejects his constitutional challenge to the statutory schemes. The real parties in interest cross-appeal, asserting that the data collection and reporting requirements applicable to state contracting may be severed from the remainder of the statutory scheme and upheld. In addition, respondent California Community Colleges raises the initial question whether plaintiff has standing to pursue this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">We conclude (1) plaintiff has standing to maintain this litigation; (2) the statutory scheme applicable to the state lottery is invalid; (3) the statutory scheme applicable to the sale of government bonds is invalid, but a portion of the data collection and reporting requirements of the scheme may be severed and upheld; (4) the statutory scheme applicable to the state civil service is partially invalid, but the remainder of the scheme may be severed and upheld; (5) the statutory scheme applicable to the community colleges is invalid; and (6) a portion of the data collection and reporting requirements of the statutory scheme applicable to state contracting may be severed from the invalid portions of the scheme and upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">As we will explain, the statutory schemes at issue here were enacted over many years, some more than 20 years ago, during a time when the manner of applying equal protection principles to affirmative action programs was not settled. It has now been held that all racial classifications imposed by a governmental entity must be analyzed using the strict scrutiny standard of review. And, under our state Constitution, strict scrutiny applies to gender classifications. In addition, Proposition 209 imposes additional restrictions against racial and gender preferences and discriminatory actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">Insofar as the challenged statutory schemes utilize race and gender classifications, we have reviewed them under strict scrutiny and Proposition 209, with the results that we have detailed above. Because our conclusion differs in some respects from the trial court\u2019s rulings, we shall reverse the judgment and remand with directions to enter a new judgment consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">We begin by rejecting the claim that plaintiff lacks standing to pursue this litigation. According to the California Community Colleges, the decision in <em>Cornelius </em>v. <em>Los Angeles County etc. Authority </em>(1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 1761 [57 Cal.Rptr.2d 618] \u201csuggests that [plaintiff\u2019s] state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>taxpayer status should not permit him to proceed; this challenge should be deferred in favor of persons with an actual injury.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">California\u2019s Constitution, unlike its federal counterpart, does not contain a \u201ccase or controversy\u201d limitation on the judicial power. <em>(National Paint &amp; Coatings Assn. </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 753, 761 [68 Cal.Rptr.2d 360]; see <em>Lujan </em>v. <em>Defenders of Wildlife </em>(1992) 504 U.S. 555, 560 [112 S.Ct. 2130, 2136, 119 L.Ed.2d 351, 364] [among other things, to establish a case or controversy under federal law, a plaintiff must have suffered an \u201c \u2018injury in fact\u2019 \u201d that is \u201cconcrete,\u201d \u201cparticularized,\u201d and \u201c \u2018actual or imminent, not \u201cconjectural\u201d or \u201chypothetical\u201d \u2019 \u201d].) Therefore, restrictive federal rules of justiciability do not necessarily apply in state courts. <em>(White v. Davis </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 757, 763 [120 Cal.Rptr. 94, 533 P.2d 222].) In particular, there are two related rules of standing applicable in state court actions that are contrary to the rules in federal courts\u2014the right to maintain an action as a taxpayer, and the right to maintain an action as a citizen.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">Code of Civil Procedure section 526a permits a taxpayer to bring an action to restrain or prevent an illegal expenditure of public money. No showing of special damage to a particular taxpayer is required as a requisite for bringing a taxpayer suit. <em>(White </em>v. <em>Davis, supra, </em>13 Cal.3d at p. 764.) Rather, taxpayer suits provide a general citizen remedy for controlling illegal governmental activity. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 763.)</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">Citizen suits may be brought without the necessity of showing a legal or special interest in the result where the issue is one of public right and the object is to procure the enforcement of a public duty. <em>(Green v. Obledo </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 126, 144 [172 Cal.Rptr. 206, 624 P.2d 256].) Citizen suits promote the policy of guaranteeing citizens the opportunity to ensure that governmental bodies do not impair or defeat public rights. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">Taxpayer suits and citizen suits are closely related concepts of standing. (See <em>Common Cause v. Board of Supervisors </em>(1989) 49 Cal.3d 432, 439 [261 Cal.Rptr. 574, 777 P.2d 610].) The chief difference is a taxpayer suit seeks preventative relief, to restrain an illegal expenditure, while a citizen suit seeks affirmative relief, to compel the performance of a public duty. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Where standing appears under either rule, the action may proceed regardless of the label applied by the plaintiff. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b49-9\">Statutorily enacted affirmative action programs are matters of intense public concern. <em>(Department of Corrections v. State Personnel Bd. </em>(1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 131, 143 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 34].) Hence, a claim that such a program violates principles of equal protection and Proposition 209 is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>precisely the type of claim to which citizen and taxpayer standing rules apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">Moreover, plaintiff\u2019s pursuit of this litigation is consistent with the purpose of a standing requirement, which is to ensure that courts address actual controversies between parties who have sufficient adverse interests to press their case with vigor. <em>(Common Cause v. Board of Supervisors, supra, </em>49 Cal.3d at p. 439.) This case has been litigated intensely, and there is no danger here that the court will be misled by the failure of the parties to adequately explore and argue the issues. <em>(Van Atta v. Scott </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 424, 450 [166 Cal.Rptr. 149, 613 P.2d 210].)</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">The California Community Colleges suggest that we should deny standing to plaintiff because application of the challenged statutory schemes will produce potential plaintiffs with personal beneficial interests in the matter who will be entitled to pursue their own actions. However, \u201c[n]umerous decisions have affirmed a taxpayer\u2019s standing to sue despite the existence of potential plaintiffs who might also have had standing to challenge the subject actions or statutes.\u201d <em>(Van Atta v. Scott, supra, </em>27 Cal.3d at pp. 447-448, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">Citing the decision in <em>Cornelius v. Los Angeles County etc. Authority, supra, </em>49 Cal.App.4th 1761, 1774-1779, the California Community Colleges argue that we should apply a restrictive definition of \u201ctaxpayer\u201d in order to deny taxpayer standing to plaintiff. But that case involved an action against a local government entity by a person who lacked standing as an individual, who was not a resident of the county and did not pay property taxes to the county, and whose state taxes bore only a tangential relationship to the challenged program. Whatever might be the merits of indulging in a restrictive definition of \u201ctaxpayer\u201d in such circumstances, the decision is inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">At oral argument, respondents added to their argument on the issue of standing. They assert that this proceeding is in mandate, that mandate addresses conduct rather than the validity of legislation, and that plaintiff cannot proceed in mandate without introducing proof that respondents are in fact engaging in unconstitutional behavior. We reject this contention for three separate reasons. First, it was raised for the first time at oral argument. <em>(Rebney v. Wells Fargo Bank </em>(1990) 220 Cal.App.3d 1117, 1138, fn. 6 [269 Cal.Rptr. 844].) Second, mandate can be used to test the constitutional validity of a legislative enactment. <em>(Floresta, Inc. v. City Council </em>(1961) 190 Cal.App.2d 599, 612 [12 Cal.Rptr. 182]; see, e.g., <em>Hollman v. Warren </em>(1948) 32 Cal.2d 351, 357, 360 [196 P.2d 562]; <em>Driving Sch. Assn, of Cal. v. San </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number><em>Mateo Union High Sch. Dist. </em>(1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 1513, 1517, 1521-1525 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 908].) Third, to the extent respondents suggest that we should deny plaintiff standing to challenge the statutory schemes because agencies subject to those schemes may perform their duties in a constitutional manner by either ignoring the statutory directives or by engaging in a strained interpretation thereof, the argument overlooks a critical principle of law. As we will explain more fully in subsequent portions of this opinion, an administrative agency lacks the authority to cure a facially unconstitutional statute by refusing to enforce it as written.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">Here, plaintiff challenges statutory schemes enacted by the Legislature for application throughout the state and which as written, and unless restrained, will result in the expenditure of state funds consistent with their application. Plaintiff\u2019s status as a state taxpayer is sufficient to confer taxpayer standing in these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">Before we decide whether the statutory programs challenged by plaintiff violate state and federal principles of equal protection and are contrary to Proposition 209, it is helpful to provide, at the outset, an overview of the rules of law that we must apply in addressing plaintiff\u2019s attack on the statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b51-9\">The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution is succinct: \u201cNo state shall . . . deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\u201d California\u2019s Constitution is equally terse: \u201cA person may not be . . . denied equal protection of the laws.\u201d (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 7, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b51-10\"> Although our state constitutional guarantee is independent of the federal guarantee, in the context of this case it is, with one exception, applied in a manner identical with the federal guarantee. <em>(DeRonde </em>v. <em>Regents of University of California </em>(1981) 28 Cal.3d 875, 889-890 [172 Cal.Rptr. 677, 625 P.2d 220].)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The one exception is with respect to gender. Under federal law, distinctions based on gender are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>subjected to heightened judicial scrutiny, but gender is not a suspect classification, as is race. (See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Virginia </em>(1996) 518 U.S. 515, 532 [116 S.Ct. 2264, 2275, 135 L.Ed.2d 735, 751].) Under California law, classifications based on gender are considered suspect for purposes of equal protection analysis. <em>(Koire </em>v. <em>Metro Car Wash </em>(1985) 40 Cal.3d 24, 37 [219 Cal.Rptr. 133, 707 P.2d 195]; <em>Sail\u2019er Inn, Inc. </em>v. <em>Kirby </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 1, 20 [95 Cal.Rptr. 329, 485 P.2d 529, 46 A.L.R.3d 351].)</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">Following its adoption, the federal equal protection clause \u201cwas relegated to decades of relative desuetude\u201d while the courts adjudicated rights under notions of substantive due process. <em>(University of California Regents </em>v. <em>Bakke </em>(1978) 438 U.S. 265, 291 [98 S.Ct. 2733, 2743-2744, 57 L.Ed.2d 750, 772], lead opn. of Powell J. (hereafter <em>Bakke II).) </em>With the demise of \u201cthe era of substantive due process,\u201d the equal protection clause began to attain a \u201cmeasure of vitality.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 291-292 [98 S.Ct. at p. 2749, 57 L.Ed.2d at p. 772].) In the early development of principles of equal protection, the landmark decisions arose in response to actions that discriminated against minorities, most often African-Americans. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 294 [98 S.Ct. at p. 2750, 57 L.Ed.2d at p. 773].)</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">Development of equal protection jurisprudence established that the constitutional guarantee applies to governmental classifications, whether they be legislative, executive, judicial, or administrative. Legislative classification is the act of specifying who will and who will not come within the operation of a particular law. <em>(Dare v. Bd. of Medical Examiners </em>(1943) 21 Cal.2d 790, 802 [136 P.2d 304]; <em>In re Cardinal </em>(1915) 170 Cal. 519, 521 [150 P. 348]; <em>County of Los Angeles v. Hurlbut </em>(1941) 44 Cal.App.2d 88, 93 [111 P.2d 963].)</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">A legislative classification satisfies equal protection of law so long as persons similarly situated with respect to the legitimate purpose of the law receive like treatment. <em>(Brown v. Merlo </em>(1973) 8 Cal.3d 855, 861 [106 Cal.Rptr. 388, 506 P.2d 212, 66 A.L.R.3d 505].)</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>Legislative classifications generally are entitled to judicial deference, are presumptively valid, and may not be rejected by the courts unless they are palpably unreasonable. <em>(Asbury Hospital v. Cass County </em>(1945) 326 U.S. 207, 215 [66 S.Ct. 61, 65, 90 L.Ed. 6, 13]; <em>County of L.A. </em>v. <em>Southern Cal. Tel. Co. </em>(1948) 32 Cal.2d 378, 392 [196 P.2d 773].) However, judicial deference does not extend to laws that employ suspect classifications, such as race. Because suspect classifications are pernicious and are so rarely relevant to a legitimate governmental purpose <em>(Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co. </em>(1989) 488 U.S. 469, 505 [109 S.Ct. 706, 727-728, 102 L.Ed.2d 854, 889] (hereafter <em>Croson)), </em>they are subjected to strict judicial scrutiny; i.e., they may be upheld only if they are shown to be necessary for furtherance of a compelling state interest and they address that interest through the least restrictive means available. <em>(Bernal </em>v. <em>Fainter </em>(1984) 467 U.S. 216, 219-220 [104 S.Ct. 2312, 2315-2316, 81 L.Ed.2d 175, 179-180]; <em>Weber v. City Council </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 950, 958 [109 Cal.Rptr. 553, 513 P.2d 601].)</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">With the advent of affirmative action programs, it was inevitable that so-called reverse discrimination cases would come before the courts. In a series of cases, the United States Supreme Court has addressed the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">In <em>Bakke II, supra, </em>438 U.S. 265 [98 S.Ct. 2733, 57 L.Ed.2d 750], the court affirmed a decision of the California Supreme Court <em>(Bakke I, supra, </em>18 Cal.3d 34), insofar as it held a race-based admissions program unlawful, but reversed insofar as it precluded the school from giving any consideration to race in the admissions process.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">In <em>Wygant </em>v. <em>Jackson Board of Education </em>(1986) 476 U.S. 267 [106 S.Ct. 1842, 90 L.Ed.2d 260] (hereafter <em>Wygant), </em>the court invalidated a public school layoff scheme under which nonminority teachers were laid off while minority teachers with less seniority, including probationary teachers, were retained.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">In <em>Croson, supra, </em>488 U.S. 469 [109 S.Ct. 706, 102 L.Ed.2d 854], the court invalidated a city contract scheme that provided a \u201cset-aside\u201d for minority business enterprises.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-9\">In <em>Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena </em>(1995) 515 U.S. 200 [115 S.Ct. 2097, 132 L.Ed.2d 158] (hereafter <em>Adarand), </em>the court held that, pursuant to the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment, a federal contracting scheme that employed race-based presumptions must be judged under the same strict scrutiny standards applicable to state and local governments.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-10\">Then, in a series of cases following the 1990 census, the court found various race-based congressional reapportionment schemes to be invalid. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number><em>(Shaw </em>v. <em>Hunt </em>(1996) 517 U.S. 899 [116 S.Ct. 1894, 135 L.Ed.2d 207]; <em>Shaw v. Reno </em>(1993) 509 U.S. 630 [113 S.Ct. 2816, 125 L.Ed.2d 511]; see also <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Cromartie </em>(1999) 526 U.S. 541 [119 S.Ct. 1545, 143 L.Ed.2d 731]; <em>Bush v.

Johnson </em>(1995) 515 U.S. 900 [115 S.Ct. 2475, 132 L.Ed.2d 762].)</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">The opinions filed in those cases demonstrate the difficulty that the United States Supreme Court has had in applying equal protection principles to affirmative action programs. The cases generally have resulted in multiple opinions from the justices. Although the court has not upheld any of the programs under consideration in those cases, the various opinions indicate that race-based governmental programs are not per se invalid but that, to be constitutionally valid, they must withstand the stringent test of strict judicial scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">From those opinions, we can distill certain principles that have been endorsed by a majority of the United States Supreme Court and must guide our consideration of the validity of the statutory schemes involved here.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">The equal protection clause recognizes that distinctions between persons based solely upon their ancestry \u201c \u2018are by their very nature odious to a free people whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality.\u2019 [Citation.]\u2019\u2019 <em>(Shaw </em>v. <em>Reno, supra, </em>509 U.S. at p. 643 [113 S.Ct. at p. 2824, 125 L.Ed.2d at p. 526] (maj. opn.); <em>Bakke II, supra, </em>438 U.S. at pp. 290-291 [98 S.Ct. at pp. 2748-2749, 57 L.Ed.2d at p. 771] (lead opn.).) Accordingly, the core purpose of the equal protection clause is to eliminate govemmentally sanctioned racial distinctions. <em>(Croson, supra, </em>488 U.S. at p. 495 [109 S.Ct. at pp. 722-723, 102 L.Ed.2d at p. 883] (plur. opn.); <em>Wygant, supra, </em>476 U.S. at p. 277 [106 S.Ct. at pp. 1848-1849, 90 L.Ed.2d at p. 270] (plur. opn.).) Where the government proposes to assure participation of \u201csome specified percentage of a particular group merely because of its race or ethnic origin, such a preferential purpose must be rejected not as insubstantial but as facially invalid.

The relevant constitutional consideration is that they are compelled to contact MBE\u2019s/ WBE\u2019s, which are thus accorded preferential treatment within the meaning of section 31.\u201d <em>(Hi-Voltage, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at p. 562.)</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">In holding the program to be invalid, the court observed: \u201cThe participation component authorizes or encourages what amounts to discriminatory quotas or set-asides, or at least race- and sex-conscious numerical goals. [Citations.] A participation goal differs from a quota or set-aside only in degree; by whatever label, it remains \u2018a line drawn on the basis of race and ethnic status\u2019 as well as sex.\u201d <em>(Hi-Voltage, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at pp. 562-563.)</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">Although finding the city\u2019s outreach program unconstitutional under Proposition 209, the court acknowledged \u201cthat outreach may assume many forms, not all of which would be unlawful.\u201d <em>(Hi-Voltage, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at p. 565.) \u201cPlainly, the voters intended to preserve outreach efforts to disseminate information about public employment, education, and contracting not predicated on an impermissible classification.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>However, the court expressed \u201cno opinion regarding the permissible parameters of such efforts.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">It can be seen that Proposition 209 overlaps, but is not synonymous with, the principles of equal protection that we have described in part II. A., <em>ante. </em>Under equal protection principles, all state actions that rely upon suspect classifications must be tested under strict scrutiny, but those actions which can meet the rigid strict scrutiny test are constitutionally permissible. Proposition 209, on the other hand, prohibits discrimination against or preferential treatment to individuals or groups regardless of whether the governmental action could be justified under strict scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">In this respect, the distinction between what the federal Constitution permits and what it requires becomes particularly relevant. (See <em>Shaw v. Reno, supra, </em>509 U.S. at p. 654 [113 S.Ct. at pp. 2830-2831, 125 L.Ed.2d at p. 533] (maj. opn.).) To the extent the federal Constitution would permit, but not require, the state to grant preferential treatment to suspect classes, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>Proposition 209 precludes such action. <em>(Hi-Voltage, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at p. 567 [Prop. 209 contains no compelling state interest exception].)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">The complaining party bears the initial and ultimate burden of establishing unconstitutionality. <em>(Wygant, supra, </em>476 U.S. at pp. 277-278 [106 S.Ct. at pp. 1848-1849, 90 L.Ed.2d at p. 271] (plur. opn.).) But when the plaintiff has made a sufficient showing to trigger strict scrutiny review, the burden of justification is both demanding and entirely upon the government. <em>(Bakke II, supra, </em>438 U.S. at p. 306 [98 S.Ct. at pp. 2756-2757, 57 L.Ed.2d at p. 781] (lead opn.); <em>Sail\u2019er Inn, Inc. v.

If the government succeeds in establishing justification for the use of a suspect classification, the burden shifts back to the complaining party to show that the statutory scheme or its application is nevertheless unconstitutional.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">In this case, plaintiff employs the easiest means by which strict scrutiny is triggered.  Laws that explicitly distinguish between individuals on racial grounds fall within the core of the prohibition of the equal protection clause and \u201c[n]o inquiry into legislative purpose is necessary when the racial classification appears on the face of the statute.\u201d <em>(Shaw v.

And the express use of suspect classifications in a statutory scheme immediately triggers strict scrutiny review. <em>(Shaw v. Reno, supra, </em>at pp. 642-644 [113 S.Ct. at pp. 2824-2825, 125 L.Ed.2d at pp. 525-526] (maj. opn.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Under the strict scrutiny test, specificity and precision are required. <em>(Croson, supra, </em>488 U.S. at pp. 500, 505 [109 S.Ct. at pp. 725, 727-728, 102 L.Ed.2d at pp. 886, 889] (maj. opn.).) The government cannot avoid constitutional conflict simply because a racial classification is part of a statutory scheme which is so broad and/or amorphous that it might in some instances be employed in a race-neutral manner. If the racial classification is not necessary to the statutory scheme, it may not be employed. <em>(Shaw v.

If the racial classification is necessary to the statutory scheme, it must be justified by a compelling governmental interest, and its use must be narrowly tailored to serve that interest. <em>(Wygant, supra, </em>476 U.S. at p. 274 [106 S.Ct. at p. 1847, 90 L.Ed.2d at p. 268] (plur. opn.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">In respondents\u2019 view, strict scrutiny applies only where legislation grants a preference based upon race, and not where the legislation is merely \u201crace conscious.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">We do not agree that a law must confer a preference before strict scrutiny applies. The United States Supreme Court could not be more certain on this point. The ultimate goal of the equal protection clause is the complete elimination of irrelevant factors such as race from governmental decision-making. <em>(Croson, supra, </em>488 U.S. at p. 495 [109 S.Ct. at pp. 722-723, 102 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>L.Ed.2d at p. 883] (plur. opn.).) Regardless of the burdens or benefits imposed by or granted under a particular law, the use of a racial classification presents significant dangers to individuals, racial groups, and society at large. <em>(Croson, supra, </em>at pp. 493-494 [109 S.Ct. at pp. 721-722, 102 L.Ed.2d at p. 882] (plur. opn.).) \u201cRacial classifications of any sort pose the risk of lasting harm to our society.\u201d <em>(Shaw v.

And without strict scrutiny, a court cannot determine whether a racial classification truly is benign or remedial. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 653 [113 S.Ct. at p. 2830, 125 L.Ed.2d at p. 533] (maj. opn.); <em>Adarand, supra, </em>515 U.S. at p. 226 [115 S.Ct. at p. 2112, 132 L.Ed.2d at p. 181] (maj. opn.).) What is significant under the equal protection clause is that the government has drawn a line on the basis of race or ethnic status <em>(Bakke II, supra, </em>438 U.S. at p. 289 [98 S.Ct. at pp. 2747-2748, 57 L.Ed.2d at p. 770] (lead opn.)), and laws that do so are immediately suspect. <em>(Shaw v. Reno, supra, </em>509 U.S. at p. 642 [113 S.Ct. at p. 2824, 125 L.Ed.2d at p. 525] (maj. opn.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">Nevertheless, we agree that a law is not subject to strict scrutiny review merely because it is \u201crace conscious.\u201d (See <em>Shaw v. Reno, supra, </em>509 U.S. at p. 642 [113 S.Ct. at p. 2824, 125 L.Ed.2d at p. 525] (maj. opn.).) Since the guarantee of equal protection is an individual right, where the operation of the law does not differ between one individual and another based upon a suspect classification, strict scrutiny is not required even though the law might mention matters such as race or gender. Accordingly, to use respondent California Community Colleges\u2019 example, a law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race or gender would be race and gender conscious but would not invite strict scrutiny.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">In this respect, we agree with respondents that if a statutory provision can, by fair and reasonable interpretation, be given a meaning consistent with the requirements of the Constitution rather than in conflict with it, we must so interpret the statute in order to preserve its validity. <em>(Izazaga v. Superior Court </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 356, 371 [285 Cal.Rptr. 231, 815 P.2d 304]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Davenport </em>(1985) 41 Cal.3d 247, 264 [221 Cal.Rptr. 794, 710 P.2d 861].)</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">However, as we shall explain, for the most part the statutory schemes at issue in this case, which employ express racial and gender classifications, cannot be interpreted to preserve their validity.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>F</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">Several respondents assert that statutory schemes which may be denominated as outreach, recruitment, or inclusive measures do not violate principles of equal protection or Proposition 209.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">With respect to a benefit or advantage, such as admission to a school of higher education, a government job, or a public contract, the cognizable interest of a competitor is in being able to compete on an equal footing without regard to the race or gender of other competitors. <em>(Adarand, supra, </em>515 U.S. at p. 211 [115 S.Ct. at pp. 2104-2105,132 L.Ed.2d at p. 171] (maj. opn.).) A competitor does not have a constitutionally cognizable interest in limiting the pool of applicants with whom he or she must compete. (See <em>Alabama Power Co. v. Ickes </em>(1938) 302 U.S. 464, 479-480 [58 S.Ct. 300, 303-304, 82 L.Ed. 374, 378].) Therefore, outreach or recruitment efforts which are designed to broaden the pool of potential applicants without reliance on an impermissible race or gender classification are not constitutionally forbidden. (See <em>Hi-Voltage, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at p. 565.)</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">But if the statutory scheme relies upon race or gender classifications, it must, for equal protection analysis, be subjected to strict judicial scrutiny. And if it discriminates against or grants preference to individuals or groups based upon race or gender, it is prohibited by Proposition 209.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">G</p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">Respondents contend that monitoring programs which collect and report data concerning the participation of women and minorities in governmental programs do not violate equal protection principles. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-10\">Throughout the various opinions filed in the United States Supreme Court\u2019s affirmative action cases, no justice has suggested that discrimination is a thing of the past which need not concern governmental entities. Governmental entities remain under a duty to eliminate the vestiges of segregation and discrimination. <em>(Wygant, supra, </em>476 U.S. at p. 277 [106 S.Ct. at pp. 1848-1849, 90 L.Ed.2d at p. 270] (plur. opn.).) All of the justices agree that governmental entities may use race- and gender-neutral methods of fostering equal opportunity and that, in some instances, even race- and gender-specific remedies may be employed. Accurate and up-to-date information is the sine qua non of intelligent, appropriate legislative and administrative action. Assuming that strict scrutiny is required, a monitoring program designed to collect and report accurate and up-to-date information is justified by the compelling governmental need for such information. So long as such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>program does not discriminate against or grant a preference to an individual or group, Proposition 209 is not implicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">With all of the aforesaid principles in mind, we proceed to consider the specific statutory schemes challenged in this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">\n<em>State Lottery</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">The statutory provision applicable to the state lottery that plaintiff challenges is contained in Government Code section 8880.56, which is set forth in full in appendix A, <em>post. </em>(Further section references are to the Government Code unless otherwise specified.)  At issue is subdivision (b)(5), which was added by the Legislature in 1986. (Stats. 1986, ch. 55, \u00a7 17, pp. 158-160, eff. Apr. 16, 1986.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As we will explain, that subdivision violates principles of equal protection and Proposition 2<em>0</em>9.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-9\">With respect to the advertising or awarding of any contract for the procurement of goods and services exceeding $500,000, section 8880.56, subdivision (b)(5) imposes upon the California State Lottery Commission (the commission) and its director an \u201caffirmative duty\u201d of maximizing the level of participation of \u201csocially and economically disadvantaged small business concerns\u201d in the commission\u2019s procurement programs. The commission is required to \u201cadopt proposal evaluation procedures, criteria, and contract terms which . . . will achieve the most feasible and practicable level of participation by socially and economically disadvantaged small business concerns . . . .\u201d And bidders and contractors, are required \u201cto include specific plans or arrangements to utilize subcontracts with socially and economically disadvantaged small business concerns.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b67-10\">Economic disadvantage is a criterion that may be determined through application of race-neutral and gender-neutral financial factors. Social disadvantage is a more amorphous concept that certainly invites reliance on racial and gender classifications. But we do not have to guess as to legislative intent because the fourth paragraph of section 8880.56, subdivision (b)(5) expressly incorporates racial, ethnic, and gender classifications into the statutory meaning of \u201csocially and economically disadvantaged.\u201d Individuals from a list of racial and ethnic backgrounds and women are conclusively presumed to be socially and economically disadvantaged regardless of their actual affluence. Persons from the excluded group, apparently only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>White males, may be included if found by the commission to be disadvantaged, but the statute provides no definitional criteria, no application procedures, and no procedures for review of the commission\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">Even if such procedures were included in the statute, the fact that some individuals must prove disadvantage while others are conclusively presumed to be disadvantaged based solely on race, ethnicity, and gender, establishes impermissible race, ethnicity, and gender classifications. (See <em>Stanley v. Illinois </em>(1972) 405 U.S. 645, 657-658 [92 S.Ct. 1208,1215-1216, 31 L.Ed.2d 551, 562].)</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">The challenged provision does more than use race, ethnicity, and gender classifications; it establishes preferences for persons from the favored groups. The commission and director are assigned the affirmative duty of maximizing participation by such persons. Selection procedures and criteria are required to accomplish that objective. And bidders and contractors are required to include specific plans or arrangements to utilize subcontracts with members of the favored groups. These provisions do not merely attempt to equalize the opportunity to participate, they establish a preference for doing business with members of the favored groups.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">Section 8880.56, subdivision (b)(5) cannot even arguably withstand strict scrutiny. The absence of any identification of past discrimination by the California State Lottery, the random inclusion of groups without individualized consideration whether particular groups suffered from discrimination, the absence of any attempt to measure the recovery by the extent of the injury, the absence of any attempt to disburse the benefits of the scheme in an evenhanded manner to those who actually suffered detriment, and the absence of any geographic or temporal limits to the scheme, all serve to condemn it.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">The commission and director do not attempt to justify the statute as written, but argue that they have implemented it in a constitutional manner. Specifically, they assert they have implemented it as a small business outreach statute, using the definition of small business from the Small Business Procurement and Contract Act (\u00a7 14835 et seq.), which does not employ racial and gender classifications. They contend that, as implemented, bidders and contractors are required to make good faith efforts to reach out to minority-owned and women-owned small business concerns, but that no preference or advantage in contracting or subcontracting based on race or gender is applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">The difficulty with this position is that the commission and director lack the authority to cure a facially unconstitutional statute by refusing to enforce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>it as written. (Cal. Const., art. III, \u00a7 3.5; <em>Reese </em>v. <em>Kizer </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 996, 1002 [251 Cal.Rptr. 299, 760 P.2d 495].) We do not deal here with an ambiguous statutory provision that can be interpreted in a constitutional manner; rather, it is a statute that cannot be implemented both constitutionally and in accordance with its express terms. However well intentioned, to the extent that the commission and the director refuse to employ racial and gender preferences in implementing section 8880.56, subdivision (b)(5), they do so in disregard of express statutory requirements. While administrative interpretation may save an ambiguous statute, it cannot cure a facially invalid statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">\n<em>Professional Bond Services</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">The statutory provisions applicable to professional bond services that plaintiff challenges are contained in sections 16850 through 16857, which are set forth in full in appendix B, <em>post. </em>For reasons which follow, we conclude that, with one exception, the challenged provisions violate principles of equal protection and Proposition 209.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">Government bonds may be issued for a variety of purposes and on behalf of a variety of state departments and agencies. The bonds must be issued in accordance with the dictates of the particular authorizing act, enacted by the electorate or by a legislative body with authority to provide for the issuance of bonds. <em>(Golden Gate Bridge etc. Dist. </em>v. <em>Filmer </em>(1933) 217 Cal. 754, 757-758 [21 P.2d 112, 91 A.L.R. 1].) Matters that are not governed specifically by the authorizing act or otherwise required by law are left to the broad discretion of the issuing department, agency, or officer. (Ibid.; see also <em>Kennedy v. McInturff </em>(1933) 217 Cal. 509, 514-515 [20 P.2d 315].)</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">With respect to issuance of state bonds, the State Treasurer is the sole agent for offering and selling bonds. (\u00a7 5702.) In selling bonds on behalf of any state agency or department, the State Treasurer is required to schedule the sale of the bonds so as to coordinate the sale with the program of the department or agency necessitating the sale of the bonds. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b69-9\">In the issuance of government bonds, the state may contract for the services of financial advisers, bond counsel, underwriters, underwriter\u2019s counsel, financial printers, feasibility consultants, and other professionals. (\u00a7 16851, subd. (j).) Underwriters essentially serve as transfer agents. The State Treasurer may, in some instances, select an underwriting team without competitive bidding (\u00a7 5703); in those situations, the State Treasurer negotiates a contract with the underwriters, and the underwriters negotiate the sale of bonds to the public. In other instances, bond underwriters are chosen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>through competitive bidding; in those situations, the bonds are sold to the underwriter who submits the most favorable bid, and the underwriter then resells the bonds to the investing public.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">Sections 16850 through 16857 establish minority and women business \u201cparticipation goals\u201d for professional bond service contracts. The statutory scheme establishes and utilizes racial and gender classifications. For purposes of the scheme, \u201cminority\u201d is defined to mean \u201can ethnic person of color . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 16851, subd. (h).) Minority business enterprises and women business enterprises are defined by reference to majority ownership and control in minorities and/or women. (\u00a7 16851, subds. (i) &amp; (k).) To be a minority business enterprise or a women business enterprise, a business must be at least 51 percent owned and controlled by one or more minorities or women, respectively. (\u00a7 16851, subds. (i) &amp; (k).) A business owned and controlled 50 percent by minorities and 50 percent by women may be counted as either but not both. (\u00a7 16851, subd. (/).)</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">With respect to contracts awarded without competitive bidding, section 16850, subdivision (a) establishes statewide participation goals of 15 percent for MBE\u2019s and 5 percent for WBE\u2019s. The trial court found that this portion of the statutory scheme is invalid, and it is not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">With respect to contracts awarded through competitive bidding, section 16850, subdivision (a) requires each awarding department to establish minority business and women business participation goals. A \u201cgoal\u201d is \u201ca numerically expressed objective that awarding departments and providers of professional bond services are required to make efforts to achieve.\u201d (\u00a7 16851, subd. (f).) The goals \u201capply to the overall dollar amount expended by the awarding department with respect to the contracts for professional bond services relating to the issuance of bonds by the awarding department including amounts spent as underwriter\u2019s discounts.\u201d (\u00a7 16850, subd. (a).) These provisions establish a state preference, at least to the extent of the established goals, for doing business with individuals based upon their race and gender.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">When the services of an underwriter are to be obtained by competitive bidding, the awarding department is required to, \u201cat a minimum,\u201d (1) \u201c[djeliver the notice of sale[,] or other notification of intention to the [.sic] issue the bonds[,] to all minority and women business enterprises that have listed their names with the awarding department for the purpose of this notice and [to] other qualified minority and women business enterprises known to the awarding department,\u201d (2) state in all notices that \u201cminority and women business enterprises are encouraged to respond,\u201d and (3) require <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>all submitting bidders \u201cto certify their awareness of the goals of the awarding department [for awarding contracts to minority business enterprises and women business enterprises].\u201d (\u00a7 16852.)</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">Thus, these statutory provisions entitle minority business enterprises and women business enterprises to special notice of the sale or intention to issue bonds. The State Treasurer disagrees, suggesting that section 16852 does not require special notice to such enterprises, but includes them only in the notice that is otherwise required under 16754. We are not persuaded. The State Treasurer has considerable discretion in the sale of government bonds, and section 16754 permits the sale of bonds upon such notice as the Treasurer may deem advisable. For purposes of equal protection analysis, we must view the law from the standpoint of the individual. Under the existing statutory scheme, minority businesses and women businesses may ensure that they receive notice by listing their names with the department and, if they have not done so, will receive notice so long as they are known to the department. There is no mechanism by which other businesses can ensure that they receive notice, and there is no requirement that the notice deemed advisable by the State Treasurer be such that any reasonably alert potential bidder will receive it.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Accordingly, this portion of the statutory scheme contravenes Proposition 209\u2019s prohibition against the selective dissemination of information. <em>(Hi-Voltage, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at pp. 562, 564.)</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">Moreover, the fact that all bidders are required to certify their awareness of the department\u2019s goals for the participation of minority businesses and women businesses, coupled with the imposition of a duty on providers of services to make efforts to achieve those goals, only can be intended to result in preferential treatment based upon race and gender. (See <em>Hi-Voltage, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at p. 562.)</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">With respect to contracts to be awarded through competitive bidding, the awarding department must require each bidder to identify the minority business enterprises and women business enterprises which will be used to fulfill minority and women participation goals, and to state the portion or the work to be done by each such subcontractor. (\u00a7 16852.5, subd. (a).) And section 16852.5, subdivision (b) makes applicable to those subcontractors the Subletting and Subcontracting Fair Practices Act (Pub. Contract Code, \u00a7 4100 et seq.), which requires prime contractors to identify, in their bids, the subcontractors who will perform work under the contract, and prohibits the prime contractor from thereafter substituting any person for the subcontractor unless a statutory exception is established. (Pub. Contract Code, \u00a7\u00a7 4104, 4107.)</p>\n<p id=\"b72-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>Extending protections of the Subletting and Subcontracting Fair Practices Act to minority and women subcontractors for professional bond services, but not to other subcontractors, is itself a suspect classification for purposes of equal protection analysis and an impermissible preference under Proposition 209.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">In addition, the statutory scheme requires an awarding department to establish a method of monitoring adherence to its minority and women participation goals, including requiring a follow-up report from all contractors upon completion of any sale of bonds. (\u00a7 16853, subd. (a).) Each awarding department is required to file an annual report with the Governor and the Legislature stating the level of participation of minority and women businesses in professional bond service contracts and, if the department\u2019s participation goals are not met, stating the reasons for its inability to achieve the goals and the steps that will be taken in an effort to achieve the goals. (\u00a7 16855.)</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">The State Treasurer claims that this portion of the statutory scheme should not be subject to strict scrutiny because there is no penalty for a failure to achieve participation goals. According to this argument, competitively bid contracts are awarded to the lowest responsible bidder without consideration of the race or gender of the bidder or of the bidder\u2019s subcontractors, and thus minority and women participation goals are irrelevant to the selection process itself. We reject this argument for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">First, the statutory scheme requires that bidders certify their awareness of participation goals and imposes upon them a duty to make efforts to achieve those goals. (\u00a7\u00a7 16851, subd. (f), 16852, subd. (c).) Government contractors are required to act in good faith and, in assessing the validity of a statutory scheme, we cannot presume they will not do so. (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 3529, 3548.) Regardless of whether the statutory scheme imposes a penalty for the failure to comply with the duty that it imposes, it establishes racial and gender preferences.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">Second, the economic realities of the statutory scheme inevitably compel bidders to give preferences based on racial and gender classifications. Except for the special minority business enterprise and women business enterprise notice requirements, the State Treasurer and awarding departments have broad discretion in providing notice to potential bidders. While some contracts are awarded through competitive bidding, others are not. A bidder who wishes to be ensured of notice for future competitively awarded contracts, and to be considered for negotiated contracts, will know that a demonstrated ability to meet or exceed participation goals inevitably will be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>a factor in the notice and selection processes. (See, e.g., \u00a7 5703, subd. (a).) Therefore, while an isolated competitive bid contract may be obtained without complying with the duty to make efforts to achieve participation goals, a bidder\u2019s hopes for future business inevitably will cause it to employ racial and gender preferences.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">The statutory scheme does not arguably withstand strict scrutiny. No justification has been shown. There was no specific finding of identified prior discrimination in the contracting for professional bond services. There was no effort to measure the remedy against the consequences of identified discrimination. There was no effort to limit recovery to those who actually suffered from prior discrimination. There was no showing that non-race-based and non-gender-based remedies would be inadequate or were even considered. The scheme is unlimited in duration. And, except for its limitation to citizens and lawfully admitted aliens, the scheme is unlimited in reach.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">It remains to be determined whether reporting requirements of the statutory scheme (\u00a7 16855) may be severed and upheld. We already have decided that monitoring and reporting requirements serve a compelling government need and may be employed without violating principles of equal protection or Proposition 209. The requirement in the first sentence of section 16855, that each awarding department make an annual report \u201cto the Governor and the Legislature on the level of participation by minority and women business enterprises in contracts as identified in this chapter,\u201d may be severed functionally and grammatically from the remainder of the statutory scheme. The consistency with which the Legislature has imposed monitoring and reporting duties on state agencies with respect to the participation of minorities and women in various programs, and the importance of such information to the Legislature, convinces us that the Legislature intended to impose this requirement regardless of the validity of the remainder of the statutory scheme. Hence, we sever and uphold this portion of the reporting requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">\n<em>State Civil Service</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">The state civil service affirmative action provisions that plaintiff challenges are contained in sections 19790 through 19799, which are set forth in full in appendix C, <em>post. </em>We find that, with two exceptions, those provisions facially violate principles of equal protection and Proposition 209.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">Pursuant to the challenged statutory scheme, each agency and department \u201cis responsible for establishing an effective affirmative action program.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>(\u00a7 19790.) The director of each department, in cooperation with the State Personnel Board, has \u201cthe major responsibility for monitoring the effectiveness of the affirmative action program of the department.\u201d (\u00a7 19794.) The secretary of each agency and the director of each department each is required to appoint an \u201caffirmative action officer\u201d with responsibility over the agency\u2019s and the department\u2019s programs. (\u00a7 19795, subd. (a).) Bureau and division chiefs \u201c[are] accountable to the department director, for the effectiveness and results of the program within their division or bureau.\u201d (\u00a7 19796.) All management levels, including first-line supervisors, must \u201cprovide program support and take all positive action necessary to ensure and advance equal employment opportunity at their respective levels.\u201d (\u00a7 19796.)</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">. An affirmative action program includes, on an annual basis, the establishment of \u201cgoals and timetables designed to overcome any identified underutilization of minorities and women in their [agency or department].\u201d (\u00a7 19790.) At a minimum, each agency and department must annually \u201cidentify the areas of underutilization of minorities and women within [the agency or department] by job category and level,\u201d perform \u201can equal employment opportunity analysis of all job categories and levels within the hiring jurisdiction,\u201d and provide \u201can explanation and specific actions for improving the representation of minorities and women.\u201d (\u00a7 19797.)</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">For purposes of the statutory scheme, a goal is a projected level of achievement, specific to the smallest reasonable hiring unit, for correcting underutilization of minorities and women. (\u00a7 19791, subd. (a).) A timetable is an estimate of the time required to meet specific goals. (\u00a7 19791, subd. (b).) \u201c \u2018Underutilization\u2019 means having fewer persons of a particular group in an occupation or at a level in a department than would reasonably be expected by their availability.\u201d (\u00a7 19791, subd. (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">The State Personnel Board (hereafter the board) is \u201cresponsible for providing statewide advocacy, coordination, enforcement, and monitoring of [agency and department affirmative action] programs.\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 19790, 19792.) Among other things, the board must review and approve agency and departmental affirmative action goals and timetables. (\u00a7\u00a7 19790, 19792, subd. (d).) The board is required to make an annual report to the Governor, the Legislature, and the Department of Finance on the accomplishment of each agency and department in meeting its goals for the past year. (\u00a7 19793.) The Legislature must then \u201cevaluate the equal employment opportunity efforts and affirmative action progress of state agencies during its evaluation of the Budget Bill.\u201d (\u00a7 19793.)</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>And section 19798 provides that, \u201c[i]n establishing order and subdivisions of layoff and reemployment, the board, when it finds past discriminatory hiring practices, shall by rule, adopt a process that provides that the composition of the affected work force will be the same after the completion of a layoff, as it was before the layoff procedure was implemented.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">In 1995, Governor Wilson issued Executive Order No. W-124-95, which directed state agencies to eliminate employment practices based on racial and gender preferences.. Thereafter, the board revised its recommended procedures in an effort to comply with the executive order. The trial court held the statutory scheme is valid because, in light of the executive order, it appears that the statutory scheme can be implemented reasonably without racial and gender preferences.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">We conclude, however, that the statutory requirements for the establishment of goals and timetables to overcome identified underutilization of minorities and women violate principles of equal protection and Proposition 209.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">As the California Supreme Court noted in <em>Hi-Voltage, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at page 563, a participation goal differs from a quota or set-aside only in degree; it remains a line drawn on the basis of race and gender. And when the government chooses to rely upon racial and gender distinctions, the scheme is presumptively invalid; we cannot defer to legislative pronouncements, and the burden is on the government to justify the use of the distinction. <em>(Croson, supra, </em>488 U.S. at pp. 500-501 [109 SCt. at pp. 725-726, 102 L.Ed.2d at p. 886] (maj. opn.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">Pursuant to the statutory scheme, the board must establish requirements for improvement or corrective action to eliminate underutilization of minorities and women. (\u00a7 19792, subd. (e).) In each agency and department, a duty is imposed on every managerial employee, from first line supervisors on up, to attempt to achieve the agency or departmental goals. (\u00a7\u00a7 19794-19796.) Such an establishment of specific hiring goals necessarily is, in itself, the establishment of hiring preferences for purposes of equal protection and Proposition 209.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">Under equal protection principles, the use of statistical underutilization to establish hiring goals suffers from a fatal flaw. The scheme can be viewed in only two ways. It may represent a decision to assure participation of \u201csome specified percentage of a particular group\u201d merely because of race or gender, which would be impermissible discrimination. <em>(Bakke II, supra, </em>438 U.S. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>p. 307 [98 S.Ct. at p. 2757, 57 L.Ed.2d at p. 782] (lead opn.); see also <em>Croson, supra, </em>488 U.S. at p. 497 [109 S.Ct. at pp. 723-724, 102 L.Ed.2d at p. 884] (plur. opn.).) Or the use of statistical underutilization to establish hiring goals may be viewed as the establishment of a conclusive presumption of prior discrimination based upon statistical disparity. The problem with this is that, while statistical underutilization may serve as significant evidence of prior discriminatory hiring practices, it is not conclusive and is not, in itself, proof of discrimination. <em>(Hazelwood School District v. United States </em>(1977) 433 U.S. 299, 312-313 [97 S.Ct. 2736, 2743-2744, 53 L.Ed.2d 768, 780].) There may be explanations other than discrimination for statistical variations, and detailed consideration of past hiring practices may rebut the inference suggested by statistical evidence. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Constitutional rights cannot be foreclosed through the use of presumptions rather than proof. <em>(Stanley v. Illinois, supra, </em>405 U.S. at pp. 657-658 [92 S.Ct. at pp. 1215-1216, 31 L.Ed.2d at p. 562].) Accordingly, statistical anomalies, without more, do not give a governmental entity the legal authority to employ racial and gender classifications. <em>(Croson, supra, </em>488 U.S. at pp. 499, 501-503 [109 S.Ct. at pp. 725-727, 102 L.Ed.2d at pp. 885, 887-888] (maj. opn.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">These constitutional objections may be eliminated by severing and invalidating the requirement that state agencies and departments establish, and make efforts to achieve, goals and timetables to overcome any identified underutilization of minorities and women in state agencies and departments.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">In other words, portions of the statutory scheme that provide for data collection and reporting do not suffer a constitutional defect because a determination of the underutilization of minorities and women in state service can serve legitimate and important purposes. Such a determination may indicate the need for further inquiry to ascertain whether there has been specific, prior discrimination in hiring practices. It may indicate the need to evaluate applicable hiring criteria to ensure that they are reasonably job-related and do not arbitrarily exclude members of the underutilized group. And it may indicate the need for inclusive outreach efforts to ensure that members of the underutilized group have equal opportunity to seek employment with the affected department.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">One other provision of the statutory scheme requires separate discussion. Section 19798 authorizes the board, when it finds the existence of past discriminatory hiring practices, to adopt a process that alters layoff and reemployment procedures in order to maintain the racial and gender composition of the affected work force.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>The burdens imposed by such a process are not diffused throughout the general population and do not affect mere hopes or expectations. Rather, they interfere with the established employment rights of specific individuals based upon race and/or gender. They are among the most severe race and gender based remedies that might be postulated. (See <em>Wygant, supra, </em>476 U.S. at pp. 294-295 [106 S.Ct. at pp. 1857-1858, 90 L.Ed.2d at p. 282] (cone. opn. of White, J.).) Therefore, the use of such a remedy would require the most compelling justification.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">Equal protection jurisprudence of the United States Supreme Court has not disapproved the possibility that such a remedy might be appropriate in some circumstance. While utilization of the authority conferred on the board by section 19798 would be subject to strict judicial scrutiny, the statute is not facially invalid under equal protection principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">Proposition 209 is more restrictive. Alteration of layoff and reemployment schemes in order to maintain the racial and/or gender composition of the work force unquestionably would discriminate against some individuals and grant preferences to others on the basis of race and/or gender. Proposition 209 generally forbids such action. But there are exceptions to the rule established by Proposition 209. If the failure to employ the scheme authorized by section 19798 would result in ineligibility for a federal program with a loss of federal funds, or if federal law or the United States Constitution required, rather than merely permitted, the use of the scheme, Proposition 209 would not preclude it. (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 31, subds. (e), (h).)</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">While any attempt by the board to implement an altered layoff and reemployment scheme pursuant to section 19798 would be subject to the restrictions of Proposition 209 and to strict judicial scrutiny for equal protection purposes, the granting of authority to the board to utilize such a scheme, should appropriate circumstances arise, is not invalid on its f\u00e1ce.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">\n<em>Community Colleges</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b77-9\">The community college provisions that plaintiff challenges are contained in Education Code sections 87100 through 87107, which are set forth in full in appendix D, <em>post. </em>As will become apparent, they violate principles of equal protection and Proposition 209.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-10\">Community colleges are two-year secondary schools that are part of the state public school system. (Ed. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 66010.4, 66700.) The community college system is divided into districts. (Ed. Code, \u00a7 74000.) Each district is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>under the immediate control of a board of trustees (Ed. Code, \u00a7 70902), while statewide management, administration, and control over community colleges are vested in a board of governors. (Ed. Code, \u00a7 71020 et seq.)</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">The statutory scheme in question declares that it is \u201ceducationally sound\u201d for (1) \u201cthe minority student attending a racially impacted school to have available the positive image provided by minority classified and academic employees,\u201d (2) \u201cthe student from the majority group to have positive experiences with minority people,\u201d and (3) \u201cstudents to observe that women as well as men can assume responsible and diverse roles in society.\u201d (Ed. Code, \u00a7 87100, subd. (b).) It is further declared that \u201c[ljessons concerning democratic principles and the richness which racial diversity brings to our national heritage can be best taught by the presence of staffs of mixed races and ethnic groups working toward a common goal.\u201d (Ed. Code, \u00a7 87100, subd. (d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">To this end, the Legislature intended \u201cto promote the total realization of equal employment opportunity through a continuing affirmative action employment program\u201d with the intent \u201cto require educational agencies to adopt and implement plans for increasing the numbers of women and minority persons at all levels of responsibility.\u201d (Ed. Code, \u00a7 87100, subd. (d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">For purposes of this statutory scheme, an \u201caffirmative action employment program\u201d means \u201cplanned activities designed to seek, hire, and promote persons who are underrepresented in the work force compared to their number in the population, including handicapped persons, women, and persons of minority racial and ethnic backgrounds.\u201d It requires employers \u201cto make additional efforts to recruit, employ, and promote members of groups formerly excluded at the various levels of responsibility who meet statewide minimum qualifications, if any, and who, relative to local qualifications beyond the statewide minimum qualifications, are qualified or may become qualified through appropriate training or- experience within a reasonable length of time.\u201d The program \u201cshould be designed to remedy the exclusion, whatever its cause.\u201d (Ed. Code, \u00a7 87101, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">Each community college district is required to have a plan which ensures that district personnel participate in, and are committed to, the affirmative action employment program. The plan must include hiring goals and timetables for its implementation. (Ed. Code, \u00a7 87102, subd. (a).) \u201cGoals and timetables\u201d mean \u201cprojected new levels of employment of women and minority racial and ethnic groups to be attained on an annual schedule. . . .\u201d (Ed. Code, \u00a7 87101, subd. (b).) The plan must include steps to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>taken \u201cin meeting and improving hiring goals for both full-time faculty and part-time faculty\u201d and \u201cthe development of the plan shall be a condition for receipt of allowances [for program improvement].\u201d (Ed. Code, \u00a7 87102, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">The governing board of each community college district is accountable for the success or failure of its program. (Ed. Code, \u00a7 87102, subd. (a).) The governing board must periodically submit to the board of governors \u201can affirmation of compliance.\u201d (Ed. Code, \u00a7 87102, subd. (a).) And the board of governors has the authority to impose conditions necessary to assure reasonable progress of affirmative action, including program improvement allowances and moneys from the Faculty and Staff Diversity Fund. (Ed. Code, \u00a7 87104, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">The Faculty and Staff Diversity Fund is available to the board of governors for the purpose of enabling community colleges as a system to meet \u201cthe goal that by the year 2005 the system\u2019s work force will reflect proportionately the adult population of the state.\u201d (Ed. Code, \u00a7 87107, subd. (a).) The Legislature expressed the intent that, by fiscal year 1992-1993, 30 percent of all new hires in the system would be ethnic minorities. (Ed. Code, \u00a7 87107, subd. (a).) The board of governors is to use the fund for, among other things, providing for extended outreach and recruitment of underrepresented groups, providing incentives to hire members of underrepresented groups, and for in-service training and other related staff diversity programs. (Ed. Code, \u00a7 87107, subd. (d).) In administering the Faculty and Staff Diversity Fund, it is the intent that boards of governors \u201cgive funding priority and shall afford flexibility and discretion in the use of these funds to districts which have made or are making reasonable progress in contributing to the achievement of the goals of this fund.\u201d (Ed. Code, \u00a7 87107, subd. (e).)</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">This statutory scheme suffers from multiple constitutional faults. The establishment of an overall and continuing hiring goal\u2014by fiscal year 1992-1993, 30 percent of new hires will be ethnic minorities and by the year 2005, the work force will proportionately reflect the adult population of the state\u2014is, unquestionably, a preferential hiring scheme in violation of Proposition 209. Moreover, a goal of assuring participation by some specified percentage of a particular group merely because of its race or gender is \u201cdiscrimination for its own sake\u201d and must be rejected as facially invalid under equal protection principles. <em>(Bakke II, supra, </em>438 U.S. at p. 307 [98 S.Ct. at p. 2757, 57 L.Ed.2d at p. 782] (lead opn.); see also <em>Croson, supra, </em>488 U.S. at p. 497 [109 S.Ct. at pp. 723-724, 102 L.Ed.2d at p. 884] (plur. opn.).) And the requirement to create timetables to seek, hire, and promote minorities and women and to make reasonable progress in doing so\u2014with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>financial incentives for success and financial detriment for failure\u2014establishes impermissible racial and gender preferences. <em>(Hi-Voltage, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at p. 563.)</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">One stated justification for the preferential hiring scheme\u2014the role model theory (Ed. Code, \u00a7 87100, subd. (d))\u2014has been rejected by the United States Supreme Court. (Wygant, <em>supra, </em>476 U.S. at pp. 274-276 [106 S.Ct. at pp. 1847-8148, 90 L.Ed.2d at pp. 269-270] (plur. opn.).) The other stated justification is the belief that \u201c[ljessons concerning democratic principles and the richness which racial diversity brings to our national heritage can be best taught by the presence of staffs of mixed races and ethnic groups . . . .\u201d (Ed. Code, \u00a7 87100, subd. (d).) This, too, does not justify the establishment of racial and gender preferences. Lessons concerning democratic principles must include the fundamental rule of law, embodied in our state and federal Constitutions, that individuals should not be classified for different treatment based upon their race or gender.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">The statutory scheme is not, as the community colleges state, an \u201cequal employment opportunity\u201d scheme. It says nothing about making inclusive outreach efforts to assure equal opportunity; instead, it requires efforts to seek, hire, and promote minorities and women. Success must be achieved, and underrepresentation must be eliminated. Nor, as the community colleges suggest, is it an attempt to redress specific prior discrimination; under the scheme, underrepresentation must be eliminated regardless of its cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">And, contrary to the community colleges\u2019 claim, regulations adopted to implement the statutory scheme do not make the statutory scheme consistent with constitutional requirements. As we already have noted, administrative implementation cannot save a facially invalid statutory scheme. (Cal. Const., art. III, \u00a7 3.5; <em>Reese </em>v. <em>Kizer, supra, </em>46 Cal.3d at p. 1002.)</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">In any event, the board of governors\u2019 regulations do not come close to implementing the scheme in a constitutional manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">Among other things, the regulations proceed with hiring goals and timetables and require that districts achieve success in reaching numerical workforce parity of women and minorities. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 5, \u00a7\u00a7 53001, subds. (a), (b), (f), (o), (p), 53003, subd. (c)(10), 53020, subd. (a), 53030, subd. (b)(3).) This is invalid discrimination for its own sake.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">Although inclusive outreach efforts may be designed and carried out in a manner that does not require strict scrutiny or violate Proposition 209, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>calling a scheme an outreach effort does not save it from strict scrutiny or constitutional invalidity if it in fact utilizes suspect classifications. The board\u2019s regulations do so. Recruitment must include \u201cfocused outreach\u201d to women and minorities, and in-house or promotional only recruitment may not be used unless women and minorities have reached numerical parity in the pool of eligible employees. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 5, \u00a7 53021, subds. (a), (b).) If members of the favored groups have not applied in sufficient numbers by the time the application period has closed, steps must be taken that include reopening the application process for additional focused recruitment. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 5, \u00a7 53023, subd. (b).) And, after applications are screened for eligibility, the regulations specify that the process may have to be reopened again, and local qualifications may have to be abandoned, in order to ensure sufficient applicants from the favored groups. <em>(Ibid.) </em>In fact, a requirement that the process be reopened or redone may occur throughout the selection process whenever necessary to ensure there are sufficient applicants from the favored groups. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 5, \u00a7\u00a7 53023-53024.) This is not an inclusive outreach scheme, it is a preferential recruitment and selection process.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">In addition, if the preferential recruitment and selection process has not achieved numerical parity in a reasonable time, defined in most circumstances as three years, then additional steps must be taken that include consideration of the race or gender of applicants in the selection process and the inclusion, in the applicant pool, of members of the favored groups who were previously screened out for failure to meet locally established desirable or preferred qualifications. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 5, \u00a7 53006.) By any reckoning, this constitutes the use of hiring preferences.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">Moreover, the regulations require the use of racial and gender hiring preferences without a finding of specific discrimination, without evidence that would support such a finding, and in contravention of Proposition 209.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">For all of these reasons, the regulations do not save the statutory scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">Although we uphold the data collection and reporting aspects of other statutory schemes, we cannot do so with the community college statutes. Since their data collection and reporting requirements are entirely bound up and intermixed with the success of the preferential hiring scheme, they cannot be severed functionally and grammatically from the remainder of the statutory scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-9\">\n<em>State Contracting</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b81-10\">Public Contract Code sections 10115 through 10115.15 concern minority business and women business participation goals for state contracts. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number><em>Monterey Mechanical Co. v. Wilson </em>(9th Cir. 1997) 125 F.3d 702 (hereafter <em>Monterey Mechanical), </em>the federal court of appeals held this statutory scheme was invalid under principles of equal protection. So, too, did the trial court in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">The federal court in <em>Monterey Mechanical </em>did not address whether the reporting requirements in the statutory scheme (Pub. Contract Code, \u00a7 10115.5) may be severed and upheld.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The trial court in this case found they may not. Real parties in interest have cross-appealed, asserting that the reporting requirements should be severed and upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">Division One of the Court of Appeal, First Appellate District, addressed this issue in <em>Barlow v. Davis </em>(1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 1258 [85 Cal.Rptr.2d 752],  The appellate court held that, although the reporting requirements may be severed mechanically and grammatically from the invalid portions of the statutory scheme, and although the scheme includes a sever-ability clause (Pub. Contract Code, \u00a7 10115.8), the reporting requirements find efficacy only when they are correlated with the invalidated portions of the statutory scheme and thus cannot be functionally separated. <em>(Barlow </em>v. <em>Davis, supra, </em>72 Cal.App.4th at p. 1266.) We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">The Legislature\u2019s right to obtain accurate and up-to-date information on matters of public concern cannot be disputed. \u201cThe power of inquiry has been employed by Congress throughout our history, over the whole range of the national interests concerning which Congress might legislate or decide upon due investigation not to legislate; it has similarly been utilized in determining what to appropriate from the national purse, or whether to appropriate. The scope of the power of inquiry, in short, is as penetrating and far-reaching as the potential power to enact and appropriate under the Constitution.\u201d <em>(Barenblatt v. United States </em>(1959) 360 U.S. 109, 111 [79 S.Ct. 1081, 1085, 3 L.Ed.2d 1115, 1120].)</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">The broad nature of the power of inquiry and the importance thereof have been recognized under state law. \u201c[I]n many instances, in order to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>preparation of wise and timely laws the necessity of investigation of some sort must exist as an indispensable incident and auxiliary to the proper exercise of legislative power.\u201d <em>(In re Battelle </em>(1929) 207 Cal. 227, 241 [277 P. 725, 65 A.L.R. 1497]; see also <em>Special Assembly Int. Com. </em>v. <em>Southard </em>(1939) 13 Cal.2d 497, 503 [90 P.2d 304].)</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">In our tripartite system of government, legislative function is limited to declaring the law and providing the ways and means of its accomplishment. <em>(California Radioactive Materials Management Forum v. Department of Health Services </em>(1993) 15 Cal.App.4th 841, 870-871 [19 Cal.Rptr.2d 357], disapproved on another ground in <em>Carmel Valley Fire Protection Dist. </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 287, 305, fn. 5 [105 Cal.Rptr.2d 636, 20 P.3d 533].) The Legislature cannot exercise direct supervisorial control over the execution of the laws. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 872.) In this light, the statutory provisions that require data to be collected and reported to the Legislature cannot be intended as some sort of supervisorial device; they can be intended only as the basis for future legislative consideration, within the power of inquiry, with respect to the need for future legislative action.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">Irrespective of the substantive elements of the statutory scheme, information concerning the participation of minority and women business enterprises in state contracts can serve a number of important and valid legislative purposes. As we have noted earlier, it may indicate the need for further inquiry to determine whether specific discrimination is occurring. It may aid the Legislature in determining whether race-neutral and gender-neutral remedies are needed. It may aid the Legislature in determining whether a scheme that does not employ suspect classifications, such as an inclusive outreach scheme, is warranted. It also may satisfy the Legislature that no further legislative action is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">In these respects, the reporting requirements of the statutory scheme applicable to state contracting can serve a legislative interest separate from the substantive provisions of the scheme. The Legislature determined that the enactment of the substantive elements of the statutory scheme would not eliminate the need for further legislative inquiry, and neither will invalidation of the substantive elements of the scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">The reporting requirements contained in Public Contract Code section 10115.5, subdivision (a) can be severed mechanically and grammatically from the invalid portions of the act and, we conclude, may be severed functionally. Accordingly, we find the reporting provisions are valid and may be enforced separate from the invalid portions of the statutory scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">The judgment is reversed, and the cause is remanded to the trial court with directions to enter a judgment consistent with the conclusions in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">Morrison, J., and Callahan, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>Appendix A</p>\n<p id=\"Af\">State Lottery</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">The statutory provision challenged with respect to the state lottery is Government Code section 8880.56, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-6\">\u201c(a) Notwithstanding other provisions of law, the director may purchase or lease goods and services as are necessary for effectuating the purposes of this chapter.

It is a conscious, deliberate step taken by a hiring authority to assure equal employment opportunity for all staff, both academic and classified. These programs require the employer to make additional efforts to recruit, employ, and promote members of groups formerly excluded at the various levels of responsibility who meet statewide minimum qualifications, if any, and who, relative to local qualifications beyond the statewide minimum qualifications, are qualified or may become qualified through appropriate training or experience within a reasonable length of time. The programs should be designed to remedy the exclusion, whatever its cause.

Thus, when <em>Bakke </em>I, <em>Price, </em>and <em>DeRonde </em>were decided, it had not been established, as it now has, that strict scrutiny review applies to every racial classification regardless of whether it may be described as benign or remedial. Also, the California Supreme Court did not apply strict scrutiny in <em>Price </em>and <em>DeRonde </em>and, to that extent, those decisions are inconsistent with current equal protection jurisprudence. It is axiomatic that California\u2019s Constitution cannot permit the state to engage in conduct forbidden by the federal equal protection clause, and in <em>Price </em>(26 Cal.3d at pp. 284-285) and <em>DeRonde </em>(28 Cal.3d at p. 890), the court said that our state equal protection guarantee imposes no greater restrictions on affirmative action than are imposed by the federal Constitution.
