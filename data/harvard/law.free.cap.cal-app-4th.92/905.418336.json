J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aq5p\">In a session with his psychotherapist, a patient makes threatening statements about his ex-girlfriend. Penal Code section 422<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> makes it a crime to threaten another with great bodily injury or death even when that threat is made to a third party with the intent that it be conveyed to the victim. Here we conclude, among other things, that the patient\u2019s statements do not constitute a violation of section 422 even though the third party psychotherapist has a duty to warn the intended victim. It must be shown that the patient intended the threatening remarks to be communicated to the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">Fernando Felix appeals his judgment after conviction of kidnapping (count 8; Pen. Code, \u00a7 207, subd. (a)), making three terrorist threats (counts 5, 10 and 11; Pen Code, \u00a7 422), and leaving the scene of an accident (counts 6 and 7; Veh. Code, \u00a7 20001, subd. (a)). He was sentenced to state prison for eight years and four months. We reverse count 10, making a terrorist threat, but affirm all other counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">\n<em>The kidnapping</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b772-9\">Felix was the former boyfriend of Julia Luckhart. They previously lived together with her three-year-old daughter, Glenda. Luckhart obtained a restraining order preventing Felix from contacting her and going to Glenda\u2019s school.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-10\">Luckhart was at the Danbury School, carrying Glenda in a child\u2019s car seat. Felix grabbed the car seat from Luckhart and put Glenda in his car. Luckhart testified: \u201c[Felix] said that he was tired of . . .me trying to avoid him, so this is the only way that he can get to talk to me.\u201d She pleaded with him to give Glenda back, but he refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-11\">Luckhart got into Felix\u2019s car because she was afraid for her daughter\u2019s safety. Felix had her daughter and she \u201cknew he wouldn\u2019t give her back if [she] didn\u2019t do what he asked . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b773-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>Luckhart reminded Felix of the restraining order, but he said it would not keep him away. He told her he wanted to renew their relationship. She agreed with what he was saying, solely to pacify him. She was afraid of what he might do if she disagreed. During a \u201chalf hour, 45 minutes\u201d drive, she made at least 12 requests to Felix to take her home. He refused and told her she had to listen to him. He made three stops and left the car for brief periods of time. But she could not run to safety because Glenda\u2019s car seat was too heavy and Felix was watching her. He eventually drove her home.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">\n<em>Threats on May 27</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">Luckhart and her fianc\u00e9, Jon Peel, were at Henry Valencia\u2019s house at 4:00 p.m., when Felix drove up and honked his horn. Peel ran towards him. Felix drove forward and hit Peel. Valencia threw a brick through the windshield. Felix said, \u201cboth of you are dead motherfuckers.\u201d Two hours later, Felix telephoned Luckhart and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to fucking kill you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">\n<em>Felix\u2019s statements to jail psychologist</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b773-8\">Psychologist Carl Levinger testified that on June 18, during a therapy session in jail, Felix said \u201che was thinking about how he was going to kill [Luckhart] once he was released from jail.\u201d Felix told Levinger that he had made a death threat to Luckhart before and told her, \u201cI\u2019m not threatening you, I\u2019m making a promise.\u201d Levinger testified Felix said \u201cthat if he saw her with somebody else that he would shoot her and then the kids and then himself.\u201d Felix also said \u201cone of his friends would kill her if he asked him to.\u201d Levinger telephoned Luckhart three days later. When the prosecution asked Levinger what he told her, the court sustained an objection on relevance grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-9\">Luckhart testified that Levinger called her. But when the prosecution asked whether Levinger communicated threats to her, the court sustained an objection on hearsay grounds. Luckhart testified that after the call she went to her room, cried, and said, \u201cOh, my God, he\u2019s going to try to kill me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b773-10\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b773-11\">I. <em>Substantial evidence supports the conviction for kidnapping.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b773-12\">Felix contends the evidence was insufficient to support a conviction for kidnapping Luckhart.  In deciding the sufficiency of the evidence, we determine whether \u201c \u2018after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hatch </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 260, 272 [92 Cal.Rptr.2d 80, 991 P.2d 165].) We resolve neither credibility issues nor evidentiary conflicts, we look for substantial evidence. <em>(People v. Ochoa </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 1199, 1206 [26 Cal.Rptr.2d 23, 864 P.2d 103].)</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">\u201cEvery person who forcibly, or by any other means of instilling fear . . . takes . . . any person . . . into another part of the same county, is guilty of kidnapping.\u201d (\u00a7 207, subd. (a); <em>People v. Mayberry </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 143, 153 [125 Cal.Rptr. 745, 542 P.2d 1337].)  A defendant is guilty of kidnapping a parent where he or she takes the parent\u2019s child and the parent accompanies the defendant because of fear for the child\u2019s safety. <em>(People v. La Salle </em>(1980) 103 Cal.App.3d 139, 146-147 [162 Cal.Rptr. 816], overruled on other grounds in <em>People v. Kimble </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 480, 496, fn. 12 [244 Cal.Rptr. 148, 749 P.2d 803].) But \u201c[i]f a defendant entertains a reasonable and bona fide belief that a prosecutrix voluntarily consented to accompany him,\u201d this shows a lack of intent to commit the crime. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mayberry, supra, </em>at p. 155.)</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">Felix contends the evidence shows he believed Luckhart \u201cvoluntarily consented to accompany him.\u201d But he presented no evidence on this issue and Luckhart\u2019s testimony undermines his claim. Felix took Luckhart\u2019s daughter to force her to go with him. He admitted using the child as a tactic to achieve that result. He violated the restraining order and said it would not keep him away. This shows Felix knew Luckhart would not voluntarily go with him. She got in his car because she feared for her daughter\u2019s safety. She requested, at least a dozen times, that Felix take her home. But he refused and insisted that she listen to him. Although he made three stops, Luckhart could not run away because she knew Felix was watching her. From these facts the jury could reasonably infer Felix was guilty of kidnapping. <em>(People v. Galvan </em>(1986) 187 Cal.App.3d 1205, 1214-1215 [232 Cal.Rptr. 410]; <em>People v. La Salle, supra, </em>103 Cal.App.3d at pp. 146-147.)</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">Felix contends his motive was to renew their relationship. But \u201ca person who forcibly carries and transports another . . . against his or her will, is guilty of kidnapping \u2018however good or innocent [the defendant\u2019s] motive or intent may otherwise be . . . .\u2019\u201d <em>(People v. Kelly </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 931, 959 [275 Cal.Rptr. 160, 800 P.2d 516].)</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">II. <em>The trial court did not have to instruct that a good faith belief that the victim consented was a defense.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">Felix contends the court should have instructed that defendant\u2019s reasonable belief that the victim consented to accompany him is a defense to the crime. <em>(People v. Mayberry, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d at pp. 153-158.)</p>\n<p id=\"b775-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>The trial court has a sua sponte duty to instruct on defenses where there is substantial evidence to support the instruction. <em>(People v. Breverman </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 142, 157 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 870, 960 P.2d 1094].) Because we have concluded there was no substantial evidence to show that Felix reasonably believed Luckhart consented to go with him, there was no error. But even if the court erred, it is not reasonably probable that Felix would have obtained a more favorable outcome had the error not occurred. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 178.) Evidence of Felix\u2019s guilt was overwhelming. Felix grabbed Glenda and told Luckhart he took the child to force her to accompany him. He ignored 12 requests to take her home. Luckhart\u2019s testimony was uncontradicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">HI. <em>There was no substantial evidence that Felix made a terrorist threat against Luckhart to Levinger.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">Felix contends that the statements he made about killing during his psychological therapy were not threats. He contends count 10 therefore must be reversed. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">It is a crime to threaten another with death or great bodily harm. <em>(In re David L. </em>(1991) 234 Cal.App.3d 1655, 1657 [286 Cal.Rptr. 398]; \u00a7 422.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The crime requires \u201ca threat so \u2018unequivocal, unconditional, immediate, and specific\u2019 that it conveys to the victim an \u2018immediate prospect of execution.\u2019 \u201d <em>(In re David L., supra, </em>at p. 1659.) \u201c[S]ection 422 is violated as well when such a threat is communicated by the threatener to a third party and by him conveyed to the victim . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1657.) Section 422 therefore requires that the threatening statement be made with the specific intent to be taken as a threat.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">Where a psychologist reasonably believes that a patient is dangerous to another person, he or she has a duty to warn the intended victim. <em>(Tarasoff v. Regents of University of California </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 425, 442 [131 Cal.Rptr. 14, 551 P.2d 334, 83 A.L.R.3d 1166]; Evid. Code, \u00a7 1024.) This is a narrow exception to the psychotherapist-patient privilege and the psychologist may be required to testify against the patient in a criminal trial. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number><em>(People v. Wharton </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 522, 563 [280 Cal.Rptr. 631, 809 P.2d 290] [defendant waived the privilege by placing his mental state in issue].)</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">\n<em>Communication</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">Felix correctly contends that the prosecution had to prove that Levinger communicated his statements about killing to Luckhart. <em>(In re David L, supra, </em>234 Cal.App.3d at p. 1657.) It must establish \u201cthat <em>the threat </em>actually caused the person threatened \u2018to be in sustained fear . . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Toledo </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 221, 228 [109 Cal.Rptr.2d 315, 26 P.3d 1051], italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">But inexplicably, the trial court sustained Felix\u2019s objections to the content of the telephone call between Levinger and Luckhart on hearsay and relevance grounds. The conversation between Levinger and Luckhart, not offered for the truth of the matter asserted, was not hearsay, and might have been highly relevant. It could have shown whether in fact Levinger related a threat to Luckhart. The trial judge could have determined the relevance of this disputed preliminary fact by way of an Evidence Code section 402 hearing where Levinger could have testified out of the presence of the jury, about what he said to Luckhart. <em>(People v. Alcala </em>(1992) 4 Cal.4th <em>742,11A </em>[15 Cal.Rptr.2d 432, 842 P.2d 1192].) If Levinger had merely told Luckhart that Felix was dangerous and that she should be careful, the objection should have been sustained. Levinger testified he called Luckhart, she testified she talked to him, but neither of them testified about what Levinger said. Therefore there was no evidence that Levinger told Luckhart the content of Felix\u2019s statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">The Attorney General states that after the call Luckhart said, \u201cOh, my God, he\u2019s going to try to kill me.\u201d He contends it can be inferred that Levinger must have told her what Felix said. But there must be evidence to support an inference and the prosecution may not fill an evidentiary gap with speculation. <em>(People v. Godwin </em>(1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 1562, 1573 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 545]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bledsoe </em>(1946) 75 Cal.App.2d 862, 864-865 [171 P.2d 950]; 3 Witkin, Cal. Evidence (4th ed. 2000) Presentation, \u00a7 141, p. 202.) A therapist is not required to disclose the patient\u2019s statements when giving a <em>Tarasoff </em>warning. <em>(Menendez </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 435, 451 [11 Cal.Rptr.2d 92, 834 P.2d 786].) Levinger could have achieved the same reaction from Luckhart, without mentioning Felix\u2019s statements, by simply warning her that Felix was dangerous. <em>(People v. Wharton, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 562 [psychiatrist\u2019s warning did not reveal patient\u2019s remarks but only told the victim, \u201c \u2018[y]ou\u2019re in a very dangerous situation. I think you should get out. . . .\u2019\u201d].) Luckhart\u2019s statements might have been prompted by the threats made on May 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>The Attorney General\u2019s reliance on <em>In re David L. </em>is misplaced because there the prosecution proved that the third party informed the victim of the defendant\u2019s remarks. <em>(In re David L, supra, </em>234 Cal.App.3d at p. 1658.) That is not the case here. But even if it were, the prosecution still had to prove another element.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">\n<em>Intent</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">Felix contends that he did not intend his statements to Levinger to be threats, they were only statements made as part of his therapy. Section 422 was not enacted to punish emotional outbursts, it targets only those who try to instill fear in others. <em>(In re Ricky T. </em>(2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 1132, 1141 [105 Cal.Rptr.2d 165].) \u201cOne may, in private, curse one\u2019s enemies, pummel pillows, and shout revenge for real or imagined wrongs\u2014safe from section 422 sanction.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Teal </em>(1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 277, 281 [71 Cal.Rptr.2d 644].)</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">Levinger objected to testifying because Felix was his patient and Felix objected contending that his communications were privileged. The prosecution conceded that Felix\u2019s statements were made during a therapy session, but successfully argued they were admissible under <em>Tarasoff.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b777-8\">The Attorney General contends Felix \u201cintended for the threat to be communicated to Luckhart, as it was understandable for appellant to believe Dr. Levinger would warn Luckhart . . . .\u201d But there is no evidence Felix knew about <em>Tarasoff. </em>Moreover, there was no evidence that Felix knew Levinger would disclose his statements to Luckhart or that he wanted them to be revealed. He only told Levinger Luckhart\u2019s first name. There is nothing in the record showing that Levinger told Felix that he would contact her. \u201cWhere the threat is conveyed through a third party intermediary, the specific intent element of the statute is implicated. Thus, if the threatener intended the threat to be taken seriously by the victim, he must necessarily have intended it to be conveyed.\u201d <em>(In re David L., supra, </em>234 Cal.App.3d at p. 1659.) In <em>In re David L., </em>the defendant knew that the third party would convey the threat to the victim because the victim and the third party were friends. But here there was no such evidence. On the other hand, if Felix had said to Levinger, \u201cyou can tell Luckhart that I am going to kill her,\u201d he would undoubtedly be in violation of section 422.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-9\">Moreover, in evaluating intent, the setting in which the defendant makes the remarks must be considered. \u201cWhen determining whether an alleged threat falls outside the realm of protected speech, it is important to focus on the context of the expression.\u201d <em>(United States v. Bellrichard </em>(8th Cir. 1993) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>994 F.2d 1318, 1321; see also <em>United States v. Hoffman </em>(7th Cir. 1986) 806 F.2d 703, 704; <em>Watts v. U.S. </em>(1969) 394 U.S. 705, 706 [89 S.Ct. 1399, 1400-1401, 22 L.Ed.2d 664].)</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">Similarly, \u201c[s]ection 422 demands that the purported threat be examined \u2018on its face and under the circumstances in which it was made.\u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Ricky T., supra, </em>87 Cal.App.4th 1132, 1137.) Felix made his remarks while discussing highly personal thoughts about homicide, suicide, and his emotions for Luckhart. He made them in a setting where the patient has an expectation of confidentiality. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1014; <em>Scull v. Superior Court </em>(1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 784, 788 [254 Cal.Rptr. 24].) \u201c[A] psychotherapist\u2019s capacity to provide effective treatment requires that a patient \u2018 \u201c. . . bare his entire self, his dreams, his fantasies, his sins and his shame. . . .\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Scull, supra, </em>at p. 789.) \u201c[S]ection 422 is not violated by mere angry utterances or ranting soliloquies, however violent.\u201d <em>(People v. Teal, supra, </em>61 Cal.App.4th at p. 281.) Where the patient fantasizes about killing in private, this is not an offense under section 422. <em>(Teal, </em>at p. 281; <em>U.S. v. Alkahabaz </em>(6th Cir. 1997) 104 F.3d 1492, 1496 [defendant\u2019s act of e-mailing a friend fantasies about torturing and killing another student was insufficient to support indictment for transmitting interstate threats].)</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">The Attorney General notes that Levinger gave a <em>Tarasoff </em>warning and Felix used threatening language. But the warning only shows that Levinger thought Felix might be dangerous and the prosecution may not prove the offense by simply relying on Felix\u2019s words. <em>(Menendez </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>3 Cal.4th at p. 451; <em>In re Ricky T, supra, </em>87 Cal.App.4th at p. 1137; compare <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Glass </em>(10th Cir. 1998) 133 F.3d 1356, 1359.) It must also prove he specifically intended those words to be threats. <em>(People v. Teal, supra, </em>61 Cal.App.4th at p. 281; <em>In re David L., supra, </em>234 Cal.App.3d at p. 1659.)</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">The prosecution showed that Felix made his remarks 45 minutes into his therapy session. But it produced no evidence about what preceded them, why he made them, whether they were in response to therapy, or what Felix wanted Levinger to do about them. There is no evidence that Levinger advised Felix about \u201c \u2018the relevant limitations on confidentiality\u2019 \u201d of the session, or that Felix knew about them. <em>(U.S. </em>v. <em>Hayes </em>(6th Cir. 2000) 227 F.3d 578, 586.)</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">\u201c[T]he open and confidential character of psychotherapeutic dialogue encourages patients to express threats of violence . . . .\u201d <em>(Tarasoff v. Regents of University of California, supra, </em>17 Cal.3d at p. 441.) Psychoanalysts often try to probe deeply into the psyche to measure stress and the origins of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>aberrations. <em>(Edwards </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 905, 911 [130 Cal.Rptr. 14, 549 P.2d 846].) But there was no testimony regarding the scope of this session. There was no evidence as to whether anything Levinger did brought these remarks out or whether they were purely voluntary. Because the prosecution did not adequately prove the factual setting involving Felix\u2019s remarks, it did not show whether his words were the product of therapy, ranting soliloquies, or a crime. The prosecution must prove sufficient facts to show that the defendant\u2019s words fell squarely within section 422. <em>(In re Ricky T., supra, </em>87 Cal.App.4th at p. 1139.) It did not do that.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">Moreover, to apply the Attorney General\u2019s position here would mean that those who need therapy for their homicidal thoughts would not seek it. <em>(Scull </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>206 Cal.App.3d at p. 788.) They could view the jail psychologist as a police agent and the therapy session as self-incrimination. <em>(Estelle v. Smith </em>(1981) 451 U.S. 454, 461-462 [101 S.Ct. 1866, 1872-1873, 68 L.Ed.2d 359].) Instead of exposing their thoughts for treatment they might repress them and act on them. Such a result would not further the interests of victims, psychotherapy, or the criminal justice system.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">We conclude the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction on count 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">TV. <em>Section 654</em></p>\n<p id=\"b779-8\">Felix contends that the two threats on May 27 (counts 5 and 11) were improperly prosecuted and punished as separate crimes. He states that under section 654 they were part of an indivisible course of conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-9\">The trial court imposed an eight-month consecutive sentence for each of these two terrorist threat convictions. (\u00a7 422.)  \u201c[S]ection 654 prohibits multiple punishment for an indivisible course of conduct. . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Chacon </em>(1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 52, 65 [43 Cal.Rptr.2d 434].) But multiple crimes are not one transaction where the defendant had a chance to reflect between offenses and each offense created a new risk of harm. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Massie </em>(1967) 66 Cal.2d 899, 908 [59 Cal.Rptr. 733, 428 P.2d 869]; <em>People v. Kwok </em>(1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1236, 1253-1256 [75 Cal.Rptr.2d 40].) \u201cSeparate sentencing is permitted for offenses that are divisible in time . . . .\u201d <em>(People v. Kwok, supra, </em>at p. 1254.)</p>\n<p id=\"b779-10\">The trial court could reasonably infer that each threat was a separate crime. They were not connected because Felix made them at different times at different places. Although Felix made two threats on May 27, the first was directed at two victims, the second was exclusively against Luckhart. Felix <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>contends these crimes were part of a pattern of anger against Luckhart. But Felix had time to reflect before making the second threat. The trial court could reasonably infer that because of his anger he intended the second threat to cause new emotional harm to Luckhart. Felix has not shown error.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">The judgment is reversed as to count 10.
