As a result of the shooting, the woman entered a nolo contendere plea to a felony (assault with a firearm), and she also suffered a civil judgment against her and in favor of the man. The woman is bankrupt but she had homeowner\u2019s insurance at the time of the shooting, and the man wants to collect his judgment from her insurer. The policy excludes coverage for \u201cbodily injury . . . which is a foreseeable result of an intentional or criminal act of [the] insured or which is in fact intended by [the] insured.\u201d In the insurer\u2019s declaratory relief action against the man, the trial court granted the insurer\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The man appeals, claiming there are questions of fact about the woman\u2019s intent at the time of the shooting. We affirm on the ground that the \u201ccriminal act\u201d exclusion applies without regard to the insured\u2019s intent and (based on the undisptited facts of this case) without regard to the doctrine of collateral estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1190\">*1190</page-number>Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b994-4\">Armed with a semi-automatic handgun, Susan Paster entered Hugh Schurtz\u2019s residence and shot at Schurtz, grazing his forehead and finger. Paster was arrested and charged with attempted murder and assault with a firearm, with an allegation that she had personally used a firearm. (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 664, 187, subd. (a), 245, subd. (a)(2), 12022.5, subds. (a), (d), 1192.7, subd. (c)(8).) Paster entered a not guilty plea and denied the allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-5\">About three weeks later, Schurtz sued Paster for damages on three intentional tort theories (assault, battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress), alleging in his verified complaint that Paster had pointed a loaded gun at his temple, threatened to kill him, then \u201cintentionally and willfully discharged [the] handgun ... for the purpose of killing [him].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b994-6\">In December 1994, in her criminal case, Paster entered a plea of nolo contendere to one felony count (assault with a firearm) and admitted the personal use allegation. The trial court accepted Paster\u2019s waiver of her trial rights, found a factual basis for Paster\u2019s plea and admission, found Paster guilty of assault with a firearm, found true the allegation that Paster had personally used the gun, and accepted Paster\u2019s plea as one to a serious felony within the meaning of Penal Code section 1192.7. (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 245, subd. (a)(2), 12022.5, subds. (a), (d).) As part of a negotiated disposition, Paster was taken into custody the same day and sent to state prison for a diagnostic evaluation with the understanding that, when completed, the evaluation would be relied on by the court to determine whether Paster would be sentenced to state prison for a term of five years or placed on probation. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1203.03.) The attempted murder count was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-7\">In July 1995, Schurtz filed an amended (unverified) complaint in his civil action, adding a cause of action for negligence and alleging that Paster had \u201ccarelessly and negligently\u201d ingested drugs and alcohol, then gone to Schurtz\u2019s house and brandished a pistol and waved it about, which \u201cresulted] in the pistol discharging in the direction of, and near . . . Schurtz.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b994-8\">Paster answered Schurtz\u2019s first amended complaint, then tendered the defense of Schurtz\u2019s action to 20th Century Insurance Company (her homeowner\u2019s insurer at the time of the shooting).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Subject to a reservation of rights, 20th Century agreed to defend Paster, and lawyers were retained to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1191\">*1191</page-number>represent her in Schurtz\u2019s action. In October 1997, Paster, Schurtz, and their lawyers executed a stipulation in which (1) Paster \u201cadmit[ted] liability for all injuries and damages suffered by . . . Schurtz\u201d on his negligence cause of action, (2) Schurtz dismissed his intentional tort causes of action, and (3) the parties agreed that \u201cthe only issue to be submitted to the trier of fact... at trial [would] be [Schurtz\u2019s] damages.\u201d The stipulation was not signed or approved by 20th Century.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-4\">In the fall of 1997, Schurtz testified at his deposition that Paster had gained entry to his house by breaking a window, that she woke him by hitting him on the head with her fist or the gun, held the gun at his head, and said it wasn\u2019t a joke. When he started to get up,, she \u201cput the gun at [his] crotch,\u201d told him not to move, put the gun back to his head and said, \u201cThe bullet\u2019s in the chamber. You\u2019re dead.\u201d He leaned forward and \u201c[t]he gun fired.\u201d About one week later, Paster testified at her deposition that she never intended to inflict any kind of injury on Schurtz, that she always carried a gun for protection, and that she took her gun out of her purse at Schurtz\u2019s house only after he woke up, got up, and frightened her. The gun went off accidentally as he struggled to get it away from her.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b995-5\">In August 1998, Schurtz\u2019s damages were tried to a jury, which awarded him $103,838.66. 20th Century refused to pay the judgment, and (in March 1999) sued Paster and Schurtz for declaratory relief, asking for a judicial determination that it was not obligated to pay Schurtz\u2019s judgment against Paster\u2014on the ground that the policy expressly excluded coverage for \u201cbodily injury . . . which is a foreseeable result of an intentional or criminal act of [the] insured or which is in fact intended by [the] insured.\u201d (Ins. Code, \u00a7 533.) Schurtz answered and cross-complained against 20th Century, alleging a direct right of recovery and asking for damages in the amount of his judgment against Paster. (Ins. Code, \u00a7 11580.)</p>\n<p id=\"b995-6\">20th Century moved for summary judgment on the ground that Schurtz\u2019s injuries were the result of Paster\u2019s intentional and criminal act and, as such, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1192\">*1192</page-number>expressly excluded from coverage by the terms of Paster\u2019s insurance policy. 20th Century\u2019s evidence (documents from Paster\u2019s criminal case, and the pleadings and deposition transcripts from Schurtz\u2019s civil action against Paster) established Paster\u2019s plea of nolo contendere, her admission of the gun use allegation, the criminal court\u2019s finding of guilt, and Schurtz\u2019s admission that Paster had awakened him by hitting him with her fist or the gun, then threatened to kill him.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-4\">In his opposition to 20th Century\u2019s motion, Schurtz picked at some nits (for example, whether the transcript of Paster\u2019s plea was of a \u201cplea\u201d or a \u201cplea hearing,\u201d whether Schurtz\u2019s civil action was filed on October 24 or October 28, 1997, and other matters of equal weight and significance) but otherwise admitted the material facts relied on by 20th Century\u2014except those pertaining to Paster\u2019s intent at the time of the shooting. Schurtz offered Paster\u2019s deposition testimony to show that, notwithstanding Paster\u2019s criminal conviction and Schurtz\u2019s original complaint for intentional tort damages, Paster was acting in self-defense when she took her gun from her purse, that she never intended to injure Schurtz, and that her actions were negligent, not intentional.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-5\">The trial court granted 20th Century\u2019s motion for summary judgment, finding (among other things) that Paster\u2019s plea of nolo contendere to assault with a firearm and her admission of the gun use allegation were based on the same acts as Schurtz\u2019s tort claims against Paster, that 20th Century\u2019s policy excluded coverage for bodily injury that was the foreseeable result of an intentional or criminal act, that Paster was engaged in a criminal act at the time of the shooting, that the ensuing struggle and bodily injury were foreseeable results of her act and that, as a result, there was no coverage under 20th Century\u2019s policy. Schurtz appeals from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b996-7\">Schurtz contends there are triable issues of material fact concerning Paster\u2019s intent at the time Schurtz was shot and, therefore, about whether her actions were criminal. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-9\">At the time this case was before the trial court, 20th Century\u2019s exclusion of coverage for injuries caused by an \u201cintentional or criminal act\u201d was treated as a legal redundancy, and no real distinction was made between an act that might be one but not the other. So viewed (as it is by Schurtz on this appeal), the summary judgment probably could not stand. <em>(Teitelbaum. Furs, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1193\">*1193</page-number><em>Inc. v. Dominion Ins. Co., Ltd. </em>(1962) 58 Cal.2d 601, 603-606 [25 Cal.Rptr. 559, 375 P.2d 439] [in a subsequent civil case, a final judgment of conviction in a prior criminal case conclusively bars relitigation of any issue necessarily decided in the criminal case <em>except </em>where the prior criminal case has been resolved by guilty plea rather than trial, in which event the guilty plea is admissible in a subsequent civil action only as an admission]; see also <em>Pease </em>v. <em>Pease </em>(1988) 201 Cal.App.3d 29, 30, 32-34 [246 Cal.Rptr. 762] [a trial court in a civil case may not give collateral estoppel effect to a criminal conviction involving the same issues of the conviction resulting from a guilty plea]; <em>Yarbrough v.

Since the means by which Paster stands convicted are irrelevant in this context, it follows that 20th Century\u2019s motion for summary judgment was properly granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-6\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-7\">In <em>Safeco Ins. Co. v. Robert S. </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 758 [110 Cal.Rptr.2d 844, 28 P.3d 889], our Supreme Court held that, notwithstanding an exclusion of coverage for bodily injury arising out of an \u201cillegal act,\u201d an insurer is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1194\">*1194</page-number>obligated to defend and indemnify its insureds in a wrongful death action brought against them after their teenage son \u201caccidentally\u201d shot and killed his friend (as a result of which the son was made a ward of the juvenile court after a petition charging him with involuntary manslaughter was sustained). <em>(Id. </em>at p. 761.) In <em>Safeco, </em>where the policy did not have a \u201ccriminal act\u201d exclusion, the Supreme Court explained the ambiguity of the language that <em>was </em>used and, in that context, made it clear that the ambiguity could have been avoided by the use of a \u201ccriminal act\u201d exclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-4\">\u201cSafeco agreed to defend and indemnify the insureds in the event of claims brought against any insured for bodily injury caused by \u2018an occurrence,\u2019 which the policy defined as an accident resulting in bodily injury during the policy period. Excluded from coverage was liability for bodily injury \u2018arising out of any <em>illegal act </em>committed by or at the direction of an insured.\u2019 (Italics added.) The policy did not define the term \u2018illegal act.\u2019 [1D ... [ID</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-6\">\u201c. . . The phrase \u2018illegal act\u2019 is susceptible of two reasonable meanings. . . . [T]he Court of Appeal, relying on a dictionary definition, construed the term broadly, as meaning any act prohibited by law. But the term can also be interpreted more narrowly as meaning a violation of criminal law. This is the construction Safeco urges us to adopt. Certain thesaurases do treat the term \u2018illegal\u2019 as synonymous with \u2018criminal.\u2019 . . . If we were to adopt this meaning in the context of the policy here, we would have to treat the policy\u2019s clause excluding coverage for an \u2018illegal act\u2019 as the equivalent of a clause excluding coverage for a \u2018criminal act.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-7\">\u201cThe policy before us, however, contains not a <em>criminal act </em>exclusion but an <em>illegal act </em>exclusion. <em>Had Safeco wanted to exclude criminal acts from coverage, it could have easily done so. Insurers commonly insert an exclusion for criminal acts in their liability policies. </em>(Croskey &amp; Kaufman, Cal. Practice Guide: Insurance Litigation (The Rutter Group 2000) 7:331.5, 7:2256, pp. 7A-86, 71-23 . . . .) Because Safeco chose not to have a criminal act exclusion, instead opting for an illegal act exclusion, we cannot read into the policy what Safeco has omitted. To do so would violate the fundamental principle that in interpreting contracts, including insurance contracts, courts are not to insert what has been omitted. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-9\">\u201cWe now consider the Court of Appeal\u2019s construction of the term \u2018illegal\u2019 as meaning [a] violation of <em>any </em>law, whether civil or criminal. . . . That construction, however, is so broad as to render the policy\u2019s liability coverage practically meaningless. HD For instance, a violation of \u2018any law\u2019 would include the law governing negligence, which holds individuals responsible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1195\">*1195</page-number>for the failure to exercise ordinary care resulting in injury to another. . . . The duty to exercise ordinary care is imposed by law. ... A violation of that duty is therefore <em>a violation of law. </em>Broadly construed, a violation of <em>any </em>law, whether civil or criminal, is an illegal act. An insured\u2019s negligent act, being a violation of law and therefore <em>an illegal act, </em>would thus not be covered under Safeco\u2019s policy excluding coverage for an insured\u2019s illegal acts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b999-4\">\u201cBut the homeowners policy that the insureds here bought from Safeco expressly provided that Safeco would defend and indemnify them for bodily injury caused by \u2018an occurrence,\u2019 which the policy defines as \u2018an accident . . . which results, during the policy period, in bodily injury or property damage.\u2019 Because the term \u2018accident\u2019 is more comprehensive than the term \u2018negligence\u2019 and thus includes negligence . . . , Safeco\u2019s homeowners policy promised coverage for liability resulting from the insured\u2019s negligent acts. That promise would be rendered illusory if, as discussed above, we were to construe the phrase \u2018illegal act,\u2019 as contained in the policy\u2019s exclusionary clause, to mean violation of any law, whether criminal or civil. When reasonably practical, contracts are to be interpreted in a manner that makes them reasonable and capable of being carried into effect, and that is consistent with the parties\u2019 intent. . . . [10 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 HD</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b999-5\">\u201cIt is not clear how the Court of Appeal defined the word \u2018illegal\u2019 as it is used in the exclusionary clause. <em>If the Court of Appeal construed the exclusionary clause as excluding every offense, that is, every crime, it defines the word \u2018illegal\u2019 as meaning \u2018criminal.\u2019 As we have seen, that definition is inappropriate here because it rewrites the policy by inserting what has been omitted. . . .</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b999-6\">\u201cAs we noted earlier, \u2018ambiguous terms are resolved in the insureds\u2019 favor, consistent with the insureds\u2019 reasonable expectations.\u2019 . . . An insured should not be expected to know the subtle legal distinctions between the concepts of ordinary negligence and gross negligence. Such distinctions are not objectively within the reasonable expectations of the insured. HQ . . . [1Q In short, because the illegal act exclusion cannot reasonably be given meaning under established rules of construction of a contract, it must be rejected as invalid. . . .\u201d <em>(Safeco Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Robert S., supra, </em>26 Cal.4th at pp. 762-766, some italics added, fn. omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b999-7\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-8\">The corollary of the <em>Safeco </em>rule is that where, as here, an insurer <em>does </em>want to exclude criminal acts from coverage and <em>has </em>expressly done so in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1196\">*1196</page-number>language that is clear and unambiguous, the exclusion will be given effect. <em>(Safeco Ins.

Co., Ltd., supra, </em>58 Cal.2d at pp. 605-606.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-6\">But 20th Century\u2019s policy also excludes coverage for an injury resulting from a <em>criminal act, </em>and there can be no dispute that Paster committed a criminal act. No matter how often she and Schurtz redefine the facts surrounding the shooting, the evidence is <em>undisputed that Paster was convicted of a felony. </em>(Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 245, subd. (a)(2), 12022.5, subds. (a), (d).) This is <em>not </em>a matter of an admission by Paster or Schurtz. The <em>conviction </em>is undisputed and indisputable. And although Schurtz now contends that Paster\u2019s conduct was not criminal because it was not intentional, Schurtz\u2019s characterization of the legal effect of Paster\u2019s act cannot change the undisputed fact that she was convicted of a crime. <em>(Allstate Ins.

That evening, she was at the new house. She drank several beers (\u201cpossibly\u201d more than 10). She took a Valium. Later, she drove to her other house to feed her cats. When the cats weren\u2019t where she expected to find them, she drove to the front of Schurtz\u2019s house (his lot adjoins her backyard), parked on the wrong side of the street, got out of her car carrying her purse (in which she had the gun she always carried, a Clock), and walked to Schurtz\u2019s house in search of her cats. She thought his house was vacant (because it was undergoing earthquake repairs) and noticed the side door was open. Curious about the repairs, she entered the house, turned on the light, and saw Schurtz asleep on a sofa. Schurtz awoke, jumped out of bed, and landed on the floor next to Paster. Frightened, Paster took the gun from her purse.

As the Supreme Court reminded us this year, the <em>Teitelbaum Furs </em>rule is alive and well in California. <em>(Coscia v. McKenna &amp; Cuneo </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 1194, 1204 [108 Cal.Rptr.2d 471, 25 P.3d 670] [holding that, in light of compelling considerations peculiar to a legal malpractice claim arising out of a criminal conviction, \u201can intact conviction precludes recovery in a legal malpractice action even when ordinary collateral estoppel principles otherwise are not controlling, for example because a conviction was based upon a plea of guilty that would not be conclusive in a subsequent civil action involving the same issues\u201d].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1001-5\"><em>Calvillo-Silva </em>construes section 847 of the Civil Code, which provides that a landowner is not liable for injuries sustained by a person during the commission of specified crimes while on the landowner\u2019s property\u2014unless the landowner\u2019s conduct was willful, wanton, or criminal, or unless his property was dangerous within the meaning of the statute. In <em>Calvillo-Silva, </em>a robber sued his victim for personal injury damages. The victim moved for summary judgment, and presented evidence of the robber\u2019s plea of nolo contendere to one count of felony grand theft, plus the victim\u2019s declaration to the effect that he shot in self-defense. The trial court granted summary judgment but the Court of Appeal reversed. The Supreme Court granted review to determine \u201cthe scope of the statutory immunity, and in particular to consider whether [Civil Code] section 847 protects the intentional use of deadly force when a statutorily enumerated felony has been committed.\u201d <em>(Calvillo-Silva v. Home Grocery, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at p. 718.) The Supreme Court held that immunity is available to one who acts in self-defense but agreed with the Court of Appeal that there were triable issues of material fact concerning the reasonableness of the landowner\u2019s conduct. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 736-737.) In a footnote apparently included for the benefit of the trial court on remand, the majority opinion holds that, <em>under Civil Code section 847, \u201ca person who is convicted of a statutorily enumerated offense pursuant to a plea bargain or a plea of nolo contendere is barred from arguing that the conviction may be disregarded in determining the statute\u2019s application. . . . Accordingly, under [Civil Code] section 847plaintiff may not contest involvement in an attempted grand theft and may not litigate the facts behind his nolo contendere plea to avoid triggering the statute\u2019s application.\u201d (Calvillo-Silva v. Home Grocery, supra, </em>19 Cal,4th at p. 736, fn. 18, italics added.) Justice Werdegar disagreed with the quoted passage, pointing out in her concurring and dissenting opinion that, \u201cunder well-settled California law, a conviction by plea of guilty or no contest <em>does not preclude the convicted person from relitigating issues of guilty conduct or intent in a subsequent civil trial, </em>although the plea, whether guilty or no contest, is relevant and admissible against the convicted felon to show his or her factual guilt.\u201d <em>(Calvillo-Silva </em>v. <em>Home Grocery, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at p. 737 (cone. &amp; dis. opn. of Werdegar, J.).) In light of the Supreme Court\u2019s subsequent <em>unanimous </em>decision in <em>Coscia v. McKenna &amp; Cuneo, supra, </em>25 Cal.4th 1194, we view <em>Calvillo-Silva\u2019&amp; </em>holding vis-\u00e1-vis a guilty or no contest plea in the context of Civil Code section 847 as the same sort of exception to the rule of <em>Teitelbaum Furs </em>identified in <em>Coscia. (Coscia v. McKenna &amp; Cuneo, supra, </em>25 Cal ,4th at p. 1204 [\u201cwe hold that an intact conviction precludes recovery in a legal malpractice action even when ordinary collateral estoppel principles otherwise are not controlling, for example because a conviction was based upon a plea of guilty that would not be conclusive in a subsequent civil action involving the same issues\u201d].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1001-6\">At oral argument, we expressed concern about the opportunity for collusion inherent in the application of <em>Teitelbaum Furs </em>to the facts of this case.

We also asked the parties to discuss judicial estoppel. These issues are addressed in the concurring opinions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b1002-6\">VOGEL (MIRIAM A.), J.</author>\n<p id=\"A16M\">Obviously, I concur in the opinion I authored. I write separately to emphasize two points.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-7\">First, I agree with the notion that Schurtz <em>should </em>be bound under the <em>D\u2019Amico </em>rationale, but I have doubts about whether that approach would work where, as here, Schurtz\u2019s rights under Paster\u2019s insurance policy are derivative and dependent upon Paster\u2019s position. <em>Safeco </em>makes it unnecessary to step into that quagmire.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-8\">Second, there is nothing in the lead opinion that is inconsistent with <em>Teitelbaum Furs. </em>As explained in part C, the evidence about Paster\u2019s felony conviction is undisputed and indisputable. My analysis has nothing to do with admissions or collateral estoppel.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b1002-9\">ORTEGA, Acting P. J., Concurring.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqt\">I agree with everything in the lead opinion except part A. There, the opinion points out that at the time the matter was in the trial court, there was no real distinction between an intentional act and a criminal act and that so viewed, \u201cthe summary judgment probably could not stand. [Citing <em>Teitelbaum Furs, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dominion Ins. Co. Ltd. </em>(1962) 58 Cal.2d 601 [25 Cal.Rptr. 559, 375 P.2d 439.]\u201d I think the summary judgment granted 20th Century must stand, either under the current <em>post-Safeco </em>environment or as the matter previously presented itself in the trial court. I agree that <em>Teitelbaum </em>\u201cis alive and well.\u201d I just do not think it is of any assistance to Schurtz. Irrespective of how Paster was convicted, Schurtz adamantly proclaimed throughout that Paster had deliberately tried to kill him. He did so in letters to the Probation Department and the trial court, in his deposition, and in a verified complaint. Only in a subsequent unverified amendment did he try to trump everything with his wholly inconsistent negligence claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-10\">Irrespective of <em>Teitelbaum, </em>which would preclude collateral estoppel based on Paster\u2019s plea, if we were considering this matter <em>pre-Safeco </em>I would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1199\">*1199</page-number>terminate Schurtz\u2019s case against 20th Century based on his own insistence throughout that Paster\u2019s assault was deliberate and intentional. I would not indulge Schurtz in his subsequent negligence ploy, plainly hatched for the purpose of gaining access to Paster\u2019s insurance policy. Nor do I see a triable issue of fact just because Paster has joined the scheme.</p>\n<author id=\"b1003-4\">MALLANO, J., Concurring.</author>\n<p id=\"A55\">Schurtz alleged in a verified complaint that Paster \u201cpointed a loaded gun at his temple, threatened to kill him, then \u2018intentionally and willfully discharged [the] handgun ... for the purpose of killing [him].\u201d\u2019 (Lead opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1190.) At his deposition, Schurtz testified that Paster \u201cgained entry to his house by breaking a window, that she woke him by hitting him on the head with her fist or the gun, held the gun at his head, and said it wasn\u2019t a joke. When he started to get up, she \u2018put the gun at [his] crotch,\u2019 told him not to move, put the gun back to his head and said, \u2018The bullet\u2019s in the chamber. You\u2019re dead.\u2019 He leaned forward and \u2018[t]he gun fired.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1191.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-5\">Thus, by his twice-sworn admission, Schurtz has established facts that fall squarely into the criminal act exclusion of Paster\u2019s policy. Based on the rationale of <em>D\u2019Amico </em>v. <em>Board of Medical Examiners </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 1 [112 Cal.Rptr. 786, 520 P.2d 10] <em>(D\u2019Amico), </em>I conclude that the trial court properly granted 20th Century\u2019s summary judgment motion. As is stated in <em>D\u2019Amico, </em>\u201c \u2018When discovery, properly used, makes it \u201cperfectly plain that there is no substantial issue to be tried\u201d [citations], [summary judgment] is available for prompt disposition of the case.\u2019 [Citations.] RD Moreover, when discovery has produced an <em>admission </em>or concession on the part of the party opposing summary judgment which demonstrates that there is no factual issue to be tried, certain of those stem requirements applicable in a normal case are relaxed or altered in their operation. Thus, in <em>King </em>v. <em>Andersen </em>[(1966)] 242 Cal.App.2d 606 [51 Cal.Rptr. 561], the rule providing for liberal construction of counteraffidavits was held not to require reversal of a summary judgment for defendants where the plaintiff in an assault case, although having stated in his counteraffidavit that unnecessary force was used, nevertheless had stated in a previous deposition that no force was used; refusing to find that a triable issue was thus presented, the court said; \u2018Where, as here, however, there is a clear and unequivocal <em>admission </em>by the plaintiff, himself, in his deposition . . . we are forced to conclude there is no <em>substantial </em>evidence of the existence of a triable issue of fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>(D\u2019Amico, supra, </em>11 Cal.3d at p. 21, fn. omitted, some italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-6\">If <em>D\u2019Amico </em>prevents Schurtz from avoiding the force of his admissions in his verified complaint and deposition testimony\u2014that he was injured during a criminal act committed by Paster\u2014by offering his own sworn statement to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1200\">*1200</page-number>the contrary, it also follows that he cannot do so on the basis of Paster\u2019s sworn statement denying criminal culpability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-4\">I am concerned about the rationale of the lead opinion, which states, as I understand it, that Paster\u2019s admission of her criminal conviction in and of itself triggers her policy\u2019s criminal act exclusion. I can foresee other situations where an insured pleads guilty to a crime to obtain the benefit of a plea bargain, yet the \u201cvictim\u201d of the \u201ccrime\u201d takes the position that there was no crime and claims that there is coverage under the insured\u2019s policy, notwithstanding a criminal act exclusion. Why should the insured be allowed to make a binding determination by pleading guilty that there was a criminal act for the purposes of policy coverage? I do not wish to foreclose what under present law might be a viable action against an insurer by a party claiming to be injured by an insured in a situation where it is disputed whether a criminal act caused the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-5\">Finally, it seems that the lead opinion contradicts <em>Teitelbaum Furs, Inc. v. Dominion Ins. Co., Ltd. </em>(1962) 58 Cal.2d 601 [25 Cal.Rptr. 559, 375 P.2d 439]. Under that case, Paster\u2019s plea of nolo contendere may be used as an admission, but not for the purposes of collateral estoppel. Yet, if Paster\u2019s admission of a criminal conviction conclusively establishes a criminal act for the purposes of her policy\u2019s criminal act exclusion, it would appear that her plea is being used for more than just an admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-6\">A petition for a rehearing was denied November 2, 2001, and appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied January 23, 2002.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
