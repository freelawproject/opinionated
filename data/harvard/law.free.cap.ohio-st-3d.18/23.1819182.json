It is axiomatic that a writ of mandamus will issue only upon a showing by the requesting party that he has no adequate legal remedy. Appellant cannot make such a showing with regard to her request concerning the Industrial Commission\u2019s July 15 order. That order has been vacated and all benefits have been restored: The issue is, therefore, moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-12\">Additionally, appellant has failed to show that she has exhausted her \u00e1dministrative remedies with respect to her allegations concerning the propriety of Binkowitz\u2019s actions at the deposition. Appellant has not sought an order from the commission directing Dr. Davies to answer her questions, and the commission has not issued an order stating that the questions are irrelevant and need not be answered. Furthermore, the commission has not issued a final order either maintaining or withdrawing appellant\u2019s death benefits. Since the commission has not issued any final rulings on appellant\u2019s questions, mandamus will not lie.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals denying appellant\u2019s requested writ of mandamus is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b57-6\">Celebrezze, C.J., Sweeney, Locher, Holmes, C.
