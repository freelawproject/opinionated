Although R.C. 5739.02 and 5741.02 respectively impose a sales and use tax on \u201ceach retail sale\u201d and the use of \u201ctangible personal property\u201d in this state, the appellee contends that its computer hardware is excepted from sales tax pursuant to R.C. 5739.01(E)(2) and, therefore, from use tax pursuant to R.C. 5741.02(C)(2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-12\">R.C. 5739.01(E)(2) provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-13\">\u201c(E) \u2018Retail sale\u2019 and \u2018sales; at retail\u2019 include all sales <em>except </em>those in which the purpose of the consumer is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-15\">* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-16\">\u201c(2) * * * [T]0 use or consume the thing transferred directly in the <em>production </em>of tangible personal property * * * for sale <em>by manufacturing </em>[or] processing * * (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>Appellee asserts that it qualifies for this exception because its computer hardware is used to \u201cmanufacture\u201d computer software. Based upon the definition of \u201cmanufacturing,\u201d which was set forth at R.C. 5789.01(S) at the time of the assessment of the disputed tax, we must reject the appellee\u2019s assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">R.C. 5739.01(S) provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-5\">\u201c \u2018Manufacturing\u2019 or \u2018processing\u2019 means the <em>transformation or conversion of material or things </em>into a different state or form from that in which they originally existed and, for the purpose of the exceptions contained in division (E)(2) of this section, includes the adjuncts used during and in, and necessary to carry on and continue, production to complete a product at the same location after such transforming or converting has commenced.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">While the appellee produces tangible personal property in the form of encoded magnetic tapes, such production is only in a very narrow sense the result of \u201cmanufacturing\u201d or \u201cprocessing\u201d as those terms were defined by R.C. 5739.01(S). The appellee does not transform or convert <em>\u201cmaterial </em>or <em>things </em>into a different state or form\u201d until it actually begins to encode the magnetic tape with the program that it has previously developed on its computer.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Prior to encoding the tape, the appellee is dealing with intangibles \u2014 ideas, plans, procedures, formulas, etc.; and, although these intangibles are in some respects transformed or converted (or \u201corganized\u201d) into a different state or form, such transformation or conversion is <em>not </em>\u201cmanufacturing\u201d because no <em>\u201cmaterial </em>or <em>thing\u201d </em>has been transformed or converted.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">In that the appellee herein did not engage in \u201cmanufacturing\u201d (as that term was defined in R.C. 5739.01[S] and applied in R.C. 5739.01[E][2]) until it actually encoded the magnetic tapes with the programs that it had previously developed, we hold that the Board of Tax Appeals erred in modifying the appellant\u2019s final order of assessment to except <em>from </em>sales and use taxes those items of computer hardware that were used by the ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>pellee in the preparation and development of computer programs. We remand the cause to the Board of Tax Appeals for a determination as to which items of hardware, if any, should be excepted from taxation because they were used <em>directly </em>in the encoding of magnetic tapes for sale to the appellee\u2019s customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b344-5\">Celebrezze, C.J., Sweeney, Locher, Cook and Douglas, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b344-6\">Douglas, J., concurs separately.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b344-7\">Holmes and Wright, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b344-8\">Cook, J., of the Eleventh Appellate District, sitting for C.

In <em>AccuRay Corp. </em>v. <em>Lindley </em>(1981), BTA case No. 80-D-599, the board held that the computer hardware utilized by AccuRay in the development of computer programs was not used in \u201cmanufacturing\u201d; but, the board found that the hardware that actually transferred programs onto blank diskettes (thereby transforming the diskettes [tangible \u201cthings\u201d] into different states or forms) <em>was </em>used in manufacturing and was, therefore, excepted from sales and use taxes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b343-9\"> This court has previously addressed the meaning of \u201cmanufacturing\u201d as it was set forth in R.C. 5739.01(S). In <em>Canton Malleable Iron Co. </em>v. <em>Porterfield </em>(1972), 30 Ohio St. 2d 163, 173 [59 O.O.2d 178], we stated that \u201c* * * [i]f the primary use or consumption of an item of tangible personal property is made directly in the process of transforming or converting <em>tangible personal property into tangible personal property </em>for sale, then it is excepted from taxation.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This statement, requiring that a <em>tangible </em>\u201cmaterial or thing\u201d be transformed or converted in order for the manufacturing exception to apply, is in accord with the commonly accepted definitions of \u201cmaterial\u201d and \u201cthing.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b344-9\">Douglas, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ai8\">concurring. While I am heartened that the majority herein does not attempt to \u201csqueeze\u201d an exception out of R.C. 5739.01 for the taxpayer in this case, it is unfortunate that the majority failed to exercise similar restraint in <em>Procter &amp; Gamble Co. </em>v. <em>Lindley </em>(1985), 17 Ohio St. 3d 71, where it chose instead to \u201csqueeze\u201d an exception out of R.C. 5739.01(E)(1) for the taxpayer therein.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b344-10\">Wright, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Av5\">dissenting. I cannot join in the majority opinion for the reasons that follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-11\">We have consistently held that this court has only a limited right of review in cases appealed from the Board of Tax Appeals. We are not to overturn decisions of the board unless they are unreasonable or unlawful. See, <em>e.g., Citizens Financial Corp. </em>v. <em>Porterfield </em>(1971), 25 Ohio St. 2d 53 [54 O.O.2d 191], paragraph one of the syllabus; <em>Buckeye Power </em>v. <em>Kosydar </em>(1973), 35 Ohio St. 2d 137 [64 O.O.2d 82], paragraph one of the syllabus. I am satisfied that the board\u2019s decision, which exempted from sales and use taxes most items of computer hardware that were used by appellee in the manufacturing and processing of its computer programs, met the test noted above.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-12\">Although the majority fails to deal either directly, thoroughly, or convincingly with the direct-use-and-manufacturing exemption, it is quite apparent that the exemption is fully applicable herein. This exemption has been the subject of a number of decisions by this court. See, <em>e.g., Canton Malleable Iron Co. </em>v. <em>Porterfield </em>(1972), 30 Ohio St. 2d 163 [59 O.O.2d 178]; <em>Ohio Ferro-Alloys Corp. </em>v. <em>Kosydar </em>(1973), 34 Ohio St. 2d 113 [63 O.O.2d 195] <em>Southwestern Portland Cement Co. </em>v. <em>Lindley </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St. 2d 417 [21 O.O.3d 261]; and <em>Youngstown Building Material &amp; Fuel Co. </em>v. <em>Bowers </em>(1958), 167 Ohio St. 363 [5 O.O.2d 3].</p>\n<p id=\"b345-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>In <em>Youngstown, supra, </em>this court in the syllabus set forth the basic test for determining whether particular items of property are excepted under R.C. 5739.01(E)(2) and 5739.01(S):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-3\">\u201cIn determining whether tangible personal property is used or consumed directly in production of tangible personal property for sale by manufacturing or processing, and, therefore, whether its sale or use is excepted from taxation under the provisions of subdivision (E)(2) of section 5739.01, or subdivision (C)(2) of section 5741.01, Revised Code, the test is not whether such property is essential to the operation of an \u2018integrated plant,\u2019 the test to be applied being, <em>when </em>does the actual manufacturing or processing activity begin and end, and is the property used or consumed <em>during and in the manufacturing or processing period. \u201d </em>(Emphasis <em>sic.)</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">In determining when the manufacturing process begins and ends, we must decide whether the process at issue is an excepted one or one that is preliminary or preparatory to manufacturing. <em>Southwestern Portland Cement Co., supra, </em>at 421. This court in <em>Interlake </em>v. <em>Kosydar </em>(1975), 42 Ohio St. 2d 457, 459 [71 O.O.2d 436], stated that \u201c[t]he manufacturing process for which a beginning and end must be determined is the one that produces the marketable product.\u201d In the present case, the \u201cmarketable product\u201d of appellee is clearly the software programs which it sells to the general public.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Furthermore, \u201cmanufacturing\u201d is defined as the transformation of a thing into a different state or form from that in which it originally existed. See <em>National Tube Co. </em>v. <em>dander </em>(1952), 157 Ohio St. 407 [47 O.O. 313], paragraph four of the syllabus; and R.C. 5739.01(S). In other words, manufacturing is that process which changes the form of tangible personal property into a marketable product. <em>Canton Malleable Iron Co. </em>v. <em>Porter-field, supra, </em>at 170. In that respect, appellee\u2019s manufacturing process transforms <em>the initial conceptual design into the ultimate magnetic tape or marketable product, </em>existing in a different state than it did originally.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">I am therefore of the opinion that appellee produces tangible personal property in the form of encoded magnetic tapes and that such production is the result of \u201cmanufacturing\u201d or \u201cprocessing\u201d as those terms were defined by R.C. 5739.01(S). The appellee does in fact transform or convert <em>\u201cmaterial </em>or <em>things </em>into a different state or form.\u201d I would stress that the process begins with an idea and ends with encoding the magnetic tape with the program that it has previously developed on its computer. While it is true that the subject equipment is used for some testing which is outside the manufacturing process, it is undisputed that the primary and principal use of this equipment is for the manufacturing process noted above.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">Thus, the result achieved by the majority is an unnecessary exercise which conflicts with logic, as well as notions of judicial and administrative economy and efficiency. In the last paragraph of its opinion, the majority concludes: \u201cWe remand the cause to the Board of Tax Appeals for a determination as to which items of hardware, <em>if any, </em>should be excepted from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>taxation because they were used <em>directly </em>in the encoding of magnetic tapes for sale to the appellee\u2019s customers.\u201d (Emphasis added in part.) Unfortunately, the majority has failed to enlighten either this writer or the board as to which items, <em>\u201cif any,\u201d </em>should be subject to taxation. In light of the dearth of instruction provided by the majority opinion, upon remand the board may very well reach a substantially similar, if not identical, result.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">The board has already acted upon this matter once. Now, with essentially no additional guidance, the board must act yet again upon precisely the same matter. Such use of the board\u2019s time and resources is utterly unwarranted, and, thus, I must respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
