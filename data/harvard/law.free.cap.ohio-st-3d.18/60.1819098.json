The court held that \u201cthe commission must make a finding that the claimant * * * [appellant] in fact did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>obtain the benefits through fraud,\u201d and remanded the cause for that purpose.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We agree with the court below. Where allegations of fraud are involved in a termination-of-benefits case, the Industrial Commission must make a specific finding as to the fraud issue. Mere conclusory statements in the commission\u2019s pronouncement will not sustain an order cancelling benefits where fraud is alleged.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Without a specific finding, the commission\u2019s order terminating compensation will be ordered vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">The only remaining question in this case, then, is whether the evidence before the Industrial Commission supports its order that appellant\u2019s compensation be terminated because she is not permanently and totally disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">As already mentioned, appellant\u2019s permanent-and-total-disability claim was allowed because of a back injury and the urinary condition. Benefits later were terminated because of the alleged fraud and the \u201cfinding of the Commission that from the reports of medical specialises] Dr. William Sloan and Dr. Mark Bohm, that claimant is not permanently and totally disabled at this time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">In <em>State, ex rel. Anderson, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1981), 62 Ohio St. 2d 166, at 168 [16 O.O.3d 199], this court held that \u201cwhere the issue before the commission is whether a claimant is permanently and totally disabled on account of the combined effect of two or more allowed conditions, medical testimony not evaluating the combined effect of those conditions cannot constitute evidence that the claimant is not permanently and totally disabled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">More recently, in <em>State, ex rel. Norman, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1982), 1 Ohio St. 3d 263, 265, the court said: \u201cHowever, if a physician determines that one is not permanently and totally disabled as the result of one condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>tion, the physician must continue and analyze the additional allowed conditions to determine their combined effect upon the injured worker evaluated. This is the real meaning of <em>Anderson, supra </em>[62 Ohio St. 2d 166 (16 O.O.3d 199)]. Obviously, one must look at the person as a whole in evaluating whether [he] can work or not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">In the present case, neither of the medical reports relied upon by the commission covers all of the conditions allowed in appellant\u2019s original claim. Dr. Sloan, in his evaluation, only discussed appellant\u2019s problem with incontinence; he neglected to mention anything about appellant\u2019s back condition and to what degree the two, taken together, have rendered the appellant physically impaired. Under <em>Anderson </em>and <em>Norman, supra, </em>Dr. Sloan\u2019s report does not constitute evidence that can support the Industrial Commission\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Dr. Bohm evaluated appellant\u2019s back injury and concluded that she was only thirty to forty percent permanently and partially disabled. He did not offer any opinion as to what extent appellant\u2019s other problems-physically affected her. With respect to the urinary condition, Dr. Bohm merely acceded to the judgment of Dr. Sloan. Again, under <em>Anderson </em>and <em>Norman, supra, </em>the report of Dr. Bohm does not constitute evidence supportive of the finding of the Industrial Commission. See, also, <em>State, ex rel. Anderson, </em>v. <em>State </em>(1979), 60 Ohio St. 2d 106 [14 O.O.3d 339].</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">R.C. 4123.58(A) states: \u201cIn cases of permanent total disability, the employee shall receive an award to continue until his death * * *.\u201d This provision places a burden upon the Industrial Commission heavier than that which it carried here. Once determining that permanent and total disability exists, the Industrial Commission must have before it reliable, probative, and substantial evidence before it can terminate an award made pursuant to its original findings. Such evidence was lacking in this case because neither doctor\u2019s report relied upon by the commission can justify its finding that appellant was no longer permanently and totally disabled. \u201cWhere there is no evidence upon which the commission could have based its factual conclusion, an abuse of discretion is present and mandamus becomes appropriate.\u201d <em>State, ex rel. Teece, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1981), 68 Ohio St. 2d 165, 167 [22 O.O.3d 400].</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">Therefore, in view of the foregoing, we conclude that the judgment of the court of appeals should be affirmed insofar as it allows a writ of mandamus vacating the Industrial Commission\u2019s order and remanding the cause for consideration of the fraud issue. The judgment of the court of appeals should be reversed, however, with respect to its holding that the Industrial Commission did not abuse its discretion in deciding that appellant was no longer permanently and totally disabled. A writ of mandamus is hereby allowed directing the Industrial Commission to vacate such determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed in part, reversed in part and writ allowed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b96-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>Celebrezze, C.J., Sweeney, Locher, C.
