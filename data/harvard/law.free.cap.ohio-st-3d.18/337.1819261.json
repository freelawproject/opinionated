Co. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St. 2d 189 [23 O.O.3d 210], this court stated at 192:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-14\">\u201c* * * [I]t is a fundamental tenet of judicial review in Ohio that courts should decide cases on the merits. See, <em>e.g., Cobb </em>v. <em>Cobb </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St. 2d 124 [16 0.0.3d 145]. Judicial discretion must be carefully \u2014 and cautiously \u2014 exercised before this court will uphold an outright dismissal of a case on purely procedural grounds.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-15\">Although the holding in <em>DeHart </em>is not on all fours with respect to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>cases before us, its reaffirmation of this court\u2019s philosophy with respect to judicial review is relevant to our disposition of the appeals herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">The appellate court below dismissed both appellants\u2019 causes because of a purported technicality in the Appellate Rules. The court of appeals\u2019 dismissals, in our view, have no support under either the Appellate Rules, or under the common law of this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">In reviewing the pertinent rules upon which the appellate court based its decisions, we find that App. R. 18(A) provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-7\">\u201cExcept as provided in Rule 14(C), the appellant shall <em>serve and file </em>his brief within twenty days after the date on which the clerk has mailed the notice required by Rule 11(B). * * *\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">Appellants contend, and the state agrees, that the Rules of Appellate Procedure clearly distinguish between the obligation to file and the obligation to serve an appellant\u2019s brief. App. R. 18(C) provides a specific, although discretionary, sanction should an appellant fail to <em>file </em>his brief in a timely fashion as prescribed under App. R. 18(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">App. R. 18(C) states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-10\">\u201cIf an appellant fails to <em>file </em>his brief within the time provided by this rule, or within the time as extended, the court may dismiss the appeal. * * *\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-11\">However, as appellants correctly contend, nothing in this rule condones or sets forth an available sanction to the court of appeals should an appellant fail to <em>serve </em>his brief in a timely fashion, or for any defect in the mode of service caused by an appellant. This being the case, we hold that a court of appeals may not dismiss, <em>sua sponte, </em>an appeal based upon a defect in the mode of service of an appellant\u2019s brief, when said brief was otherwise timely filed before the appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-12\">We believe that our construction of App. R. 18 is compelled by the language (or lack thereof) contained within the rule, and is consonant with the fundamental tenet of judicial review of deciding cases on their merits, as we enunciated in <em>DeHart, supra. </em>Since the appellate court\u2019s dismissals of appellant\u2019s causes were without statutory or common-law authority, as even the appellee-state concedes, we find no conceivable justification for a disposition by the court of appeals, other than on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-13\">Therefore, the judgments of the court of appeals are reversed, and the causes are remanded to that court for a consideration of the instant appeals on their merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-14\">\n<em>Judgments reversed and causes remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b371-15\">Celebrezze, C.J., Locher, Holmes, C.
