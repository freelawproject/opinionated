We will not substitute our judgment for that made by the state board if there is some evidence supporting the board\u2019s resolution. See <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Lewis </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St. 2d 577, 578 [23 O.O.3d 485]; <em>State, ex rel. Ogan, </em>v. <em>Teater </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St. 2d 235, 247 [8 O.O.3d 217]. Therefore, the issue presented is whether the state board\u2019s order, which confirmed the local board\u2019s resolution that bus transportation for the non-public school children was unreasonable and impractical, and was supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence. R.C. 119.12. The court of appeals reversed the trial court and upheld the state board\u2019s resolution. For the reasons which follow, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-11\">In <em>Hartley, supra, </em>this court held that local school boards must strictly comply with the mandates of R.C. 3327.01 before making payments in lieu of bus transportation for non-public school children. <em>Id. </em>at paragraph two of the syllabus.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Writing for the majority, Justice Locher noted that a local <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>school board may not make a unilateral judgment, but that R.C. 3327.01 requires the State Board of Education to confirm the decision. Justice Locher also stated that under the statute, \u201ctransportation is the rule and payment is the exception.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 416.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">In accordance with the provisions of R.C. 3327.01 and this court\u2019s decision in <em>Hartley, </em>the state board has adopted specific criteria in an effort to guide the determinations of local school boards when they are confronted with the feasibility question of providing bus transportation to non-public school children.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> These factors are similar to those set forth by Justice Sweeney in his concurring opinion in <em>Hartley, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">All parties herein agree that this controversy centers on the cost-related figures concerning the additional busing required to transport these children to the parochial schools in question. Appellees contend that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>excessive costs may be a basis for a determination that transportation by school conveyance is unreasonable. However, we find that such issue need not be reached as there is a lack of credible evidence in support of the cost figures submitted by the local board which were ultimately accepted by the state board.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Given the strict language of our decision in <em>Hartley, </em>a local school board certainly has the burden to establish that its resolution is lawful so that payment can be made in lieu of transportation. Here, the local board has failed to substantiate its cost figures for numerous reasons. First, concerning the total cost of transporting all pupils to and from school, the local board included the costs for field trips, athletic events and other extra-curricular activities which distorted such figure. Turning to the figures relative to the transportation of non-public children, there was evidence in the record that the actual mileage to and from the parochial schools was falsified, as one bus driver was instructed to drive around in an empty bus to gain additional mileage. In addition, the wage figure used by the local board for bus drivers transporting non-public students was, for no apparent reason, approximately twenty-five percent higher than the wages of other drivers. The cost of fringe benefits was also included within the figure when, in fact, some drivers do not receive these benefits. There was further evidence that the afternoon bus routing of non-public students was not done in the most economical fashion. Finally, the number of nonpublic students to be transported by bus was set at nineteen by the local board when, in all probability, at least thirty students would take advantage of such transportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">All of these factors distorted the cost figures which the local board substantially relied upon in presenting its argument at the numerous hearings on this matter. Other than what appears to be quite questionable data as submitted by the local board, we can find no remaining evidence to support the state board\u2019s order which confirmed the local board\u2019s resolution. Therefore, the state board\u2019s order is not supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence as required by R.C. 119.12. The judgment of the court of appeals is hereby reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b350-8\">Celebrezze, C.J., Sweeney, Locher, Holmes, C.
