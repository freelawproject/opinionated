These specific safety requirements were enacted to \u201cprovide reasonable safety for life, limb and health of employees.\u201d IC-5-01.01. Accordingly, in <em>State, ex rel. M.T.D. Products, </em>v. <em>Stebbins </em>(1975), 43 Ohio St. 2d 114 [72 O.O.2d 63], this court found that the safety requirements do not purport to impose absolute liability for an additional award. The <em>M.T.D. </em>court at 118 stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-9\">\u201c* * * The regulation does not forewarn the employer that, in addition to providing a safety device, the safety device must also be completely failsafe. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-10\">In the instant case there appears to be no evidence to suggest that the Hold-Back Guard used by appellant was ineffective while the press was operating throughout its entire cycle in a normal fashion. To the contrary, within a month after the accident, an investigation by the U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s Occupational Safety and Health Administration revealed \u201cno violations of existing or effective [safety] standards.\u201d In fact, the evidence before this court indicates the only time the guards failed to operate was when the press was activated manually by a person other than the operator in an attempt to correct an unrelated problem. IC-5-08.03(A), in conjunction with <em>M.T.D., </em>does not require that a power press operator\u2019s hands be guarded from ever entering the danger zone. Rather, it is only required that an operator\u2019s hands be guarded from entering the danger zone \u201cduring the [machine\u2019s] operating cycle.\u201d Since the evidence before this court supports the conclusion that claimant\u2019s injury did not occur during the operating cycle of the power press, and since we discern no evidence indicating that the guards were ineffective during the operating cycle of the power press, appellee\u2019s conclusion that appellant violated IC-5-08.03(A) is an abuse of discretion and can not stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-11\">We must now determine the appropriate remedy for appellee\u2019s abuse of discretion. This court was required to make a similar determination in <em>State, ex rel. Cox, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St. 2d 235 [23 O.O.3d 147]. In that case the court held at paragraph three of the syllabus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-12\">\u201cTo be a proper order of the Industrial Commission, entered pursuant to R.C. 4121.06(A), the record must show that a majority of the commission could reasonably have based their approval and confirmation of the staff officer\u2019s order upon evidentiary matters within the record.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-13\">The <em>Cox </em>court found that since there was an absence of evidence in the record to support the hearing officer\u2019s decision, it was an abuse of discre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>tion for the commission to enter an order in support of that decision, and a rehearing to clarify the evidence was necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">In the instant case there is an absence of evidence in the record to support the hearing officer\u2019s findings (1) that the guards failed to operate during the entire operating cycle of the machine and, more Specifically, (2) that there was a manual phase of operation of the machine during which the guards failed to operate. Therefore, in accordance with <em>Cox, </em>a rehearing is necessary to adduce any and all evidence necessary to establish whether there has been a violation of a specific safety requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and order that a writ of mandamus be issued, directing the Industrial Commission to grant appellant a rehearing on the merits of claimant\u2019s application for an additional award.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and writ allowed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b138-8\">Celebrezze, C.J., Sweeney, Locher, Holmes, C. Brown, Douglas and Wright, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
