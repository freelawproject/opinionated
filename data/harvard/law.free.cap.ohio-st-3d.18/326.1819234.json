In <em>Travelers, </em>we held that such a restriction of coverage to accidents where the injury results from physical contact of the unidentified vehicle with the insured or the automobile occupied by him was compatible with R.C. 3937.18, the uninsured motorist statute, and with public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-12\">The basis of our decision in <em>Travelers </em>was clearly set out at 122 where we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-13\">\u201cWe find nothing uncertain or ambiguous about the words used in this policy to define \u2018hit-and-run vehicle,\u2019 or to establish the requirement of \u2018physical contact.\u2019 Giving the wording of the policy its natural and reasonable construction, the only conclusion to be reached is that the policy does not provide coverage for injuries sustained by reason of the tortious operational conduct by drivers of unidentified vehicles, in the absence of at least a minimal contact between such a vehicle and the insured or the vehicle he is occupying. The rubric \u2018hit-and-run vehicle,\u2019 encompassing a \u2018hit,\u2019 as well as a \u2018run,\u2019 further buttresses the express prerequisite of a \u2018physical contact.\u2019 Were we to accept the construction urged by appellants, we would be disregarding the words \u2018physical contact\u2019 and \u2018hit-and-run vehicle,\u2019 and allowing recovery under the \u2018hit-and-run\u2019 portion of the uninsured motorist provision whenever unidentified vehicles \u2018proximately cause\u2019 an automobile accident to occur. Barring certain well-defined overriding principles, this should not be done where the parties have clearly and expressly provided otherwise in the policy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>As we concluded in the last paragraph of <em>Travelers </em>at 124:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-5\">\u201cWords which have a plain and commonly understood meaning ought not to be rationalized to a different meaning in an attempt to avoid the results of reading them as they are. If insurers are to be required to provide protection against injuries sustained in automobile accidents caused by all unidentified vehicles, without the \u2018physical contact\u2019 restriction, it is a requirement for the General Assembly to enunciate and not the courts</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-6\">* * * <em>ft</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">In <em>Yurista, </em>the court of appeals chose not to apply the policy\u2019s definition of a \u201chit-and-run vehicle\u201d and the requirement of the policy as to \u201cphysical contact.\u201d The court allowed recovery where an alleged unidentified vehicle proximately caused an accident to occur. As we stated in <em>Travelers, </em>this should not be done where the parties have provided otherwise in the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">In <em>Basford, </em>the court of appeals and the trial court both recognized that, since there was no actual physical contact between the unidentified vehicle and Mr. Basford or the motor vehicle he was occupying, the \u201chit- and-run\u201d provision of the policy did not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">As to case No. 84-1166, we must reverse the judgment of the court of appeals. The trial court properly denied Yurista\u2019s motion for summary judgment but erred in entering summary judgment in favor of Nationwide. In <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Aaron </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St. 3d 48, this court held that \u201cCiv. R. 56 does not authorize courts to enter summary judgment in favor of a non-moving party.\u201d Since Nationwide did not move for summary judgment in the trial court but that court erroneously awarded it summary judgment, the cause is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">As to case No. 84-1890, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-11\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded in case No. 84-1166.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AUJ\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed in case No. 84-1890.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b362-13\">Celebrezze, C.J., Locher, Holmes and Wright, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"A32M\">Sweeney and C.

Brown, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ahu\">dissenting. The physical-contact rule set forth in <em>Travelers Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Reddick </em>(1974), 37 Ohio St. 2d 119 [66 O.O.2d 189], establishes a rigid irrebuttable presumption which has no sound legal justification. The better-reasoned approach in hit-and-run ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>cidents is the corroborative-evidence test which has been adopted by numerous jurisdictions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">The adoption of the corroborative-evidence test will alleviate the present fundamental unfairness which has developed under the physical-contact requirement. It should be noted that the rationale of this court in <em>Travelers </em>was that \u201cthe purpose of the requirement [the physical-contact requirement] is obvious \u2014 to provide an objective standard of corroboration of the existence of a \u2018hit-and-run\u2019 vehicle to prevent the filing of fraudulent claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 124. The corroborative-evidence test maintains this concern while eliminating the requirement that physical contact occur in every case before an injured party can recover. Physical contact would still be required in those cases where acceptable corroborative evidence is unavailable.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">Appellate courts of this state have found the corroborative-evidence test to be a much more just standard and I concur. See <em>Progressive Cos. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Mastin </em>(1982), 4 Ohio App. 3d 86; <em>Yurista </em>v. <em>Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(June 8,1984), Ottawa App. No. OT-84-6, unreported. Therefore, I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for Franklin County in case No. 84-1890 and affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals for Ottawa County in case No. 84-1166.</p>\n<judges id=\"b363-7\">Sweeney, J., concurs in foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b363-8\"> See <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Cas.
