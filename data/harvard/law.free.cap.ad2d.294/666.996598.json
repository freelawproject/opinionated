Defense counsel seeks to be relieved of his assignment as counsel for defendant upon the ground that there are no nonfrivolous issues that can be raised on appeal. Upon our review of the record and defense counsel\u2019s brief, we agree. The judgment is therefore affirmed, and defense counsel\u2019s application for leave to withdraw is granted <em>(see, People v Stokes, </em>95 NY2d 633; <em>People v Cruwys, </em>113 AD2d 979, <em>lv denied 67 </em>NY2d 650).</p><p id=\"b704-7\">Cardona, P.J., Mercure, Crew III, Carpinello and Mugglin, JJ., concur.
