Thus, it cannot be said \u201cthat there was \u2018no valid line of reasoning and permissible inferences which could possibly lead rational [persons] to [find in favor of defendant] on the basis of the evidence presented at trial\u2019 \u201d <em>(Levin v Carbone, </em>277 AD2d 951, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>951). Although plaintiff testified that the \u201cfireman\u2019s seat\u201d collapsed when he attempted to sit on it as he and the conductor were arriving at the station for lunch, defendant presented testimony controverting plaintiff\u2019s testimony that the seat was displaced from its post when the locomotive came into the station immediately after plaintiff allegedly fell. In addition, defendant established that plaintiff reported more than one version of the manner in which the accident occurred. Where, as here, questions of fact exist concerning how the accident occurred, and the disputed facts are dispositive of whether defendant is liable under the Boiler Inspection Act (49 USC \u00a7 20701), the court erred in granting plaintiff\u2019s motion for a directed verdict <em>(see generally Calabritto v New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford R.R. Co., </em>287 F2d 394, 394-395, <em>cert denied </em>366 US 928). We therefore reverse the judgment, deny plaintiff\u2019s motion and grant a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-3\">The court properly required defendant to disclose the transcribed statement of the conductor taken by defendant\u2019s supervisor of personnel at the time of the accident. The conductor, who died before trial, was the only witness to the accident, and the supervisor had taken the statement at the direction of defendant\u2019s counsel. Because of the death of the declarant and the unique conditions under which the statement was taken, plaintiff established a \u201csubstantial need\u201d for disclosure of the statement <em>(Rochford v Long Is. R.R. Co., </em>273 AD2d 291, 292). In addition, the court properly permitted plaintiff\u2019s supervisor to be cross-examined with that statement. The supervisor, who by the time of trial had been promoted to the position of defendant\u2019s superintendent and had \u201cforgotten\u201d that he had taken the statement, testified at trial that defendant had no reason to believe that the accident occurred in the manner described by plaintiff. Thus, the conductor\u2019s statement was properly used on cross-examination of the supervisor to refresh his recollection and impeach his credibility <em>(cf. Mahoney v Staffa, </em>256 AD2d 827, 829). We agree with defendant, however, that the court erred in admitting the statement, as evidence-in-chief in plaintiff\u2019s case; the statement is hearsay, and does not come within an exception to the hearsay rule <em>(see generally Sadowsky v Chat Noir, </em>64 AD2d 697).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">We further agree with defendant that the court erred in permitting plaintiff to use defendant\u2019s \u201cRailroad Injury and Illness Summary,\u201d a monthly report that each railroad carrier is required to submit to the United States Department of Transportation pursuant to 49 USC \u00a7 20901, to impeach the credibility of the employee who prepared the report. The stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>ute expressly provides that \u201c[n]o part of [such report] * * * may be used in a civil action for damages resulting from a matter mentioned in the report\u201d (49 USC \u00a7 20903; <em>see also Tyree v Burlington N. &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co., 973 F Supp 786, 792).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\">Finally, we note that, upon the retrial, plaintiffs \u201csick pay\u201d may not be deducted from plaintiffs award of damages, if any. \u201cSick pay\u201d is a benefit of plaintiffs employment and is not specifically addressed in any collective bargaining agreement to render it subject to the Federal collateral source rule (45 USC \u00a7 55; <em>see Clark v Burlington N., </em>726 F2d 448, 450-451).
