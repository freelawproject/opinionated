Issues of credibility, including the weight to be given to inconsistencies in testimony, were properly considered by the trier of facts and there is no reason to disturb its determinations <em>(see, People v Gaimari, </em>176 NY 84, 94). The elements of the crime of prostitution (Penal Law \u00a7 230.00) were established by testimony, properly credited by the court, that appellant agreed to engage in sexual conduct in exchange for money, quoted a price and directed the undercover officer to meet her at a nearby motel.
