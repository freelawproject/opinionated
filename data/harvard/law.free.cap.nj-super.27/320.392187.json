There the conviction was reversed for reasons stated at 23 <em>N. J. Super. </em>511 (1952). In turn, the State petitioned for certification and the Supreme Court granted same, 11 N. <em>J. </em>497 (1953), and, after argument on the appeal, reversed the judgment of the Appellate Division and remitted the record to the Appellate Division \u201cto be there proceeded with in accordance with the rules and practice relating to that court, consistent with the opinion of this court.\u201d That judgment requires the proceedings in the Appellate Division, pursuant to the mandate, to be consistent with the opinion of the Supreme Court. The opinion is reported in 12 <em>N. J. </em>505 (1953). It concludes as follows: \u201cThe judgment of the Hudson County Court is reinstated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">In his appeal in the Appellate Division, the defendant argued that the judgment of the County Court should be reversed on four grounds:</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">(1) The indictments were defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">(2) The court erred in denying the defendant\u2019s motions for acquittal, in that the State had failed to prove a <em>prim,a facie </em>ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-10\">(3) The court erred in the admission of testimony over the defendairt\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-11\">(4) The court erred in failing to instruct the jury on certain matters of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-12\">The Appellate Division, as is stated in the opinion of Judge Schettino, found \u201cit necessary to consider only the challenge addressed to the sufficiency of the indictments.\u201d It reversed solely on the ground that the indictments failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>allege the essential elements of the crimes of which the defendant was found guilty by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">In the Supreme Court the only question presented by the State or considered by the court appears to have been whether or not the indictments were sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Now that the case has been remitted to us, the defendant asks us to consider the questions that were argued on his appeal in the first place and which have never been decided. He points out that he was entitled as of right to his appeal, and that all questions of alleged error in the trial court raised by him in good faith should be considered, if necessary to do him justice. He urges that a refusal of such consideration denies to him the equal protection of the laws which is guaranteed by the Constitution of our country. This argument may be sound, but it is not our province to grant him- relief. <em>Stone v. Allied Clothing Corp., </em>140 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>224 <em>(Ch. </em>1947); <em>Isserman v. Isserman, </em>2 <em>N. J., </em>1 (1949). Our only function is to carry into effect the mandate of the Supreme Court and that plainly requires that the judgment of the Hudson County Court be reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">The defendant\u2019s motion is therefore denied and the judgment of the County Court affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
