J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AvV\">The defendants were convicted upon an indictment charging them with the possession of burglar\u2019s tools, proscribed by the provisions of <em>N. J. S. 2A </em>:94 \u2014 3, and they appeal from the ensuing judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-17\">The essential facts are that Police Officer Edward L. Zirkel, a member of the City of Elizabeth Police Department, at about 11:00 o\u2019clock on the night of June 26, 1952, was checking doors \u201calong from Commerce Place down Grand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>Street as far as Jefferson Avenue,\u201d when his attention was attracted to three men walking toward him through a parking lot; he took a position in a darkened area; the men walked past him at a distance of 10 or 15 feet and stopped to engage in conversation with each other. At that point, they were eight or ten feet on the far side of the first set of railroad tracks,- while Zirkel was on the near side of the tracks in the vicinity of a darkened crane. The only words of the conversation that Officer Zirkel could distinctly hear were \u201cthe beef house.\u201d Grand Street, approximately 200 feet from the railroad tracks, runs parallel thereto in an easterly and westerly direction. Commerce Place extends from east Grand Street a distance of 150 feet before merging with the railroad right of way. The Commerce Place parking lot is on the court house side of the railroad tracks, while the \u201cbeef house\u201d is located on the other side of the tracks.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">One of the trio then proceeded across the tracks towards the \u201cbeef house,\u201d while the two defendants went towards Commerce Place. Officer Zirkel waited about ten minutes, then crossed the tracks towards the \u201cbeef house,\u201d when suddenly he came upon the defendants in the dark, whereupon he directed his flashlight at them. At that time Zirkel was traversing the tracks towards Chestnut Street and the two defendants were proceeding down the tracks in the direction of the \u201cPort\u201d alongside the \u201cbeef house\u201d on the far side of the tracks. Zirkel informed them' they were under arrest and discovered that the defendant Ligori had a jimmy in his left hand; he observed a sledge hammer, a chisel and a mismated, pair- of canvas gloves on the ground about three feet from Salern'itkno\u2019s feet, and black gloves at Ligorfs feet.' Salernitano informed Zirkel that he had a flashlight in his pocket, which was delivered to Zirkel later.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">After Zirkel had' sent for the patrol wagon, he returned to the scene of the apprehension of the defendants and recovered the other articles which he had previously observed on the ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">Defendant Ligori informed the police that they could locate their'automobile in a parking lot on Commerce Place, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>which was about 1,000 feet from the \u201cbeef house.\u201d Upon an examination thereof, Detective Matiunas and Officer Zirkel discovered a small cold chisel, two small crowbars and a white and yellow canvas glove. Prior to examining the automobile Detective Matiunas engaged in conversation with the defendant Ligori, who stated that he was at the scene of his arrest as the result of a rendezvous with a \u201ccolored girl\u201d whom he had met at a tavern and had selected the back of the \u201cbeef house\u201d as the place of assignation.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">After Officer Zirkel and Detective Matiunas had returned to headquarters from their investigation of the automobile they again questioned the defendants, whereupon they gave conflicting stories as to tlieir activities of the evening. The defendant Ligori stated that the tools found in his car were kept there in the event it was ever necessary to change a tire, but Ligori changed this story several days later when he said that he had been unable to get a plumber and that he was trying to repair his boiler. The white and yellow canvas glove found in the automobile matched the odd glove found at the scene of the defendants\u2019 arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Detective Matiunas, who testified as an expert on burglar\u2019s tools, expressed the opinion that the tools found upon the defendants and at the scene of their arrest were \u201cburglar\u2019s tools\u201d conceding, however, that they could be used for other purposes. Although the articles found in the automobile were not admitted in evidence, on the ground that they were not set forth in the indictment, Detective Matiunas was permitted to testify, without objection, regarding their presence in the automobile used by the defendants on that occasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">Neither of the defendants took the stand nor did they offer any witnesses in their behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">The only ground of appeal relied upon by the defendants is that the State did not prove a <em>prima facie </em>case of criminal intent and, therefore, the trial court erred in refusing to grant the defendants\u2019 motion for a judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">Por a clear understanding of the statute upon which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>indictment and conviction of the defendants are grounded, we quote the following provisions thereof:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-4\">\u201cAny person wlio manufactures or knowingly possesses any engine, machine, tool or implement adapted or designed for cutting through, forcing or breaking open any building, room, vault, safe or other depository, in order to steal therefrom any money or other property, knowing the same to be adapted or designed for such purpose, with intent to use or employ or allow the same to be used or employed for that purpose, is guilty of a high misdemeanor.\u201d <em>N. J. S. 2A </em>:94-3 (formerly <em>R. S. </em>2:115-5).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">An examination of the statute clearly discloses that to support a conviction for the violation thereof, the State must bear the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt the three following elements of the offense: (1) adaptation and design of the tool or implement for breaking and entering;</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">(2) possession thereof by one with knowledge of its character; and (3) intent to use or employ such tool or implement or allow the same to be used or employed for the interdicted purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">Following the enumeration of the tools is the phrase \u201cadapted or designed for cutting through, forcing or breaking open any building,\u201d <em>etc. </em>This adjective phrase qualifies all the preceding nouns naming \u201cengine, machine, tool or implement.\u201d Otherwise, it would be a crime under the statute to make, design, set up, possess or have any such tool. Under the <em>maxim, noscitur a sociis </em>this construction is further borne out by the fact that the tools and devices specifically enumerated in the statute are of a character adapted, designed and commonly used for breaking into structures named in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">It follows that the possession of tools, instruments, or devices not so adapted, designed or commonly used does not subject the possessor to prosecution under the statute. <em>State v. </em>Hyde, 297 <em>Mo. </em>213, 248 <em>S. W. </em>920,.922 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1923); <em>State of Missouri v. </em>Hefflin, 338 <em>Mo. </em>236, 89 <em>S. W. 2d </em>938, 103 <em>A. L. R. </em>1308 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1935). There is no express provision in the statute that possession upon one\u2019s person is an essential element of the crime. Accordingly, the possession may be actual or constructive. Two persons</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>may hare constructive possession, or one may have actual possession and the other constructive possession. <em>Commonwealth v. Segers, </em>167 <em>Pa. Super. </em>642, 76 <em>A. 2d </em>483 <em>(Super. Ct. </em>1950); 12 <em>C. J. S., Burglary, </em>\u00a7 69, <em>p. </em>754; 9 <em>Am. Jur., </em>Burglary, \u00a7 86, <em>p. </em>281.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\"> That the tools or implements were originally not made or intended for an unlawful use is not a controlling factor. The test is whether they are suitable for the purpose of breaking and entering burglariously; it is immaterial that they are also designed and adapted for honest and lawful purposes. On the other hand, the mere possession of tools, instruments or devices not adapted, designed or commonly used in breaking into buildings, <em>etc., </em>is not sufficient to subject the possessor to prosecution. A loading case on the subject is <em>Commonwealth v. Tivnon, </em>8 <em>Cray </em>(74 <em>Mass.) </em>375, 380, 69 <em>Am. Dec. </em>248, 251 <em>(Sup. Jud. Ct. </em>1857), where it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-6\">\u201cNor do we think it necessary, in order to create the offence which the statute is designed to punish, that it should appear that the tools or implements were originally made or intended for an unlawful use. If they are suitable for the purpose, so that they can be used 1o break and enter burglariously, it is wholly immaterial that they were also designed and adapted for honest and lawful use. A chisel or centrebit, though a tool in common use for ordinary purposes, is quite as efficacious in the hands of a burglar to carry out his felonious intent, as a jimmy or a lock-picker, which is made for the sole purpose of being used to break and enter buildings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">See also <em>Commonwealth v. Riley, </em>192 <em>Ky. </em>153, 232 <em>S. W. </em>630, 632 <em>(Ct. App. </em>1921); <em>State v. Widenski, </em>50 <em>R. I. </em>148, 146 <em>A. </em>407 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1929); <em>State v. Fitzpatrick, </em>141 <em>Wash. </em>638, 251 <em>P. </em>875 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1927); <em>O\u2019Neill v. State, </em>105 <em>Neb. </em>824, 182 <em>N. W. </em>503 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1921); <em>State v. Ferrone, </em>97 <em>Conn. </em>258, 116 <em>A. </em>336 <em>(Sup. Ct. err. </em>1922) ; <em>People v. Morgan, </em>59 <em>Hun. </em>619, 13 <em>N. Y. S. </em>448 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1891).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">To sustain a conviction it necessarily follows that there must be proof not only that the tools or implements are adapted and designed for breaking and entering but also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>proof of the possession thereof by the accused with knowledge of their character. But the question of the good or bad intent of the possessor of the tools banned by the statute is material in a prosecution thereunder. It cannot be said that the statute brands as a criminal every carpenter or mechanic who carries with him the implements of his trade, or every motorist who goes about with an ordinary tool kit in his automobile. Hammers, saws, chisels,-braces and bits, drills, screw drivers, crowbars and punches obviously would be discovered in one or all of such kits, and would be implements adapted, designed or commonly used in breaking into houses, <em>etc. </em>They would, therefore, come .within the literal terms of-the statute. In considering the harshness of a contrary construction, the State must bear the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the possession of the tools bj the accused must be with, the general intent that they will be used for a burglarious purpose. 9 <em>Am. Jur., </em>Burglary, <em>sec. </em>86, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">Criminal intent may be shown by circumstantial evidence. <em>People v. Beacham, </em>358 <em>Ill. </em>373, 193 <em>N. E. </em>205 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1934); <em>People v. McLaughlin, </em>337 <em>Ill. </em>259, 169 <em>N. E. </em>206 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1929); <em>People v. Yuskauskas, </em>268 <em>Ill. </em>328, 109 <em>N. E. </em>319 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1915); <em>Dahlberg v. People, </em>225 <em>Ill. </em>485, 80 <em>N. E. </em>310 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1907); <em>McCoy v. People, </em>175 <em>Ill. </em>224, 51 <em>N. E. </em>777 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1898).; <em>Crosby v. People, </em>137 <em>Ill. </em>325, 27 <em>N. E. </em>49 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1891); <em>People v. Buskievich, </em>330 <em>Ill. </em>532, 162 <em>N. E. </em>196 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1928); <em>People v. Weiss, </em>367 <em>Ill. </em>580, 12 <em>N. E. 2d </em>652, 655 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1937); <em>People v. Taylor, </em>410 <em>Ill. </em>469, 102 <em>N. E. 2d </em>529 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1951). The question of proof of intent was discussed in the case of <em>State v. Walsh, </em>9 <em>N. J. Super. </em>43, 46 <em>(App. Div. </em>1950), wherein Judge McGeehan, speaking for the court, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-5\">\u201cAil essential element of the crime is the intent to use or employ the tool or implement, or to allow the same to be used or employed for cutting through, forcing or breaking open any building, room, etc., in order to steal therefrom any money or property. When specific intent is an essential element of the crime charged, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>burden is on the State, lo prove such intent. This burden may be met by direct proof or by circumstantial evidence. <em>Underhill, Criminal Evidence, </em>\u00a7 54 <em>(4th ed. </em>1935) ; 22 <em>C. J. S., Criminal Law, </em>\u00a7 568; 14 <em>Am. Jur., Criminal Law, </em>\u00a7 24, <em>n. </em>19. There must be proof, at leasf, of some circumstance or circumstances, in addition to the proof of the possession of the tool itself, from which the, jury could draw a legitimate inference of the required intent. Here, there was neither direct proof nor proof of any such circumstance or circumstances. <em>Cf. </em>103 <em>A. L. R. </em>1313, 1316.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">The, defendants contend that the State failed to bear the burden imposed upon it of proving beyond a reasonable doubt the \u201cessential element of the crime <em>(i. e.) </em>the intent to use or employ the tool or implement, or to allow the same to be used or employed for cutting through, forcing or breaking open any building, room, etc., in order to steal therefrom any money or property.\u201d It is incumbent upon us, therefore, to scrutinize the record to determine whether there was sufficient evidence to justify the 'finding that the defendants possessed the tools with intent to use them for a burglarious purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\"> When a motion for directed acquittal is made, the test is whether there is any evidence from which an inference of guilt may be drawn. <em>State v. Fox, </em>12 <em>N. J. Super. </em>132 <em>(App. Div. </em>1951). A judgment of acquittal should be denied where there is evidence of guilt which, if believed by the jury, would justify a guilty verdict. <em>State v. Sgro, </em>108 <em>N. J. L. </em>528 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1932); <em>State v. Cammarata, </em>12 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>115 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1934); <em>State v. De Falco, </em>8 N. <em>J. Super. </em>295 <em>(App. Div. </em>1950); <em>State v. Carbone, </em>17 <em>N. J. Super. </em>446, 453 <em>(App. Div. </em>1952), affirmed 10 <em>N. J. </em>329 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">In support of their position, the defendants rely upon the case of <em>State v. Walsh, supra. </em>In fact, it is the only case cited by the defendants to bolster their argument. The <em>Walsh </em>case is clearly distinguishable from the case <em>sub judice. </em>In that case, Walsh was apprehended while walking on a public sidewalk at 7:50 P M., and at the request of the arresting officers told them correctly where Algonquin Place was, hut hp refused to tell them who he was, where he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>going and what he was doing. Upon searching him, they found in the outside pocket of his overcoat two cotton gloves, a jimmy inside one of the gloves, a small flashlight and a small mirror, a slip of paper with certain numbers upon it, identified at the trial as catalog numbers for a revolver, a receipt for a room in a New York hotel, three $100 bills and other cash, totalling $369.42. On the basis of the foregoing proofs, the Appellate Division reversed Walsh\u2019s conviction, holding that .in addition to the proof of the possession of the jimmy, there must be proof of some circumstance or circumstances from which the jury could draw a legitimate inference of the required intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">Our review of the record of the present case discloses that the State\u2019s proofs met the requirements of the rule enunciated in <em>State v. Walsh. </em>In the <em>Walsh </em>case, there was only one burglar\u2019s tool in the defendant\u2019s possession, whereas in the present case, the evidence supports the finding that the sledge hammer, jimmy and chisel, all were seized in the possession of the defendants. Walsh was found walking on a public sidewalk at 7:50 p. m., whereas the defendants were trespassing on private property in a rather dark and secluded place, at about 11:00 p. m., within approximately 100 feet of a \u201cbeef house,\u201d mentioned by one of the three men (two of whom were identified by' Officer Zirkel) when Zirkel had them under surveillance. In view of the defendants^ denial of any connection with the articles found on the ground, much significance must be given to the odd glove found in the defendants\u2019 automobile, in that it was the mate of the other glove found at the scene of the arrest. While the gloves and flashlight may not be considered as tools adapted or designed for use in breaking and entering, we think that in view of the \u201cburglar\u2019s tools\u201d found in the defendants\u2019 possession, the jury could properly consider them as bearing on the question of intent. <em>State v. </em>Widenski, <em>supra; State v. </em>Hefflin, 338 <em>Mo. </em>236, 89 <em>S. W. 2d </em>938, 103 <em>A. L. R. </em>1301 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1935); <em>People v. </em>Taylor, <em>supra. </em>Additionally, the defendants told conflicting stories concerning their presence at the place of arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>It is our considered opinion that there was sufficient competent evidence to warrant the denial of the motion to acquit and to support the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">Affirmed. \u2022</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
