J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqk\">This is an appeal from an order of the Essex County Court, Probate Division, placing a will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>contest upon a military list for a period of six months, because caveator is in Korea on military service. The proponent appeals.' About a year prior to the order the court first stayed the hearing of the cause because of caveator\u2019s military service goad appointed an administrator <em>pendente lite.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">Motion is made to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the order appealed from is interlocutory and not appeal-able. This is plainly so. There is no merit at all to the position of the appellant that under <em>R. R. </em>2:2-3 <em>(a) (3) </em>the court below was without jurisdiction over the subject matter and that under <em>R. R. </em>2:2-3 <em>(a) </em>(4), a delay in the hearing of the cause visits upon the estate an irreparable injury. Here, there is an administrator <em>pendente lite </em>who has been acting for the estate for over a year. Under the circumstances a delay in the trial is not irreparable. The appeal will therefore have to be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">However, the appeal was fully briefed and argued, and it may not be amiss to consider the matters urged upon us by appellant. Under the Soldiers and Sailors Civil Relief Act, 54 <em>Stat. </em>1181, 50 <em>U. S. C. A. Appendix, </em>\u00a7 521, and <em>R. R. </em>1:31-2, the trial court is invested with a judicial discretion as to whether a case should be placed upon the military list. We find no ground for saying, as asserted by-proponent, that the court abused that discretion \u2014 that is, as stated in <em>State v. Shiren, </em>9 <em>N. J. </em>445 (1952), that there has been a manifest denial of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Indeed it would appear that the \u201cability\u201d of the caveator \u201cto conduct his defense\u201d quite probably would be \u201cmaterially affected by reason of his military service.\u201d See the statute cited. Certainty cannot be called for in such a matter. See <em>Boone v. Lightner, </em>319 <em>U. S. </em>561, 63 <em>S. Ct. </em>1223 (1943); <em>Fluhr v. Fluhr, </em>140 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>131 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1947); <em>In re Cool\u2019s Estate, </em>19 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>236 <em>(Orph. Ct. </em>1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">Caveator is in default for failure to file an answer as required by <em>R. R. </em>4:85-4. However, here is a case involving four wills made by a testator in less than two years, the first three treating caveator more favorably than the last. By <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>the third will, the testator divides his estate about equally between proponent and caveator. By the fourth will, made three or six months later \u2014 the caveator was then in service\u2014 proponent is given about two-thirds of the estate and caveator only one-third. In such a case the caveator\u2019s intimate knowledge of the relationship between the testator and the newly favored beneficiary, his knowledge of the testator\u2019s circumstances and mental condition and of the persons who constituted the close friends of the testator, may be matters of great importance. The last time the caveator was at the testator\u2019s home was four months prior to the execution of the fourth will, but that was recent enough in these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">The statute cited was so designed as to afford a party an opportunity not only to testify in the cause, but \u2014 in a case such as this, where he undoubtedly is the only one well qualified to do so \u2014 to conduct a personal investigation of the matter. We certainly will not, on an appeal charging abuse of discretion, enter upon nice calculations as to the extent to which the caveator\u2019s absence in military service would be of prejudice to his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">It is true that the facts upon which we rely came out on the motion to dismiss the appeal and were apparently not before the trial court at the time the case was put upon the military list. But since the appeal is dismissible and those facts are now before the court and undenied, we certainly will not reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">It is urged on proponent\u2019s behalf that the caveator in this case is not a \u201cperson in interest\u201d within the purview of <em>R. R. </em>5:3-3 <em>(b), </em>and hence that the court committed error when it put the case on the military list.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">As under the former practice, no one may interpose a caveat unless he would be injured by the probate of the will propounded. <em>In re Van Doran\u2019s Estate, </em>119 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>80 <em>(Prerog. </em>1935); <em>Tn re Myers\u2019 Estate, </em>69 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>793 <em>(E. </em>&amp; <em>A. </em>1905); <em>Middleditch v. Williams, </em>47 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>585 (E. <em>&amp; A. </em>1890). In many statutes it is stated that no one may be a contestant in a probate action unless he is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>\"person in interest,\u201d and quite universally these statutes are construed so as to require that the contestant be one who would be aggrieved by the probate. <em>Stephens v. </em>Richardson, 189 <em>Ala. </em>360, 66 <em>So. </em>497 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1914); <em>In re Biehn\u2019s Estate, </em>41 Ariz 403, 18 <em>P. 2d </em>1112 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1933); <em>In re Land\u2019s Estate, </em>166 <em>Cal. </em>538, 137 <em>P. </em>246 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1913); <em>Conner v. Brown, </em>9 <em>W. W. Harr </em>529, 39 <em>Del. </em>529, 3 <em>A. 2d </em>64 <em>(Super. Ct. </em>1938); <em>Cassem v. Prindle, </em>258 <em>Ill. </em>11, 101 <em>N. E. </em>241 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1913); <em>Gruender v. Frank, </em>267 <em>Mo. </em>713, 186 <em>S. W. </em>1004 <em>(Sup. Ct. 1916); In re Thompson\u2019s Will, </em>178 <em>N. C. </em>540, 101 <em>S. E. </em>107 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1919); <em>Kennedy v. Walcutt, </em>118 <em>Ohio St. </em>442, 161 <em>N. E. </em>336 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1928); <em>In re Carlson\u2019s Estate, </em>153 <em>Or. </em>327, 56 P. <em>2d </em>347 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1936); <em>In re Knecht\u2019s Estate, </em>341 <em>Pa. </em>292, 19 <em>A. 2d </em>111 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1941); <em>Moore v. Stark, </em>118 <em>Tex. </em>565, 17 <em>S. W. 2d </em>1037, 21 <em>S. W. 2d </em>296 <em>(Com. App. </em>1929).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">However, the ground of proponent\u2019s attack on caveator\u2019s standing, as it came out on the oral argument, is that when the third will (this was the will caveator apparently claims to be the last valid will) was revoked, the testator was of sound mind and was acting of his own volition. A question such as this, should not be considered while the case is on the military list. We therefore need not decide a question that has not been raised here, namely, whether in this cause dealing with the fourth will, the court should take cognizance of an issue as to the validity of the revocation of the third will. <em>Cf. In re Lent, </em>142 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>21 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">Appeal dismissed.'</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
