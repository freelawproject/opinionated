Appellant, a son of the decedent and a resident of Hew York, filed, a motion in the County Court for an order to show cause why the judgment of probate should not be set aside. On January 29, 1953 the County Court dismissed the motion on the ground that the notice and affidavit were defective. The time in which a non-resident may serve a notice of motion to review a judgment of the Surrogate\u2019s Court before the County Court is limited to a period of six months after the entry of judgment. <em>Rule </em>5 :3 \u2014 4. In the present case such time expired on February 3, 1953. The attorney for the appellant on February 19, 1953 served on the attorney for the executrix a notice with an affidavit annexed that he would apply to the County Court on March 12, 1953 for leave to file a motion <em>nunc pro tunc </em>as of February 3, 1953, and for an order to show cause why the judgment of probate of the aforesaid will should not be set aside or modified. The notice and affidavit were filed with the court on the following day. On March 23, 1953 the County Court entered an order denying the motion. Plaintiff appealed from the above mentioned orders of January 29, 1953 and March 23, 1953.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">This court, on motion of respondent, on June 15, 1953 dismissed the appeal from the order of January 29, 1953 on the ground that the appeal was taken after the time for appeal had expired. There was aro error in the order of March 23, 1953 dismissing appellant\u2019s application. We agree with the reasons for the dismissal stated by Judge McGrath in his opinion reported in 25 <em>N. J. Super. </em>264 <em>(Cty. Ct. </em>1953). Moreover, the record discloses that after the disanissal of appellant\u2019s first motion he had ample opportunity within the time limitation of <em>Rule </em>5 :3-4 to file a new motion overcoming the defects of the original application.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">The order of the County Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
