He appeals from the judgment and from an order denying his motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>There is no foundation for the contention that there was not sufficient evidence to justify the verdict of murder in the first degree; and the only point which calls for special notice arises out of the contention that the court erred in allowing evidence that appellant, in addition to killing O\u2019Shea, also shot another man named Zodikoff. Of course, the general rule is that upon the trial of a defendant on an indictment charging him with one offense, it is not admissible to introduce proof of another and entirely distinct offense merely for the purpose of prejudicing the jury against the defendant. But where the evidence objected to is pertinent to the main issues in the case, and is in itself competent, relevant, and admissible, it cannot be excluded simply because it happens incidentally to include the commission of another offense, nor where the facts touching the other offense are so intimately connected with facts constituting the offense charged as to make both parts of one transaction, so that there could not well be an intelligent statement of the one which did not allude to the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">The main features of the case are theses The homicide\u2014\u25a0 that -is the killing of O\u2019Shea\u2014occurred about a quarter past six o\u2019clock in the morning of Monday, the twelfth day of December, 1904, in a livery stable on San Pedro Street, in the city of Los Angeles, kept by two men named Bennett and Zodikoff, and known as the \u201cExchange Livery and Feed Stable.\u201d About three days before said December 12th the defendant had sold to Bennett and Zodikoff a horse and wagon. The sale of the property was consummated in front of the livery stable, and defendant drove the horse and wagon into the stable to be delivered to the purchasers. He went with Bennett into the office of the stable to make a bill of sale and receive the purchase money, and took with him a certain halter which he claimed was reserved from the sale, but which Zodikoff claimed to be included in the property sold. After defendant and Bennett concluded their business, defendant discovered that his halter had disappeared, and Bennett told him that Zodikoff had taken it. Defendant' was persistent in his demands for the halter and showed anger about the matter. Bennett told him to come the next day and he would tell Zodikoff to give it to him, as it was a small matter. After that defendant made several visits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>to the stable to get the halter; sometimes he saw O\u2019Shea, who was employed in the stable as a hostler, and sometimes Zodikoff, both of whom refused to give him the halter, and he had warm words about the matter with both O\u2019Shea and Zodikoif. On Monday morning, about 5:30 o\u2019clock, defendant was seen by a witness looking into the Exchange Stable through a ventilating hole, and when asked what he was doing answered that he was \u201clooking for somebody.\u201d About a quarter past six o\u2019clock on the same morning there were in the Exchange Stable the defendant, Zodikoif, O\u2019Shea, and a man named McAfee, who was a witness for the prosecution. Defendant and Zodikoif were near each other, and O\u2019Shea was a little farther toward the rear of the stable, shaking up some straw in one of the horse-stalls. McAfee testified that he heard one voice say, \u201cI come to get the halter,\u201d and another voice said, \u201cYou don\u2019t get it.\u201d Then came the reply, \u201cI am a son of a bitch if I don\u2019t get it,\u201d and another answer, \u201cI am God damned if you do.\u201d The witness testified that then \u201cdefendant pulled a revolver and fired. He fired at Zodikoif.\u201d The bullet struck Zodikoif, who ran past McAfee towards the street. McAfee testified that \u201cthen the defendant stepped about three feet in that direction and fired three times toward the back of the stable. I did not see what he was firing at. Immediately before I saw him fire in the rear of the stable three times, I saw him shoot at the man Zodikoif. . . . Immediately after he fired these three shots, I saw a man fall immediately after those three shots were fired. \u2019 \u2019 He further testified that \u201cdefendant stepped across the body and used a large knife upon it,\u201d and the defendant stabbed the knife into the body six times. The witness then went into the street, but returned in about ten minutes and found the dead body of O\u2019Shea \u201clying in the same place where I saw the defendant plunging the knife into him.\u201d In another part of his testimony he stated that \u201cone minute would take the whole time that it took to stand there and watch it all and start to the street.\u201d Other witnesses'who were in the vicinity, some of them being in another livery stable called the \u201cAscott,\u201d just across the street opposite the Exchange Stable, testified to hearing the shots. One witness said that \u201cit was seemingly no time after I heard the first shot until I heard the others.\u201d Other witnesses speak of the time be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>tween the first and second shots as \u201cless than half a minute.\u201d These witnesses testified that immediately after hearing the first shot Zodikoff came running out into the street crying, \u201cI am shot! Help!\u201d One of these witnesses, after hearing the first shot, went to the stable and was there in time to see defendant plunging the knife into the body of O\u2019Shea. Another witness who was in the Ascott stable testified that after hearing the first shot he saw defendant stab O\u2019Shea. It is quite clear, therefore, that the shooting of Zodikoff so immediately preceded the shooting and stabbing of O\u2019Shea as to form part of the same transaction, and it also appears that the motive for killing both was the same. It is, indeed, difficult to see how the witnesses could have given an intelligent statement of the occurrences which resulted in the death of O\u2019Shea without reference to the shooting of Zodikoff. As was said in <em>People </em>v. <em>Linares, </em>142 Cal. 17, [75 Pac. 308]: \u201cNo matter at what point the narrative had commenced, it in the end would almost necessarily have reached these connecting facts.\u201d Our conclusion is that appellant\u2019s objections to the said evidence touching the shooting of Zodikoff are not maintainable, and that the court did not err in the ruling complained of. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Walters, </em>98 Cal. 138, [32 Pac. 864]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Suesser, </em>142 Cal. 362, [75 Pac. 1093]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Linares, </em>142 Cal. 17, [75 Pac. 308].)</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Appellant in his briefs objects to two of the instructions given to the jury. The first is a mere copy of section 1105 of the Penal Code; and we see nothing in the case at bar which made the giving of that section improper. The other instruction is as follows: \u201cGentlemen of the jury, there has been offered and admitted some testimony in this case relating to the shooting of one Zodikoff at the time it is claimed the defendant shot Jerry O\u2019Shea. The only relation or object in considering such testimony was to illustrate or establish the intent or motive with which the shooting of Jerry O\u2019Shea was done, if any, and before you can consider the question of the shooting of said Zodikoff you must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant shot said Zodikoff willfully, unlawfully, and intentionally; and if you have such reasonable doubt you are instructed to entirely disregard all the testimony you heard on that question.\u201d Whatever grounds of objection this instruction might have pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>seated to the prosecution, it could in no way have been prejudicial to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">There are no other points calling for notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">The judgment and order appealed from are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">Angellotti, J., Shaw, J., Van Dyke, J., Lorigan, J., and Henshaw, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
