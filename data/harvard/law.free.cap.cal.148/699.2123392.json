Subsequently, upon the twenty-third <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>day of February, 1905, the clerk entered a judgment of dismissal. Plaintiff\u2019s appeal was taken within six months from the last-named date, but more than six months from the entry of the minute order. Defendant moves to dismiss the appeal upon this ground, and the motion must be granted. It is well settled by our decisions that the entry of the order of dismissal in the minute-book of the court, being declared by the statute to be \u201ceffective for all purposes,\u201d is in its nature a final judgment, and from the date of that entry the time within which an appeal may be taken begins to run <em>(Marks </em>v. <em>Keenan, </em>140 Cal. 33, [73 Pac. 751]; <em>Pacific Pav.
