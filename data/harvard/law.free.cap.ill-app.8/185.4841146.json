Hughes v. William G. Lumsden.</parties><headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b187-5\" pgmap=\"187\">1. Statement. \u2014 Appellee, as special commissioner, held notes belonging to Mrs. A. Upon the representation of her husband that he was acting as her agent, appellee delivered the notes, properly indorsed, to appellant, in part payment of land purchased of him by Mr. A. Afterwards Mr. A. repudiated the contract, and refused to accept a deed of the land, whereupon appellee demanded a return of the notes, and failing, brought trover for their conversion, against appellant.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b187-6\" pgmap=\"187\">2. Agency. \u2014 An instruction that if Mrs. A., through her agent, ordered appellee to turn over these notes in part payment of land sold to her husband, then such order and acceptance and delivery amounted to a receiving of the notes by Mrs. A., and appellee cannot maintain this action was proper, correctly states the law, and should have been given.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b187-7\" pgmap=\"187\">3. Statute ov Frauds. \u2014 An objection that the contract for side of the lands not being in writing was void under the statute of frauds, cannot be raised by appellant, because he was not a party to the contract. He held the notes merely as the trustee of Mrs. A.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b187-8\" pgmap=\"187\">4. Conditional Delivery. \u2014 The promise by appellant to procure a receipt from Mrs. A. for the notes, and deliver the same to appellee, did not render the delivery conditional, so that a failure would authorize appellee to avoid the contract.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b187-9\" pgmap=\"187\">Appeal from the Circuit Court of Morgan county; the Hon.

He was living with his wife, and acting as her agent, whether with or without her authority, no one had better means of knowing, and he testifies that whatever he did in the matter was as agent for his wife, and as he understood, by her authority.</p> <p id=\"b189-7\" pgmap=\"189\">The question of his authority to act for his wife was for the jury to determine, and was properly submitted by the instruction.</p> <p id=\"b189-8\" pgmap=\"189\">Again, appellee insists that appellant acquired no right to the notes, because the contract for the purchase of the land was not in writing, and therefore void under the Statute of Frauds.</p> <p id=\"b189-9\" pgmap=\"189\">Even if the contract was void for the reason assigned, the statute could only be interposed by the parties to the contract, and not by Lumsden, who had no interest in it. So long as they were satisfied, it was not his business whether it was in writing or not. He held the notes as trustee for Mrs. Ash, having no interest in them, and if he delivered them to Hughes in payment for the land sold by him to Ash, by the direction of Mrs. Ash through her authorized agent, it was the same as if he had delivered them to her in person, and from that moment he ceased to have any interest, either general or special, in the notes, and no subsequent repudiation of the contract could reinvest him with title to the notes or any right to their possession.</p> <p id=\"b189-10\" pgmap=\"189(33) 190(10)\">No doubt if Hughes should be unable to comply with his contract, or refuse to make a deed upon demand and tender of the balance of the purchase-money, the purchaser or his legal representatives could recover back the purchase-money advanced, with interest.</p> <p id=\"b190-5\" pgmap=\"190\">The promise of appellant at the time he received the notes, to procure a receipt from Mrs. Ash and deliver the same to appellee, was exacted by appellee for his own protection, but did not render the delivery conditional, so that a failure would authorize appellee to avoid the contract and recover the notes back. He might have retained the notes until he got the receipt, or contracted for their return in case of failure to get it : but instead he parted with the notes, relying upon the promise of appellant that he would furnish the receipt at some future time.</p> <p id=\"b190-6\" pgmap=\"190\">The principal contract can be performed by the parties in interest independent of this promise, and hence it cannot be regarded as a condition, the breach of which will authorize the avoidance of the contract, but as a stipulation only, the breach of which gives an action to the injured party. 2 Parsons on Contracts, \u00a7 527.</p> <p id=\"b190-7\" pgmap=\"190\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p> <p id=\"b190-8\" pgmap=\"190\">Reversed and remanded.</p> <p id=\"b190-9\" pgmap=\"190\">Davis, J., dissenting.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
