On the 25th day of June, 1877, the county board of Cook county passed a resolution instructing its clerk to issue to Comisky a duplicate order for the same amount, to replace the order lost, and such duplicate order was afterwards issued to Comisky, and paid by the county treasurer.

This proposition is fully sustained by the authorities. Knapp v. Mayor, etc., of Hoboken, 10 Vroom, 394; Town of Hackettstown v. Swackhamer, 8 Id. 191; The Mayor v. Ray, 19 Wal. 468; Emery v.

Sec. 406; 1 Daniells on Negotiable Instruments, \u00a7\u00a7 420, 427, 428, 435.</p> <p id=\"b399-4\" pgmap=\"399\">In this case the indebtedness represented by the original county order was paid by the county treasurer to Comisky. The issuing of a duplicate order, and the payment of the money on surrender of that order, was only the mode adopted by the county authorities for making payment of the original indebtedness, and preserving a proper voucher of the transaction. This payment would doubtless have been a complete defense against the original order in the hands of Comisky, and the payment having been made so far as appears, without notice to the county authorities that the original order had come into the hands of the relator, or had even got into circulation, we are unable to see why the same defense is not equally available as against the relator.</p> <p id=\"b399-5\" pgmap=\"399(73) 400(54)\">The rule is inflexible, even since the passage of the amendatory act of 1874, that mandamus will not lie where the right sought to be enforced is doubtful. The party resorting to this writ must show a clear legal right to have the thing sought by it done. People v. Village of Crotty, 93 Ill. 180; People v. Klokke, 92 Id. 134. The least that can be said in this case is. that the relator has failed to show such clear legal right to payment of the county order in question as can entitle him to have such payment enforced by mandamus. On the facts appearing at the trial the court should have dismissed the writ. The judgment will accordingly be reversed and the cause remanded.</p> <p id=\"b400-5\" pgmap=\"400\">Judgment reversed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
