McCLANAHAN, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">UPON A REHEARING EN BANC</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">Deborah Ann Stacy (wife) appeals the trial court\u2019s order terminating, pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-109(A), the obligation of William Leslie Stacy (husband) to make payments on a mortgage on the former marital home under the terms of the parties\u2019 property settlement agreement (PSA). Wife contends the court erred in finding the payments constituted spousal support under the PSA and, therefore, had no authority under Code \u00a7 20-109(A) to terminate husband\u2019s mortgage payment obligation. Wife also claims she is entitled under the PSA to an award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs for this appeal and the proceedings below.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">A panel majority of this Court affirmed the decision of the trial court. We granted a petition for rehearing <em>en banc </em>and stayed the mandate of the panel decision. Upon rehearing <em>en banc, </em>we reverse the trial court and remand for the trial court\u2019s consideration of wife\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees and costs under the PSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b83-10\">Husband and wife divorced in 2001 after entering into a PSA, wherein the parties expressly \u201cwaive[d]\u201d spousal support. The parties also agreed that wife would receive the marital home and husband would be solely responsible for payment of the \u201cremaining mortgage indebtedness\u201d on the home. The trial court approved the parties\u2019 PSA and incorporated it by reference into the final decree of divorce. Upon entry of the final decree, husband, pursuant to the PSA, transferred his interest in the marital home to wife and \u201crefinanced the [b]ank mortgage obligation into a [pjromissory [n]ote solely in his name.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>In 2006, husband, citing Code \u00a7 20-109, filed a petition seeking to terminate his mortgage payment obligation under the PSA based on the claim wife had been eohabitating with an individual in a relationship analogous to marriage for several years. Under Code \u00a7 20-109(A), spousal support is subject to termination under certain circumstances, including the payee\u2019s cohabitation analogous to marriage for a year or more.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In response, wife stipulated to her involvement in the alleged relationship for more than a year. She argued, however, that under the express terms of the PSA husband\u2019s mortgage payment obligation was not spousal support; rather, it was part of the parties\u2019 equitable distribution, thus negating Code \u00a7 20-109(A)\u2019s applicability and the court\u2019s authority to terminate the obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">Neither party argued that the PSA was ambiguous, and the trial court found the PSA was unambiguous.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court then \u201cclassifie[d]\u201d husband\u2019s third party mortgage payments as spousal support, and thereby terminated the obligation to the bank (a non-party) pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-109(A) on cohabitation grounds. In doing so, the court relied on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>language in paragraph 9 of the PSA in which the parties stipulated that, while husband\u2019s mortgage payments \u201cwere not direct support payments being made to wife,\u201d they were \u201cin the nature of support,\u201d and therefore \u201cnon-dischargeable\u201d by husband in any bankruptcy proceeding.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">A. <em>Termination of Husband\u2019s Mortgage Payment Obligation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">Wife argues the trial court erred in \u201cre-writ[ing]\u201d the parties\u2019 PSA when it characterized husband\u2019s third party mortgage payments as \u201cspousal support,\u201d contrary to the express terms of the PSA, and in terminating the obligation under Code \u00a7 20-109(A) based on that erroneous interpretation. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">The trial court\u2019s interpretation of the PSA is an issue of law that we review <em>de novo. Palmer &amp; Palmer Co., LLC v. Waterfront Marine Constr., Inc., </em>276 Va. 285, 289, 662 S.E.2d 77, 80 (2008) (citation omitted); <em>Henderlite v. Henderlite, </em>3 Va.App. 539, 541, 351 S.E.2d 913, 913-14 (1987); see <em>Eure v. Norfolk Shipbuilding &amp; Drydock Corp., </em>263 Va. 624, 631, 561 S.E.2d 663, 667 (2002) (an appellate court has \u2018\u201can equal opportunity to consider the words of the contract within the four corners of the instrument itself\u201d) (quoting <em>Wilson v. Holyfield, </em>227 Va. 184, 188, 313 S.E.2d 396, 398 (1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">Code \u00a7 20-109(A) is subject to the statutory proviso, under subsection C, that no order \u201cshall be entered except in accordance with [the PSA].\u201d Code \u00a7 20-109(C). \u201c[T]his requires the trial judge to examine the parties\u2019 agreement to ascertain whether the relief sought by the moving party is encompassed within the terms of the agreement.\u201d <em>Rutledge v. Rutledge, </em>45 Va.App. 56, 63, 608 S.E.2d 504, 508 (2005) (citing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number><em>White v. White, </em>257 Va. 139, 144-45, 509 S.E.2d 323, 326 (1999)). Accordingly, a PSA is governed by the same rules of construction applied to other contracts. <em>Plunkett v. Plunkett, </em>271 Va. 162, 166, 624 S.E.2d 39, 41 (2006); <em>White, </em>257 Va. at 144, 509 S.E.2d at 325; <em>Irwin v. Irwin, </em>47 Va.App. 287, 292-93, 623 S.E.2d 438, 441 (2005). When applying these rules, the court\u2019s function is to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-5\">\u201cconstrue the contract made by the parties, not to make a contract for them. The question for the court is what did the parties agree to as evidenced by their contract. The guiding light in the construction of a contract is the intention of the parties as expressed by them in the words they have used, and courts are bound to say that the parties intended what the written instrument plainly declares.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AR5\"><em>Irwin, </em>47 Va.App. at 293, 623 S.E.2d at 441 (quoting <em>Wilson, </em>227 Va. at 187, 313 S.E.2d at 398). That is, \u201c[w]hen a contract is clear and unambiguous, it is the court\u2019s duty to interpret the contract, as written.\u201d <em>Palmer &amp; Palmer Co., </em>276 Va. at 289, 662 S.E.2d at 80 (citation omitted); <em>see PMA Capital Ins. Co. v. U.S. Airways, Inc., </em>271 Va. 352, 360-61, 626 S.E.2d 369, 374 (2006) (reversing trial court on contract interpretation after concluding the court \u201cessentially re-wrote the [contract] and made a new contract\u201d in derogation of its \u201cplain language\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">Applying these principles, our Supreme Court and this Court have rejected arguments that mortgage payments constituted spousal support under the respective settlement agreements at issue. In <em>White, </em>257 Va. 139, 509 S.E.2d 323, an agreement of the husband to pay the mortgage on the marital home conveyed to the wife was ratified by the trial court and incorporated into the parties\u2019 final divorce decree. The decree stated that \u201c \u2018[Mr. White] entered into [the] agreement ... with respect to maintenance and support.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 142, 509 S.E.2d at 324. Three years after the divorce, Ms. White sold the home, at which time the balance due on the mortgage was paid from the proceeds of the sale. Though Mr. White made the payments to the mortgagee bank as called for under the agreement until the time of sale of the home, Ms. White filed a complaint seeking an order requiring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>Mr. White to show cause why he should not be held in contempt for failure to then make payments to her in the amount of the mortgage payments. <em>Id. </em>The trial court ruled in Ms. White\u2019s favor on her petition, holding that the agreement to pay the mortgage constituted a lump sum award to her payable in installments as \u201cmaintenance and support\u201d under the terms of the divorce decree. <em>Id. </em>at 143, 509 S.E.2d at 325.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">The Supreme Court reversed the trial court\u2019s decision, ruling as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-6\">The agreement clearly obligates Mr. White to pay the $30,000 mortgage on the house ... to [the] Bank in 120 monthly installments. It contains no provision for Mr. White to make any payments to Mrs. White. Moreover, and of particular significance in this case, nothing within the express terms of the agreement evinces any intent of the parties that Mr. White\u2019s obligation would survive the satisfaction of the mortgage debt, regardless of the manner in which that debt was extinguished.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-7\">Accordingly, we hold that the agreement obligated Mr. White to make payments on the mortgage on the marital home so long as that debt existed, but did not obligate him to pay a fixed sum to the wife in installments with interest, as she alleged in her bill of complaint and as the trial court subsequently found in the show cause hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 145, 509 S.E.2d at 326. The Court concluded that \u201c[t]he language of the final decree of divorce referencing the agreement as \u2018an agreement ... with respect to maintenance and support\u2019 could not, and did not, alter <em>the intent of the parties as expressed in the agreement.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">Similarly, in <em>Owney v. </em>Owney, 8 Va.App. 255, 260, 379 S.E.2d 745, 748 (1989), this Court held that the trial court erred in \u201ccharacterizing]\u201d as \u201cspousal support\u201d the husband\u2019s obligation, under the parties\u2019 property settlement agreement, to make mortgage payments on the marital home. Like the instant case, the parties\u2019 agreement in <em>Owney </em>required that husband convey his interest in the marital residence to wife <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>and that he assume the mortgage payments on the first deed of trust held by the mortgagee bank. The agreement also \u201cspecifically release[d] the husband and wife \u2018of any claim either might have for alimony or support.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>After husband defaulted on the mortgage, wife paid off the obligation and petitioned the trial court to require husband to make the payments to her as spousal support under the parties\u2019 PSA. The trial court granted wife\u2019s petition as requested. <em>Id. </em>at 257-58, 379 S.E.2d at 747. On appeal, we reversed the trial court and remanded the case for further consideration of husband\u2019s continuing liability on the mortgage obligation, if any. In doing so, however, we concluded that the trial court\u2019s characterization of husband\u2019s third party debt obligation as spousal support, and its award of those debt payments to wife as support, \u201ceontrovene[d] the plain language of the [parties\u2019] agreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 260, 379 S.E.2d at 748.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">Here, the parties expressly waived spousal support in paragraph 8 of the PSA, which provides in its entirety as follows: \u201c8. SPOUSAL SUPPORT: Each party hereby waives any present or future right to receive any support or maintenance from the other.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">With regard to husband\u2019s mortgage obligation, paragraph 4 of the PSA (under the heading \u201cDEBTS\u201d) specifically provides, in relevant part, that husband \u201cshall be responsible for the payment of ... [t]he remaining mortgage indebtedness [on the marital residence]\u201d; husband \u201cshall be solely responsible\u201d for this debt; and husband \u201cshall indemnify and hold the [w]ife harmless from any and all ... claims or demands, including, but not limited to, attorney\u2019s fees\u201d regarding this debt. In conjunction with these provisions, husband further agreed, in paragraph 19, to convey to wife all of his rights, title and interest in the marital residence. Accordingly, upon entry of the final divorce decree, which incorporated the PSA, husband deeded his undivided interest in the marital residence to wife, and then refinanced the bank\u2019s mortgage on the property with a promissory note solely in his name.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>Consistent with paragraph 4\u2019s indemnification and hold harmless provisions in favor of wife regarding husband\u2019s assumption of the mortgage debt, paragraph 5 (under the heading \u201cCREDIT OF PARTIES\u201d) provides, in part, that \u201c[n]either party shall at any time hereafter ... contract any debts, charges or liabilities of any nature whatsoever for which the other party shall or may become liable to answer.\u201d Furthermore, \u201c[e]ach party covenants and agrees to save and keep the other party free and harmless from any and all debts, charges and liabilities which may hereinafter be incurred or contracted by such party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">Challenging the import of these plainly stated provisions, husband contends the language in paragraph 9<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of the PSA characterizing his mortgage payment obligation as \u201cin the nature of support\u201d renders \u201cineffective\u201d the parties\u2019 express waiver of spousal support in paragraph 8, and makes the obligation subject to termination under Code \u00a7 20-109(A). Settled principles of contract construction, however, dictate that such was not the parties\u2019 contractual intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>In giving effect to the intention of the parties \u201cas expressed by them in the words they have used,\u201d <em>Irwin, </em>47 Va.App. at 293, 623 S.E.2d at 441 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted), we are not to treat any word or clause in the PSA \u201c \u2018as meaningless if a reasonable meaning can be given to it, and there is a presumption that the parties have not used words needlessly,\u2019 \u201d <em>Dominion Sav. Bank, FSB v. Costello, </em>257 Va. 413, 417, 512 S.E.2d 564, 567 (1999) (quoting <em>D.C. McClain, Inc. v. Arlington Co., </em>249 Va. 131, 135-36, 452 S.E.2d 659, 662 (1995)). At the same time, we must construe the contract as a whole. <em>Quadros &amp; Assocs., P.C. v. City of Hampton, </em>268 Va. 50, 55, 597 S.E.2d 90, 93 (2004) (citations omitted). In other words, \u201cthe meaning of a contract \u2018is to be gathered from all its associated parts assembled as a unitary expression of the agreement of the parties.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sully Station II Community Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. Dye, </em>259 Va. 282, 284, 525 S.E.2d 555, 556 (2000) (quoting <em>Berry v. Klinger, </em>225 Va. 201, 208, 300 S.E.2d 792, 796 (1983)); <em>see Virginian Ry. Co. v. Hood, </em>152 Va. 254, 258, 146 S.E. 284, 285 (1929) (explaining that a contract\u2019s provisions \u201care to be harmonized when possible\u201d and \u201ceffect ... given to every stipulation when it can reasonably be done\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">When all of the provisions of the PSA are considered as a whole and read in context, with reasonable meaning given to each provision, it is evident that paragraph 9 was written with a certainty intended to accomplish one purpose only: to ensure, to the extent possible, that should husband ever elect in the future to file a petition for bankruptcy, the mortgage obligation being assumed by him would not be dischargeable in the bankruptcy proceeding. This prohibition was made possible because, under bankruptcy law, an obligation found to be \u201cin the nature of support\u201d is a nondischargeable debt under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(5). <em>See, e.g., Brunson v. Austin (In're Austin), </em>271 B.R. 97 (Bankr.E.D.Va. 2001) (explaining multi-factor test for determining whether a particular obligation is \u201cin the nature of support\u201d under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(5)). Therefore, when placing this prohibition in paragraph 9 immediately after the parties\u2019 express and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>definitive waiver of any right to demand or receive spousal support from the other, the parties surely had no intent to render paragraph 8 meaningless and create an obligation of spousal support. As used in the PSA, the phrase \u201cin the nature of support\u201d was technical language from the Bankruptcy Code and limited to its bankruptcy context. Husband\u2019s third party debt obligation was thus never spousal support as contemplated by Code \u00a7 20-109. To hold otherwise would amount to \u201calter[ing] the intent of the parties as expressed in [their] agreement.\u201d <em>White, </em>257 Va. at 145, 509 S.E.2d at 326. The obligation can still be viewed, however, as \u201cin the nature of support\u201d so as to render it non-dischargeable under bankruptcy law. \u201c \u2018[A] debt could be in the \u201cnature of support\u201d under [11 U.S.C. \u00a7 ]523(a)(5) even though it would not legally qualify as alimony or support under state law.\u2019\u201d <em>In re Gianakas, </em>917 F.2d 759, 762 (3rd Cir.1990) (quoting <em>In re Yeates, </em>807 F.2d 874, 878 (10th Cir.1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">The trial court thus erred in treating husband\u2019s mortgage payment obligation as spousal support under Code \u00a7 20-109, and terminating it on cohabitation grounds. Under the plainly stated terms of the parties\u2019 PSA, it was an unconditional third party obligation incurred by husband as part of the parties\u2019 equitable distribution\u2014with spousal support having been expressly waived. As such, the trial court had no authority to terminate the obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">B. <em>Attorney\u2019s Fees and Costs Pursuant to the PSA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">Wife also argues she is entitled under the PSA to an award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs for this appeal and the proceedings below. Paragraph 24 of the PSA states: \u201cThe parties agree that if one party incurs any expenses in the enforcement of any of the provisions of this [a]greement, the other shall be responsible for, and shall pay forthwith, any and all expenses incurred, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d In ruling in husband\u2019s favor, the trial court did not award attorney\u2019s fees to wife. Because we reverse the judgment of the trial court and rule in wife\u2019s favor, we remand the case to the trial court for consideration of wife\u2019s request <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>for attorney\u2019s fees and costs under the PSA. <em>See Rutledge, </em>45 Va.App. at 62, 608 S.E.2d at 507 (contractual provisions for attorney fees in PSA are enforceable in same manner as any other terms); <em>Sanford v. Sanford, </em>19 Va.App. 241, 249-50, 450 S.E.2d 185, 190 (1994) (remanding case for award of attorney fees to wife under PSA for enforcement action); <em>see generally Ulloa v. QSP, Inc., </em>271 Va. 72, 81-83, 624 S.E.2d 43, 49-50 (2006) (analyzing award of attorney fees under employment contract).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">For these reasons, we reverse the trial court\u2019s order terminating husband\u2019s mortgage payment obligation and remand for consideration of wife\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees and costs for this appeal and the proceedings below pursuant to paragraph 24 of the PSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b83-11\">.
