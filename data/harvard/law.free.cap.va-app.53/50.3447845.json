Williams (\u201cWilliams\u201d) appeals his conviction for grand larceny, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-95, and conspiracy to commit grand larceny, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-23(B). Williams argues that the trial court erred by refusing to suppress statements that he made to a police officer because the warning given by the officer did not sufficiently advise him of his right to an attorney. Williams also argues that the trial court erred by holding that the evidence was sufficient to prove that he conspired to commit larceny. For the following reasons, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-13\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b95-14\">\u201cOn appeal, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the prevailing party below, giving it the benefit of all reasonable inferences.\u201d <em>Pierce v. Commonwealth, </em>50 Va.App. 609, 612, 652 S.E.2d 785, 787 (2007). So viewed, the evidence established the following.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>Late in the evening of January 9, 2007, Adrian Smith (\u201cSmith\u201d) broke into two trailers on the property of Old Dominion Metals. From those trailers, Smith removed several Rubbermaid containers containing copper and brass, and placed the containers between the two trailers. The containers were too heavy for Smith to carry away by himself, so he called Williams and asked him to help him \u201cpick some stuff up.\u201d When Williams arrived, Smith told Williams that he had removed several containers from the trailers and needed help carrying them away. Williams drove his truck to the trailers, where he and Smith loaded the containers into the truck\u2019s bed. Williams then drove the truck with the metal to Smith\u2019s house. Williams later admitted that he knew at the time that Smith did not have permission to take the containers.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Williams was subsequently arrested on an unrelated charge, and was being held at the Chesapeake City Jail, when Detective Mark Anthony (\u201cDetective Anthony\u201d) of the Portsmouth Police Department went to speak with him. Prior to speaking with Williams about the stolen metal, Detective Anthony gave him the following warnings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-6\">You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney, the Court will consider appointing an attorney for you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">Detective Anthony then asked Williams if he understood his rights, and Williams responded \u201cYes.\u201d Williams went on to describe the facts set forth above.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">Following his confession, the Commonwealth charged Williams with grand larceny, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-95 and conspiracy to commit grand larceny, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-23(B). Prior to trial, Williams moved to suppress his confession, arguing that he was not sufficiently apprised of his right to an attorney. Williams claimed that the officer\u2019s statement that the court would \u201cconsider\u201d appointing an attorney did not satisfy the requirements enunciated in <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). The trial court denied Williams\u2019 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>At trial, the Commonwealth presented only one witness, Detective Anthony. Detective Anthony testified about what Williams had told him during the interview in the Chesapeake City Jail. Williams moved to strike the evidence, claiming that the Commonwealth failed to prove a conspiracy because Smith had already \u201ccompleted\u201d the larceny before Williams agreed to assist him. The trial court denied Williams\u2019 motion and ultimately convicted him of both charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"AQc\">A. The Miranda Warnings</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Williams claims that Detective Anthony violated his Fifth Amendment rights by interrogating him without adequately warning him of his rights against self-incrimination. Williams argues that Detective Anthony\u2019s statement, \u201cIf you cannot afford an attorney, the Court will <em>consider </em>appointing an attorney for you,\u201d was not sufficient to inform him of his right to an attorney. Specifically, Williams claims that statement does not convey \u201cthe absolute right to have counsel appointed if one is indigent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">\u201cOn appeal from a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress, the burden is on the appellant to show that the denial of the motion constituted reversible error.\u201d <em>Emerson v. Commonwealth, </em>43 Va.App. 263, 272, 597 S.E.2d 242, 247 (2004). \u201c[W]e are bound by the trial court\u2019s findings of historical fact unless \u2018plainly wrong\u2019 or without evidence to support them.\u201d <em>McGee v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 193, 198, 487 S.E.2d 259, 261 (1997) <em>(en banc). </em>However, \u201c[w]e review <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the \u2018trial court\u2019s application of defined legal standards to the particular facts of a case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Emerson, </em>43 Va.App. at 272, 597 S.E.2d at 247 (quoting <em>Watts v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 206, 213, 562 S.E.2d 699, 703 (2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">In <em>Miranda, </em>the Supreme Court of the United States \u201cestablished certain procedural safeguards that require police to advise criminal suspects of their rights under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments before commencing custodial inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>rogation.\u201d <em>Duckworth v. Eagan, </em>492 U.S. 195, 202, 109 S.Ct. 2875, 2880, 106 L.Ed.2d 166 (1989). Specifically, the Court required that a suspect be told that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMO\">he has the right to remain silent, that anything he says can be used against him in a court of law, that he has the right to the presence of an attorney, and that <em>if he cannot afford an attorney one unit be appointed for him prior to any questioning if he so desires.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-5\"><em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 479, 86 S.Ct. at 1630 (emphasis added). However, the Supreme Court has \u201cnever insisted that <em>Miranda </em>warnings be given in the exact form described in that decision.\u201d <em>Duckworth, </em>492 U.S. at 202,109 S.Ct. at 2880. \u201cIn <em>Miranda </em>itself, the Court said that \u2018the warnings required and the waiver necessary in accordance with our opinion today are, <em>in the absence of a fully effective equivalent, </em>prerequisites to the admissibility of any statement made by a defendant.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 476, 86 S.Ct. at 1629) (emphasis in original). Moreover, \u201c \u2018the rigidity of <em>Miranda </em>[does not] extend to the precise formulation of the warnings given a criminal defendant,\u2019 and [] \u2018no talismanic incantation [is] required to satisfy its strictures.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 202-03, 109 S.Ct. at 2880 (quoting <em>California v. Prysock, </em>453 U.S. 355, 359, 101 S.Ct. 2806, 2809, 69 L.Ed.2d 696 (1981) <em>(per </em>curiam)) (first and last alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">Thus, the mere fact that Detective Anthony did not use the exact language of <em>Miranda </em>does not make the warning ineffective. In order to determine whether Detective Anthony adequately advised Williams of his rights, we must determine if Detective Anthony\u2019s statement was a \u201cfully effective equivalent\u201d to the warnings articulated in <em>Miranda. </em>384 U.S. at 476, 86 S.Ct. at 1629.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">In <em>Duckworth, </em>the Supreme Court of the United States addressed a similar situation. In that case,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-8\">The police told respondent that he had the right to remain silent, that anything he said could be used against him in court, that he had the right to speak to an attorney before and during questioning, that he had \u201cthis right to the advice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>and presence of a lawyer even if [he could] not afford to hire one,\u201d and that he had the \u201cright to stop answering at any time until [he] talked to a lawyer.\u201d As noted, the police also added that they could not provide respondent with a lawyer, but that one would be appointed <em>\u201cif and when you go to court.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-5\"><em>Duckworth, </em>492 U.S. at 203, 109 S.Ct. at 2880 (citations omitted) (emphasis added). The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held that the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Au\">\u201cif and when you go to court\u201d language suggested that \u201conly those accused who can afford an attorney have the right to have one present before answering any questions,\u201d and \u201cimplie[d] that if the accused does not \u2018go to court,\u2019 i.e.[,] the government does not file charges, the accused is not entitled to [counsel] at all.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-6\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Eagan v. Duckworth, </em>843 F.2d 1554, 1557 (7th Cir.1988)) (alteration in original). The Supreme Court held that the Seventh Circuit \u201cmisapprehended the effect of the inclusion of \u2018if and when you go to court\u2019 language.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court reasoned that the \u201cif and when\u201d language simply \u201cdescribed the procedure for the appointment of counsel,\u201d explaining that, \u201c[u]nder Indiana law, counsel is appointed at the defendant\u2019s initial appearance in court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 204, 109 S.Ct. at 2881 (citing Ind.Code \u00a7 35-33-7-6 (1988)). The Court concluded that the warning given \u201ctouched all of the bases required by <em>Miranda,\u201d </em>and, was therefore, sufficient to alert the defendant to his Fifth Amendment rights. <em>Id. </em>at 203, 109 S.Ct. at 2880.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">Here, as in <em>Duckworth, </em>the officer added language to the <em>Miranda </em>warning that could be interpreted as qualifying or limiting the suspect\u2019s Fifth Amendment rights. However, as was the case in <em>Duckworth, </em>Detective Anthony\u2019s warning did nothing more than \u201cdescribe[ ] the procedure for appointment of counsel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 204, 109 S.Ct. at 2881. In Virginia, the government does not provide attorneys merely because someone claims to be unable to afford one. Code \u00a7 19.2-159 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>If the accused shall claim that he is indigent ... the court shall determine from oral examination of the accused or other competent evidence whether or not the accused is indigent within the contemplation of law pursuant to the guidelines set forth in this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">Thus, Detective Anthony\u2019s statement that \u201cthe court will consider appointing an attorney\u201d was technically accurate in reflecting the procedure set forth in Code \u00a7 19.2-159. Had Williams claimed to be unable to afford an attorney, he would have had to appear in court, where a judge would have considered whether or not he was indigent according to law. The warnings given by Detective Anthony did nothing more than convey this procedure to Williams. The warnings alerted Williams to all of his substantive rights under the Fifth Amendment, without qualification. Detective Anthony\u2019s statement \u201ctouched all the bases required by <em>Miranda,\u201d Duckworth, 492 </em>U.S. at 203, 109 S.Ct. at <em>2880, </em>in that they fairly advised him of his right to remain silent and his right to consult with counsel, if he chose and were thus the \u201cfully effective equivalent\u201d of the warnings spelled out by the Supreme Court, <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 476, 86 S.Ct. at 1629. Therefore, the trial court did not err by refusing to suppress the statements made by Williams to Detective Anthony.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b101-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>\n<em>B. Conspiracy to Commit Grand Larceny</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">Williams claims that the evidence was insufficient to convict him of conspiracy to commit larceny because Smith\u2019s actions prior to the agreement were already sufficient to convict Smith of larceny. Thus, Williams reasons, there could have been no \u201cpreconcert\u201d and, therefore, no conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">When considering a challenge that the evidence presented at trial is insufficient, we \u201cpresume the judgment of the trial court to be correct\u201d and reverse only if the trial court\u2019s decision is \u201cplainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u201d <em>Davis v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 96, 99, 570 S.E.2d 875, 876-77 (2002). We do not \u201csubstitute our judgment for that of the trier of fact.\u201d <em>Wactor v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 375, 380, 564 S.E.2d 160, 162 (2002). \u201cInstead, the relevant question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Code \u00a7 18.2-23 makes it a felony to \u201cconspire, confederate or combine with another or others ... to commit larceny or counsel, assist, aid or abet another in the performance of a larceny, where the aggregate value of the goods or merchandise involved is more than $200.\u201d \u201cConspiracy is defined as \u2018an agreement between two or more persons by some concerted action to commit an offense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Feigley v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 717, 722, 432 S.E.2d 520, 524 (1993) (quoting <em>Wright v. Commonwealth, </em>224 Va. 502, 505, 297 S.E.2d 711, 713 (1982)). The crime is \u201ccomplete when the parties agree to commit an offense.\u201d <em>Gray v. Commonwealth, </em>260 Va. 675, 680, 537 S.E.2d 862, 865 (2000). \u201cIn order to establish the existence of a conspiracy, as opposed to mere aiding and abetting, the Commonwealth must prove \u2018the additional element of preconcert and connivance not necessarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>inherent in the mere joint activity common to aiding and abetting.\u2019 \u201d <em>Zuniga v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va.App. 523, 527, 375 S.E.2d 381, 384 (1988) (quoting <em>United States v. Peterson, </em>524 F.2d 167,174 (4th Cir.1975)).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Williams does not dispute the fact that he agreed with Smith to steal the containers of metal from Old Dominion Metal. Rather, he seizes on the word \u201cpreconcert\u201d from our jurisprudence, and argues that there could have been no preconcert because Smith had already committed larceny before the two men entered into an agreement. Williams is correct in that Smith had already committed larceny prior to entering into the agreement. \u201cLarceny is the taking and carrying away of the goods and chattels of another with intent to deprive the owner of the possession thereof permanently.\u201d <em>Lund v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 688, 691, 232 S.E.2d 745, 748 (1977). \u201c \u2018[A]ny carrying away movement, however slight, even though it takes but a moment, is sufficient\u2019 \u201d to satisfy that element of the offense. <em>Bryant v. Commonwealth, </em>248 Va. 179, 183, 445 S.E.2d 667, 670 (1994) (quoting 3 C. Torcia, <em>Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 378 (14th ed.1980)). Thus, it is true that by taking the containers and carrying them out of the trailers, Smith committed larceny.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">Williams is incorrect, however, in concluding that Smith\u2019s prior larceny precluded him from conspiring to continue committing that same larceny. Larceny is a continuing offense. <em>Commonwealth v. Cousins, </em>29 Va. (2 Leigh) 708 (1830).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-7\">\u201c[Wjhere property has been feloniously taken, every act of removal or change of possession by the thief constitute^] a new taking and asportation; and, as the right of possession, as well as the right of property, continues in the owner, every such act is a new violation of the owner\u2019s right of property and possession.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-8\"><em>Dunlavey v. Commonwealth, </em>184 Va. 521, 527, 35 S.E.2d 763, 766 (1945) (quoting <em>Strouther v. Commonwealth, </em>92 Va. 789, 791, 22 S.E. 852, 791 (1895)). Thus, when Smith and Williams agreed to steal the metal, Smith was still committing larceny. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>Every new act of removal by Smith was a new taking and asportation of the containers. Williams agreed with Smith to steal metal from Old Dominion Metal. Because the crime was ongoing when Williams agreed to \u201cconspire, confederate or combine\u201d with Smith in completing its execution, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s refusal to strike the evidence of conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">For the reasons stated above, we hold that Detective Anthony sufficiently apprised Williams of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and that the evidence was sufficient to prove that Williams conspired with Smith to commit grand larceny. We therefore affirm the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b100-6\">. The Supreme Court of Virginia has approved of a <em>Miranda </em>warning similar to the warning given in this case. In <em>Poyner v. Commonwealth, </em>229 Va. 401, 329 S.E.2d 815 (1985), the Supreme Court held that the following warning was sufficient:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-7\">You have the right to remain silent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-8\">Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to have an attorney present before any questions. If you cannot afford an attorney, the Court is <em>empowered </em>to appoint one for you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-9\"><em>Poyner, </em>229 Va. at 404, 408, 329 S.E.2d at 820, 821 (emphasis added). However, the issue in that case was not whether the warning was sufficient to inform the defendant of his right to counsel if he is indigent. Rather, the Court only addressed whether the warning was \"so vague as to beg the question as to <em>when </em>the Court would appoint Poyner a lawyer....\" <em>Id. </em>at 408, 329 S.E.2d at 821 (emphasis added). Although the Court\u2019s approval of the warning, \"If you cannot afford an attorney, the Court is empowered to appoint one for you,\u201d is dicta, it does lend support to our approval of a warning that states, \"If you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>cannot afford an attorney, the Court will consider appointing an attorney for you.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
