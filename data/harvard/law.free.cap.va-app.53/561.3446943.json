Clanton contends the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions. A panel majority of this Court agreed and reversed the convictions. We granted a petition for rehearing <em>en banc </em>and stayed the mandate of the panel decision. Upon rehearing <em>en banc, </em>we affirm the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">On appeal, we review the evidence in the \u201clight most favorable\u201d to the Commonwealth. <em>Commonwealth v. Hudson, </em>265 Va. 505, 514, 578 S.E.2d 781, 786 (2003) (citation omitted). That principle requires us to \u201c \u2018discard the evidence of the accused in conflict with that of the Commonwealth, and regard as true all the credible evidence favorable to the Commonwealth and all fair inferences that may be drawn therefrom.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kelly v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 250, 254, 584 S.E.2d 444, 446 (2003) <em>(en banc) </em>(quoting <em>Watkins v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 335, 348, 494 S.E.2d 859, 866 (1998)). <em>See also Bolden v. Commonwealth, 275 </em>Va. 144, 147-48, 654 S.E.2d 584, 586 (2008); <em>Molina v. Commonwealth, 272 </em>Va. 666, 671, 636 S.E.2d 470, 473 (2006); <em>Viney v. Commonwealth, </em>269 Va. 296, 299, 609 S.E.2d 26, 28 (2005); <em>Walton v. Commonwealth, </em>255 Va. 422, 425-26, 497 S.E.2d 869, 871 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-9\">So viewed, the evidence proved Clanton was one of four armed intruders, three males and one female, who attempted to rob occupants of a home that Mike Mabry shared with his mother, his nephew, Debryant, and Debryant\u2019s infant daughter. On the morning of the attempted robbery, two of the intruders knocked on the door and asked Mike if they could use his telephone claiming their vehicle was inoperable. Mike <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>retrieved the telephone and handed it to the female who purported to make a telephone call. After Mike turned around to go into the kitchen, the male put a gun to the back of his head and told him to be quiet while two more males entered the home with guns. The intruder holding the gun to Mike\u2019s head in the kitchen ordered him to lie on the floor, hit Mike in the head with the gun, and bound Mike\u2019s mouth, legs, and hands with duct tape.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">While Mike remained bound by duct tape in the kitchen, the intruders ran throughout the house, with their guns drawn, demanding money. They kicked down the door to a bedroom in which Debryant, his infant daughter, and his girlfriend, Simone Lewis,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> were sleeping. Debryant was pulled out of bed, shoved on the floor, bound in duct tape, and held at gunpoint while the intruders demanded money from him.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">One intruder grabbed Simone, pulled her out of bed, shoved her down the hallway, and into another bedroom. The intruder who grabbed Simone continued to threaten her, hold her at gunpoint, and demand money. One intruder ordered Simone to turn over and then threw a blanket over Simone\u2019s head. Another bound Simone\u2019s hands and legs with duct tape.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">At some point during the attempted robbery, one of the intruders grabbed Debryant\u2019s infant daughter out of his bed, brought the infant into the room in which Simone was being held, and threw the infant on a bed, telling Simone to \u201cwatch her.\u201d According to Simone, one of the intruders told her Debryant repeatedly said his daughter was \u201cin here\u201d before the infant was taken from Debryant\u2019s bed. Debryant did not ask or give permission to the intruders to take his daughter from him.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">After approximately thirty minutes, Mike managed to break free from the duct tape and run next door to his cousin\u2019s house and then outside to the road in front of his house to seek help. By that time, the intruders were outside in his front yard and one of them fired two gunshots at Mike without hitting him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>before all four jumped into a vehicle fleeing the scene. Mike went back into his home, found Debryant and Simone, removed the duct tape from them, and called the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">The trial court convicted Clanton of abduction of the infant and use of a firearm in the commission of the abduction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">When considering a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence on appeal, a reviewing court does not \u201cask itself whether <em>it </em>believes that the evidence at the trial established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 318-19, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979) (emphasis in original; citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Instead, we ask only \u201c \u2018whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Maxwell v. Commonwealth, </em>275 Va. 437, 442, 657 S.E.2d 499, 502 (2008) (quoting <em>Jackson, </em>443 U.S. at 319, 99 S.Ct. at 2789) (emphasis in original). <em>See also McMillan v. Commonwealth, </em>277 Va. 11, 19, 671 S.E.2d 396, 400 (2009); <em>Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>277 Va. 171, 182, 670 S.E.2d 727, 734 (2009). These principles recognize that an appellate court is \u201cnot permitted to reweigh the evidence,\u201d <em>Nusbaum v. Berlin, </em>273 Va. 385, 408, 641 S.E.2d 494, 507 (2007), because appellate courts have no authority \u201cto preside <em>de novo </em>over a second trial,\u201d <em>Haskins v. Commonwealth, </em>44 Va.App. 1, 11, 602 S.E.2d 402, 407 (2004). This deferential standard of review \u201capplies not only to the historical facts themselves, but the inferences from those facts as well.\u201d <em>Crowder v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 658, 663 n. 2, 588 S.E.2d 384, 387 n. 2 (2003). Thus, a fact finder may \u201cdraw reasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts,\u201d <em>Haskins, </em>44 Va.App. at 10, 602 S.E.2d at 406 (citations omitted), unless doing so would push \u201cinto the realm of <em>non </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number><em>sequitur,\u201d Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>48 Va.App. 605, 608, 633 S.E.2d 229, 231 (2006) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">A. Abduction Conviction</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">Clanton argues the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction for abduction because (1) the infant was taken for her own protection, not with a wrongful intent, and (2) there was no evidence the infant was taken by force, intimidation or deceit.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">The trial court found Clanton guilty of abduction in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-47, which provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-8\">A. Any person, who, by force, intimidation or deception, and without legal justification or excuse, seizes, takes, transports, detains or secretes the person of another, with the intent to deprive such other person of his personal liberty or to withhold or conceal him from any person, authority or institution lawfully entitled to his charge, shall be deemed guilty of \u201cabduction\u201d____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">\u201cThis codification wholly \u2018supercedes the common law' and effectively combines the common law offenses of kidnapping, abduction, and false imprisonment \u2018into one statutory felony.\u2019 \u201d <em>Walker v. Commonwealth, </em>47 Va.App. 114, 120, 622 S.E.2d 282, 285 (2005) (quoting John L. Costello, <em>Virginia Criminal Law &amp; Procedure </em>\u00a7 7.1, at 119-20 (3d ed.2002)), <em>aff'd, </em>272 Va. 511, 636 S.E.2d 476 (2006). A conviction under the abduction statute \u201crequires only a showing of \u2018physical detention of a person, with the intent to deprive him of his personal liberty, by force, intimidation, or deception,\u2019 without more.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Scott v. Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 519, 526, 323 S.E.2d 572, 576 (1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-10\">1. Wrongful Intent</p>\n<p id=\"b609-11\">Clanton argues the Commonwealth failed to prove abduction because \u201cthe movement of the child was at the request of the parents and for the child\u2019s own protection rather than for a wrongful purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>The Commonwealth was required to prove the infant was seized or taken \u201cwith the intent to deprive [her] of [her] personal liberty or to withhold or conceal [her] from any person, authority or institution lawfully entitled to [her] charge.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-47. Although Clanton argues the infant was not taken with a wrongful intent, the trial court found the evidence proved \u201ca seizure or asportation with intent to deprive [such] other person of personal liberty or to withhold him from any person lawfully entitled to his charge.\u201d Since the infant was in fact taken from Debryant, her father and the person lawfully entitled to her charge, it was certainly reasonable for the trial court to conclude Clanton intended to do precisely what he did\u2014withhold the infant from the person lawfully entitled to her charge.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Walker, </em>47 Va.App. at 121, 622 S.E.2d at 286 (fact finder could infer defendant intended to detain victim because that is exactly what defendant did); <em>see also Scott, </em>228 Va. at 524, 323 S.E.2d at 575 (evidence of intent sufficient for conviction of abduction where defendant intended to make victim sit on the couch long enough for her to watch him Mil himself); <em>Joyce v. Commonwealth, </em>210 Va. 272, 170 S.E.2d 9 (1969) (depriving occupants of a house of personal liberty, at gunpoint, to detain them satisfied intent requirement of abduction statute).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Clanton intended the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>natural and probable consequences of his acts. <em>Velasquez v. Commonwealth, </em>276 Va. 326, 330, 661 S.E.2d 454, 456 (2008); <em>Schmitt v. Commonwealth, </em>262 Va. 127, 145, 547 S.E.2d 186, 198 (2001). The question of whether Clanton possessed this intent rested with the trial court, as the finder of fact, <em>Nobles v. Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 548, 551, 238 S.E.2d 808, 810 (1977), and we find there was credible evidence to support the trial court\u2019s finding in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Clanton contends there was no wrongful intent because the infant was moved to a safer environment<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> at the request of her parents. The record is clear, though, that Debryant, the child\u2019s father, did not ask the assailants to take his daughter away and did not give the assailants permission to do so. We decline Clanton\u2019s invitation to find an \u201cimplicit\u201d request to move his daughter away from him since we are bound by our standard of review, which requires us to view the evidence in the \u201clight most favorable\u201d to the Commonwealth, <em>Hudson, </em>265 Va. at 514, 578 S.E.2d at 786.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> To the extent an inference can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>be made from Debryant\u2019s statement that his daughter was \u201cin here,\u201d the more reasonable one is that he wanted the intruders to leave, not take his daughter away so they could continue unhindered with their attempted robbery of him.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Even if we accepted Clanton\u2019s argument that the infant was moved to a safer environment, the fact remains that the infant was moved for the purpose of facilitating the accomplishment of the ongoing armed robbery. Although Clanton acknowledges the evidence permitted conflicting inferences regarding his intent, he points out that the trial court made no express finding that the purpose of taking the infant was to facilitate the robbery rather than safeguard the infant. But</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-T\">when \u201cfaced with a record of historical facts that supports conflicting inferences\u201d a court reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence \u201cmust presume\u2014even if it does not affirmatively appear in the record\u2014that the trier of fact resolved any such conflicts in favor of the prosecution, and must defer to that resolution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-6\"><em>Harper v. Commonwealth, </em>49 Va.App. 517, 523, 642 S.E.2d 779, 782 (2007) (quoting <em>Jackson, </em>443 U.S. at 326, 99 S.Ct. at 2793). Accordingly, to the extent the evidence permitted conflicting inferences regarding the assail\u00e1nts\u2019 intent in taking the infant, we must presume the trial court resolved any such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>conflict in favor of the Commonwealth and found the intent was to facilitate the ongoing robbery.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Any other conclusion would ignore the fact that had the assailants been concerned about the well-being of the infant, they could have aborted the robbery attempt and left the premises thereby eliminating the danger to the infant.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">The Supreme Court of Virginia has held that \u201cabducting a person as a means of gaining access to the scene or otherwise facilitating the commission of an intended robbery ... violates the [statute proscribing abduction for pecuniary benefit].\u201d <em>Barnes v. Commonwealth, </em>234 Va. 130, 137, 360 S.E.2d 196, 201 (1987).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus, regardless of whether the infant was moved to a safer environment, she was taken away from her father, the person lawfully entitled to her charge, in order to facilitate the commission of the attempted robbery of him, in violation of the abduction statute.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>\u201cIn the end, [Clanton\u2019s argument] is little more than an invitation for us to interpret the inferences differently than the factfinder, to find all exculpatory inferences reasonable and all inculpatory inferences unreasonable____\u201d <em>Haskins, </em>44 Va.App. at 11, 602 S.E.2d at 407. It must be kept in mind that \u201cthe reasonable-hypothesis principle is not a discrete rule unto itself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8, 602 S.E.2d at 405. \u201c \u2018The statement that circumstantial evidence must exclude every reasonable theory of innocence is simply another way of stating that the Commonwealth has the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019\u201d <em>Kelly, </em>41 Va.App. at 258, 584 S.E.2d at 447-48 (quoting <em>Hudson, </em>265 Va. at 513, 578 S.E.2d at 785). This principle \u201cdoes not add to the burden of proof placed upon the Commonwealth in a criminal case,\u201d <em>id., </em>but merely \u201creiterates the standard applicable to every criminal case.\u201d <em>Pease v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 342, 360, 573 S.E.2d 272, 280 (2002) <em>(en </em>banc) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted), aff<em>'d, </em>266 Va. 397, 588 S.E.2d 149 (2003) <em>(per curiam </em>order adopting reasoning of the Court of Appeals).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">\u201cWhether the hypothesis of innocence is reasonable is itself a \u2018question of fact,\u2019 <em>Emerson v. Commonwealth, </em>43 Va.App. 263, 277, 597 S.E.2d 242, 249 (2004) (citation omitted), subject to deferential appellate review, <em>Kelly, </em>41 Va.App. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>259, 584 S.E.2d at 448.\u201d <em>Haskins, </em>44 Va.App. at 9, 602 S.E.2d at 406. \u201cMerely because defendant\u2019s theory of the case differs from that taken by the Commonwealth does not mean that every reasonable hypothesis consistent with his innocence has not been excluded.\u201d <em>Miles v. Commonwealth, </em>205 Va. 462, 467, 138 S.E.2d 22, 27 (1964). \u201cBy finding the defendant guilty, therefore, the factfinder \u2018has found by a process of elimination that the evidence does not contain a reasonable theory of innocence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Haskins, </em>44 Va.App. at 9, 602 S.E.2d at 406 (quoting <em>United States v. Kemble, </em>197 F.2d 316, 320 (3d Cir.1952)).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">While the dissent is correct that when the evidence is susceptible of two interpretations, the fact finder cannot <em>arbitrarily </em>adopt the one that incriminates the defendant, <em>Corbett v. Commonwealth, </em>210 Va. 304, 307, 171 S.E.2d 251, 253 (1969), the fact finder\u2019s \u201cdetermination cannot be overturned as <em>arbitrary </em>unless no rational factfinder would have come to that conclusion.\u201d <em>Haskins, </em>44 Va.App. at 9, 602 S.E.2d at 406 (emphasis added). The evidence permitted conflicting inferences, including the inference that the assailants took the infant from her father solely at his request and not to facilitate the robbery. The trial court rejected this hypothesis as unreasonable, and we cannot conclude the fact finder arbitrarily chose one theory over another or that \u201cno rational fact finder would have come to that conclusion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">2. Force, Intimidation or Deceit</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">Clanton argues the Commonwealth failed to prove abduction because there was no evidence the infant was subjected to force, intimidation or deceit or that the infant comprehended the use of any such force, intimidation or deceit.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">The abduction statute, by its plain language, does not require that force, intimidation or deceit be directed at the person being seized or taken or that the person being seized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>or taken be aware of such conduct and resist it. Indeed, by prohibiting the use of force to withhold a person from another person entitled to his charge, the statute clearly envisions the situation in which a child or some other person incapable of resistance is taken or withheld from another. As the Maryland Court of Special Appeals stated in response to an argument that an infant was not forcibly taken,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-5\">[i]f we were to follow appellant\u2019s reasoning to its logical end, children, incompetents, physically handicapped and the unconscious would not be protected by the statute if they did not resist in any manner or smiled as they were taken from their beds. It would ill serve the law to exclude as kidnappers those who prey on persons who cannot resist.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-6\"><em>Stancil v. State, </em>78 Md.App. 376, 553 A.2d 268, 273 (1989) (where three-week-old infant, incapable of resistance, was carried out of a hospital without any assaultive conduct exhibited toward the infant, state presented sufficient evidence of force). Likewise, we decline to limit the application of the abduction statute to the taking or seizure of only those persons who can comprehend such conduct and resist the taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">Abduction \u201cmay be accomplished by a minimal amount of force and each case will depend upon the particular facts of the taking.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 272 (citation omitted). Debryant\u2019s daughter was taken from his bed when four intruders stormed the house, demanded money, bound Debryant by duct tape and held him at gunpoint. We find these facts support the conclusion that the infant was taken by force, intimidation or deceit within the meaning of the abduction statute.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>See Wilson v. Commonwealth, </em>249 Va. 95, 103, 452 S.E.2d 669, 675 (1995) (defendant\u2019s initial act of forcing his female victims upstairs at gunpoint satisfied elements of abduction statute); <em>Walker, </em>47 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>Va.App. at 121, 622 S.E.2d at 285 (defendant used force and intimidation within the meaning of the abduction statute by-pointing a gun at victim and manhandling him into a truck); <em>Simms v. Commonwealth, 2 </em>Va.App. 614, 618, 346 S.E.2d 734, 736 (1986) (where defendant grabbed a female victim, held a gun to her head, and threatened to shoot her, \u201cabduction was established as a fact once the Commonwealth proved that [defendant] had deprived the victim of her liberty by threats of violence and use of force\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">B. Firearm Conviction</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">Clanton also contends the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction for use of a firearm in the commission of the abduction because there was no evidence a firearm was actually used or that the infant comprehended the use of any such firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">The trial court found Clanton guilty of violating Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1, which makes it \u201cunlawful for any person to use or attempt to use any pistol, shotgun, rifle, or other firearm or display such weapon in a threatening manner while committing or attempting to commit ... abduction.\u201d The record clearly supports the trial court\u2019s conclusion that a firearm was used in the abduction of the infant since Debryant was threatened and held at gunpoint as his daughter was taken away from him. We find Clanton\u2019s argument regarding the infant\u2019s comprehension of the use of the firearm without merit for the same reason we find his argument regarding the infant\u2019s comprehension of the use of force without merit. Like the abduction statute, Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1, by its plain language, prohibits certain conduct (use of or attempt to use a firearm in the commission of a felony) without regard to the awareness of the victim. And we refuse to restrict application of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 only to situations in which the victim is aware of or able to comprehend the use of a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">III.

Where the circumstantial evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, \u201c \u2018is equally susceptible of two interpretations one of which is consistent with the innocence of the accused, [the trier of fact] cannot arbitrarily adopt that interpretation which incriminates him.\u2019 \u201d <em>Corbett v.

Not only must the evidence be <em>consistent </em>with a finding that the accused acted with the intent required to support the charged crime; it must also exclude every reasonable hypothesis that the accused may have acted <em>only </em>with a <em>different, </em>non-culpable intent. <em>Webb v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number><em>Commonwealth, </em>204 Va. 24, 34, 129 S.E.2d 22, 29 (1963). When it is equally plausible that a \u201creasonable hypothesis of innocence\u201d explains the accused\u2019s conduct, evidence cannot be said to rise to the level of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, <em>Haywood v.

This evidence indicates that Clanton and his companions did not move the infant from Debryant Mabry\u2019s bedroom immediately after entering it, when they moved Simone Lewis. Instead, the infant was moved to the room to which Simone had been taken only <em>after </em>Debryant had repeatedly said his daughter was \u201cin here,\u201d in the bedroom where they were holding Debryant at gunpoint. Further, the robbers could reasonably have believed that by taking the infant to Simone, they were simply moving her from her father\u2019s presence to her mother\u2019s, based on her father\u2019s request.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Thus, although the evidence does not <em>compel </em>a finding that Clanton and his companions moved the infant at Debryant\u2019s request, one of several reasonable inferences flowing from the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, is that the robbers did, in fact, move the infant solely as a result of Debryant\u2019s repeated references to the child\u2019s presence in the room rather than solely as a result of any intent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>facilitate the robbery, or as a result of some combination of culpable and non-culpable intents.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">Whether <em>Debryant intended </em>his statements to cause the robbers to move the infant to another room or to cease the attack is not dispositive of the issue of <em>what Clanton and his companions intended. </em>Whether moving the infant to another room served to protect her also is not dispositive. The burden was on the Commonwealth to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Clanton acted with the intent to abduct the infant and not upon Clanton to prove he acted virtuously or with any other non-criminal intent. What I conclude <em>is </em>dispositive is that the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, supported at least one reasonable hypothesis that was consistent with Clanton\u2019s innocence. Because I believe the trier of fact erred in arbitrarily rejecting that reasonable hypothesis of innocence, I would reverse and dismiss Clanton\u2019s conviction for abduction. Thus, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b619-6\">. Although the record indicates Simone was not the infant's mother, no evidence in the record provides any indication that Clanton or any of his companions knew this. <em>Robinson v.

However, this does not negate the fact that another reasonable hypothesis flowing from the evidence is that Clanton acted with a single, non-culpable intent.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
