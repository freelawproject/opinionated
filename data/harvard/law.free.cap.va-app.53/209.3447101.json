On appeal, father claims the trial court erred in utilizing Code \u00a7 20-146.33(A) as the statutory basis for awarding mother attorney\u2019s fees. Alternatively, father claims the trial court erred in denying him the opportunity to present evidence to show that the award of attorney\u2019s fees was inappropriate. Additionally, both parties request an award of appellate attorney\u2019s fees and costs. For <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>the following reasons, we reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment, remand for further proceedings, and deny the parties\u2019 requests for appellate attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">The parties were divorced by final decree of divorce entered by the trial court on June 1, 1999. Pursuant to that decree, mother was awarded sole legal custody and primary physical custody of the parties\u2019 two minor children (children), and father was granted limited supervised visitation. Over the next several years, the trial court heard and resolved numerous post-divorce motions filed by the parties pertaining to visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">In August 2005, mother and children moved to Arizona, where they continue to reside. Although father initially sought to enjoin the relocation, in September 2005, the trial court entered a consent order reflecting the parties\u2019 agreement that mother and children were permitted to relocate to Arizona and setting forth the agreed upon schedule of visitation in Arizona and Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">On September 13, 2007, mother filed a motion to change jurisdiction, asking the trial court to relinquish its jurisdiction, under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA), Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-146.1 to 20-146.38, so that future custody and visitation determinations could be made by an Arizona court. In connection with that motion, mother requested an award of her attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">Thereafter, in a letter opinion dated November 30, 2007,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the trial court found Virginia to be \u201can inconvenient forum\u201d and Arizona \u201ca more appropriate forum.\u201d Accordingly, the trial court declined to exercise its jurisdiction in the case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-146.18(A).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court\u2019s opinion, however, did not address mother\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Hence, the case was again before the trial court on January 2, 2008, for resolution of mother\u2019s outstanding request for attorney\u2019s fees and costs, and for entry of an order consistent with the rulings in the November 30, 2007 letter opinion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After submitting an affidavit of the attorney\u2019s fees she incurred in connection with her motion to change jurisdiction, mother argued she was entitled to an award of such fees under Code \u00a7 20-146.33(A)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> because she prevailed on her motion under Code \u00a7 20-146.18 and because the requested attorney\u2019s fees were not \u201cclearly inappropriate.\u201d Alternatively, mother argued that, in light of her inferior economic position in comparison to father\u2019s, the court could also award her attorney\u2019s fees and costs under Code \u00a7\u00a7 20\u201479(b) and 20-99(5).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">In response, father argued that Code \u00a7 20-146.33(A) applied only to proceedings under the UCCJEA to enforce child custody determinations and, thus, could not be used to award attorney\u2019s fees to mother in connection with her motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>change jurisdiction under Code \u00a7 20-146.18. Father further argued that, if the trial court determined that Code \u00a7 20-146.33(A) was applicable, he would put on evidence to show that the requested attorney\u2019s fees and costs were \u201cclearly inappropriate.\u201d Lastly, father argued that, despite his greater income, mother\u2019s \u201csubstantial resources\u201d rendered any disparity in the parties\u2019 relative economic positions insignificant.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">Applying Code \u00a7 20-146.33(A), the trial court found there was \u201cinsufficient evidence to show that an award of attorney\u2019s fees would be clearly inappropriate\u201d and granted mother\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees. The trial court then entered an order reflecting the rulings in the November 30, 2007 letter opinion and awarding mother attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of $9,595.80.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">This appeal by father followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">II. ATTORNEY\u2019S FEES AT THE TRIAL LEVEL</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">In this appeal, we are asked to review the propriety of the trial court\u2019s determination that mother, having prevailed on her motion to change jurisdiction under Code \u00a7 20-146.18, was entitled to an award of attorney\u2019s fees under Code \u00a7 20-146.33(A). Father contends, as he did below, that Code \u00a7 20-146.33(A) is inapplicable to mother\u2019s motion to change jurisdiction under Code \u00a7 20-146.18.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Mother contends the trial court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees under Code \u00a7 20-146.33(A) was proper. Alternatively, she argues that, if we conclude Code \u00a7 20-146.33(A) is not applicable in this case, we should affirm her award of attorney\u2019s fees under Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-79(b) and 20-99(5) or, at the very least, remand the matter to the trial court for consideration of her request for attorney\u2019s fees under those statutes. We agree with father that the trial court improperly utilized Code \u00a7 20-146.33(A) to award mother attorney\u2019s fees in connection with her Code \u00a7 20-146.18 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>motion, and we agree with mother that the case should be remanded to the trial court for consideration of her request for attorney\u2019s fees under Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-79(b) and 20-99(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">\u201cWhether to award attorney\u2019s fees \u2018is a matter submitted to the sound discretion of the trial court and is renewable on appeal only for an abuse of discretion.\u2019\u201d <em>Kane v. Szymczak, </em>41 Va.App. 365, 375, 585 S.E.2d 349, 354 (2003) (quoting <em>Northcutt v. Northcutt, </em>39 Va.App. 192, 199-200, 571 S.E.2d 912, 916 (2002)). However, \u201ca trial court \u2018by definition abuses its discretion when it makes an error of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Shooltz v. Shooltz, </em>27 Va.App. 264, 271, 498 S.E.2d 437, 441 (1998) (quoting <em>Room, v. United States, </em>518 U.S. 81, 100, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 2047, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996)). \u201cIn determining whether the trial court made an error of law, we review the trial court\u2019s statutory interpretations and legal conclusions <em>de novo.\u201d Rollins v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 73, 79, 554 S.E.2d 99, 102 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">The initial question before us is whether Code \u00a7 20-146.33(A) permits an award of attorney\u2019s fees to a party who prevails under Code \u00a7 20-146.18. To answer that question, we must first determine to what \u201cproceedings\u201d Code \u00a7 20-146.33(A) applies. Mother argues the statute applies to all proceedings under the UCCJEA; father argues it applies only to those proceedings under the UCCJEA that involve the enforcement of child custody determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">On its face, Code \u00a7 20-146.33(A) does not expressly limit its application to any particular proceedings. Indeed, it merely provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[t]he court shall award the prevailing party ... necessary and reasonable expenses incurred by or on behalf of the party, including costs [and] ... attorney\u2019s fees ... during the course of <em>the proceedings, </em>unless the party from whom fees or expenses are sought establishes that the award would be clearly inappropriate.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-146.33(A) (emphasis added). The statute neither defines the term \u201cproceedings\u201d nor otherwise indicates the extent of the statute\u2019s application. Accordingly, we conclude that the term \u201cproceedings\u201d is ambiguous, <em>see Gillespie v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number><em>Commonwealth, </em>272 Va. 753, 758, 636 S.E.2d 430, 432 (2006) (\u201cLanguage is ambiguous if it admits of being understood in more than one way, refers to two or more things simultaneously, is difficult to comprehend, is of doubtful import, or lacks clearness and definiteness.\u201d), and thus resort to the rules of statutory interpretation to determine its intended meaning, <em>see Va. Dep\u2019t of Labor &amp; Indus. v. Westmoreland Coal Co., </em>233 Va. 97, 101-02, 353 S.E.2d 758, 762 (1987) (\u201cBecause the section is ambiguous, we ... must resort to extrinsic evidence and the rules of construction to determine legislative intent. ...\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">In interpreting a statute, we endeavor \u201c\u2018to search out and follow the true intent of the legislature, and to adopt that sense of the words which harmonizes best with the context, and promotes in the fullest manner the apparent policy and objects of the legislature.\u2019 \u201d <em>Colbert v. Commonwealth, </em>47 Va.App. 390, 394, 624 S.E.2d 108, 110 (2006) (quoting <em>Jones v. Rhea, </em>130 Va. 345, 372, 107 S.E. 814, 823 (1921)). \u201c \u2018Statutes which have the same general or common purpose or are parts of the same general plan are ... ordinarily considered as in pari materia.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lucy v. County of Albemarle, </em>258 Va. 118, 129, 516 S.E.2d 480, 485 (1999) (emphasis omitted) (quoting <em>Prillaman v. Commonwealth, </em>199 Va. 401, 405,100 S.E.2d 4, 7 (1957)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-6\">Under the rule of statutory construction of statutes in pari materia, statutes are not to be considered as isolated fragments of law____ [Tjhey should be so construed as to harmonize the general tenor or purport of the system and make the scheme consistent in all its parts and uniform in its operation, unless a different purpose is shown plainly or with irresistible clearness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-8\"><em>Alston v. Commonwealth, </em>274 Va. 759, 769, 652 S.E.2d 456, 462 (2007) (quoting <em>Prillaman, </em>199 Va. at 405, 100 S.E.2d at 7). Moreover,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-9\">[t]he rules of statutory interpretation argue against reading any legislative enactment in a manner that will make a portion of it useless, repetitious, or absurd. On the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>trary, it is well established that every act of the legislature should be read so as to give reasonable effect to every word and to promote the ability of the enactment to remedy the mischief at which it is directed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-5\"><em>Jones v. Conwell, </em>227 Va. 176, 181, 314 S.E.2d 61, 64 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Mindful of these principles, we note that Code \u00a7 20-146.33(A) is not the only statute in the UCCJEA that permits a court to award attorney\u2019s fees and other costs to a prevailing party. Code \u00a7 20-146.19(C) provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-7\">If a court dismisses a petition or stays a proceeding because it declines to exercise its jurisdiction [on the ground that the person seeking to invoke its jurisdiction has engaged in unjustifiable conduct, the court] shall assess against the party seeking to invoke its jurisdiction necessary and reasonable expenses including costs [and] ... attorney\u2019s fees ... during the course of the proceedings, unless the party from whom fees are sought establishes that the assessment would be clearly inappropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">Plainly, if Code \u00a7 20-146.33(A) applies to all proceedings under the UCCJEA, as mother asserts, a separate statute would not be needed to address the award of attorney\u2019s fees under the circumstances described in Code \u00a7 20-146.19(C). Indeed, to adopt mother\u2019s position that Code \u00a7 20-146.33(A) applies to all proceedings under the UCCJEA would render the provisions of Code \u00a7 20-146.19(0 superfluous.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">Accordingly, we reject that position. <em>See Yamaha Motor Corp. v. Quillian, </em>264 Va. 656, 667, 571 S.E.2d 122, 127-28 (2002) (rejecting an asserted interpretation that would render the provisions of a part of the statute superfluous); <em>Shaw v. Commonwealth, </em>9 Va.App. 331, 334, 387 S.E.2d 792, 794 (1990) (\u201cWe will not construe legislative action in a manner that would ascribe to the General Assembly a futile gesture.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-10\">The question remains, however, whether Code \u00a7 20-146.33(A) applies solely to enforcement-related proceedings, as father asserts. We hold that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>While a statute\u2019s placement in a particular part of the Code may generally not be considered when the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous, <em>HCA Health Servs. of Virginia, Inc. v. Levin, </em>260 Va. 215, 220-21, 530 S.E.2d 417, 420 (2000), such a factor may be taken into account when the intended meaning of the language is not otherwise clear, <em>see Lewis v. House, </em>232 Va. 28, 31, 348 S.E.2d 217, 219 (1986) (construing a word\u2019s intended meaning based on its placement in a particular section of the Code); <em>cf. Shivaee v. Commonwealth, </em>270 Va. 112, 125, 613 S.E.2d 570, 577 (2005) (determining that the Sexually Violent Predators Act \u201cwas codified by the General Assembly as a civil statute, as indicated by its placement in Title 37\u201d). Here, Code \u00a7 20-146.33(A) is in Article <em>3 of </em>the UCCJEA, and Code \u00a7 20-146.18, the statute implicated by mother\u2019s motion for change of jurisdiction, is in Article 2. The UCCJEA comprises four articles. Article 1 sets forth definitions and other general provisions. Article 2 defines the circumstances in which the trial court may exercise jurisdiction concerning child custody determinations. Article 3 establishes the procedures for the enforcement of child custody determinations. Article 4 consists of miscellaneous provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Specifically, Article 3 is entitled \u201cEnforcement\u201d and requires the courts of this Commonwealth to \u201crecognize and enforce\u201d appropriate child custody determinations of the courts of other states, Code <em>\u00a7\u00a7 </em>20-146.24(A) and 20-146.27(B), and to order, \u201cupon a finding that a petitioner is entitled to immediate physical custody of the child,\u201d that \u201cthe petitioner may take immediate physical custody of the child,\u201d Code \u00a7 20-146.31(A). Article 3 also addresses the mechanisms by which child custody determinations may be enforced, as well as other aspects of enforcement proceedings under the UCCJEA. <em>See, e.g., </em>Code \u00a7 20-146.23 (permitting Virginia courts to \u201cenforce an order for the return of the child made under the Hague Convention\u201d); Code \u00a7 20-146.24(B) (permitting Virginia courts to \u201cutilize any remedy available under other law of this Commonwealth to enforce a child custody determination made by a court of another state\u201d); Code \u00a7 20-146.25 (permitting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>Virginia courts to \u201cissue a temporary order\u201d enforcing the visitation provisions of a child custody determination of another state); Code \u00a7 20-146.27(A) (permitting Virginia courts to \u201cgrant any relief normally available under the law of this Commonwealth to enforce a registered child custody determination made by a court of another state\u201d); Code \u00a7 20-146.32 (permitting Virginia courts, upon a finding \u201cthat the child is imminently likely to suffer serious physical harm or be removed from this Commonwealth,\u201d to \u201cissue an ex parte order to take immediate physical custody of the child\u201d). In addition, the definitions set forth at the beginning of Article 3 characterize the parties implicating its mechanisms as parties seeking enforcement remedies or defending against those remedies. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 20-146.22 (\u201c\u2018Petitioner\u2019 means a person who seeks ... enforcement of a child custody determination. \u2018Respondent\u2019 means a person against whom a proceeding has been commenced for ... enforcement of a child custody determination.\u201d). Thus, Article 3 applies when a party\u2019s allegedly bad conduct compels another party to invoke the jurisdiction of a Virginia court to enforce a child custody determination or to protect the child from imminent harm or removal from Virginia. Such a focus on bad conduct befits the prevailing-party standard used in Code \u00a7 20-146.33(A). We conclude, therefore, that, by placing Code \u00a7 20-146.33(A) in Article 3 and using a prevailing-party standard rather than one based on equitable determinations, the legislature intended to confine Code \u00a7 20-146.33(A)\u2019s application to the enforcement-related proceedings set forth in Article 3 of the UCCJEA.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">This conclusion is buttressed by Code \u00a7 20-146.19(C)\u2019s similar focus, in authorizing an award of attorney\u2019s fees to the prevailing party, on the improper conduct of a party. As previously discussed, that statute, which is in Article 2 of the UCCJEA, provides that, when the trial court declines to exercise its jurisdiction due to a party\u2019s unjustifiable conduct in attempting to obtain that jurisdiction, the other party is presumptively entitled to an award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs. Code \u00a7 20-146.19(0. Thus, like Code \u00a7 20-146.33(A), Code \u00a7 20-146.19(0 is intended to compensate the prevailing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>party for the fees and costs incurred as a result of the other party\u2019s bad conduct, albeit with regard to the matter of jurisdiction rather than enforcement of child custody determinations. Given that Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-146.33(A) and 20-146.19(C) are the only statutes in the UCCJEA that provide for a presumptive entitlement to attorney\u2019s fees, it is clear that the legislature did not intend to require an award of attorney\u2019s fees in non-enforcement and non-Code \u00a7 20-146.19 proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">In the instant case, mother sought only a change of jurisdiction pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-146.18, which is located in Article 2 of the UCCJEA. Neither party sought to enforce a child custody determination or challenge the other party\u2019s allegedly improper invocation of jurisdiction. Code \u00a7 20-146.18 permits a trial court to decline to exercise its jurisdiction \u201cif it determines that it is an inconvenient forum under the circumstances and that a court of another state is a more appropriate forum.\u201d Unlike Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-146.33(A) and 20-146.19(0, Code \u00a7 20-146.18 does not contemplate a circumstance where a party\u2019s conduct forces another party to pursue enforcement of a child custody determination or where a party is forced to defend against a party who has invoked the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction by unjustifiable conduct. Rather, Code \u00a7 20-146.18 merely allows a court, \u201cupon the motion of a party, the court\u2019s own motion, or request of another court,\u201d to decline to exercise its jurisdiction if it finds another state\u2019s court is a more convenient forum. To make that determination, the court must neutrally consider and weigh all factors relevant to assessing which court is in the better position to make future custody determinations. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 20-146.18(B). If the trial court declines to exercise its jurisdiction, the statute does not expressly authorize an award of attorney\u2019s fees to the prevailing party. In fact, the statute makes no mention of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">\u201cWe may not by interpretation, \u2018add to a statute language which the legislature has chosen not to include.\u2019 \u201d <em>Chauncey F. Hutter, Inc. v. Virginia Employment Comm\u2019n, </em>50 Va.App. 590, 598, 652 S.E.2d 151, 155 (2007) (quoting <em>County of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number><em>Amherst Bd. of Supervisors v. Brockman, </em>224 Va. 391, 397, 297 S.E.2d 805, 808 (1982)). Accordingly, we conclude that the authority provided by Code \u00a7 20-146.33(A) to award attorney\u2019s fees to the prevailing party is inapplicable to mother\u2019s motion to change jurisdiction under Code \u00a7 20-146.18.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Consequently, the trial court erred in applying Code \u00a7 20-146.33(A) in this case to award attorney\u2019s fees to mother.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Having determined that Code \u00a7 20-146.33(A) constituted an erroneous statutory basis for the trial court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees to mother, we turn to mother\u2019s claim that we should apply Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-79(b) and 20-99(5) to affirm the same award.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Essentially, mother is asking us to conclude that, in awarding mother attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of $9,595.80, the trial court reached the right result, albeit for the wrong reason. <em>See Harris v.

Ingram, </em>217 Va. 27, 29, 225 S.E.2d 362, 364 (1976); <em>Verrocchio v. Verrocchio, </em>16 Va.App. 314, 322, 429 S.E.2d 482, 487 (1993); <em>Kaufman v. Kaufman, </em>7 Va.App. 488, 500, 375 S.E.2d 374, 380 (1988); <em>D\u2019Auria v. D\u2019Auria, </em>1 Va.App. 455, 461, 340 S.E.2d 164, 167 (1986). This discretionary authority also extends to related post-divorce proceedings, <em>see Gibson v. Gibson, </em>5 Va.App. 426, 435, 364 S.E.2d 518, 523 (1988) (citing <em>D\u2019Auria </em>in affirming the trial judge\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs in connection with a post-divorce award of spousal support), including those involving child custody-related determinations, <em>see Kane, </em>41 Va.App. at 375-76, 585 S.E.2d at 354-55 (citing <em>Verrocchio </em>in affirming the trial judge\u2019s denial of attorney\u2019s fees and award of other costs in a post-divorce child custody proceeding).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">Because a court\u2019s decision under Code \u00a7 20-146.18 whether to decline to exercise its jurisdiction necessarily concerns child custody matters, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 20-146.18(A) (providing that a Virginia court with jurisdiction \u201cto make a <em>child custody determination </em>may decline to exercise its jurisdiction ... if it determines that it is an inconvenient forum under the circumstances and that a court of another state is a more appropriate forum\u201d (emphasis added)), we hold that the discretionary authority to award attorney\u2019s fees and costs pursuant to Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-79(b) and 20-99(5) extends to proceedings under Code \u00a7 20-146.18. Thus, the trial court had the authority in this case to award mother attorney\u2019s fees under Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-79(b) and 20-99(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">However, we may not employ the \u201cright result, wrong reason\u201d rule to affirm the judgment of the trial court \u201c \u2018where, because the trial court has ... confined its decision to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>specific ground, further factual resolution is needed before the right reason may be assigned to support the trial court\u2019s decision.\u2019 \u201d <em>Harris, </em>39 Va.App. at 676, 576 S.E.2d at 231 (quoting <em>Driscoll, </em>14 Va.App. at 452, 417 S.E.2d at 313).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">In this case, the trial court based its decision to award attorney\u2019s fees solely on Code \u00a7 20-146.33(A). Under that statute, \u201c[t]he court shall award the prevailing party ... necessary and reasonable expenses incurred by or on behalf of the party, including costs [and] ... attorney\u2019s fees ..., unless the party from whom fees or expenses are sought establishes that the award would be clearly inappropriate.\u201d Thus, as previously mentioned, the prevailing party has a presumptive right to fees. Hence, in determining whether to award mother the reasonable and necessary attorney\u2019s fees she incurred in connection with her motion to change custody, the trial court merely had to, and did, find that there was no showing that an award of such fees was clearly inappropriate. Indeed, the court made no other express findings in connection with mother\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">In contrast, there is no prevailing-party entitlement to fees under Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-79(b) and 20-99(5). Instead, the trial court, in the exercise of its discretion, may award attorney\u2019s fees and costs to \u201ceither party as equity and justice may require.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-99(5); <em>see Taylor v. Taylor, </em>27 Va.App. 209, 217, 497 S.E.2d 916, 919 (1998) (\u201cThe trial court has discretion to compensate a party for costs and attorney\u2019s fees incurred as a result of the litigation.\u201d). Indeed, \u201c[r]ather than following a statutory scheme, in determining whether to award attorney\u2019s fees the trial court considers \u2018the circumstances of the parties,\u2019 <em>Barnes v. Barnes, </em>16 Va.App. 98, 106, 428 S.E.2d 294, 300 (1993), and the \u2018equities of the entire case[,]\u2019 <em>Davis v. Davis, </em>8 Va.App. 12, 17, 377 S.E.2d 640, 643 (1989).\u201d <em>Taylor, </em>27 Va.App. at 217, 497 S.E.2d at 919-20. \u201c[T]he key to a proper award of counsel fees [is] reasonableness under all of the circumstances revealed by the record.\u201d <em>McGinnis v. McGinnis, </em>1 Va.App. 272, 277, 338 S.E.2d 159, 162 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">In confining its decision in this case to consideration of whether attorney\u2019s fees were warranted under the prevailing-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>party standard in Code \u00a7 20-146.33(A), the trial court clearly did not consider all the circumstances of the parties or the equities of the case. Hence, further factual resolution is required before it may be properly determined that an award of attorney\u2019s fees to mother is warranted under the equitable standard set forth in Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-79(b) and 20-99(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Accordingly, we reject mother\u2019s invitation to employ the right result, wrong reason rule to affirm the trial court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees to mother. Instead, we remand the case to the trial court for consideration, on the record,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> of mother\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees under Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-79(b) and 20-99(5).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">III. APPELLATE ATTORNEY\u2019S FEES AND COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">Both parties request an award of the attorney\u2019s fees and costs they incurred in connection with this appeal.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>The rationale for the appellate court being the proper forum to determine the propriety of an award of attorney\u2019s fees for efforts expended on appeal is clear. The appellate court has the opportunity to view the record in its entirety and determine whether the appeal is frivolous or whether other reasons exist for requiring additional payment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-5\"><em>O\u2019Loughlin v. O\u2019Loughlin, </em>23 Va.App. 690, 695, 479 S.E.2d 98, 100 (1996). Upon consideration of the record, we find \u201cthe litigation addressed appropriate and substantial issues and that neither party generated unnecessary delay or expense in pursuit of its interests.\u201d <em>Estate of Hackler v. Hackler, </em>44 Va.App. 51, 75, 602 S.E.2d 426, 438 (2004). Accordingly, we deny the parties\u2019 requests for an award of appellate attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">For these reasons, we reverse the trial court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees to mother under Code \u00a7 20-146.33(A), we remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion, and we deny the parties\u2019 requests for appellate attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b254-10\">. The Honorable LeRoy F. Millette, Jr., initially presided over mother\u2019s motion to change jurisdiction and issued the November 30, 2007 letter opinion. However, as Judge Millette noted in that letter opinion, his further involvement in the case was precluded by his November 26, 2007 appointment to this Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b255-7\">. Code \u00a7 20-146.18(A) provides, in substantial part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-8\">A court of this Commonwealth that has jurisdiction under this act to make a child custody determination may decline to exercise its jurisdiction at any time if it determines that it is an inconvenient forum under the circumstances and that a court of another state is a more appropriate forum.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b255-9\">. The court also considered father\u2019s emergency motion for holiday visitation at the same proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b255-10\">. Code \u00a7 20-146.33(A) provides, in pertinent part, that \"[t]he court shall award the prevailing party ... necessary and reasonable expenses incurred by or on behalf of the party, including costs [and] ... attorney\u2019s fees ..., unless the party from whom fees or expenses are sought establishes that the award would be clearly inappropriate.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b255-11\">. Although the record is not entirely clear on the matter, father\u2019s counsel conceded during oral argument before us that mother\u2019s express reliance on Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-79(b) and 20-99(5) at the January 2, 2008 hearing was specifically related to her request for attorney\u2019s fees and costs in connection with her motion to change jurisdiction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b256-9\">. Alternatively, father contends the trial court erred in not giving him the opportunity to establish that an award of attorney\u2019s fees \"would be clearly inappropriate,\u201d as required by Code \u00a7 20-146.33(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b263-6\">. Our conclusion that mother's interpretation of the statute was not intended by the legislature is also buttressed by the fact that a similar resolution was reached by the court of a sister state in considering that state\u2019s counterparts to Article 3 and Code \u00a7 20-146.33(A). <em>See Creighton v. Lazell-Frankel, </em>178 N.C.App. 227, 630 S.E.2d 738, 741 (2006) (concluding that the mother\u2019s request that the father be held in contempt for his plans to violate child custody provisions did not constitute an \"enforcement\u201d under Part 3 of the UCCJEA and, therefore, did not permit an award of attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 50A-312 (2005)). As expressly mandated by the UCCJEA, the Act\u2019s provisions \"shall be construed\u201d in a manner to \"[mjake uniform the law of those states that enact it.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-146.38(A)(9).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b263-7\">. In light of this resolution, we need not address father's alternative contention that the trial court erred, under Code \u00a7 20-146.33(A), in not allowing him to present evidence to show that an award of the requested attorney's fees was \"clearly inappropriate.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b263-8\">. Code \u00a7 20-79(b) provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-9\">In any suit for divorce, the court in which the suit is instituted or pending, when either party to the proceedings so requests, shall provide in its decree for the maintenance, support, care or custody of the child or children ..., support and maintenance for the spouse ..., and counsel fees and other costs, if in the judgment of the court any or all of the foregoing should be so decreed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">Code \u00a7 20-99(5) provides that \"[cjosts may be awarded to either party as equity and justice may require.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b266-8\">. Because mother\u2019s request for an award of attorney\u2019s fees under Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-79(b) and 20-99(5) was fully before the trial court at the January 2, 2008 hearing, and because both parties had the opportunity to, and did in fact, proffer evidence and present argument to the court on that motion, and because neither party expressed to the court the need or desire to present any additional evidence or argument in order to complete their presentations on that motion, we conclude it would be inappropriate to permit the parties to introduce additional evidence on remand and, thus, relitigate a matter already litigated. <em>See Antonelli v. Antonelli, </em>242 Va. 152, 155, 409 S.E.2d 117, 119 (1991) (noting that this Court\u2019s remand to the circuit court improperly \"afford[ed] the father another opportunity to prove what he failed to prove in the first instance\"); <em>id. </em>at 157, 409 S.E.2d at 120 (Whiting, J., dissenting) (finding the remand proper because \"nothing in [this] Court's opinion ... authorized] the [parties] to introduce any additional evidence\u201d on remand).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b266-9\">. Father\u2019s counsel asserted at oral argument that mother\u2019s failure to note an objection on the January 2, 2008 order \"to the fees being awarded under\" Code \u00a7 20-146.33(A), rather than Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-79(b) and 20-99(5), precludes us from remanding this case to the trial court for consideration of mother\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees under Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-79(b) and 20-99(5). Father offered, and we are aware of, no authority that supports his position. | Suffice it to say, requiring the <em>prevailing </em>parly to object to the trial court's choice of one asserted ground for awarding the requested relief over another does not comport with our sense of logic and reason.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
