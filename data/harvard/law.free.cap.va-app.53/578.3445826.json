On appeal, husband contends both these rulings were erroneous.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">\u201cWe review the evidence in the light most favorable to [wife], the party prevailing below, and grant ... all reasonable inferences fairly deducible from the evidence viewed in that light.\u201d <em>Goodhand v. Kildoo, </em>37 Va.App. 591, 595, 560 S.E.2d 463, 464 (2002). The evidence, so viewed, established the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">The parties were married in 1998 and had two sons. They separated in 2005 but continued to reside in the same house in Amissville, Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-9\">On May 11, 2007, wife filed a complaint for divorce based on a one-year separation and requested equitable distribution of the parties\u2019 property and sole custody of the parties\u2019 children, who were 3 and 5 years old at the time. The complaint also stated wife\u2019s \u201cdesire[ ] to relocate to Wausau, Wisconsin, with the parties\u2019 minor children.\u201d Husband filed an Answer in which he objected to wife\u2019s request for permission to relocate to Wisconsin with the boys.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-10\">Wife subsequently moved the court for <em>pendente lite </em>relief, and the parties entered into a consent order. Pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-124.5, the consent order included the term that each party was required to provide thirty days advance written notice to the other party of any intended change of address, including \u201cthe specific street, route address, city or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>county, state and zip code of the intended new address.\u201d In compliance with the <em>pendente lite </em>order, wife notified husband and the court that she intended to move with the parties\u2019 children to Warrenton, Virginia, on August 1, 2007, and included her street address. Wife and the parties\u2019 children continued to reside at the Warrenton address at the time of the divorce hearing on April 28, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">At that hearing, the parties testified and offered evidence about the boys\u2019 relationships with both parents. When wife\u2019s counsel announced the intention to question wife about \u201cone of the major issues that [she] filed with [her] complaint,\u201d her desire to relocate to Wisconsin, husband\u2019s counsel moved to exclude evidence of -wife\u2019s desire to relocate, claiming the <em>pendente lite </em>order required any party wishing to relocate to give thirty days notice of that intent under Code \u00a7 20-124.5. Wife\u2019s counsel argued the filing of wife\u2019s complaint, in which she indicated her desire to move to Wisconsin with the children, gave adequate notice of her intention. When the trial court asked wife for her new address in Wisconsin, wife said, \u201cI can give you a general address,\u201d and the trial court responded, \u2018Well, I mean the statute requires it____[W]hat you\u2019re asking me to do, really, is to give an advisory opinion.\u201d Wife\u2019s counsel argued wife did not want to give 30 days notice \u201cuntil she has heard from the Court. My understanding of the case law is that it can be done either way.\u201d Over husband\u2019s objection that he was entitled to notice and that \u201cadvisory opinions aren\u2019t constitutional,\u201d the trial court ruled as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-8\">I think it is sensible to do it this way because [wife], from the very start, has said that\u2019s what she wants to do. For judicial economy, it behoves [sic] the Court to do it this way. If we don\u2019t, ... what it really means is that a party has to arrange for a place to live, arrange for things to be moved, say they\u2019re going to move, and then give 30 days notice, and you won\u2019t get to court in 30 days, not here, not now, you know, because of the docket of this Court and a new judge coming on in August and all that. So it would just really screw up the docket. I realize that\u2019s probably not a reason <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>to step on the constitution or anything of that nature, but she\u2019s made it clear that she wants to move from the very start, and I think today is an appropriate day to decide....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">Wife then offered evidence about her family in Wausau, Wisconsin, and described how she thought the boys would benefit from moving there and what efforts she intended to take to see that the boys maintained a relationship with their father. She also offered evidence regarding the relatively limited role husband played in the children\u2019s lives. Husband disputed wife\u2019s testimony concerning his relationship -with the boys and averred he had always been an active, involved parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">The parties also offered evidence concerning their property and additional relevant factors for equitable distribution under Code \u00a7 20-107.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">The trial court ruled that wife had proved \u201cthe move will not substantially impair the [boys\u2019] relationship with [husband]\u201d and that relocation to Wisconsin with wife was in the boys\u2019 best interests. It established a detailed visitation schedule and provided that all regularly scheduled visitation would occur in Virginia at wife\u2019s expense. On the issue of equitable distribution, the trial court ruled as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-8\">He has an IRA which is solely separate. I think it was worth about 27,000 or something like that. But anyway, his IRA is solely separate, so the Court makes no ruling with regard to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-9\">She has a pension, the marital value of which is about $28,000. Now, lots of other things are going to happen in a minute [with regard to equitable distribution], but I think she made more monetary and nonmonetary contributions for the benefit of the family. While he brought this [real] property into the marriage, in a moment he\u2019s going to get credit for it....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-10\">She was the main caregiver. She earned more. She did ... a lot of things to make the family go while he was out doing whatever he was doing on Saturdays ... so I think-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>she should keep her pension. That\u2019s a small enough nod to her greater contribution in that respect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">On May 13, 2008, about 15 days after the court\u2019s bench ruling, wife sent husband a notice of intended ehange of address, listing a particular street address in Wausau, Wisconsin, to take effect as of July 15, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">Husband asked the trial court to stay wife\u2019s planned relocation until he could appeal the final decree\u2019s approval of the relocation request to the Court of Appeals and obtain a ruling on that appeal. The trial court held a hearing on the request for stay on June 23, denied the motion, and entered the final decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">Husband then noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-10\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b627-11\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-12\">RELOCATION TO WISCONSIN</p>\n<p id=\"b627-13\">\n<em>1. Receipt of Testimony and Rendering of a Decision Regarding Relocation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b627-14\">Husband contends the trial court erred in allowing wife, at the evidentiary hearing on her complaint for divorce and equitable distribution, to offer evidence about her desire to relocate to Wisconsin with the parties\u2019 two sons. This was error, he contends, because wife\u2019s failure to file a notice of that intent and failure to list her \u201cspecific ... intended new address\u201d violated Code \u00a7 20-124.5 and the related notice provision in the <em>pendente lite </em>order. Thus, he avers, the admission of evidence relating to the relocation request was error and the ruling authorizing relocation amounted to a constitutionally prohibited advisory opinion. We hold the trial court\u2019s admission of the challenged testimony and resolution of the relocation request in the final decree was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>It is undisputed that in wife\u2019s complaint for divorce filed May 11, 2007, she sought custody of the parties\u2019 minor children and specifically stated her \u201cdesire[ ] to relocate to Wausau, Wisconsin, with the parties\u2019 minor children.\u201d Husband filed an Answer in which he objected, <em>inter alia, </em>to wife\u2019s request for permission to relocate with the children. He stated that relocating to Wausau, Wisconsin, was not in the children\u2019s best interests, and he did not state that the relocation request could not be resolved because wife had not listed the particular street address to which she desired to move. Thus, husband had notice of wife\u2019s intent, if necessary, to litigate the relocation request as part of the divorce proceeding,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and wife had no notice of husband\u2019s intent to object to the litigation of that issue on the ground that wife had not yet provided a specific street address for the desired relocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Further, neither Code \u00a7 20-124.5 nor the related notice provision in the <em>pendente lite </em>order prevented litigation of the relocation request in the divorce proceedings. Code \u00a7 20-124.5 provides in its entirety as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-6\">In any proceeding involving custody or visitation, the court shall include as a condition of any custody or visitation order a requirement that thirty days\u2019 advance written notice be given to the court and the other party by any party intending to relocate and of any intended change of address, unless the court, for good cause shown, orders otherwise. The court may require that the notice be in such form and contain such information as it deems proper and necessary under the circumstances of the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">This statute speaks directly to the written notice provision required to be included in any custody or visitation order. In the instant case, no such order existed when wife filed her complaint for divorce, custody, and permission to relocate.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>Assuming without deciding the notice provisions of Code \u00a7 20-124.5 became applicable to wife\u2019s previously filed request to relocate upon the inclusion of the notice language in the <em>pendente lite </em>order, the statute expressly recognizes that <em>a court may, \u201cfor good cause shown, </em>\u201d <em>modify the notice requirement so as to accept \u201cnotice </em>... <em>in such form and containing] such information as it deems proper and necessary under the circumstances of the case.\u201d </em>Code \u00a7 20-124.5 (emphasis added). The trial court implicitly found good cause for considering wife\u2019s request to relocate as part of the April 28, 2008 hearing on the merits of wife\u2019s complaint for divorce and equitable distribution, and we hold the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to wife, supports that finding. The trial court found the approach \u201csensible\u201d and noted \u201cthe other cases seem to say that the court does exactly what it\u2019s doing here and make[s] the decision [about whether to permit relocation] in advance of the formal notice.\u201d The court observed that not allowing such an approach would put the parent desiring to move in a \u201cCatch-22\u201d situation, requiring that parent to \u201cget a house, get a job, and do all these things, and then come[ ] to court and say now can I move having done all these things? And if the court says no, then they\u2019re stuck.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">This approach did not leave husband without a remedy for objecting to the particular address to which wife moved on the facts of this case. Although the court determined that allowing wife to move to Wausau, Wisconsin, with the parties\u2019 two sons was in the children\u2019s best interests, it still required wife to provide husband with \u201cthe required 80-day notice upon the actual move.\u201d Wife provided husband with this notice 15 days after the hearing and more than 60 days prior to her actual move. Thus, husband had ample time to challenge the particular street address but opted not to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">The trial court\u2019s ruling as a result of the April 28, 2008 hearing did not constitute an advisory opinion any more than would any ruling made in advance of an actual move, and policy considerations supported the court\u2019s decision to address the relocation issue in the divorce and custody hearing. As we have previously recognized, no statute sets out the standards <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>under which permission to relocate should be granted or denied. <em>See Petry v. Petry, </em>41 Va.App. 782, 789, 589 S.E.2d 458, 462 (2003). We have reasoned that \u201cthe relocation issue is best understood under traditional constructs governing custody and visitation\u201d and, thus, that the best interests standard governs. <em>Id. </em>at 789-90, 589 S.E.2d at 462. Because both the custody and relocation determinations are governed by a best interests standard, considering both issues in one proceeding serves judicial economy, as the trial court expressly recognized.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">Thus, we conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion in accepting evidence and ruling on the relocation request as part of the April 28, 2008 proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">\n<em>2. Sufficiency of the Evidence to Permit Relocation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">\u201cIn a court\u2019s decision as to the propriety of relocating the children ..., \u2018the welfare of the children is of primary and paramount importance.\u2019 \u201d <em>Parish v. Spaulding, </em>26 Va.App. 566, 572, 496 S.E.2d 91, 94 (1998) (quoting <em>Simmons v. Simmons, </em>1 Va.App. 358, 361, 339 S.E.2d 198, 199 (1986)), <em>aff'd, </em>257 Va. 357, 513 S.E.2d 391 (1999); see Code \u00a7 20-124.3 (delineating the factors to be weighed in assessing the best interests of children in custody and visitation matters); <em>see also Cloutier v. Queen, </em>35 Va.App. 413, 427, 430, 545 S.E.2d 574, 581, 582-83 (2001) (holding that the Code \u00a7 20-124.3 factors govern whether relocation is in a child\u2019s best interests and that the interests to be assessed are solely the child\u2019s and do not include the custodial parent\u2019s interests). \u201c[T]he added difficulty in maintaining a beneficial relationship between a child and a non-custodial parent should not be the sole basis for restricting a custodial parent\u2019s residence except where the benefits of the relationship cannot be substantially maintained if the child is moved away from the non-custodial parent.\u201d <em>Scinaldi v. Scinaldi, </em>2 Va.App. 571, 575, 347 S.E.2d 149, 151 (1986). The moving party bears the burden of proving that the relocation will not \u201csubstantially impair[ ]\u201d the relationship between the children and the other parent. <em>Stockdale v. Stockdale, </em>33 Va.App. 179, 184, 532 S.E.2d 332, 335 (2000). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>\u201cWe review the evidence in the light most favorable to [wife], the party prevailing below, and grant ... all reasonable inferences fairly deducible from the evidence viewed in that light.\u201d <em>Goodhand, </em>37 Va.App. at 595, 560 S.E.2d at 464. The trial court\u2019s decision regarding the relocation of a custodial parent \u201c \u2018is a matter of discretion,\u2019 \u201d and on appeal, we will not reverse that decision \u201c \u2018unless plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sullivan v. Knick, </em>38 Va.App. 773, 783, 568 S.E.2d 430, 435 (2002) (quoting <em>Bostick v. Bostick-Bennett, </em>23 Va.App. 527, 533, 478 S.E.2d 319, 322 (1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">Husband contends wife failed to meet her burden of proving relocation would not substantially impair his relationship with the parties\u2019 children and that the move was in the children\u2019s best interests. We hold the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the party prevailing below, supports the trial court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">Code \u00a7 20-124.3(5) requires the trial court to consider \u201c[t]he role which each parent <em>has played </em>and will continue to play in the future, in the upbringing and care of the child.\u201d (Emphasis added.) As we have previously recognized, the role the non-custodial parent has previously played in the children\u2019s lives is relevant to assessing whether the requested relocation will \u201csubstantially impair[ ]\u201d the relationship between the children and the other parent. <em>Petry, </em>41 Va.App. at 792-93, 589 S.E.2d at 463-64. Although husband contended he had played an active role in the children\u2019s lives since their birth, wife\u2019s evidence was that husband exhibited little to no interest in spending time with his sons until he learned wife was keeping a detailed log of his behavior toward the children and was planning to file for divorce. <em>See id. </em>(where the trial court found that prior to the parties\u2019 separation \u201chusband had \u2018abdicated to a great extent\u2019 his parental duties,\u201d holding husband\u2019s \u201cprior history of parental disinterest\u201d was a proper factor for consideration in assessing whether relocation would substantially impair husband\u2019s relationship with the children).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">The trial court expressly observed wife bore the burden of proving the relocation would not substantially impair the boys\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>relationship with husband. It noted that although \u201c[husband] has participated in home schooling the older boy and has increased his participation with both children, <em>that\u2019s really recent history.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The trial court then ruled, implicitly if not explicitly, that the move would not substantially impair husband\u2019s prior relationship with the boys because wife was the main caregiver and \u201cthe other kinds of things that [husband] has done with the children can be arranged in expanded visits that will take place on a less frequent basis.\u201d The evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to wife, supports this finding. The trial court found wife was \u201ccommitted to encouraging visits with the [husband].\u201d It established a detailed visitation schedule for the children, including four weeks during the summer, and ordered that wife be responsible for the cost of transporting the children to and from Virginia so that this burden would not fall on husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">The evidence as a whole also supports the trial court\u2019s finding that the move was in the best interests of the children, who were 4 and 6 years old at the time of the hearing. The trial court found that upon moving to the small town of Wausau, Wisconsin, wife, who had always been the primary caretaker for the children, \u201cwill have more time with the children by avoiding the killer commute that she has now.\u201d Additional evidence established that wife\u2019s ability to work a flexible schedule at her job in Virginia and to maintain any sort of employment with that company were both in jeopardy as a result of her boss\u2019 impending departure. Wife, who was not college educated, testified that the cost of living in Wausau was significantly lower than in Virginia and that she would more easily be able to earn enough money to support herself and the children there than in Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">The evidence supported a finding that wife\u2019s extended family, including her parents, three brothers, one sister,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>families, all resided in Wausau, Wisconsin. The trial court also found that the children were \u201cof an age and stage in life where they have not developed ties to friends and places in Virginia such that a move will be difficult for them,\u201d and noted that because \u201cthey\u2019ve visited Wisconsin and have a sense of place and person there, ... it\u2019s not an unfamiliar place or unfamiliar people to them.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 793-94, 589 S.E.2d at 464 (noting that a child\u2019s familial and other contacts in, and number of prior visits to, an area are relevant to determining whether a move there is in a child\u2019s best interests). It explained further that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-5\">[t]he kids\u2019 lives [in Wausau, Wisconsin,] will be more community-oriented. They will have a smaller area where they will be concentrated with her work and their schooling and playmates and friends and that kind of thing. She indicates they will be able to attend private school [at wife\u2019s expense], which both parents want and which is not affordable in Virginia but is in Wisconsin. They\u2019ll have extensive contact with cousins of similar age and with other maternal relatives and other children as well, ... [in] school.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">The evidence showed that the children\u2019s family ties in Virginia, other than husband, consisted only of their paternal grandparents and that, although these grandparents helped care for the boys from time to time, the boys were \u201cnot that dose\u201d to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">This evidence supported the trial court\u2019s finding that allowing wife to move with the boys to Wausau, Wisconsin, was in the boys\u2019 best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF WIFE\u2019S PENSION</p>\n<p id=\"AOj\">\u201cFashioning an equitable distribution award lies within the sound discretion of the trial judge----\u201d <em>Srinivasan v. Srinivasan, </em>10 Va.App. 728, 732, 396 S.E.2d 675, 678 (1990). Although the trial court must consider all factors set out in Code \u00a7 20-107.3(E), it \u201cneed not quantify or elaborate exactly what weight was given to each of the factors\u201d as long as its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>\u201cfindings ... [are] based upon credible evidence.\u201d <em>Taylor v. Taylor, </em>5 Va.App. 436, 444, 364 S.E.2d 244, 249 (1988). \u201cVirginia law does not establish a presumption of equal distribution of marital assets.\u201d <em>Matthews v. Matthews, </em>26 Va.App. 638, 645, 496 S.E.2d 126, 129 (1998); <em>see Robbins v. Robbins, </em>48 Va.App. 466, 480, 632 S.E.2d 615, 622 (2006) (affirming circuit court\u2019s use of \u201ca 65/35 division of assets\u201d). Further, \u201c[e]ach marital asset is not necessarily entitled to be treated the same for purposes of equitable distribution.\u201d <em>Gamer v. Gamer, </em>16 Va.App. 335, 344, 429 S.E.2d 618, 624 (1993). How to divide the marital share of wife\u2019s retirement account, \u201cas with any other asset, rested within the sound discretion of the chancellor, subject to the limitations of Code \u00a7 20-107.3(G) and upon consideration of the Code \u00a7 20-107.3(E) factors.\u201d <em>Torian v. Torian, </em>38 Va.App. 167, 181, 562 S.E.2d 355, 362 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">The evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to wife, supported the trial court\u2019s award to wife of all of her retirement account of $27,949.14. The evidence supported the trial court\u2019s finding that wife\u2019s income during the marriage was greater than husband\u2019s and that wife\u2019s nonmonetary contributions to the marriage were more significant, as well. In addition to maintaining employment outside the home, wife was the primary caretaker for the couple\u2019s children throughout the marriage. Finally, husband concedes the trial court evenly divided the marital portion of the parties\u2019 most significant marital assets, their real estate holdings.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">On these facts, we hold the trial court\u2019s decision to award wife 100% of the marital share of her pension was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">For these reasons, we hold the trial court did not err in granting wife permission to move the parties\u2019 two children with her to Wisconsin and awarding wife the entire marital share of her pension. Because we resolve the relocation issue in wife\u2019s favor, we do not reach the issue of our authority to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>grant husband\u2019s request for a stay of the relocation pending the outcome of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b624-11\">. Husband asked this Court to stay the trial court\u2019s decision approving wife\u2019s relocation with the parties\u2019 children to Wisconsin until this appeal was resolved. Because we conclude the trial court did not err in granting wife\u2019s request to relocate with the children to Wisconsin, we need not address father\u2019s request for a stay of the relocation pending appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b628-8\">. Husband did not contend at trial that the court\u2019s deciding to hear the issue prejudiced him in any way. He claimed only that allowing the evidence violated the statutory notice provisions as set out in the <em>pendente lite </em>order and constituted an advisory opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b632-7\">. The evidence was that wife\u2019s sister was residing in Virginia at the time of the hearing but would be moving back to Wausau, Wisconsin, six months later.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
