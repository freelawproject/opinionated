On appeal, Jones contends that (1) the evidence seized from his person was inadmissible at trial because it was obtained pursuant to an impermissible stop and frisk, in violation of the Fourth Amendment and (2) even if admissible, the evidence was not sufficient to maintain his convictions because the Commonwealth failed to establish that the item seized from his person was a firearm within the meaning of Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-308 and 18.2-308.2. We agree with Jones\u2019 first contention and reverse the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-13\">I. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b216-14\">\u201cOn appeal from a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress, we must review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to the Common<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>wealth all reasonable inferences fairly deducible from it.\u201d <em>Sabo v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 63, 69, 561 S.E.2d 761, 764 (2002) (citing <em>Commonwealth v. Grimstead, </em>12 Va.App. 1066, 1067, 407 S.E.2d 47, 48 (1991)). So viewed, the evidence at trial proved as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">On May 17, 2005 at approximately 10:30 a.m., Officer Michael Cranford (\u201cthe officer\u201d) was on bike patrol in a \u201cvery high crime area\u201d of the City of Norfolk. While on patrol, the officer observed Jones, along with two other men, standing on a grassy area near the sidewalk. He and two fellow patrolmen approached the group. As he approached, the officer did not observe any member of the group engaged in criminal activity, including Jones.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">Upon seeing the officers, Jones\u2019 \u201cdemeanor changed completely.\u201d Immediately, Jones began to walk away from the officers, heading \u201cbriskly\u201d towards a nearby townhouse.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As he walked, Jones \u201cbegan to clutch his right side with his right hand.\u201d The officer asked Jones to stop. However, Jones ignored the officer\u2019s request and continued toward the front door of the townhouse. Before reaching the door, the officer \u201ctook control of [Jones\u2019] arm and told him to put his hands up on his back.\u201d The officer then conducted a pat down of Jones, which revealed a .45-caliber pistol concealed in his waistband. The officer ran Jones\u2019 information and discovered that he had previous felony convictions. Thereafter, the officer placed Jones under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">Prior to trial, Jones made a motion to suppress all evidence seized from his encounter with the police. Jones argued that, because the officer was without a reasonable, articulable suspicion to believe Jones was engaged in criminal activity, he conducted an impermissible stop and frisk, in violation of the Fourth Amendment. The judge denied Jones\u2019 motion, finding that the officer had reasonable suspicion based upon two factors: Jones\u2019 unprovoked \u201cflight\u201d and the fact that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>encounter occurred in a high crime area. Jones was found guilty of both offenses, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">II. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">When reviewing a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress, \u201cwe are bound by the trial court\u2019s findings of historical fact unless \u2018plainly wrong\u2019 or without evidence to support them and we give due weight to the inferences drawn from those facts by resident judges and local law enforcement officers.\u201d <em>McGee v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 193, 198, 487 S.E.2d 259, 261 (1997) <em>(en </em>banc) (quoting <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 1663, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996)). The burden is on the defendant to show that the denial of his suppression motion, when the evidence is considered in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, was reversible error. <em>McCain v. Commonwealth, </em>261 Va. 483, 489-90, 545 S.E.2d 541, 545 (2001) (citing <em>Fore v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 1007, 1010, 265 S.E.2d 729, 731 (1980)). \u201c \u2018Ultimate questions of reasonable suspicion and probable cause to make a warrantless search\u2019 \u201d involve questions of both law and fact and are reviewed <em>de novo </em>on appeal. <em>McGee, </em>25 Va.App. at 198, 487 S.E.2d at 261 (quoting <em>Ornelas, </em>517 U.S. at 691, 116 S.Ct. at 1659).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">\u201cThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.... \u201d U.S. Const, amend. IV. However, \u201can officer may, consistent with the Fourth Amendment, conduct a brief, investigatory stop when the officer has a reasonable, articulable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot.\u201d <em>Illinois v. Wardlow, </em>528 U.S. 119, 123, 120 S.Ct. 673, 675, 145 L.Ed.2d 570 (2000) (citing <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 30, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 1884, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968)). Though less than probable cause, \u201cthe officer\u2019s suspicion must be based on more than just a guess or a hunch.\u201d <em>Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 1100, 1102-03, 407 S.E.2d 49, 51 (1991) (citing <em>Moss v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va.App. 305, 308, 373 S.E.2d 170, 172 (1988)). Our sole task on appeal is to deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>mine whether Jones\u2019 seizure was supported by reasonable suspicion.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">In determining if there is sufficient cause to justify an investigatory stop and subsequent frisk, we must look to the totality of the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 1108, 407 S.E.2d at 51 (citing <em>United States v. Cortez, </em>449 U.S. 411, 417, 101 S.Ct. 690, 694-95, 66 L.Ed.2d 621 (1981)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-5\">The circumstances we may consider include \u201cthe \u2018characteristics of the area\u2019 where the stop occurs, the time of the stop, whether late at night or not, as well as any suspicious conduct of the person accosted such as an <em>obvious </em>attempt to avoid officers or any nervous conduct on the discovery of their presence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 1103, 407 S.E.2d at 51-52 (quoting <em>Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 53, 67, 354 S.E.2d 79, 87 (1987)) (emphasis added). In this analysis, we use \u201cobjective standards rather than ... the police officer\u2019s subjective intent.\u201d <em>Goodwin v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va.App. 363, 366, 398 S.E.2d 690, 692 (1990) (citing <em>Iglesias v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va.App. 93, 101, 372 S.E.2d 170, 174-75 (1988) <em>(en </em>banc)). Jones argues that the totality of the circumstances surrounding his stop did not objectively indicate a \u201creasonable, articulable suspicion that criminal activity [was] afoot.\u201d <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 30, 88 S.Ct. at 1884. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">The facts of this case have notable similarities to a number of our prior cases. In each instance, we concluded that the totality of the circumstances surrounding the stop at issue did not support a finding of reasonable suspicion. In <em>Goodwin, </em>Goodwin\u2019s \u201cjamm[ing] his hand in his coat pocket\u201d upon seeing the police car did not rise to the level of reasonable suspicion, even in a high crime area. <em>Goodwin, </em>11 Va.App. at 366, 398 S.E.2d at 691. Writing for the majority, Chief Judge Koontz explained, \u201c[w]hile the police are regularly required to rely on their experience and instincts, the fourth amendment requires, at a minimum, that they possess <em>articulable facts </em>giving rise to reasonable suspicion of criminal activity before depriving a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>citizen of his or her privacy or freedom of movement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 367, 398 S.E.2d at 692 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Similarly, in <em>Smith, </em>an officer in a marked police car observed Smith on a playground that \u201chad a reputation for being a place where drugs were prevalent.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>12 Va.App. at 1102, 407 S.E.2d at 51. When he saw the police car, Smith \u201csuddenly move[d] and [stuck] something in the front of his sweatpants.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The officer subsequently detained Smith and conducted a search, which revealed a container of drugs. <em>Id. </em>We held that the officer\u2019s observations were not sufficient to justify the investigatory stop. <em>Id. </em>at 1104, 407 S.E.2d at 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">Again, in <em>Riley v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 494, 495, 412 S.E.2d 724, 725 (1992), an officer saw Riley get out of his car, turn his back, and \u201c[make] a motion to his waistband.\u201d Though the officer never saw an object of any kind, he believed Riley \u201chad a weapon which he was attempting to hide.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Based on these observations alone, the officer stopped Riley and conducted a pat-down search. <em>Id. </em>at 496, 412 S.E.2d at 725. We held that the officer\u2019s observations did not give him \u201cparticularized knowledge of Riley\u2019s involvement in any criminal activity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 499, 412 S.E.2d at 727. Thus, we held that \u201cthe circumstances upon which this stop was predicated ... were insufficient to justify an investigatory stop.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">As in each of the preceding cases, the officer in the instant case lacked facts \u201cgiving rise to reasonable suspicion\u201d to believe Jones was engaged in criminal activity. <em>Goodwin, </em>11 Va.App. at 367, 398 S.E.2d at 692. Albeit in a \u201chigh crime area,\u201d the encounter between Jones and the officer occurred at approximately 10:30 in the morning. The officer testified that as he approached, he did not observe Jones, or anyone else in the group, engaged in criminal activity. Upon seeing the officers, Jones simply turned and walked fifteen feet to a townhouse. Though Jones clutched his right side as he walked, the officer did not see an object of any kind.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>Citing <em>Wardlow, </em>the Commonwealth argues that because Jones was in a \u201chigh crime area\u201d and \u201cfled the scene as the police officer approached,\u201d his seizure was supported by reasonable suspicion. However, mere presence in a \u201chigh crime area\u201d is insufficient as a matter of law to provide reasonable suspicion for an investigative stop under <em>Terry. </em>Furthermore, Jones\u2019 \u201cbrisk\u201d walk some fifteen feet to a nearby townhouse did not constitute \u201cheadlong flight\u201d from the scene. In <em>Wardlow, </em>a group of officers descended on an area known for its drug activity in order to investigate suspected narcotic transactions. 528 U.S. at 121, 120 S.Ct. at 674. The officers expected to find \u201ca crowd of people in the area, including lookouts and customers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When they arrived, the officers observed Wardlow standing next to a building \u201cholding an opaque bag.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 122, 120 S.Ct. at 675. Immediately upon seeing the officers, Wardlow turned and ran \u201cthrough the gangway and an alley....\u201d <em>Id. </em>Finding that the stop was supported by reasonable suspicion, the Supreme Court held that \u201c[hjeadlong flight\u2014wherever it occurs\u2014is the consummate act of evasion: it is not necessarily indicative of wrongdoing, but it is certainly suggestive of such.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 124, 120 S.Ct. at 676.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">The facts of the instant case can hardly be equated to those of <em>Wardlow. </em>Unlike the facts in <em>Wardlow, </em>the officers in the instant case were on a routine patrol, not targeting participants in a drug transaction at a specific location where drug transactions were known to frequently occur. Furthermore, Jones carried no item, such as the opaque bag in <em>Wardlow, </em>which together with the other circumstances, would objectively indicate his involvement in criminal activity. Jones\u2019 \u201cbrisk\u201d walk of some fifteen feet to a nearby townhouse upon seeing the officers can hardly be equated to the \u201cheadlong flight\u201d of <em>Wardlow. </em>The Commonwealth also points to Jones\u2019 \u201c[n]ervous, evasive behavior\u201d to support its contention that the seizure was supported by reasonable suspicion. Specifically, that Jones refused to heed the officer\u2019s requests to stop. However, citizens who are not under arrest or otherwise detained have every right to refuse or ignore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>requests from law enforcement officers. \u201c[W]hen an officer, without reasonable suspicion or probable cause, approaches an individual, the individual has a right to ignore the police and go about his business.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 125, 120 S.Ct. at 676 (citing <em>Florida v. Royer, </em>460 U.S. 491, 103 S.Ct. 1319, 75 L.Ed.2d 229 (1983)). Moreover, a \u201c \u2018refusal to cooperate, without more, does not furnish the minimal level of objective justification needed for a detention or seizure.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Florida v. Bostick, </em>501 U.S. 429, 437, 111 S.Ct. 2382, 2387, 115 L.Ed.2d 389 (1991)). That was precisely what occurred here. Under these circumstances, Jones\u2019 failure to obey the officer\u2019s instructions cannot serve as the justification for his seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">Simply put, Jones\u2019 actions were not on par with those of <em>Wardlow </em>in providing reasonable suspicion to police that criminal activity \u201c[was] afoot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Because we hold that the trial court should have suppressed the handgun unlawfully seized from Jones\u2019 person, we need not and, thus, do not address the issue of whether the Commonwealth established that the handgun was a firearm within the meaning of Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-308 and 18.2-308.2. \u201c \u2018[T]he courts are not constituted ... to render advisory opinions, to decide moot questions or to answer inquiries which are merely speculative.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Harley, </em>256 Va. 216, 219-20, 504 S.E.2d 852, 854 (1998) (quoting <em>City of Fairfax v. Shanklin, </em>205 Va. 227, 229-30, 135 S.E.2d 773, 775-76 (1964)).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">III. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">Even when viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the evidence shows that Jones\u2019 seizure was clearly \u201cbased more on an \u2018inchoate and unparticularized suspicion or hunch,\u2019 than on a reasonable suspicion based on objective facts.\u201d <em>Moss, </em>7 Va.App. at 308, 373 S.E.2d at 172 (quoting <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 27, 88 S.Ct. at 1883). Because the officer lacked adequate grounds to stop Jones, we hold that the trial court erred in denying Jones\u2019 motion to suppress. Therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>we reverse the decision of the trial court and remand for a new trial, if the Commonwealth be so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b217-8\">.
