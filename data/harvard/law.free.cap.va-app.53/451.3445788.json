Roseborough (appellant) was convicted by the trial court of driving while intoxicated (DWI), in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-266. On appeal, he argues that the trial court erred in admitting a certificate of analysis containing the results of his breath test because the \u201ctest was not administered pursuant to the implied consent law.\u201d Specifically, he contends that his arrest was unlawful and, therefore, Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2(A), commonly referred to as the implied consent statute, required the exclusion of the certificate of analysis from his trial. Assuming without deciding that the officer did not have statutory authority to arrest appellant, we find the trial court did not err in admitting the certificate into evidence given the facts presented in this case. We find the implied consent statute was not used in this case to obtain the breath sample because appellant expressly volunteered to provide the sample before the officer could even mention the provisions of the implied consent statute to him. Thus, we affirm appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">BACKGROUND<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">On January 15, 2007, Charles Banks was working as a guard at the Watergate at Landmark apartment complex in the City of Alexandria. At about 2:00 a.m., he \u201c[h]eard an accident.\u201d Banks rushed to the scene, which was on the complex\u2019s private road rather than on a public street. As he arrived, Banks observed appellant standing beside the open, driver\u2019s-side door of a pickup truck that had run over the curb of the private road and gotten \u201cstuck\u201d on a hill.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">Officer. Seth Weinstein responded within thirty minutes of the crash. Appellant told Officer Weinstein that his friend, Jay, was driving the truck, but he \u201cran off.\u201d Appellant could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>not tell the officer Jay\u2019s last name, phone number, or address, other than to say that Jay lived in the apartment complex. Appellant admitted that he had been drinking at a bar in the District of Columbia. Appellant then said, \u201cI brought [Jay] back here,\u201d which the officer believed was an admission that appellant had been driving the truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">Appellant smelled of alcohol, he swayed as he walked, his eyes were bloodshot and watery, and he spoke very loudly. He refused to perform any field sobriety tests at the scene. The officer arrested him for DWI based on appellant\u2019s admissions and the officer\u2019s observations at the scene. In a search pursuant to that arrest, Officer Weinstein discovered a remote key for the truck in appellant\u2019s pocket. The ignition key was still in the ignition.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">As Officer Weinstein was transporting appellant to the detention center after his arrest, appellant said \u201che was considering blowing [into the Intoxilyzer<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] for [the officer] because [he] had been so nice.\u201d Appellant added that \u201che would blow if [the officer] would consider releasing him if he blew into the Intox[ilyzer].\u201d Officer Weinstein responded that, if appellant\u2019s breath test resulted in a blood/breath alcohol concentration (BAC) reading of .05 or less, then appellant \u201cwould be presumed to be sober in Virginia and he would be released and not charged\u201d with DWI. When they arrived at the detention center, as the officer was reading the <em>Miranda </em>warnings to him, appellant \u201cbrought the subject up and said that he was willing to blow and he wanted to blow.\u201d Up to that point, the officer had not decided whether he would even bring up the breath test, as he was not sure that the implied consent law applied when, as here, a suspect was arrested on private property. However, as the officer put it, appellant \u201cmade the decision\u201d for him when he volunteered to take the test. Officer Weinstein administered the test, appellant blew into the Intoxilyzer, and the breath test resulted in a BAC reading of .09.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>At trial,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Officer Weinstein testified about the events leading to appellant\u2019s arrest and appellant\u2019s offer to take the breath test. The officer testified that he was a certified Intoxilyzer operator, that he administered the test, that he observed appellant for twenty minutes before administering the test, and that he did not observe any behavior that would have affected the outcome of the test. The officer identified the certificate of analysis that was created when he administered the test, and he identified his signature on the attestation line of the certificate. The Commonwealth then moved for the introduction of that document into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">Appellant objected to introduction of the certificate. He argued that, because the officer did not have statutory authority to arrest appellant under Code \u00a7 19.2-81 (both because the DWI, which was a misdemeanor offense in this case, did not occur in the officer\u2019s presence and because the accident did not occur on a public highway), the implied consent statute did not apply to say that appellant was \u201cdeemed as a condition of such operation [of his car] to have consented to a blood test or breath test.\u201d Therefore, he contended, the certificate was not admissible. Appellant did not argue that the certificate failed to meet any of the evidentiary requirements found in Code \u00a7 18.2-268.9 for admission of a certificate of analysis nor did he make any argument regarding hearsay or other rules of evidence. Instead, appellant\u2019s sole objection to the introduction of the certificate was that the situation did not constitute \u201ca proper arrest\u201d for the application of the implied consent law to obtain the breath sample, so the certificate was inadmissible. In response to the argument that he voluntarily took the test, appellant argued that agreeing to the test did not validate his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>The trial court overruled appellant\u2019s objections and admitted the certificate. The court then found appellant guilty of DWI.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">On appeal, appellant argues that the results of the breath test here were inadmissible because \u201cthe accused must first be validly arrested.\u201d He does not reference any rule of evidence that would exclude a certificate created when a suspect, on his own initiative, has asked an officer to perform the Intoxilyzer test without first being informed about the implied consent statute. Appellant simply contends that the officer did not follow the \u201carrest\u201d provision of Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2, and, thus, the certificate was not admissible. Specifically, he contends that the officer could not presume that appellant consented to take the test under Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2 because the arrest was improper, and, therefore, the trial court erred in not excluding the certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">Appellant argues that Officer Weinstein did not have statutory authority to arrest him under Code \u00a7 19.2-81. He contends that, because Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2, the implied consent statute, applies only where an officer effectuates a statutorily valid arrest, that statute precluded admission of the certificate of analysis at his trial. For the purposes of this opinion, we assume without deciding that Officer Weinstein did not have statutory authority to arrest appellant. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-81 and 18.2-266. However, appellant\u2019s conclusion that the implied consent statute precluded introduction of the certificate of analysis at his trial does not follow from this premise.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>Appellant\u2019s analysis ignores a critical fact in the posture of this case\u2014Officer Weinstein never read the implied consent law to appellant and did not obtain appellant\u2019s consent to blow into the Intox\u00f1yzer by informing him of the implied consent law. Instead, appellant volunteered to take the test before Officer Weinstein had even decided if he could use the implied consent law to obtain a breath sample from appellant. Appellant <em>actually initiated </em>the taking of the test and <em>explicitly </em>volunteered to take it before he could be informed of the implied consent statute.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2(A) addresses when a person is <em>deemed to consent </em>to a breath test. The statute simply states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-6\">Any person, whether licensed by Virginia or not, who operates a motor vehicle upon a highway, as defined in \u00a7 46.2-100, in the Commonwealth shall be deemed thereby, as a condition of such operation, to have consented to have samples of his blood, breath, or both blood and breath taken for a chemical test to determine the alcohol, drug, or both alcohol and drug content of his blood, if he is arrested for violation of \u00a7 18.2-266, 18.2-266.1, or subsection B of \u00a7 18.2-272 or of a similar ordinance within three hours of the alleged offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2(A). In other words, a person driving on Virginia\u2019s roads has implicitly consented to take a breath test, so officers can refer to this statute when they want to convince a driver to provide a sample for a breath test.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This statute does not address <em>all </em>instances when a breath test may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>taken and includes no language addressing the <em>admissibility </em>of the resulting certificates of analysis at trial. The statute contains no language addressing situations such as the one here, where a defendant actually volunteered to take the breath test before an officer could tell him about the implied consent statute. Where a driver asks to have a breath test taken, as occurred here, the statute on its face has no relevance. <em>See Hubbard v. Henrico Ltd. Pshp., </em>255 Va. 335, 340, 497 S.E.2d 335, 338 (1998) (courts should look to the plain language of statutes).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">Appellant points to several Virginia appellate decisions that have addressed the admissibility of breath test certificates under Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2 and argues that these cases required the exclusion of the certificate of analysis in this case. However, these cases are clearly distinguishable and inapplicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">In <em>Thomas v. Town of Marion, </em>226 Va. 251, 254, 308 S.E.2d 120, 122 (1983), Thomas was \u201cnot properly arrested\u201d under the Code because the arresting officer did not have a warrant nor did he observe the accident that led to the misdemeanor charge. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-81. After this arrest, the officer informed Thomas of the implied consent statute. 226 Va. at 253, 308 S.E.2d at 121. Later in the evening, Thomas was properly arrested pursuant to a warrant, but this arrest was more than two hours<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> after the accident, and the administration of the breath test occurred after this second arrest. In finding that the trial court should have excluded the certificate of analysis from Thomas\u2019s breath test, the Supreme Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-7\">Since the arrest was untimely, the defendant is not deemed to have consented to the testing of his breath under the \u201cimplied consent\u201d law. Moreover, defendant\u2019s <em>actual con</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number><em>sent </em>in this case was invalid because it was based upon a belief, generated by the officer\u2019s recitation of the law, that he was bound to submit to a test. Hence, receipt of the certificate in evidence was improper.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 254, 308 S.E.2d at 122 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">The Supreme Court did not conclude its analysis in <em>Thomas, </em>as appellant would now have us do, by simply finding that the arrest was unlawful or \u201cuntimely.\u201d Instead, the Court specifically added that Thomas\u2019s <em>actual consent </em>was invalid because the officer obtained that consent by informing Thomas that \u201che was bound to submit to a test,\u201d when the law did not actually require that he provide a breath sample because the officer requested the sample more than two hours after the accident. <em>Id. </em>Here, in contrast, Officer Weinstein never informed appellant about the provisions of the implied consent statute nor had he even raised the issue of an Intoxilyzer test. Before the officer could even decide whether the provisions of the implied consent statute applied in this situation, appellant initiated this discussion by saying, without any previous mention of implied consent or of taking a breath sample for testing, that he wanted to take the Intoxilyzer test.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">As appellant <em>volunteered </em>to provide the breath sample, without being influenced by the provisions of the implied consent law, those provisions are irrelevant here. <em>Thomas, </em>rather than supporting appellant\u2019s argument, instead suggests that actual consent to take a breath test, without any reliance on the provisions of the implied consent statute, can produce an admissible certificate of analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">In <em>Durant v. City of Suffolk, </em>4 Va.App. 445, 448, 358 S.E.2d 732, 734 (1987), the same basic sequence of events occurred as in Thomas\u2014the officer arrested Durant without having statutory authority for the arrest, the officer then informed Durant of the implied consent law, and Durant subsequently submitted to a breath test. This Court, relying on <em>Thomas, </em>found the results of that test should have been excluded from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>trial. <em>Id. </em>at 449, 358 S.E.2d at 734. Therefore, <em>Durant </em>simply reapplies the same test explained, <em>supra, </em>in Thomas.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\"><em>Thomas </em>and <em>Durant </em>hold that a suspect cannot legitimately consent to a breath test if he is unlawfully or untimely arrested, the officer informs the suspect of the provisions of the implied consent law, <em>and </em>the suspect then consents to provide a breath sample under the mistaken belief that he could be penalized under the implied consent law for refusing to cooperate. <em>See Bristol v. Commonwealth, </em>272 Va. 568, 574-75, 636 S.E.2d 460, 464 (2006) (A \u201cdriver\u2019s timely arrest triggers the statutory consent requirement, [so] the arrest must be completed before the driver may be <em>required </em>to take the test.\u201d (emphasis added)).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> These cases do not address the facts here, however, where the breath test was not obtained pursuant to that law. Here, independent of the implied consent law and without the officer ever telling him about Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2, appellant <em>actually asked </em>to take the test. Unlike the defendants in <em>Durant </em>and <em>Thomas, </em>appellant initiated the discussion here and, without being informed that he was presumed \u201cto have consented to have samples\u201d of his breath taken under Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2, appellant told the officer that he \u201cwanted to blow\u201d into the Intoxylizer. Unlike the officers in <em>Durant </em>and <em>Thomas, </em>Officer Weinstein did not use the implied consent statute to prod appellant into taking the breath test. Therefore, the provisions of Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2 do not operate to exclude the certificate here.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Other states have considered arguments similar to those raised by appellant in relation to statutes similar to Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>\u00a7 18.2-268.2. In <em>People v. Ward, </em>307 N.Y. 73, 120 N.E.2d 211 (1954), the police asked, in a \u201c \u2018gentlemanly manner,\u2019 \u201d if Ward would submit to a blood test, and he then agreed to the test without any mention by the police officers of the state\u2019s implied consent law.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals of New York found the state\u2019s implied consent law did not apply, and, therefore, the test\u2019s results were admissible. <em>Id. </em>at 212-14. In <em>Lunceford v. Northport, </em>555 So.2d 246, 247 (Ala.Crim.App. 1988), an officer arrested Lunceford as he sat in a car that was parked in a private parking lot. The officer then asked him if he was willing to take a breath test, \u201cand he said yes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 248. The Alabama appellate court agreed with Lunceford that the Alabama implied consent statute applied only when a person drove on public highways, so the statute did not require that Lunceford provide a breath sample to the police.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>However, rather than ruling that the results of the defendant\u2019s test should have been excluded, the appellate court remanded the case for the trial court to determine if Lunce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>ford\u2019s agreement to take the test was voluntary\u2014and, therefore, independent of the provisions of the Alabama implied consent statute. <em>Id. </em>at 249-50. The court held that, <em>if </em>Lunceford\u2019s consent to take the test was involuntary, then he was entitled to a new trial; otherwise, he remained convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol. <em>Id. </em>at 250.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">In addition, in <em>State v. Wether ell, </em>82 Wash.2d 865, 514 P.2d 1069, 1073 (1973), the Washington appellate court found that defendant Wright<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> had \u201cactually consented\u201d to a breath test, although he was not arrested. The Washington implied consent statute, RCW \u00a7 46.20.380(1), was similar to our statute in that a person was \u201cdeemed to have given consent\u201d to take the test if he drove on the public highways and if he was arrested for driving while intoxicated. <em>Id. </em>at 1071-72. The Washington court ruled that the provisions of the implied consent statute and its warnings were \u201csuperfluous\u201d if the driver actually consented to take the test. <em>Id. </em>at 1072. As Wright had consented to take the test without recourse to the provisions of the implied consent statute, the court held that the results of his test were admissible. <em>Id. </em>at 1073. <em>See also State v. Seager, </em>178 Neb. 51, 131 N.W.2d 676, 677-78 (1964) (\u201cThere is nothing in the present statutory conditions relative to implied consent which has the effect of changing the foundation requirements of the statutes for the admission of tests performed pursuant to the consent of the accused.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">While the implied consent law provides an incentive for a driver to submit to a breath test, if an arresting officer does not discuss that law with a driver in order to obtain a breath sample, the provisions of Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2 are not implicated. As appellant here voluntarily provided the breath sample for the Intoxilyer test -without any recourse to the implied consent law, we find that Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2 did not apply here.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>Therefore, the trial court here correctly denied appellant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">The dissent points to other arguments, not made by appellant, to find that the trial court committed error here, contending that \u201c[t]he mere fact that a breath test is voluntarily taken does not automatically render the results of that test admissible at trial.\u201d We do not necessarily disagree.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> However, the dissent fails to recognize that appellant simply did not argue at trial, and does not argue on appeal, that Code \u00a7 18.2-268.9 or any other rule of evidence precluded introduction of the certificate of analysis here. As the issue was not argued at trial or on appeal, consideration of Code \u00a7 18.2-268.9 is inappropriate under Rule 5A:18 and Rule 5A:20.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">Appellant argued only that Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2(A) <em>itself, </em>and particularly as interpreted in <em>Durant </em>and <em>Thomas, </em>precluded introduction of the certificate of analysis because the arrest was unlawful.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Appellant in this appeal did not discuss any rules of evidence, but instead argued that the officer never had lawful authority to administer the test, as the issue was raised in <em>Durant </em>and <em>Thomas. </em>Although perhaps appellant should have argued that Code \u00a7 18.2-268.9 precluded introduction of the certificate here, assuming the dissent\u2019s analysis is correct, nonetheless he never made this argument at trial or on appeal. Therefore, we do not consider its application here, especially as appellant also does not argue that the ends of justice require consideration of Code \u00a7 18.2-268.9. <em>See </em>Rule 5A:18; <em>Singson v. Commonwealth, </em>46 Va.App. 724, 749 n. 10, 621 S.E.2d 682, 694 n. 10 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">The dissent also contends that the majority opinion errs, claiming that \u201cthe objection made by appellant to the sufficiency of that foundation\u201d preserved any objection to the certifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>cate of analysis under Code \u00a7 18.2-268.9. However, again, appellant <em>never </em>argued that the certificate was inadmissible under Code \u00a7 18.2-268.9. Instead, he argued that the implied consent statute did not apply because the arrest was improper. Therefore, it is not surprising that the trial court based its ruling only on the objection made by appellant. The trial court was never asked to consider the question from the perspective presented by the dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">We agree with the dissent that the Commonwealth, as the proponent of the certificate of analysis, was required to respond to appellant\u2019s arguments against admission of that evidence. However, the Commonwealth was not required to address every possible objection to the certificate\u2019s admission, even arguments that were not presented by appellant. The Commonwealth was required only to answer the specific objections that appellant did make. <em>See Wright v. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry. Co., </em>245 Va. 160, 170, 427 S.E.2d 724, 729 (1993) (\u201c[A] litigant will not be permitted to invite a trial court to commit error, either through agreeing <em>or failing to object, </em>and then be permitted to successfully complain of such error on appeal.\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>cf. Neal v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 416, 422, 425 S.E.2d 521, 524-25 (1992) (explaining that the specifics of the objection are important to preserving an evidence issue for appeal). Therefore, whether or not the certificate of analysis here failed to meet the requirements of Code \u00a7 18.2-268.9 is irrelevant now on appeal. Appellant never made any objections based on that statute, so the Commonwealth was not required to prove that the certificate of analysis met the requirements of Code \u00a7 18.2-268.9. Therefore, the provisions of that statute do not affect our analysis here.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">We find the officer did not need to resort to the implied consent law to obtain a breath sample because appellant explicitly consented to the breath test without being informed about the implied consent statute. Thus, as the officer did not rely upon Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2(A) to obtain the sample, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>statute did not require the exclusion of the certificate of analysis here.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">We find the trial court did not err in admitting the certificate into evidence, and, therefore, we affirm appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b494-9\">. We review the evidence on appeal in the light most favorable to the party who prevailed below, here, the Commonwealth, and, therefore, also grant to the Commonwealth all reasonable inferences fairly deducible from the evidence. <em>Sabo v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 63, 69, 561 S.E.2d 761, 764 (2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b495-7\">. An Intoxilyzer is a machine used by the police to take a breath sample and test that sample for alcohol content.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b496-5\">. At trial, appellant also made a motion to suppress the evidence collected by Officer Weinstein, arguing that the officer effectuated the arrest without probable cause. The trial court denied this motion. Appellant requested appellate review of this ruling in his petition for appeal, but this Court did not grant his petition in relation to that question presented. Therefore, the issue of probable cause is not before us, and we may not examine the trial court\u2019s finding that the officer had probable cause to arrest appellant. <em>See </em>Rules 5A:12 and 5A:15.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b497-8\">. Appellant does not ask this Court to apply the Fourth Amendment to suppress the certificate of analysis. At oral argument, appellant agreed that he was specifically arguing that the implied consent statute applied and that Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2 should have excluded the certificate of analysis. Appellant\u2019s argument does not reference any general rule of evidence, however, but instead is based on a statutorily unlawful arrest. Therefore, his argument is more akin to a suppression motion than a hearsay or other evidentiary objection.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b498-8\">. At trial and on appeal, appellant did not argue that his willingness to submit to the test was involuntary or tainted in any way. He argued simply that the fact that the officer did not have authority to arrest him, together with the requirement that a lawful arrest precede a breath test taken under the implied consent statute, required that the trial court exclude the certificate of analysis from his Intoxilyzer test, even though appellant actually initiated the taking of the breath test himself without ever being informed of the provisions of the implied consent statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b498-9\">.

I believe such a holding is contrary to both the basic rules of evidence and existing case law. Moreover, I would hold that the trial court erred in admitting the results of appellant\u2019s breath test pursuant to the implied consent statute. Thus, I also dissent from the judgment and would reverse the conviction and remand for a new trial if the Commonwealth be so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">The majority finds that \u201cthe implied consent statute was not used in this case to obtain the breath sample because appellant expressly volunteered to provide the sample before the officer could even mention the provisions of the implied consent statute to him.\u201d This statement by the majority is factually misleading and conflates two otherwise distinct legal issues: the voluntariness of appellant\u2019s breath test when arrested and the admissibility of the certificate of analysis from appellant\u2019s breath test as an exhibit at trial. From the record, it is clear that the trial court based the admission of the certificate on the applicability of the implied consent statute. Yet, in its analysis, the majority simply ignores what was actually presented to the trial court to find another rationale for the certificate\u2019s admissibility, and then substitutes this rationale for the one actually advanced at trial. The majority begins with the notion that because appellant \u201cagreed to submit to the Intoxilyzer,\u201d the provisions of the implied consent statute are inapplicable. From this flawed premise, the majority then reasons that because the taking of the breath <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>test was voluntary, the results were <em>ipso facto </em>admissible at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">In response, I must point out that every submission to a breath test is essentially a voluntary act, whether conducted pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2(A) or not. Our statutory scheme contemplates that by driving on the highways of the Commonwealth, one has thereby consented to taking a breath or blood test. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2. This consent can only be withdrawn by an affirmative act revoking that consent. The only legal distinction between breath tests conducted pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2 and those that are not is the <em>foundation necessary </em>in order to admit the test results as an exhibit at trial. It seems axiomatic to me that criminal defendants do not make binding decisions regarding the admissibility of evidence at the time of their arrest by virtue of their cooperation with law enforcement officers. Judges make these decisions, and they do so pursuant to the rules of evidence at the time the evidence is tendered to the fact finder. Thus, the mere fact that a breath test is voluntarily taken does not automatically render the results of that test admissible at trial.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">The majority is content to look at Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2 in a vacuum stating that \u201c[t]his statute does not address <em>all </em>instances when a breath test may be taken and includes no language addressing the <em>admissibility </em>of the resulting certificates of analysis at trial.\u201d (Emphasis in majority opinion). While this may be true in a literal sense, the majority has overlooked one of the most basic principles of appellate review. \u201c[W]hen a given controversy involves a number of related statutes, they should be read and construed together in order to give full meaning, force, and effect to each.\u201d <em>Ainslie v. Inman, </em>265 Va. 347, 353, 577 S.E.2d 246, 249 (2003) (citing <em>Kole v. City of Chesapeake, </em>247 Va. 51, 56, 439 S.E.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>405, 408 (1994)). Therefore, we cannot merely examine Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2 in isolation, but must consider it in relation to other sections of the Code that concern the admissibility of such evidence.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">Before a certificate of analysis from a breath test may be admitted into evidence, the Commonwealth must first lay an adequate foundation for its admissibility. The majority correctly notes that compliance with the implied consent statute is not necessarily a prerequisite for the admission of the results of a breath test. However, the foundation required for admission in other circumstances is far more stringent than that laid by the Commonwealth in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">Code \u00a7 18.2-268.9 outlines two categories of foundational requirements for the use of breath-test results as evidence in a prosecution for driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> For <em>all </em>cases involving a prosecution for driving under the influence, the statute provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7o\">To be <em>capable of being considered valid as evidence </em>in a prosecution under \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-266 ... chemical analysis of a person\u2019s breath shall be performed by an individual possessing a valid license to conduct such tests, with a type of equipment and in accordance with methods approved by the Department of Criminal Justice Services, Division of Forensic Science. The Division shall test the accuracy of the breath-testing equipment at least once every six months. The Division shall establish a training program for all individuals who are to administer the breath tests. Upon a person\u2019s successful completion of the training program, the Division may license him to conduct breath-test analyses. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>Such license shall identify the specific types of breath test equipment upon which the individual has successfully completed training----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Code \u00a7 18.2-268.9 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Thus, <em>no </em>breath test evidence may be <em>considered </em>for admission unless it was conducted by a properly licensed operator on properly approved equipment. The remaining language in Code \u00a7 18.2-268.9 states the foundational requirements for the <em>admissibility </em>of certificates reporting the analyses of breath tests, but expressly limits those requirements to breath tests administered pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AW6\">Any individual conducting a breath test <em>under the provisions of \u00a7 18.2-268.2 </em>shall issue a certificate which will indicate that the test was conducted in accordance with the Division\u2019s specifications, the equipment on which the breath test was conducted has been tested within the past six months and has been found to be accurate, the name of the accused, that prior to administration of the test the accused was advised of his right to observe the process and see the blood alcohol reading on the equipment used to perform the breath test, the date and time the sample was taken from the accused, the sample\u2019s alcohol content, and the name of the person who examined the sample. <em>This certificate, when attested by the individual conducting the breath test, shall be admissible in any court in any criminal or civil proceeding as evidence of the facts therein stated and of the results of such analysis </em>....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">Code \u00a7 18.2-268.9 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">Basically, in order to introduce the results of a breath test in <em>any </em>prosecution under Code \u00a7 18.2-266, the operator and equipment <em>must </em>comply with the first paragraph of Code \u00a7 18.2-268.9 as part of the foundation for admissibility of the test results. However, if the implied consent statute is applicable, the only remaining foundational requirements are found in Code \u00a7 18.2-268.9 itself, and the certificate of analysis is admissible if the requirements of both the first and second paragraphs of that statute have been satisfied. In essence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>the properly attested certificate by a certified operator using approved equipment, when coupled with the applicability of the implied consent statute, provides the necessary foundation. On the other hand, if the implied consent statute does not apply, as the majority suggests, then the streamlined statutory foundational requirements for admitting the certificate of analysis contained in the second paragraph of Code \u00a7 18.2-268.9 are likewise inapplicable. Under those circumstances, the test results would only be admissible following the laying of a proper foundation consistent with both the first paragraph of Code \u00a7 18.2-268.9 <em>and </em>the additional requirements imposed by the traditional rules of evidence such as those prohibiting hearsay or governing expert witnesses. <em>See </em>Charles E. Friend, <em>The Law of Evidence in Virginia </em>\u00a7 14-5(a), at 573 (6th ed.2003). Since the Commonwealth offered no evidentiary foundation, other than the assertion that the implied consent statute was applicable and the fact that the officer was a \u201ccertified Intox operator,\u201d the trial court would have erred in admitting the test results even under the analysis of the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">In approaching the question presented to us, the majority reasons from the negative and asserts that the trial court did not err in admitting the certificate because \u201cappellant simply did not argue at trial, and does not argue on appeal, that Code \u00a7 18.2-268.9 or any other rule of evidence precluded introduction of the certificate of analysis.\u201d However, in making this statement, the majority blithely ignores a number of significant facts in the record. First, the Commonwealth offered no alternative basis for the admission of the certificate of analysis other than the applicability of the implied consent law. The Commonwealth laid the foundation for the admission of the certificate based entirely upon the applicability of Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2. The Commonwealth established that Officer Weinstein was a certified breathalyzer operator, that he advised appellant of the statutory presumption of sobriety found in Code \u00a7 18.2-269(A)(1), and that Weinstein substantially followed all of the procedures required for taking and admitting the results of a breath test pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number><em>et seq </em>(the implied consent statutes). Thus, it seems obvious from the record that, in context, the exhibit was clearly tendered for admission by the Commonwealth on the basis of compliance with Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Second, appellant objected to the admission of the certificate of analysis pursuant to the implied consent statute, arguing that the Commonwealth failed to establish that he had been validly arrested\u2014a prerequisite for the admissibility of test results obtained pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2(A). <em>See Bristol v. Commonwealth, </em>272 Va. 568, 636 S.E.2d 460 (2006). After hearing lengthy arguments from both the prosecutor and defense counsel that focused exclusively on whether the arrest requirement of the implied consent statute was satisfied, the court stated, \u201cI\u2019m going to overrule the objection, [and] admit the Certificate of Analysis.\u201d Furthermore, the trial court expressly stated that, in doing so, it relied on <em>Easton v. Commonwealth, </em>No. 2119-04-2, 2005 WL1507103 (Va.Ct.App. Jun.28, 2005), an unpublished opinion of this Court, in making its ruling. In <em>Easton, </em>the appellant challenged the admissibility of her certificate of analysis on the grounds that the requirements of the implied consent statute were not satisfied. This Court disagreed and affirmed her conviction because the certificate was admissible <em>under the implied, consent statute. </em>In admitting the certificate of analysis, the trial court expressly noted that <em>Easton </em>was \u201calmost identical\u201d to the issue before it and then stated \u201cMr. White-stone [counsel for appellant], you have a court reporter here. You can give the Court of Appeals another opportunity to revisit [sic], but <em>in my estimation, they have already </em>decided.\u201d (Emphasis added). This statement by the trial court undoubtedly confirms that it admitted the certificate pursuant to the implied consent statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">The majority excuses any error by the trial court by asserting that appellant did not object specifically on the ground that \u201cCode \u00a7 18.2-268.9 or any other rule of evidence precluded introduction of the certificate of analysis.\u201d Assuming without agreeing that Roseborough\u2019s objection lacked the requisite specificity to put in issue the rationale offered by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>majority, the obvious point that must be made is that he did not have to object on other grounds if the ground upon which he did object had merit. Here, the Commonwealth offered the certificate of analysis into evidence and, in doing so, both proffered a foundation procedurally consistent with the requirements of a breath test taken pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2 and also specifically argued that the test was administered in compliance with the implied consent statute. Appellant then objected to the admission of the certificate based upon his perceived defect in the foundation for admissibility advanced by the Commonwealth. The trial court, after hearing argument from both counsel which focused exclusively on whether or not the foundational requirements for the admissibility of the certificate of analysis had been met <em>pursuant to the implied consent statute, </em>and considering an unpublished decision from this Court which dealt with the very point in issue, admitted the evidence over appellant\u2019s objection. In other words, the context of the decision by the trial court to admit the certificate of analysis as an exhibit was framed by the foundation tendered by the Commonwealth, the objection made by appellant to the sufficiency of that foundation, and the arguments of counsel which dealt with both. The rules of court surely require no more of an advocate in order to preserve the point for appeal than was done here. For these reasons, I disagree with the majority and would reach the merits of the issue of the admissibility of the certificate of analysis as argued and decided in the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Virginia\u2019s implied consent statute, Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2(A), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-6\">Any person, whether licensed by Virginia or not, who operates a motor vehicle upon a highway, as defined in \u00a7 46.2-100, in the Commonwealth shall be deemed thereby, as a condition of such operation, to have consented to have samples of his blood, breath, or both blood and breath taken for a chemical test to determine the alcohol, drug, or both alcohol and drug content of his blood, if he is arrested for violation of \u00a7 18.2-266, 18.2-266.1, or subsection B of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>\u00a7 18.2-272 or of a similar ordinance within three hours of the alleged offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">Thus, the results of a breath test administered pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2(A) are admissible against the accused in a trial for driving under the influence, so long as the accused has first been <em>validly arrested. Durant v. City of Suffolk, </em>4 Va.App. 445, 448, 358 S.E.2d 732, 734 (1987). Appellant argues that the statutory requirements for a valid, warrantless arrest were not satisfied in this instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">Code \u00a7 19.2-81 delineates the circumstances under which an officer may arrest a person without a warrant. For misdemeanors, the general rule is that an officer may not make a warrantless arrest of a person, unless the crime was committed in the officer\u2019s presence. <em>Galliher v. Commonwealth, </em>161 Va. 1014, 1021, 170 S.E. 734, 736 (1933). \u201cAn offense is committed within the presence of an officer, within the meaning of this rule, when he has direct personal knowledge, through his sight, hearing, or other senses that it is then and there being committed.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">The offense for which appellant was arrested is a misdemeanor, and was not committed \u201cwithin the presence\u201d of the officer. The officer arrived at the scene approximately thirty minutes after the accident. He did not observe appellant drive or operate the vehicle in any way. The officer had no \u201cdirect personal knowledge\u201d that an offense was <em>\u201cthen and there </em>being committed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Therefore, appellant\u2019s arrest was invalid unless an exception to the presence requirement of Code \u00a7 19.2-81 applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">\u201c[T]he legislature set forth certain exceptions to the misdemeanor presence rule in Code \u00a7 19.2-81, indicating that a deviation from the presence requirement is authorized only in these limited circumstances.\u201d <em>Penn v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 399, 404, 412 S.E.2d 189, 192 (1991), <em>aff'd, </em>244 Va. 218, 420 S.E.2d 713 (1992). The exception to the presence requirement of Code \u00a7 19.2-81 that concerns the issue before us involves motor vehicle accidents occurring on \u201cany of the <em>highways </em>... <em>of the Commonwealth.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>Pursuant to the statute, \u201csuch officer may, within three hours of the occurrence of any <em>such accident </em>involving a motor vehicle, arrest without a warrant at any location any person whom the officer has probable cause to suspect of driving or operating such motor vehicle while intoxicated in violation of \u00a7 18.2-266.... \u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-81 (emphasis added). Appellant argues that this exception does not apply because the gated roadways of the Watergate at Landmark apartment complex do not constitute a \u201chighway of the Commonwealth\u201d for purposes of Code \u00a7 19.2-81.1 agree.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">This Court has not previously had occasion to construe the phrase \u201chighways of the Commonwealth\u201d in the context of Code \u00a7 19.2-81. \u201cStatutory interpretation presents a pure question of law and is accordingly subject to <em>de novo </em>review____\u201d <em>Washington v. Commonwealth, </em>272 Va. 449, 455, 634 S.E.2d 310, 313 (2006) (citing <em>Ainslie, </em>265 Va. at 352, 577 S.E.2d at 248). \u201c[W]e [the Court] must determine the General Assembly\u2019s intent from the words contained in a statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Commonwealth v. Diaz, </em>266 Va. 260, 264-65, 585 S.E.2d 552, 554 (2003)). \u201c[W]hen a given controversy involves a number of related statutes, they should be read and construed together in order to give full meaning, force, and effect to each.\u201d <em>Ainslie, </em>265 Va. at 353, 577 S.E.2d at 249 (citing <em>Kole, </em>247 Va. at 56, 439 S.E.2d at 408).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">Code \u00a7 19.2-81 provides no express definition of the word \u201chighway.\u201d Consequently, we must look to the plain, commonly understood meaning of the word in order to ascertain the intent of the legislature. <em>See Hulcher v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 601, 605, 575 S.E.2d 579, 581 (2003). Traditionally, a \u201chighway\u201d is considered to be \u201ca road or way on land ... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>that is open to public use as a matter of right whether or not a thoroughfare.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>1069 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Appellant argues that the definition of \u201chighway\u201d contained in Code \u00a7 46.2-100 should be applied to the warrantless arrest requirements of Code \u00a7 19.2-81. However, the introductory paragraph of Code \u00a7 46.2-100 limits the application of that definition stating: \u201cThe following words and phrases when used in this title, <em>for the purpose of this title, </em>have the meanings respectively ascribed to them in this section____\u201d (Emphasis added). Put simply, the definition of highway used in Code \u00a7 46.2-100 is not, by itself, controlling on the issue of whether or not an officer can make a warrantless arrest of a person pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-81. Nevertheless, this definition, though not controlling, is helpful to our analysis as it is illustrative of how \u201chighway\u201d has been interpreted by the courts in other circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">The Supreme Court of Virginia has consistently held that a highway is not limited to public roads. <em>See Furman v. Call, </em>234 Va. 437, 439-40, 362 S.E.2d 709, 711 (1987) (holding that where the evidence was undisputed that the roads around and in a condominium complex were open to the public twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week and the public had never been denied access by guards or gates, the area was a \u201chighway\u201d). \u201c[T]he test for determining whether a way is a \u2018highway\u2019 depends upon the degree to which the way is open to public use for vehicular traffic.\u201d <em>Kay Mgmt. Co. v. Creason, </em>220 Va. 820, 831-32, 263 S.E.2d 394, 401 (1980). \u201cThe public\u2019s free and unrestricted use of a roadway supports the inference that a road is a highway. Evidence that the roadway\u2019s users must obtain either explicit or implicit permission to use the road may refute this inference.\u201d <em>Campbell v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 180, 190, 571 S.E.2d 906, 912 (2002) (citing <em>Kay Mgmt. Co., </em>220 Va. at 832, 263 S.E.2d at 402). It follows that if a roadway were sufficiently restricted so as to prevent its free use by the public for vehicular traffic, the roadway would not constitute a highway for purposes of Code \u00a7 46.2-100. <em>See Caplan v. Bogard, </em>264 Va. 219, 563 S.E.2d 719 (2002) (holding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>that the private parking lot of a restaurant, including its entrance, was not a \u201chighway\u201d pursuant to Code \u00a7 46.2-100); <em>see also Roberts v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 401, 504 S.E.2d 890 (1998) (holding that a convenience store parking lot, which was privately owned and which was only accessible to the public in connection with the owner\u2019s business invitation, was not a \u201chighway\u201d under Code \u00a7 46.2-100).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">In drafting Code \u00a7 19.2-81, the General Assembly was explicit about the type of road to which it was referring with respect to the \u201caccident\u201d exception to the misdemeanor presence requirement. While the definition in Code \u00a7 46.2-100 applies only to \u201chighways,\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-81 uses the language \u201chighways ... of the Commonwealth.\u201d By adding the qualifying language, \u201cof the Commonwealth,\u201d the General Assembly clearly intended to precisely limit the instances to which this exception applies. Thus, if a road does not qualify as a highway under Code \u00a7 46.2-100, it certainly would not qualify as a highway \u201cof the Commonwealth\u201d under Code \u00a7 19.2-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">Clearly, the use of the roadways within the Watergate at Landmark was restricted in such a way as to exclude the general public. The evidence at trial established that the accident in question occurred exclusively within the confines of the apartment complex. Its roadways were not \u201copen to public use for vehicular travel,\u201d <em>Kay Mgmt. Co., </em>220 Va. at 831-32, 263 S.E.2d at 401, nor could they be considered a \u201croad or way on land ... that is open to public use as a matter of right,\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s, supra, </em>at 1069. A security gate controlled access to each of the five entrances to the apartment complex. To gain entry, a person would have to obtain explicit permission from a security guard or use a remote transponder. Additionally, a security guard from the apartment complex testified that the area in question was not open to the public. Because of their restricted nature, the roadways of the Watermark at Landmark do not qualify as a highway under Code \u00a7 46.2-100, and, thus, cannot be \u201chighways of the Commonwealth\u201d for the purposes of Code \u00a7 19.2-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>Because the accident did not occur on a \u201chighway of the Commonwealth,\u201d the statutory exception to Code \u00a7 19.2-81 did not apply, making appellant\u2019s warrantless arrest for driving while intoxicated invalid, as it did not occur in the presence of the arresting officer.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Therefore, the certificate of analysis of appellant\u2019s breath test was not administered pursuant to Virginia\u2019s implied consent statute, and the trial court erred in admitting it into evidence on that basis. For the foregoing reasons, I would reverse appellant\u2019s conviction and remand for a new trial should the Commonwealth be so advised.</p>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b507-6\">. For example, the results of a preliminary breath test, which are always taken voluntarily, are never admissible at trial as evidence of guilt. Code \u00a7 18.2-267(E); <em>see also Stacy v.

The General Assembly has expressly noted that it considers Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-268.2 through 18.2-268.9 as a series of related \"steps.\u201d See Code \u00a7 18.2-268.11 (\"The <em>steps </em>set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-268.2 through 18.2-268.9 relating to taking, handling, identifying, and disposing of blood or breath samples are procedural and not substantive.

While Code \u00a7 19.2-187 deals with the general admissibility of certificates of analyses, Code \u00a7 18.2-268.9 specifically addresses the use of breath-test results as evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b514-8\">. The Commonwealth argues that Code \u00a7 19.2-81\u2019s \u201cat any location\u201d language applies to the location of the accident. That, however, is a misreading of the statute. The words, \"at any location\u201d apply only to where the arrest may occur, not the location of the accident. As appellant correctly notes, the words \u201csuch accident\" refer the reader to prior language in the statute, which indicate that the \"accident\u201d exception to the presence requirement is limited to those that occur \"on any of the highways ... of the Commonwealth.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-81.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b517-5\">.
