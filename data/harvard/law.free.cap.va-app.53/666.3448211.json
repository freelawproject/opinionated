Because he has not properly perfected his appeal, we dismiss it.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-10\">On May 19, 2007, a Virginia Beach police officer arrested Roberson for driving under the influence of alcohol. The officer issued Roberson a summons. On the summons form, there is a line in which the officer must check a box to indicate whether the summons was for a violation of a state statute or city ordinance. The officer checked the box next to \u201cCITY.\u201d The summons form also contains a blank line next to the word \u201cLAW SECTION.\u201d In that blank, the officer wrote \u201c21-1/18.2-266.\u201d 18.2-266 is the section of the Code of Virginia that criminalizes driving under the influence of alcohol. Section 21-1 of the Virginia Beach Municipal Code incorporates Code \u00a7 18.2-266 by reference, criminalizing driving under the influence within the City of Virginia Beach. Later that day, a magistrate issued a warrant of arrest for Roberson charging him with driving under the influence of alcohol. The warrant was titled \u2018WARRANT OF ARREST-MISDEMEANOR (LOCAL).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>Roberson was convicted in the general district court of driving under the influence and immediately appealed to the Virginia Beach circuit court. A trial <em>de novo, </em>pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-136 was held on the warrant before Judge Thomas S. Shadrick on November 1, 2007. At that trial, Jason Miyares, Esq. (\u201cMiyares\u201d), an Assistant Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney, prosecuted the case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On November 5, 2007, Judge Shadrick entered an order convicting Roberson of driving under the influence. The order was styled \u201cCITY OF VIRGINIA BEACH vs. CHAD CRAWFORD ROBERSON.\u201d However, under the heading \u201cCODE SECTION,\u201d the order recited \u201c18.2-266,\u201d the Commonwealth\u2019s driving under the influence statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">Following Roberson\u2019s conviction, his attorney, John D. Hooker, Jr., Esq. (\u201cHooker\u201d), filed a notice of appeal to this Court. Hooker styled the notice of appeal <em>\u201cCommonwealth of Virginia, Plaintiff, v. Chad Crawford Roberson, </em>Defendant.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">We granted Roberson\u2019s petition for appeal, and oral argument for the case was set for January 15, 2009. After the submission of the briefs, but prior to oral argument, the Attorney General, representing the Commonwealth on appeal, moved this Court to grant leave for the trial court to correct a clerical error in the final order. The Assistant Attorney General noted that pursuant to Code \u00a7 2.2-511, the Attorney General has no authority to represent local governments in criminal cases before this Court and sought clarification of the apparent discrepancy in the final order, which styled the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>\u201cCITY OF VIRGINIA BEACH VS. CHAD CRAWFORD ROBERSON,\u201d but indicated that Roberson was convicted under a state statute, Code \u00a7 18.2-266. We granted the Attorney General\u2019s motion and remanded the case to the Circuit Court of the City of Virginia Beach for the sole purpose of making any necessary clerical corrections to the final order.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">On December 15, 2008, Judge Shadrick filed an order (\u201cthe December order\u201d) stating that an order of correction is not necessary. The order explained that Roberson had been charged by the City of Virginia Beach, under a city ordinance. The order explained that Section 21-1 incorporates Code \u00a7 18.2-266 by reference and that Roberson had been \u201ccharged under the City ordinance for his violation of State law.\u201d Thus, the order concluded, the City of Virginia Beach was the proper plaintiff in the case as tried.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">In response to the December order, the Assistant Attorney General sent a letter to this Court, informing us that she would appear before the panel scheduled to hear oral argument in this case to respond to any questions regarding her letter, but could not represent the City of Virginia Beach because the Attorney General\u2019s Office does not have authority over matters related to local ordinances. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 2.2-511. The Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney for the City of Virginia Beach did not appear on behalf of the City of Virginia Beach in connection with this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">On January 15, 2009, Hooker appeared before us for oral argument on the issues granted. Prior to oral argument on the merits of the issues presented, we asked Hooker for his response to the December order of Judge Shadrick. At that time, Hooker displayed a certified copy of an order signed by Chief Judge Frederick Lowe of the Virginia Beach circuit court the previous day on January 14, 2009 (\u201cthe January order\u201d). That order purported to vacate the December order and amend the December order to read \u201cCommonwealth of Virginia vs. Chad Crawford Roberson.\u201d Hooker represented to us that Miyares and an associate from Hooker\u2019s law firm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>appeared at a hearing before Judge Lowe on January 14 and that the January order was the result of that hearing. The Assistant Attorney General represented to us that her office did not receive notice of the hearing until after the order was entered. Hooker claimed that the January order of Judge Lowe vacated the December order of Judge Shadrick, making the Commonwealth a proper party to the appeal. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">Under Rule 1:1, circuit courts lose jurisdiction over cases 21 days after entry of final judgment. <em>See </em>Rule 1:1. Code \u00a7 8.01-428 gives circuit courts the authority to correct clerical errors in a final order after the 21 days has expired. However, \u201c[djuring the pendency of an appeal,\u201d the circuit court may do so only \u201cwith leave of the appellate court.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.01-428. After receiving the December order, neither party requested, nor did we grant, any additional leave for the circuit court to correct clerical errors.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, the Virginia Beach circuit court no longer had jurisdiction over Roberson\u2019s case when Judge Lowe entered the January order. That order is, therefore, null and void, and Judge Shadrick\u2019s December order remains valid.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>The December order clarified that the City of Virginia Beach was the proper plaintiff in the case at trial. Roberson did not join the City of Virginia Beach in his appeal. By failing to join an indispensable party, Roberson has \u201cdeprive[d] us of jurisdiction to consider the appeal.\u201d <em>See Woody v. Commonwealth, </em>58 Va.App. 188, 198, 670 S.E.2d 39, 44 (2008) (\u201c \u2018[A] notice of appeal that entirely omits an indispensable party fails to transfer jurisdiction over that party to the appellate court (quoting <em>Watkins v. Fairfax County Dep\u2019t of Family Services, </em>42 Va.App. 760, 772, 595 S.E.2d 19, 25 (2004))). Because we lack jurisdiction to consider it, we must dismiss Roberson\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">\n<em>Dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b710-6\">. The Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney and his assistants have the primary responsibility to prosecute violations of city ordinances that carry the potential of jail time or a fine of $500 or more. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 15.2-1627 (\"The attorney for the Commonwealth ... may in his discretion, prosecute Class 1, 2 and 3 misdemeanors, or any other violation, the conviction of which carries a penalty of confinement in jail, or a fine of $500 or more, or both such confinement and fine.\u201d). City and town attorneys may do so only if authorized to do so by their local governing bodies and with the concurrence of the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 15.2-1542(D).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b710-7\">. All documents filed by Hooker in this Court have been styled <em>\u201cChad Crawford Roberson v. Commonwealth of Virginia.\"</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b712-5\">. In entering this order, we note that Judge Lowe could not have had access to the circuit court\u2019s file in this case as it had been transmitted to this Court pursuant to Rule 5A:10 of the Rules of the Supreme Court of Virginia. Moreover, the January order, entered by Judge Lowe, does not actually correct any clerical error. Instead it states that, \"upon reconsideration ... the court\u2019s order of December 15, 2008 is hereby vacated.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b712-6\">. We also note that, if, as Hooker maintains, the Commonwealth was a proper party in this case, one consequence would be that Hooker placed Judge Lowe in the position of arguably conducting an <em>ex parte </em>hearing. At the time of the hearing, the case was pending in this Court and in fact scheduled for oral argument before this panel the next day. As already noted, Code \u00a7 2.2-511 provides that the Attorney General, not the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney, represents the Commonwealth in all criminal appeals in which this Court has granted a petition for appeal, and indeed, the Attorney General had already participated on behalf of the Commonwealth in this case. If Hooker believed that the Commonwealth was a party to the appeal, he was, at a minimum, obliged to notify the Attorney General\u2019s office of the hearing rather than the Assistant Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney. <em>See </em>Rule of Professional Conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>3.5(e); <em>see also, </em>Canons of Judicial Conduct, 3(B)(7) (\"A judge shall accord to every person who has a legal interest in a proceeding, or that person\u2019s lawyer, the right to be heard according to law. A judge shall not initiate, permit, or consider <em>ex parte </em>communications, or consider other communications made to the judge outside the presence of the parties concerning a pending or impending proceeding.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
