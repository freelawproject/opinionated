On appeal, husband contends that the circuit court erred in ruling that a consent decree incorporating an agreement between Ophelia Keeling Brown (\u201cwife\u201d) and him qualified as a \u201cstipulation or contract\u201d under Code \u00a7 20-109(C). Husband asserts that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>consent decree merely resolved a show cause petition and did not \u201cpurport to modify the amount of spousal support ordered\u201d in the final decree of divorce. Thus, husband argues that his spousal support obligation remained modifiable for a material change in circumstance. For the reasons that follow, we agree with husband and reverse the ruling of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">I. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">\u201cOn appeal, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to the appellee.\u201d <em>Pinkard v. Pinkard, </em>12 Va.App. 848, 850, 407 S.E.2d 339, 340 (1991). \u201cThat principle requires us to discard the evidence of the appellant which conflicts, either directly or inferentially, with the evidence presented by the appellee at trial.\u201d <em>Congdon v. Congdon, </em>40 Va.App. 255, 258, 578 S.E.2d 833, 835 (2003). So viewed, the evidence was as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">After nearly thirty-four years of marriage, husband and wife were divorced by entry of a final decree of divorce on March 22, 2004.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In the final decree, husband was ordered to pay wife \u201cas and for spousal support the sum of $1,250.00 per month, payable on the 1st of each month, commencing August 1, 2003, and continuing on the 1st of each and every month thereafter.\u201d Because the circuit court made husband\u2019s spousal support obligation retroactive to August 1, 2003, he was considerably behind in his spousal support payments at the time the final decree was entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">On April 24, 2004, wife filed a show cause petition in the Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court for the City of Norfolk (\u201cthe JDR court\u201d) for husband\u2019s failure to pay $11,250 in spousal support pursuant to the final decree of divorce. Prior to the hearing, husband and wife reached an agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>that resolved the pending show cause petition. Under the terms of this agreement, husband would pay wife $500 towards the support arrears on June 30, 2004, $1,000 on the thirtieth of July, August, September, October, and November, and finally, $5,750 on December 30, 2004. The agreement also provided that husband was to pay wife $1,250 \u201cas spousal support\u201d on the thirtieth of each month commencing June 30, 2004, \u201cand continuing each month thereafter.\u201d On May 24, 2004, the agreement resolving the show cause petition was incorporated into a court order (\u201cthe Order\u201d) that was prepared by wife\u2019s counsel and signed by husband \u201cseen and agreed.\u201d Husband was <em>pro se </em>at the time the Order was entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">On April 17, 2007, husband sought to retire and filed a motion to terminate spousal support due to a material change in circumstance. On May 7, 2007, wife filed a motion in the JDR court to dismiss husband\u2019s petition. When the JDR court granted wife\u2019s motion to dismiss, husband appealed to the circuit court. In a letter opinion dated January 7, 2008, the circuit court granted wife\u2019s motion and dismissed husband\u2019s petition. The circuit court found that the Order was a \u201cconsent decree, which has a binding legal effect on the parties and may not be modified or terminated at the unilateral request of one party.\u201d The circuit court further found that the Order \u201cqualifies as a stipulation or contract under Code \u00a7 20-109(C) ... which incorporates the agreement of the parties [and] does not state that spousal support may be modified or terminated due to a material change in circumstance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">II. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">Code \u00a7 20-109 allows a court to decrease a spousal support award \u201c \u2018[u]pon petition of either party,\u2019 \u201d if the moving party is able to prove \u201c\u2018both a material change in circumstances and that this change warrants a modification of support.\u2019 \u201d <em>Furr v. Furr, </em>13 Va.App. 479, 481, 413 S.E.2d 72, 73 (1992) (quoting <em>Schoenwetter v. Schoenwetter, </em>8 Va.App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>601, 605, 388 S.E.2d 28, 30 (1989)). However, Code \u00a7 20-109(C) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-4\">In suits for divorce, annulment and separate maintenance, and in proceedings arising under subdivision A 3 or subsection L of \u00a7 16.1-241, if a stipulation or contract signed by the party to whom such relief might otherwise be awarded is filed before entry of a final decree, no decree or order directing the payment of support and maintenance for the spouse, suit money, or counsel fee or establishing or imposing any other condition or consideration, monetary or non-monetary, shall be entered except in accordance with that stipulation or contract. If such a stipulation or contract is filed after the entry of a final decree and if any party so moves, the court shall modify its decree to conform to such stipulation or contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">Not every agreement that impacts or affects the payment of spousal support, particularly of a spousal support arrearage, is necessarily a contract subject to the limitations of Code \u00a7 20-109(C). As the first sentence of the subsection states, it only applies \u201c[i]n suits for divorce, annulment and separate maintenance, and in proceedings arising under subdivision A 3 or subsection L of \u00a7 16.1-241____\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Code \u00a7 20-109(C). Simply put, \u201cCode \u00a7 20-109(C) expressly limits the court\u2019s authority to modify an agreed upon spousal support award according to the terms of a stipulation or contract signed by the parties.\u201d <em>Blackburn v. Michael, </em>30 Va.App. 95, 100, 515 S.E.2d 780, 783 (1999). This case requires us to determine whether a consent decree resolving a show cause petition constituted an agreement to modify spousal support, thereby making the consent decree subject to the limitations imposed by Code \u00a7 20-109(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>\u201cWe apply ordinary principles of contract law when construing a \u2018stipulation or contract\u2019 under Code \u00a7 20-109(C).\u201d <em>Newman v. Newman, </em>42 Va.App. 557, 568, 593 S.E.2d 533, 539 (2004) <em>(en banc). </em>Although a consent decree is \u201c[a] court decree that all parties agree to,\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>441 (8th ed.2004), \u201c \u2018it is contractual in its nature and should be construed as though it were a contract.\u2019\u201d <em>Newman, </em>42 Va.App. at 568, 593 S.E.2d at 539 (quoting <em>Gazale v. Gazale, </em>219 Va. 775, 779, 250 S.E.2d 365, 367 (1979)). Consequently, a consent decree may properly \u201cconstitute a \u2018stipulation or contract\u2019 under Code \u00a7 20-109(C).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 563, 593 S.E.2d at 536. However, \u201c[a]s with all contractual instruments, the party asserting the existence of an agreement bears the burden of persuasion to prove its existence.\u201d <em>Baldwin v. Baldwin, </em>44 Va.App. 93, 99 n. 1, 603 S.E.2d 172, 174 n. 1 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">In <em>Newman, </em>this Court held that \u201c[a]bsent equitable grounds warranting rescission, a contract cannot be judicially modified or terminated at the unilateral request of a contract party unless the agreement expressly authorizes such relief. The same is true for a consent decree.\u201d 42 Va.App. at 568-69, 593 S.E.2d at 539. However, in <em>Baldwin, </em>we further clarified that \u201c[u]nder <em>Newman, </em>a decree does not attain contractual character purely by virtue of its consensual entry. One can consent to the entry of an order without entering into a binding bilateral agreement.\u201d 44 Va.App. at 99 n. 1, 603 S.E.2d at 174 n. 1. A review of the facts of <em>Newman </em>is helpful to our analysis of whether the Order constituted a binding bilateral agreement to modify husband\u2019s spousal support obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">The consent decree at issue in <em>Newman </em>arose from a dispute over the amount of spousal support the husband was to pay to his wife. In that case, the husband filed a motion to modify both spousal and child support due to a material change in circumstance. <em>Newman, </em>42 Va.App. at 561, 593 S.E.2d at 535. The wife opposed the motion. <em>Id. </em>Prior to its disposition, husband and wife reached an agreement resolving their spousal support dispute. \u201cThe parties presented to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>trial judge an agreed order stating, in its first sentence, that they appeared \u2018by counsel' and that \u2018all matters in dispute are settled and agreed.'\" <em>Id. </em>In addition, \u201cthe parties ... reaffirmed in open court (at trial and on appeal) the contractual character of the decree.\u201d <em>Baldwin, </em>44 Va.App. at 99 n. 1, 603 S.E.2d at 174 n. 1 (discussing the facts of <em>Neuman).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">A few months later, the husband filed another motion to modify his spousal support obligation due to a material change in circumstance. <em>Newman, </em>42 Va.App. at 561, 593 S.E.2d at 535-36. However, the circuit court denied the motion. This Court affirmed holding that, because the final consent decree did not expressly retain the ability to be modified, husband\u2019s spousal support obligation could not be modified for a material change in circumstance pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-109(C). <em>Id. </em>at 571, 593 S.E.2d at 540. Furthermore, the wife met her burden to prove the existence of a contract under Code \u00a7 20-109(C), \u201cbecause the final consent decree stated that \u2018all matters in dispute' were \u2018settled and agreed' and then recited verbatim the terms of the parties\u2019 agreement on permanent spousal support.\u201d <em>Baldwin, 44 </em>Va.App. at 99 n. 1, 603 S.E.2d at 174 n. 1 (quoting <em>Newman, </em>42 Va.App. at 561, 593 S.E.2d at 535).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">In this case, wife argues that, like the wife in <em>Newman, </em>she met her burden to prove the existence of a contract under Code \u00a7 20-109(C). We disagree. Absent express language to the contrary, the intent of the parties in forming a contract may be inferred from the circumstances in which the contract was created. <em>See Black v. Powers, </em>48 Va.App. 113, 130, 628 S.E.2d 546, 555 (2006). Unlike <em>Newman, </em>the Order here was created in the context of a show cause petition, not a motion to modify spousal support. The first sentence of the Order states \u201cTHIS DAY came the parties on [-wife\u2019s] Show Cause for failure of [husband] to pay spousal support.\u201d From the face of the Order it is clear that the dispute between husband and wife, which was to be resolved by the Order, did not concern the <em>amount </em>of spousal support husband was to pay to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>wife, as in <em>Newman, </em>but rather concerned the <em>manner </em>in which husband would pay back his support arrears.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">In further contrast to the situation in <em>Newman, </em>the Order does not purport to resolve all issues between the parties. In <em>Newman, </em>the first sentence of the consent decree provided that \u201call matters in dispute are settled and agreed.\u201d 42 Va.App. at 561, 593 S.E.2d at 535. The Order in the case at bar, however, contains only the language \u201cseen and agreed.\u201d At most, this language indicates husband\u2019s intent to resolve the show cause petition, it being the only matter in dispute between the parties at that time. Thus, given the context in which it was created and the language used in its drafting, it is clear that the Order was limited to resolving the show cause petition and was not intended to modify husband\u2019s spousal support obligation in the final decree of divorce.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">We have previously held that \u201c[wjhere the court\u2019s decree does not expressly or by necessity supplant the provisions of the former decree incorporating the agreement or <em>where the two are not incompatible, </em>the valid provisions of both decrees will be enforced.\u201d <em>Schmidt v. Schmidt, </em>6 Va.App. 501, 505, 370 S.E.2d 311, 314 (1988) (emphasis added). Nowhere in the Order did the parties express their intention to modify or supplant the provision in the final decree of divorce concerning husband\u2019s spousal support obligation. Nor are the two provisions incompatible. Each requires husband to make a monthly payment to wife of $1,250, \u201cas spousal support.\u201d In fact, the only difference between the two provisions is the timing of that payment. Thus, the Order and the final decree of divorce should be read together with the final decree setting forth the amount of husband\u2019s monthly spousal support payment and the Order establishing the date of that payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>III. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b773-4\">In conclusion, we hold that the Order was not a contract that modified husband\u2019s spousal support obligation within the meaning of Code \u00a7 20-109(C). The Order merely resolved the show cause petition and did not modify the spousal support obligation in the final decree of divorce. Therefore, husband\u2019s spousal support obligation remained modifiable for a material change in circumstance, and we reverse the ruling of the circuit court and remand for further proceedings on husband\u2019s petition to terminate spousal support consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b767-9\">. Husband appealed from the judgment of the circuit court granting a final decree of divorce and awarding spousal support and attorneys\u2019 fees to wife. In an unpublished opinion, we affirmed the judgment of the circuit court. <em>See Brown v. Brown, </em>No. 1001-04-1 (Va.Ct.App. Nov.2, 2004). The parties did not have a property settlement agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b769-8\">. Code \u00a7 16.1-241(A)(3) concerns proceedings involving \u2018\u2018[t]he custody visitation, support, control or disposition of a child ... [w]hose custody, visitation, or support is a subject of controversy or requires determination.\u201d Code \u00a7 16.1-241(L) concerns proceedings involving \"[a]ny person who seeks spousal support after having been separated from his spouse.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b772-7\">. If the parties had truly intended to modify husband\u2019s spousal support obligation, in the final decree of divorce, one would expect that they would have moved the court to incorporate the consent decree into the final decree of divorce. Under Code \u00a7 20-109(C), the circuit court would have been required to grant any such motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
