On appeal, he argues the marijuana was obtained during an illegal search and seizure in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights. Because Arrington failed to challenge the admissibility of the evidence obtained in the seizure, he is procedurally barred from raising this issue pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-266.2 and Rule 5A:18.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-9\">I. BACKGROUND<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b679-10\">On appeal, we review the evidence in the \u201clight most favorable\u201d to the Commonwealth. <em>Commonwealth v. Hudson, </em>265 Va. 505, 514, 578 S.E.2d 781, 786 (2008) (citation omitted). That principle requires us to \u201c\u2018discard the evidence of the accused in conflict with that of the Commonwealth, and regard as true all the credible evidence favorable to the Commonwealth and all fair inferences that may be drawn therefrom.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kelly v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 250, 254, 584 S.E.2d 444, 446 (2003) <em>(en </em>banc) (quoting <em>Watkins v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 335, 348, 494 S.E.2d 859, 866 (1998)). <em>See also Bolden v. Commonwealth, </em>275 Va. 144, 147-48, 654 S.E.2d 584, 586 (2008); <em>Molina v. Commonwealth, </em>272 Va. 666, 671, 636 S.E.2d 470, 473 (2006); <em>Viney v. Commonwealth, </em>269 Va. 296, 299, 609 S.E.2d 26, 28 (2005); <em>Walton v. Commonwealth, </em>255 Va. 422, 425-26, 497 S.E.2d 869, 871 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-11\">Officer Frank Curott of the Norfolk Police Department stopped Arrington when he observed Arrington riding a mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>torized toy in the street in a \u201chigh drug\u201d area of Norfolk. Officer Curott asked Arrington if he had a driver\u2019s license, and Arrington replied that he did not. The officer performed a warrant check and began to issue Arrington a summons for riding a toy in the street, in violation of a Norfolk City ordinance, when Arrington\u2019s cell phone rang. As Arrington spoke to the caller, he began furtively waving his arms in the air and looking around. Officer Curott had the impression Arrington was getting ready to run and asked him to end the phone call. Arrington did not comply, and Officer Curott handcuffed him and conducted a pat-down search. When he did so, Officer Curott felt a golf-ball sized bulge in Arrington\u2019s right front pants pocket. Officer Curott removed the object, which was later determined to be marijuana wrapped in plastic.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">Arrington did not file a pretrial motion to suppress the evidence obtained in the seizure and did not object during the Commonwealth\u2019s case to the admissibility of the evidence seized. After the Commonwealth presented its evidence at the bench trial, Arrington moved to strike the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence on the ground that the search was illegal because the officer \u201clacked probable cause to seize [Arrington] and pat him down.\u201d The trial court overruled the motion. At the conclusion of the evidence, Arrington renewed his motion to strike on the basis that the \u201csearch was illegal\u201d since there was no \u201cprobable cause to stop [him].\u201d He further argued that \u201ceven if there was probable cause to stop [him],\u201d there was \u201cno reasonable suspicion to search [him].\u201d The trial court overruled the motion and convicted Arrington of misdemeanor possession of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">Arrington maintains the marijuana discovered by Officer Curott was the product of an illegal search and seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The proper vehicle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>for enforcement of the privacy rights guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment is through suppression of the evidence obtained during an illegal search and seizure. <em>Mapp v. Ohio, </em>367 U.S. 643, 655, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 1691-92, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081 (1961). Thus, \u201cthe issue is not the abstract propriety of the police conduct, but the admissibility against [the defendant] of the evidence uncovered by the search and seizure.\u201d <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 12, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 1875, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968); <em>see id. </em>at 13, 88 S.Ct. at 1875-76 (\u201c[E]videntiary rulings provide the context in which the judicial process of inclusion and exclusion approves some conduct as comporting with constitutional guarantees and disapproves other actions by state agents.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-266.2, \u201c[d]efense motions or objections,seeking ... suppression of evidence on the grounds such evidence was obtained in violation of the ... Fourth ... Amendment ] to the Constitution ... shall be raised by motion or objection.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-266.2(A)(i). This section further provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-6\">Such a motion or objection in a proceeding in circuit court shall be raised in writing, before trial. The motions or objections shall be filed and notice given to opposing counsel not later than seven days before trial____A hearing on all such motions or objections shall be held not later than three days prior to trial in circuit court, unless such period is waived by the accused, as set by the trial judge. The circuit court may, however, for good cause shown and in the interest of justice, permit the motions or objections to be raised at a later time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-9\">Code \u00a7 19.2-266.2(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-10\">\u201cThe plain language of Code \u00a7 19.2-266.2 requires that a defendant seeking to suppress evidence based on a violation of his Fourth Amendment rights must file a suppression motion no later than seven days before trial, absent \u2018good <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>cause shown and in the interest of justice.\u2019\u201d <em>Upchurch v. Commonwealth, </em>81 Va.App. 48, 51, 521 S.E.2d 290, 291-92 (1999). \u201cFailure to follow this statutory requirement results in a waiver of an accused\u2019s constitutional challenge to the admissibility of the evidence.\u201d <em>Magruder v. Commonwealth, </em>275 Va. 283, 300, 657 S.E.2d 113, 122 (2008). <em>See, e.g., Schmitt v. Commonwealth, </em>262 Va. 127, 146, 547 S.E.2d 186, 199 (2001) (argument regarding admissibility of tape recording waived because appellant failed to comply with statutory requirements of Code \u00a7 19.2-266.2), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 1094, 122 S.Ct. 840, 151 L.Ed.2d 719 (2002); <em>Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 634, 644-45, 561 S.E.2d 1, 6 (2002) (constitutionality of a code section not preserved for appeal because appellant failed to comply with Code \u00a7 19.2-266.2); <em>Morrison v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 273, 279, 557 S.E.2d 724, 727 (2002) (Court refusing to address constitutional challenge to statute where defendant failed to comply with Code \u00a7 19.2-266.2). The filing and notice requirements of Code \u00a7 19.2-266.2 \u201c \u2018serve[ ] legitimate state interests in protecting against surprise, harassment, and undue delay.\u2019 \u201d <em>Magruder, </em>275 Va. at 300, 657 S.E.2d at 122 (quoting <em>Michigan v. Lucas, </em>500 U.S. 145, 152-53, 111 S.Ct. 1743, 1747-49, 114 L.Ed.2d 205 (1991)).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Arrington failed to file a motion to suppress the evidence seized by Officer Curott in accordance with the requirements of Code \u00a7 19.2-266.2.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Therefore, he waived his right to chal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>lenge its admissibility.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">In addition to his noncompliance with Code \u00a7 19.2-266.2 requiring a pretrial motion to suppress the evidence, Arrington failed to object to the admissibility of the evidence at trial. <em>See Bitar v. Rahman, </em>272 Va. 130, 139, 630 S.E.2d 319, 324 (2006) (An objection to admissibility of evidence must be made when the evidence is presented.). Arrington was required to challenge the admissibility of the evidence in the trial court to preserve his argument on appeal that the evidence was unlawfully seized. <em>See </em>Rule 5A:18.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Applying Rule 5A:18, we have held \u201cthis Court \u2018will not consider an argument on appeal [that] was not presented to the trial court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Farnsworth v. Commonwealth, </em>43 Va.App. 490, 500, 599 S.E.2d 482, 487 (2004) (quoting <em>Ohree v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 299, 308, 494 S.E.2d 484, 488 (1998)). \u201c \u2018Rule 5A:18 applies to bar even constitutional claims.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Ohree, </em>26 Va.App. at 308, 494 S.E.2d at 488). \u201cThe purpose of [this] rule is to ensure that the trial court and opposing party are given the opportunity to intelligently address, examine, and resolve issues in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>trial court, thus avoiding unnecessary appeals.\u201d <em>Andrews v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 479, 493, 559 S.E.2d 401, 408 (2002). By failing to object to the evidence obtained in the seizure, Arrington deprived the trial court of the opportunity to consider the admissibility of the evidence, thus waiving his argument on appeal.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">Arrington concedes he did not file a motion to suppress the evidence or object to the admission of the evidence at trial but contends he \u201cessentially\u201d moved to suppress the evidence when he moved to strike the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence. The record does not show Arrington challenged the admissibility of the evidence at any time, including during his motion to strike. Nevertheless, \u201c[a] litigant may not, in a motion to strike [the evidence], raise for the first time a question of admissibility of evidence. Such motions deal with the sufficiency rather than the admissibility of evidence.\u201d <em>Woodson v. Commonwealth, </em>211 Va. 285, 288, 176 S.E.2d 818, 821 (1970); <em>see also Poole v. Commonwealth, </em>211 Va. 258, 260, 176 S.E.2d 821, 823 (1970); <em>McCary v. Commonwealth, </em>36 Va.App. 27, 40, 548 S.E.2d 239, 245 (2001) (\u201c[A] motion to strike properly challenges only the sufficiency of the evidence offered up to that point, not the underlying admissibility of the evidence.\u201d).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201cThe question [Arrington] sought to raise by his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>motion-whether [the search was] illegal ... was purely a question of admissibility of evidence.\u201d <em>Poole, </em>211 Va. at 260, 176 S.E.2d at 823. And that question could not be raised in the context of Arrington\u2019s motion to strike. <em>Woodson, </em>211 Va. at 288-89, 176 S.E.2d at 821.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">Because Arrington failed to file a motion to suppress pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-266.2 or otherwise object to the admissibility of the evidence as required by Rule 5A.-18, he waived his argument that such evidence was seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b679-12\">. The facts and proceedings are derived from a statement of facts that was filed in lieu of a transcript.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b680-8\">. The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees that \"the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated....\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b682-5\">. In a felony case, the requirements of Code \u00a7 19.2-266.2 also serve to preserve the Commonwealth's right to appeal a trial court's ruling prohibiting the use of evidence allegedly obtained in violation of the Constitution. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-398(A)(2); <em>Upchurch, </em>31 Va.App. at 53, 521 S.E.2d at 293. But the requirements of Code \u00a7 19.2-266.2 are not limited to felony cases, <em>see, e.g, Johnson, </em>37 Va.App. at 644-45, 561 S.E.2d at 6. Allowing defendants to challenge the constitutionality of a search after evidence has been admitted without objection would effectively require the Commonwealth to present all of its evidence regarding the circumstances surrounding a seizure to develop a record even though no motion to suppress was ever filed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b682-6\">. Although the trial court may permit a motion to suppress or objection to the evidence at a <em>later time </em>for good cause shown, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-266.2, since Arrington did not make a motion to suppress the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number><em>at any time </em>before or during the trial or object to its admission, the good cause exception for an <em>untimely filing </em>has no application.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b683-7\">. Arrington contends the Commonwealth failed to object to his \"untimely\u201d motion to suppress thereby waiving its argument that Arrington failed to comply with Code \u00a7 19.2-266.2. Arrington relies on <em>Sykes </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 262, 266 n. 1, 556 S.E.2d 794, 796 n. 1 (2001), where the defendant moved at trial to suppress evidence obtained during a search. Addressing the merits of the motion to suppress, the Court noted the Commonwealth did not argue the motion was inappropriate under Code \u00a7 19.2-266.2. But the Court did not address whether defendant complied with the statute, whether the good cause exception applied to the motion, or whether the Commonwealth waived an objection to the motion. More importantly, the defendant in <em>Sykes did </em>move to suppress the evidence unlike Arrington who <em>did not </em>make a motion to suppress. Since Arrington failed to make a motion to suppress, he cannot now complain that the Commonwealth failed to object to a motion that was never made.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b683-8\">. Rule 5A:18 provides that \"[n]o ruling of the trial court ... will be considered as a basis for reversal unless the objection was stated together with the grounds therefor at the time of the ruling, except for good cause shown or to enable the Court of Appeals to attain the ends of justice.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b684-6\">. Arrington does not assert any exception to Rule 5A:18, and we will not invoke one <em>sua sponte. See Edwards v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 752, 761, 589 S.E.2d 444, 448 (2003) <em>(en banc), aff'd by unpublished order, </em>No. 040019 (Va. Oct. 15, 2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b684-7\">. To be sure, a motion to strike can never be a proper vehicle to argue suppression of illegally obtained evidence since the questions of legal sufficiency and constitutional compliance are fundamentally different questions requiring different analyses. <em>Compare Crawford v. Commonwealth, </em>53 Va.App. 138, 156, 670 S.E.2d 15, 24 (2008) (\" \u2018[In determining legal sufficiency of the evidence presented,] we consider <em>all </em>admitted evidence,\u2019 without regard for whether it was properly admitted or is likely to be admitted in any subsequent retrial.\u201d (quoting <em>Hargraves v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 299, 312-13, 557 S.E.2d 737, 743 (2002)) (emphasis added)), <em>with Shiflett v. Commonwealth, </em>47 Va.App. 141, 145-46, 622 S.E.2d 758, 760 (2005) (After giving deference to the factual findings of the trial court, we \"independently decide whether, under the applicable law, the manner in which the challenged evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>was obtained satisfies constitutional requirements.\u201d (quoting <em>Jackson v. Commonwealth, </em>267 Va. 666, 673, 594 S.E.2d 595, 598 (2004))).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b685-16\">. Indeed, until this Court instructed counsel to submit supplemental briefs on whether a motion to strike alleging an unconstitutional search is sufficient to preserve the issue of whether the evidence should have been excluded, Arrington failed to recognize the issue was one of admissibility of the evidence rather than its sufficiency.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
