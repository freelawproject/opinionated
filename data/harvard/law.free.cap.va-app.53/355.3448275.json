Humphreys, on her change-in-condition application. The school board argues the commission erred in rejecting the school board\u2019s statute of limitations defense. For the following reasons, we affirm the decision of the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">On March 12, 2003, Humphreys, a teacher for the school board, was injured at work when a table fell on her leg, causing an abrasion. The injury developed into an ulceration. Humphreys missed a total of nine and a half days of work for related medical appointments. Subsequently, she filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim seeking indemnification for lost wages and medical benefits. The parties stipulated to the compensability of her injury and medical treatment (excluding pain management). However, among its defenses, the school board asserted Humphreys suffered no actual wage loss because she took sick leave for the nine and a half days of work she missed for her medical appointments, and received full pay for each of those days.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">In his May 17, 2005 opinion, the deputy commissioner found, <em>inter alia, </em>that Humphreys did not lose any actual wages, but lost sick leave due to her injury. He then awarded her \u201creimbursement of sick leave used to date for medical appointments related to her industrial accident,\u201d and medical benefits \u201cfor as long as necessary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">The school board appealed to the full commission that portion of the deputy commissioner\u2019s opinion awarding reimbursement of sick leave, asserting the commission had no jurisdiction to make such an award. While the appeal was pending, the parties agreed to a settlement entered in the form of a stipulated order by the deputy commissioner on August 22, 2005, which modified his May 17, 2005 award and ended the appeal. The parties stipulated in the order as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-8\">1. The [ejmployer\u2019s appeal is withdrawn.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>2. The May 17, 2005[o]rder of the [d]eputy [cjommissioner is modified as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-4\">a. The parties agree that the [claimant has not exhausted the waiting period for payment of indemnity of the first seven days, and therefore those days are not yet payable.[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>] In the event they do become payable, the parties agree to re-instate sick time at a rate of .75 days in exchange for each day payable, but only in multiples of one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-5\">b. For the remaining days lost, the parties agree that the [e]mployer shall only be responsible for the reinstatement of two days sick time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">It is undisputed that the parties \u201cabided by this agreement.\u201d On March 1, 2006, Humphreys filed an application for benefits based on a change in condition. She sought an award of temporary total disability benefits for work missed on February 8, 2006 to attend a medical appointment related to her original compensable injury. She later amended the application to include six additional days of missed work due to medical appointments. In defending the claim, the school board contended, <em>inter alia, </em>that the claim was barred by the two-year statute of limitations for change-in-condition applications, as set forth in Code \u00a7 65.2-708.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The deputy commissioner rejected the school board\u2019s defenses and awarded payment of compensation to Humphreys for the seven days at issue (within a time frame of February 2006 to May 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">The school board appealed the decision to the full commission, continuing to argue Humphreys\u2019 change-in-condition ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>plication was time-barred under Code \u00a7 65.2-708. The school board asserted that no compensation was awarded under the original May 17, 2005 award\u2014only medical benefits, and, thus, the limitations period expired two years from the date of the March 12, 2003 accident\u2014long before Humphreys\u2019 subsequent March 1, 2006 claim based on an alleged change in condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">The commission determined that Humphreys\u2019 March 1, 2006 change-in-condition application was not barred by the Code \u00a7 65.2-708 two-year statute of limitations, but reached that decision only after re-evaluating the basis for the deputy commissioner\u2019s May 17, 2005 award on Humphreys\u2019 original claim. As the commission explained, \u201c[t]his decision is complicated by the fact that the [d]eputy Commissioner\u2019s May 17, 2005[a]ward was improper.\u201d In that award, the deputy commissioner ordered \u201creimbursement\u201d of Humphreys\u2019 sick leave used for medical appointments, which \u201cexceed[ed] the Commission\u2019s statutory authority.\u201d However, according to the commission, it was \u201cobvious\u201d the deputy commissioner \u201cintended to award temporary total disability benefits but mistakenly entered the wrong award.\u201d The commission then reasoned that the award was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-5\">the equivalent of an award for temporary total disability benefits with a credit to the employer for the sick pay that was reinstated. Thus, we will utilize our equitable powers grounded in the doctrine of imposition to correct this mistake and enter the proper award for nine days of disability. The May 17, 2005[a]ward [o]rder is hereby amended, in relevant part, for payment of temporary disability benefits for [the nine days in March, April and May 2003 when Humphreys missed work for medical appointments].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">\u201cWhile these amendments change the form of the [a]ward entered by the [d]eputy Commissioner,\u201d the commission stated, they do not \u201cchange the substance or effect of the award order. Accordingly, we find that the present claim was filed within two years from the last day for which compensation benefits were awarded [as required by Code \u00a7 65.2-708].\u201d That is, the commission concluded that Humphreys filed her change-in-condition application within two years from the date <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>of the final order on her original claim, affirming the deputy commission\u2019s opinion and then remanding for a determination of Humphreys\u2019 pre-injury average weekly wage.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">The school board argues the commission had no authority to award benefits to Humphreys on her change-in-condition application in light of the deputy commissioner\u2019s May 17, 2005 \u201cmedical benefits only\u201d award and the parties\u2019 stipulated order, which became final. According to the school board, the commission did so only by \u201cchanging] the nature of the case and remov[ing] a statute of limitations bar.\u201d In other words, the commission \u201c[did] not have authority to unilaterally change either a final [o]rder or a [stipulated [o]rder eighteen months after its entry\u201d on the basis of the doctrine of imposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">While recognizing that upon a change-in-condition application the commission, pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.2-708, may increase the compensation previously awarded within two years from the last day for which compensation was paid, the school board contends \u201cno compensation benefits were ever paid\u201d to Humphreys under the deputy commissioner\u2019s May 17, 2005 award on her original claim. Rather, it was a \u201cmedical benefits only\u201d award. Thus, the school board argues, Humphreys\u2019 application for compensation, filed more than two years from the date of her compensable injury, was time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">The school board correctly asserts that, where the commission has entered a \u201cmedical benefits only\u201d award for a compensable injury, any subsequent claim for compensation (i.e., lost wages) arising from that injury must be filed within two years from the date of the injury. <em>See Keith v. Ball Metal Beverage Container, </em>45 Va.App. 50, 608 S.E.2d 501 (2005); <em>Mayberry v. Alcoa Bldg. Prods., </em>18 Va.App. 18, 441 S.E.2d 349 (1994). And, here, at the time of its execution, the deputy commissioner\u2019s May 17, 2005 award provided only medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>benefits, as the deputy commissioner\u2019s attempt at awarding reinstatement of Humphreys\u2019 sick leave was erroneous.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">We conclude, however, that under the parties\u2019 stipulated order, which modified the deputy commissioner\u2019s award and settled the dispute over Humphreys\u2019 original claim,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> a portion of Humphreys\u2019 salary was treated as payment of compensation for lost wages under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (the \u201cAct\u201d). The parties agreed that the nine and a half days Humphreys missed for medical appointments were, in fact, compensable under the Act, subject to the Code \u00a7 65.2-509 seven-day waiting period, that Humphreys\u2019 last two and a half days of sick leave were currently due and payable, and that a portion of Humphreys\u2019 salary for those last two and a half days of sick leave was to be treated as the payment of workers\u2019 compensation benefits. We thus hold that Humphreys\u2019 change-in-condition application was not barred by the applicable two-year statute of limitations, and affirm the commission\u2019s ruling to that effect, but on grounds other than the doctrine of imposition.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b404-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>Despite the import of the terms of the parties\u2019 stipulated order, the school board contends on appeal that, as a matter of law, the payment of wages to Humphreys could not subsequently be deemed payment of compensation to her under the Act. We disagree. Code \u00a7 65.2-520 states, in relevant part, that \u201c[a]ny payment made by the employer to the injured employee during the period of disability ... which by the terms of this title were not due and payable when made, may, subject to the approval of the Commission, be deducted from the amount to be paid as <em>compensation </em>____\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">While the Virginia appellate courts have not addressed Code \u00a7 65.2-520 in the context here presented in a published decision, the commission, in applying this statute, has consistently held, at least since 1988, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AtA\">the payment of wages to the employee based upon sick or annual leave may be credited to the employer under the provisions of Code \u00a7 65.1-72 [now Code \u00a7 65.2-520] when leave is reinstated. In the absence of an outstanding award of compensation, <em>salary paid to the employee during his disability may be considered to be payment of compensation </em>in the discretion of the Industrial Commission for purposes of \u201ccredit\u201d under Code \u00a7 65.1-72.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-7\"><em>Dyson v. Commonwealth, </em>VWC File No. 129-25-08, 1988 VA Wrk. Comp. LEXIS 68, at *3 (Oct. 11,1988) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">As the commission more recently stated in <em>Myers v. City of Danville Police, </em>VWC File No. 179-46-44, 1998 VA Wrk. Comp. LEXIS 4342, at *5 (April 28,1998):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-9\">[T]he employer is entitled to a credit, pursuant to 65.2-520 of the Code of Virginia, for the wages paid to the claimant based upon sick leave and annual leave benefits for the periods of disability awarded because the uncontradicted evidence [in <em>Myers, </em>as in the instant case,] establishes that the leave used by the claimant was reinstated to his leave balance. Although we found in Lucas <em>v. Research Analysis Corp., </em>61 OIC 166 (1969) that the employer is not entitled to any credit for salary paid if it was charged against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>claimant\u2019s sick leave or annual leave, we held in <em>Dyson v. Commonwealth of Virginia Department of Transportation, </em>67 OIC 237 (1988) that the employer is entitled to a credit for wages paid based on sick or annual leave \u201cwhen leave is reinstated.\u201d We agree with the Chief Deputy Commissioner that the Commission has no jurisdiction to consider the employer\u2019s policies regarding sick leave or annual leave and as long as reinstatement of those benefits is proved, the employer is entitled to a credit for wages previously paid. <em>See Perkins v. Crown Central Petroleum, </em>VWC File No. 159-72-55 (June 15, 1993).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-4\"><em>See also Epps v. Inova Fair Oaks Hosp., </em>VWC File No. 213-55-21, 2007 VA Wrk. Comp. LEXIS 481 (March 23, 2007) (explaining that, while the commission does not have authority to order the employer to reinstate sick leave, the employer, pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.2-520, would be entitled to a credit for salary paid where it was charged against the claimant\u2019s sick leave if the leave is reinstated (citing <em>Lucas, Dyson, </em>and Myers)); <em>Adkinson v.

LEXIS 987 (Dec. 8, 2004) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Accordingly, under the commission\u2019s construction of Code \u00a7 65.2-520, as applicable in a case such as this one, the claimant is not required to \u201c \u2018buy back\u2019 her leave balances,\u201d and the employer is \u201centitled to a credit\u201d for wages it paid for sick leave, where such leave has been reinstated. <em>Saul v.

Harter, </em>1 Va.App. 265, 269, 337 S.E.2d 901, 903 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">Under the terms of the stipulated order, the parties agreed (a) to credit the school board for a portion of the salary previously paid to Humphreys as payment of compensation, and (b) to reinstate certain corresponding portions of Humphreys\u2019 sick leave, as such compensation benefits were due and payable (both presently and in the future).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This is initially evidenced by the parties\u2019 stipulation that Humphreys\u2019 first seven sick leave days (out of her total nine and a half days of sick leave) were \u201cnot yet payable\u201d under the award because she had \u201cnot exhausted the waiting period [under Code \u00a7 65.2-509] for payment of indemnity of [those] first seven days, and therefore those days [were] not yet payable.\u201d The order then establishes for those first seven days a formula for reinstating sick leave \u201cin exchange for each day payable\u201d to the extent \u201cthey do become payable\u201d\u2014i.e., \u201cre-instate[ment] [of] sick time at a rate of .75 days in exchange for each day payable, but only in multiples of one.\u201d Finally, a portion of Humphreys\u2019 salary for her last two and a half sick leave days is treated in the order as payment of workers\u2019 compensation as evidenced by the parties\u2019 stipulation that \u201c[f]or the remaining days lost\u201d the school board \u201cshall only be responsible for the reinstatement of two days sick time.\u201d In other words, unlike Humphreys\u2019 first seven sick leave days, compensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>for her last two and a half days was currently due and payable; and, therefore, the school board, in taking a credit for wages already paid to Humphreys as payment of compensation, was reinstating two days of her sick leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">Humphreys thus received the equivalent of an award of compensation under the deputy commissioner\u2019s May 17, 2005 award, as modified by the stipulated order, dated August 22, 2005. This means that, pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.2-708, Humphreys had two years from the date of the stipulated order to file her change-in-condition application, which she filed on March 1, 2006. Her application was therefore timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">Under the stipulated order setting forth the parties\u2019 settlement agreement, the school board was credited with a portion of its sick leave pay to Humphreys as the payment of workers\u2019 compensation in exchange for reinstatement of a portion of her sick leave taken as a result of her compensable injury. Humphreys thus received, for purposes of the Act, the equivalent of an award of compensation on her original claim under the deputy commissioner\u2019s May 17, 2005 award, as modified by the stipulated order. Accordingly, Humphreys\u2019 change-in-condition application, filed on March 1, 2006, within two years of the stipulated order, dated August 22, 2005, was timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">For these reasons, we affirm the commission\u2019s decision awarding benefits to Humphreys on her change-in-condition application.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b400-8\">. This is consistent with Code \u00a7 65.2-509\u2019s waiting period, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-9\">No compensation shall be allowed for the first seven calendar days of incapacity resulting from an injury except the [medical] benefits provided for in \u00a7 65.2-603; but if incapacity extends beyond that period, compensation shall commence with the eighth day of disability. If, however, such incapacity shall continue for a period of more than three weeks, then compensation shall be allowed from the first day of such incapacity.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b400-10\">. The school board's other defenses to the claim are not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b403-5\">. Humphreys does not contest the full commission's ruling that the deputy commissioner was without authority to order the school board to reinstate sick leave, which, as discussed <em>infra, </em>has long been the commission\u2019s position on the issue of reinstating sick leave in relation to its interpretation of Code \u00a7 65.2-520.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b403-6\">. The stipulated order is in the nature of a contract between the parties, and is to be construed as such by this Court. <em>See Newman v.

By comparison, the parties in the instant case could have settled the matter by providing in the stipulated order that the school board was required to currently make payment to Humphreys for her last two and a half days of sick leave in the amount of 66 <footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em>/\u00a1% </em>of her average weekly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>salary (pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.2-502), that her first seven days of sick leave were subject to future compensation (pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.2-509's waiting period), that the school board was required to reinstate all of Humphreys' nine and a half days of sick leave, and that Humphreys was required to reimburse the school board all of the salary she received for those nine and a half days. This would have placed the parties in the same position as if the school board had paid Humphreys no salary during her absence, she had taken no sick leave, and she had then been awarded compensation for lost wages for that portion of her absence from work that was currently due and payable as compensation. The parties, however, chose not to settle the' claim in that manner. Instead, they chose to give the school board credit for wages already paid to Humphreys as payment of compensation (at such time as compensation was or would \"become payable\"), along with reinstatement of portions of her sick leave, and, under those terms, Humphreys was not required to buy back her sick leave.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b406-5\">. We also note that Code \u00a7 65.2-708(C) sets forth another example of the payment of wages being treated as the payment of compensation under the Act. For purposes of tolling the statute of limitations on a change-in-condition application, this provision mandates as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-6\"><em>All wages paid, </em>for a period not exceeding twenty-four consecutive months, to an employee (i) who is physically unable to return to his pre-injury work due to a compensable injury and (ii) who is provided work within his capacity at a wage equal to or greater than his preinjury wage, <em>shall be considered compensation.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">Code \u00a7 65.2-708(C) (emphasis added). <em>See Scott v.
