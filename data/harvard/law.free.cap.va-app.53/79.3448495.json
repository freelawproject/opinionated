HALEY, JR., Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b128-16\">I. INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b128-17\">Convicted by a jury of malicious wounding and obstruction of justice, Larry Johnson maintains the circuit court erred: (1) in failing to order an examination as to his competency; (2) in refusing to reduce the charge of maliciously wounding Kevin Casey, a former Assistant Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney, to assault and battery; and (3) in refusing to set aside the sentenc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>ing verdict based upon his post-trial <em>Brady </em>motion that the Commonwealth had failed to disclose evidence as to why Casey had resigned his position as an assistant. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">II. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">On October 16, 2006, Johnson was on trial on charges unrelated to this appeal. Kevin Casey was the prosecuting attorney. After Johnson was found guilty and the trial ended, the parties were preparing to leave the courtroom when Johnson rose and struck Casey once with a closed fist on his left ear and the area behind his ear, causing Casey to fall. Johnson\u2019s momentum caused him to fall near Casey. Court personnel responded within seconds and removed Johnson from the courtroom. Casey rose, but lacked a sense of balance, causing him to fall against a table. Other persons seated Casey in a chair until a medical squad responded. Although he felt well when the squad arrived, he shortly told one of its members he was about to vomit or faint, at which point the medical squad member placed him on the ground and administered oxygen. Casey suffered a concussion, two cuts in his ear, one of which required four stitches, and soreness in his shoulder lasting for several weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">Johnson later manifested pride at his actions. Detective Mike Zeets heard Johnson declare \u201cthat if he saw Mr. Casey, he would do the same thing again.\u201d Corporal Jason Anns reported Johnson said: \u201cKevin Casey got what he deserved. It was a long time coming____ I would do it again.\u201d Anns further testified Johnson repeatedly said: \u201cI got him good, didn\u2019t I?\u201d Anns observed Johnson generally \u201cseemed like he was proud of himself.\u201d Anns also heard Johnson threaten to harm Greg Ashwell, another prosecutor in Casey\u2019s office. Major Dale Mauck testified similarly. He testified Johnson affirmed: \u201cI\u2019m not sorry for what I\u2019ve done, I\u2019m proud of what I\u2019ve done---- I did it for everybody he\u2019s wronged up in here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b129-12\">A grand jury indicted Johnson on charges of maliciously wounding Casey and obstruction of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>During pre-trial motions on February 28, 2007, Johnson exhibited disruptive behavior stemming from his belief that the proceedings were biased against him. After the court denied a portion of one of defense counsel\u2019s motions, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-5\">[JOHNSON]: You\u2019re going to deny everything from this man, ain\u2019t you? Why don\u2019t you give somebody a fair trial? Man, let me out of here, Bradley.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Man, you know what? Man, I\u2019m telling you, I\u2019m baking a cake.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-6\">[SECURITY]: Mr. Johnson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-7\">[JOHNSON]: I\u2019m baking a cake.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-8\">[SECURITY]: Calm down, Mr. Johnson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-9\">[JOHNSON]: Hey, hey, hey, hey, Miller, I\u2019m tired of this [expletive], man. Every time I come\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-10\">[SECURITY]: Sit down, Mr. Johnson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-11\">[JOHNSON]:\u2014down here, I\u2019m getting railroaded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-12\">[SECURITY]: Mr. Johnson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-13\">[JOHNSON]: Get away from me, man. Miller, let me out of here, please. Miller, please, please. Miller, I\u2019m asking you. Miller, you and me have got a good understanding. I\u2019m getting tired of these people down here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-14\">Subsequently, defense counsel moved to withdraw from the case. Counsel based the motion on the fact that Johnson had told him of an intent to harm people when taken to the court for trial and that counsel had disclosed this intent to the sheriff, after consulting the Bar concerning the propriety of disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-15\">The court held a hearing on this motion the day the trial was scheduled. After hearing argument from counsel, the court inquired of Johnson whether he wished his counsel to withdraw. Johnson indicated he wanted counsel to remain. The court sought to confirm Johnson had this desire by asking if he \u201chad the opportunity to discuss [the motion] with [counsel], you understand his motion, and it\u2019s your desire that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>stays?\u201d Johnson responded affirmatively. The court then denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">During this hearing, the court <em>sua sponte </em>raised the issue of whether to order a competency evaluation. The court indicated it considered the issue because of what the charges involved, the previous disruptive behavior by Johnson in court, the motion to withdraw, and an unspecified event occurring while Johnson was in jail. Defense counsel asked the court to order the evaluation. Counsel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-5\">I will tell Your Honor that whenever I\u2019ve talked to Mr. Johnson, he gets very, very agitated. It\u2019s very difficult to speak with him about what\u2019s going on in the case. He can\u2019t stay on task very well and he\u2014Your Honor, he just\u2014he gets extremely agitated and then\u2014I don\u2019t know of a word to use, but he kind of rants, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-6\">I haven\u2019t brought a [competency exam] motion basically because of how I viewed the facts of this case and what our argument would be and with my previous discussions with Mr. Johnson---- I guess, in an abundance of caution, I would suggest that a [competency exam] motion would not be an unfrivolous motion....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">The court questioned Johnson about whether he wished to be evaluated, and Johnson responded: \u201cNo. I wish for the trial to go.\u201d In the end, the court declined to order a competency evaluation, stating it would \u201csee how things go today, and then we\u2019ll proceed accordingly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b131-10\">Johnson was tried by a jury on April 18, 2007. He remained calm throughout the guilt phase of the trial. At the conclusion of the evidence, defense counsel made a motion to strike the malicious wounding charge on the ground that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence only proved assault and battery. The court denied the motion. The jury convicted Johnson of both charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-11\">The jury then heard evidence in the sentencing phase of the trial, including further testimony by Casey. Casey stated that as a result of this incident, he ceased enjoying his profession and found the risks of further such encounters outweighed his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>continued practice in prosecution. He resigned about a month after the incident. Asked on cross-examination whether other reasons existed for his resignation, Casey testified he \u201cgrew not to like the job.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Johnson disrupted the sentencing phase due to his belief in the unfairness of the proceedings. When defense counsel asked Casey whether he resigned because his office placed him on administrative leave and Casey responded in the negative, Johnson spoke:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-6\">[JOHNSON]: Huh? Man, that man got suspended, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-7\">[JUDGE]: I\u2019m going to say it again, sir. Please be quiet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-8\">[JOHNSON]: Come on, now, Miller, you can\u2019t stop me from talking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-9\">[JUDGE]:\u2014or I\u2019ll have to remove you from the courtroom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-10\">[JOHNSON]: He shouldn\u2019t lie. He shouldn\u2019t lie.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-11\">[JUDGE]: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, please disregard what\u2019s going on at this time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-12\">Any other questions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-13\">[JOHNSON]: He got suspended. It wasn\u2019t because of me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-14\">After the court, gave Johnson a final warning, he temporarily became calm.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-15\">Johnson also testified during the sentencing phase. The testimony covers slightly under eight pages of transcript and represents a coherent dialogue between Johnson, counsel for both sides, and the court. Johnson testified he lived in Virginia his entire life, experienced a rough childhood, received mental health treatment while incarcerated, and had been on suicide watch several times in the past.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-16\">The jury recommended Johnson receive sentences of fifteen years on the malicious wounding charge and twelve months on the obstruction of justice charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-17\">Defense counsel subsequently filed a motion to set aside the sentencing portion of the jury\u2019s verdict, asserting the Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>monwealth had impermissibly withheld exculpatory evidence. Counsel maintained that the same day Casey resigned as a prosecutor, a judge of the juvenile and domestic relations district court prohibited Casey from practicing in that court due to inappropriate conduct. Counsel also stated the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney and another assistant prosecutor were present at the meeting. The defense argued that if the Commonwealth had provided this information, the jury likely would have imposed a lesser sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">The court heard argument on the motion to set aside the verdict at the beginning of the sentencing proceeding. Although defense counsel presented an argument consistent with his motion, he did not produce any evidence to support it. The court denied the motion, finding that even if the alleged meeting did occur, it was speculation that it represented the reason for Casey\u2019s resignation. The court held the \u201cmotion is pure speculation that the reason [Casey] resigned was because he was banned from the juvenile court. There is no evidence to that. That\u2019s simply your argument under speculation here today.\u201d The court imposed the sentences fixed by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">A. <em>Whether the Circuit Court Erred in Declining to Order a Competency Evaluation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">Johnson first maintains the circuit court erred by failing to <em>sua sponte </em>order a competency exam after the court expressed doubts about Johnson\u2019s fitness for trial and by denying his motion for a competency exam, even though he never raised the issue before the court addressed it <em>sua sponte. </em>Johnson contends this violated his constitutional and statutory rights to not face trial while incompetent.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment forbids the prosecution of incompetent persons. <em>Medina v. California, </em>505 U.S. 437, 439, 112 S.Ct. 2572, 2574, 120 L.Ed.2d 353 (1992). The constitutional test for competence \u201cis whether the defendant has \u2018sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>standing\u2019 and has \u2018a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him.\u2019 \u201d <em>Godinez v. Moran, </em>509 U.S. 389, 396, 113 S.Ct. 2680, 2685, 125 L.Ed.2d 321 (1993) (quoting <em>Dusky v. United States, </em>362 U.S. 402, 402, 80 S.Ct. 788, 788, 4 L.Ed.2d 824 (1960) <em>(per curiam)). </em>Competency issues may implicate \u201c \u2018both procedural and substantive due process.\u2019 \u201d <em>Beck v. Angelone, </em>261 F.3d 377, 387 (4th Cir.2001); <em>see also Smith v. Mullin, </em>379 F.3d 919, 930 (10th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">A defendant makes a procedural due process claim when he argues \u201cthat the trial court failed to hold a competency hearing after the defendant\u2019s mental competency was put in issue.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Walton v. Angelone, </em>321 F.3d 442, 459 (4th Cir.2003); <em>see also United States v. Herrera, </em>481 F.3d 1266, 1271 (10th Cir.2007). The defendant has the burden of showing a \u201c \u2018bona fide doubt\u2019 \u201d concerning his competency. <em>Beck, </em>261 F.3d at 387 (quoting <em>Pate v. Robinson, </em>383 U.S. 375, 385, 86 S.Ct. 836, 842, 15 L.Ed.2d 815 (1966)). The trial court should consider \u201cevidence of a defendant\u2019s irrational behavior, his demeanor at trial, and any prior medical opinion on competence to stand trial ... even one of these factors standing alone may, in some circumstances, be sufficient.\u201d <em>Drope v. Missouri </em>420 U.S. 162, 180, 95 S.Ct. 896, 908, 43 L.Ed.2d 103 (1975). The necessary inquiry is factually intensive and case specific, for \u201cno fixed or immutable signs which invariably indicate the need for further inquiry to determine fitness to proceed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>[exist]; the question is often a difficult one in which a wide range of manifestations and subtle nuances are implicated.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">By contending the circuit court erred in failing to order a competency exam, Johnson raises a procedural due process argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">The General Assembly has provided a framework for considering whether to order a competency evaluation in Code \u00a7 19.2-169.1(A). This section provides that if \u201cthere is probable cause to believe that the defendant ... lacks substantial capacity to understand the proceedings against him or to assist his attorney in his own defense, the court shall order that a competency evaluation be performed.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-169.1(A). The Code reflects the constitutional guarantees of the Due Process Clause, described by courts above as necessitating only a \u201cbona fide doubt\u201d as to competency. <em>See Orndorff v. Commonwealth, </em>271 Va. 486, 500, 628 S.E.2d 344, 351 (2006) (explaining Code \u00a7 19.2-169.1(E), which deals with the ultimate decision on whether a defendant is competent, in light of the constitutional standard enunciated by the United States Supreme Court in Godinez); <em>see also Three S. Dev. Co. v. Santore, </em>193 Conn. 174, 474 A.2d 795, 796 (1984) (equating probable cause with a bona fide confidence); <em>cf. United States v. Respress, </em>9 F.3d 483, 487-88 (6th Cir.1993) (describing probable cause as arising from \u201cbona fide suspicions\u201d). The requirement of probable cause \u201c \u2018relates to probabilities that are based upon the factual and practical considerations in everyday life as perceived by reasonable and prudent persons. The presence or absence of probable cause is not to be examined from the perspective of a legal technician.\u2019 \u201d <em>Parker v. Commonwealth, </em>255 Va. 96, 106, 496 S.E.2d 47, 53 (1998) (quoting <em>Taylor v. Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 816, 820, 284 S.E.2d 833, 836 (1981)). We review a circuit court\u2019s decision not to order a competency evaluation only for abuse of discretion. <em>See Orndorff, </em>271 Va. at 500, 628 S.E.2d at 351.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">In <em>Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>48 Va.App. 521, 535-36, 633 S.E.2d 188, 195 (2006), we held the diligence of defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>counsel in seeking an evaluation represents a key factor in reviewing a circuit court\u2019s decision not to order such an assessment. In <em>Smith, </em>nothing prior to the sentencing portion of the jury trial suggested the defendant lacked mental capacity. <em>Id. </em>at 535, 633 S.E.2d at 195. However, before the jury returned its sentencing verdicts, the defendant attempted to hang himself. <em>Id. </em>at 528, 633 S.E.2d at 191. Defense counsel then told the court this \u201craised a \u2018question\u2019 about the defendant\u2019s mental status.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 533, 633 S.E.2d at 194. Counsel requested and received time to consult with the defendant and then made no further argument. <em>Id. </em>We found it \u201centirely fair\u201d to place great emphasis on counsel\u2019s actions, for \u201ca trial judge\u2019s first instinct should be to determine if defense counsel appears to be aware of the potential problem. Counsel is \u2018obviously in a superior position\u2019 to evaluate a client\u2019s ability to understand the proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 535-36, 633 S.E.2d at 195 (quoting <em>United States v. Caicedo, </em>937 F.2d 1227, 1233 (7th Cir.1991)). Thus, the history of defense counsel\u2019s satisfaction with the client\u2019s mental health has persuasive weight in determining whether a court should order a competency evaluation. <em>Id. </em>at 536, 633 S.E.2d at 195.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">While the court should strongly consider representations by defense counsel, such statements, standing alone, do not typically provide probable cause for an evaluation. \u201c[T]he trial court may consider an express doubt by the accused\u2019s attorney, although such doubt alone is not enough to establish sufficient doubt.\u201d <em>Reynolds v. Norris, </em>86 F.3d 796, 800 (8th Cir.1996); <em>see also Bryson v. Ward, </em>187 F.3d 1193,1202 (10th Cir.1999). In <em>State v. DesLaurier, </em>230 Conn. 572, 646 A.2d 108, 116 (1994), the court affirmed a denial of competency exam where \u201cthe defendant supported his motion exclusively with limited instances of prior \u2018irrational behavior\u2019 while meeting with his counsel, his apparent communication and comprehension difficulties during a pretrial conference on the prior day and the brevity of his responses during\u201d questioning by the court. In <em>State v. Herrera, </em>131 N.M. 22, 33 P.3d 22, 31 (Ct.App.2001), counsel moved for a competency determination on the grounds that the defendant \u201chad ceased eating, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>hiding in his room, was crying uncontrollably, and was taking antidepressants.\u201d Affirming the trial court\u2019s denial of a competency exam, the court noted counsel submitted no evidence to substantiate the claims. <em>Id. </em>Finally, in <em>People v. Eddmonds, </em>143 Ill.2d 501, 161 Ill.Dec. 306, 578 N.E.2d 952, 960 (1991), the court rejected the claim that defense counsel\u2019s testimony of a \u201cgeneral impression\u201d of mental illness in the defendant required a competency hearing. The court stated such bare assertions did not raise bona fide doubts. <em>Id. </em>It also found significant that counsel testified the defendant understood the charges and proceedings and had discussed them with counsel and that the defendant provided lucid, comprehensive testimony. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">This does not mean, of course, that counsel must submit certain pieces of evidence to obtain a competency exam. The court remains on a duty to watch a defendant\u2019s behavior for signs of irrational conduct and may order an exam <em>sua sponte. Smith, </em>48 Va.App. at 533-34, 633 S.E.2d at 194. Indeed, the court must <em>sua sponte </em>order an exam where it has probable cause to question the defendant\u2019s competence. <em>Burt v. Uchtman, </em>422 F.3d 557, 564 (7th Cir.2005); <em>Jermyn v. Horn, </em>266 F.3d 257, 283 (3d Cir.2001). Aside from this, counsel could present expert testimony or layperson observations, <em>State v. Flores, </em>138 N.M. 636, 124 P.3d 1175, 1184 (Ct.App.2005), or even detailed evidence from counsel, <em>United States v. Nichols, </em>661 F.Supp. 507, 513 (W.D.Mich.1987) (finding a \u201cfour-page, detailed affidavit\u201d from counsel sufficient); <em>Nowitzke v. State, </em>572 So.2d 1346, 1349-50 (Fla.1990) (holding a trial court erred in not conducting a competency hearing where defense counsel detailed extremely paranoid beliefs of the defendant showing \u201ca lack of rational thought process\u201d); <em>Ex parte Gordon, </em>556 So.2d 363, 364-65 (Ala.1988) (ordering a competency exam where three attorneys testified the defendant lacked competency). Moreover, a defendant\u2019s behavior during court may under some circumstances provide the requisite evidence. <em>United States v. Auen, </em>846 F.2d 872, 878 (2d Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>Yet even where a defendant has a history of disruptive behavior in court, this does not entitle him to a competency exam where he can understand the proceedings and participate in his defense. \u201cIn other words, [to obtain a competency evaluation] a defendant must exhibit more than bizarre, paranoid behavior, strange words, or a preexisting psychiatric condition that has little bearing on the question of whether the defendant can assist his defense counsel.\u201d <em>People v. Ramos, </em>34 Cal.4th 494, 21 Cal.Rptr.3d 575, 101 P.3d 478, 489 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Other cases help to illustrate this point. In <em>State v. Zorzy, </em>136 N.H. 710, 622 A.2d 1217, 1218 (1993), the defendant exhibited disruptive behavior while appearing <em>pro se </em>at a bail hearing. The defendant ignored the court\u2019s instructions and contended he was the victim of an illegitimate prosecution. <em>Id. </em>He also harassed witnesses on irrelevant issues. <em>Id. </em>The court warned the defendant about his mockery of the judicial process. <em>Id. </em>As the hearing ended, the prosecution suggested it would move for a competency exam and the court remarked to the defendant he had \u201csome problems with your noggin.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1218-19. The prosecution did not ask for a competency evaluation; additionally, the court denied the defendant a continuance to obtain an exam. <em>Id. </em>at 1219. In affirming, the court observed that although \u201c[t]he defendant exhibited disruptive and often annoying behavior ... he appeared to have a factual as well as rational understanding of the proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1220. The court also noted it had no evidence of mental illness. <em>Id. </em>The trial court\u2019s suggestions ' of the defendant\u2019s incompetence were dismissed as \u201ctentative speculation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at (internal quotation marks omitted). In <em>State v. Edwards, </em>507 N.W.2d 393, 395 (Iowa 1993), the defendant also argued his seemingly irrational behavior during court should have resulted in a competency evaluation. The defendant threw a trash can at the court reporter and consistently interrupted the testimony of prosecution witnesses. <em>Id. </em>at 395-96. While speaking with the court, the defendant repeatedly used expletives and stated he expected his lawyer to \u201cyell or scream at the victims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 396. He indicated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>his lawyer behaved too kindly towards witnesses. <em>Id. </em>The defendant stated his reasons for expecting this conduct from his lawyer: <em>\u201cI\u2019m facing life in </em>jail____ <em>I got one chance. That\u2019s it. When this is over, this is good-by. </em>You know what I mean.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court held that although the defendant behaved unusually, his actions were \u201crationally motivated, purposeful, and in keeping with his expressed intention.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The defendant \u201cappreciated the seriousness of the charge and understood the proceedings,\u201d even if he did approach them in an unorthodox fashion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">All of this precedent leads us to affirm the circuit court\u2019s decision not to order a competency evaluation. In spite of Johnson\u2019s history of disruptive behavior, defense counsel had never previously mentioned the issue of Johnson\u2019s competence. When the circuit court raised the issue <em>sua sponte, </em>defense counsel responded that \u201cin an abundance of caution\u201d an evaluation would be \u201cunfrivolous.\u201d Counsel\u2019s actions and statements strongly suggest the defendant was competent. <em>Smith, </em>48 Va.App. at 535-36, 633 S.E.2d at 195. While defense counsel ultimately sought an examination and stated in support he had difficulty communicating with his client, counsel offered no evidence to support his position. The vague, unsubstantiated representations of counsel did not provide probable cause to doubt Johnson\u2019s mental capacity. <em>Reynolds, </em>86 F.3d at 800.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">Furthermore, Johnson\u2019s behavior in court before the court denied his motion, while sometimes disruptive, evidenced a rational comprehension of the proceedings. When Johnson interrupted the pre-trial motions hearing, he did so in response to the court\u2019s partial denial of one of his motions. He chose to express anger that the court had not ruled in his favor. Johnson also expressed a belief he was not receiving a fair trial, albeit while ranting. It is clear Johnson understood the context of the proceedings. <em>See Edwards, </em>507 N.W.2d at 395-96; <em>Zorzy, </em>622 A.2d at 1220; <em>State v. Watson, </em>198 Conn. 598, 504 A.2d 497, 501 (1986) (finding significant in upholding the failure to hold a competency hearing that the defendant understood \u201cthe court\u2019s questions testing his understanding of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>the plea agreement, the factual basis for the pleas, the meaning of the <em>Alford </em>plea, the constitutional rights which he was waiving, and the adequacy of the advice of counsel\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Proceedings after the court denied the evaluation again reveal no reason to order an evaluation. Johnson clearly and succinctly answered the court\u2019s questions regarding whether he wished his counsel to withdraw and whether he wanted to proceed to trial. After the trial commenced, Johnson behaved normally throughout the guilt phase. He gave his plea when asked by the clerk and never displayed aberrant behavior during the guilt phase. When Johnson interrupted the proceedings during the sentencing phase, it was to express his belief Casey was lying. <em>Edwards, </em>507 N.W.2d at 396. This was a rational thing for Johnson to wish to convey. It is also noteworthy that after the court told Johnson it would remove him from the courtroom if he did not cease his disruptions, he became quiet. Johnson coherently answered questions from his counsel during the sentencing phase, covering just under eight pages of transcript. <em>Eddmonds, </em>161 Ill.Dec. 306, 578 N.E.2d at 960.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">Johnson\u2019s attack on Casey, while criminal, also demonstrated a rational comprehension of what was occurring. Corporal Anns heard Johnson say he hit Casey because Casey \u201cdid a lot of people wrong\u201d and Casey \u201cgot what he deserved.\u201d Johnson believed Casey was \u201clying on\u201d him. Johnson apparently disapproved of local prosecution policies, as he also threatened to harm Greg Ashwell, another Assistant Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney. Johnson expressed pride in his actions to multiple persons after the incident, boasting he would commit the same act again if given the opportunity. It is understandable that Johnson, who Casey had just participated in convicting, would feel anger towards Casey. Johnson expressed that anger through physical violence. Anger often leads to violence. It does not give rise to probable cause of legal incompetence.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">While the court itself raised the issue of Johnson\u2019s incompetence <em>sua sponte, </em>this does not mean the court had to order a competency evaluation. We agree with the reasoning of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>New Hampshire Supreme Court that the court\u2019s questioning of Johnson\u2019s abilities represented only \u201ctentative speculation.\u201d <em>Zorzy, </em>622 A.2d at 1220. The court\u2019s momentary conjecture did not bind it to order an evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">In summary, the record overwhelmingly suggested Johnson possessed mental competence for trial. As another court held, since \u201cthe trial judge was not faced with substantial evidence of [Johnson\u2019s] incompetence\u2014and in fact had good reason to think that [Johnson] was competent\u2014he did not err in failing to\u201d order a competency evaluation. <em>Davis v. Woodford, </em>384 F.3d 628, 645 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">B. <em>Whether the Evidence of Intent to Permanently Injure Sufficed</em></p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">Johnson next argues the circuit court erred in denying his motion to strike the malicious wounding charge since the evidence showing only a single blow with a fist did not suffice to prove an intent to permanently disfigure Casey, as required by the statute.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He contends this represented only assault and battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">Code \u00a7 18.2-51 provides that \u201c[i]f any person maliciously shoot, stab, cut, or wound any person or by any means cause him bodily injury, with the intent to maim, disfigure, disable, or kill,\u201d he is guilty of malicious wounding.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">Under well established law, \u201cthe evidence and all reasonable inferences flowing therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the prevailing party in the trial court,\u201d the Commonwealth. <em>Commonwealth v.

Instead, we ask only \u201c Vhether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Maxwell v.

These principles recognize that an appellate court is \u201cnot permitted to reweigh the evidence,\u201d <em>Nusbaum v. Berlin, </em>273 Va. 385, 408, 641 S.E.2d 494, 507 (2007), because appellate courts have no authority \u201cto preside <em>de novo </em>over a second trial,\u201d <em>Haskins v.

Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 658, 663 n. 2, 588 S.E.2d 384, 387 n. 2 (2003). \u201cThe inferences to be drawn from proven facts, so long as they are reasonable, are within the province of the trier of fact.\u201d <em>Hancock v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 774, 782, 407 S.E.2d 301, 306 (1991). Thus, a jury may \u201cdraw reasonable inferences from basic to ultimate facts,\u201d <em>Haskins, </em>44 Va.App. at 10, 602 S.E.2d at 406 (citations omitted), unless doing so would push \u201cinto the realm of <em>non sequitur\u201d Thomas v.

Intent may, and often must, be inferred from the facts and circumstances of the case, including the actions and statements of the accused.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Taylor, </em>256 Va. 514, 519, 506 S.E.2d 312, 314 (1998) (citations omitted).

Commonwealth, </em>276 Va. 326, 330, 661 S.E.2d 454, 456 (2008). The question of whether a defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>dant possessed the requisite intent normally rests with the finder of fact. <em>Nobles v. Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 548, 551, 238 S.E.2d 808, 810 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">To be guilty under Code \u00a7 18.2-51, a person must intend to permanently, not merely temporarily, harm another person. <em>Campbell v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 476, 484, 405 S.E.2d 1, 4 (1991) <em>(en banc). </em>Where \u201ca person intentionally takes an action, the probable consequence of which is the permanent disability of another, even if permanent disability does not result, he or she can be found to have intended to cause a permanent disability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 484, 405 S.E.2d at 4-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">In <em>Lee v. Commonwealth, </em>135 Va. 572, 578,115 S.E. 671, 673 (1923), our Supreme Court held that the act of striking a person with a fist, standing alone, normally does not suffice to prove an intent to permanently harm. The defendant and another man engaged in a fistfight. <em>Id. </em>at 576, 115 S.E. at 672. Eventually the defendant struck the other man in the face, causing a wound necessitating three stitches inside his nose and another six on his skin. <em>Id. </em>at 577, 115 S.E. at 672. Although the evidence was in conflict regarding whether the defendant employed only his fist in striking the blow, the Court held that if the defendant \u201conly used his fist, then there would be no presumption from that fact alone that he intended to permanently disfigure his adversary, and yet some temporary disfigurement would naturally be expected, and would almost necessarily follow, from such a blow.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 578, 115 S.E. at 673.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">The holding of <em>Lee </em>must be read in light of other precedent that makes clear a person may be found to have intended permanent harm by an attack with fists where the assailant employs sufficient brutality. As far back as <em>M'Whirt\u2019s Case, </em>44 Va. (3 Gratt.) 594, 611 (1846), it was recognized that while \u201cfists may not, indeed, be regarded generally, as a deadly weapon ... they become most deadly, by blows often repeated, long continued, and applied to vital and delicate parts of the body of a defenceless, unresisting man, on the ground.\u201d Later the Court enunciated the same principle by stating that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>\u201can assault with the bare fists may be attended with such circumstances of violence and brutality that an intent to kill will be presumed.\u201d <em>Roark v. Commonwealth, </em>182 Va. 244, 250, 28 S.E.2d 693, 695-96 (1944); <em>see also Dawkins v. Commonwealth, </em>186 Va. 55, 64, 41 S.E.2d 500, 504 (1947) (stating that \u201cone may permanently maim, disfigure, disable, or kill with the fists, or knees, if the force is applied with violence and brutality\u201d). The <em>Roark </em>Court elaborated with the example that a strong person \u201c \u2018will not be allowed to approach an unoffending citizen ... and deal him a deadly blow with his fist in a vital part and when death, the natural consequence of his act, ensues, be heard to say that he merely intended to punish him and not to kill him.\u2019 \u201d <em>Roark, </em>182 Va. at 251, 28 S.E.2d at 696 (quoting <em>State v. John, </em>172 Mo. 220, 72 S.W. 525, 527 (1903)). Such a scenario would entail \u201c \u2018unmitigated brutality.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>John, </em>72 S.W. at 527).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">Our Supreme Court found only a few blows with a fist could prove the intent to permanently injure in <em>Shackelford v. Commonwealth, </em>183 Va. 423, 32 S.E.2d 682 (1945). There the victim and her sister, the defendant\u2019s estranged wife, were staying at the home of their recently deceased mother. <em>Id. </em>at 424, 32 S.E.2d at 683. In the early morning hours, the victim heard her sister and the defendant arguing in the kitchen. <em>Id. </em>at 424-25, 32 S.E.2d at 683. The victim decided to investigate and upon doing this saw her sister appeared injured. <em>Id. </em>The victim asked the defendant to leave, but he became angry and told her he would \u201cfinish\u201d her. <em>Id. </em>at 425, 32 S.E.2d at 683. He then struck the victim once in the nose, once in the eye, and once behind her ear. <em>Id. </em>The defendant\u2019s wife intervened by grabbing him, enabling the victim to escape to a nearby house. <em>Id. </em>As a result of the attack, the victim suffered a broken nose, a cut over an eye, and severe bruises on both eyes. <em>Id. </em>In considering whether the evidence sufficed to prove intent to permanently injure, the Court noted the defendant was a strong man who \u201cmade an unprovoked attack upon a frail woman 50 years of age in her own kitchen. He struck at least three severe blows ... with the expressed intention to \u2018finish\u2019 her.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 426-27, 32 S.E.2d at 684. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>Court further found relevant that while the encounter lasted only briefly, only the intervention of the defendant\u2019s wife brought it to an end. <em>Id. </em>at 427, 32 S.E.2d at 684. Furthermore, when the sheriff arrested the defendant, the defendant \u201creferred to his wife\u2019s relatives as a \u2018bunch of bastards.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>He also \u201csaid that he not only struck [the victim] but that he \u2018followed up\u2019 the blow.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court held the evidence \u201cclearly sufficient to establish\u201d intent. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">This Court confronted a situation similar to <em>Shackelford </em>in <em>Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 393, 412 S.E.2d 202 (1991). The defendant there broke into the apartment of his former girlfriend. <em>Id. </em>at 394-95, 412 S.E.2d at 203. He went to his former girlfriend\u2019s bedroom and he found a man dressing for work. <em>Id. </em>at 395, 412 S.E.2d at 203. After each ordered the other to depart, the defendant attacked the man, hitting him with his fists between four and five times. <em>Id. </em>The attack continued until police came. <em>Id. </em>The victim had not taken any hostile action against the defendant and was unarmed. <em>Id. </em>After discussing some of the precedent above, we held that given the \u201cunprovoked and brutal assault,\u201d the serious nature of the injuries inflicted, and that the attack continued until the arrival of police, it was proper for the court to find an intent to permanently injure. <em>Id. </em>at 398, 412 S.E.2d at 205.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Although we have not previously held in a reported opinion that a single blow with a fist may constitute sufficient evidence to prove an intent to permanently injure, we hold that under the circumstances of this case the jury could make such a determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">First, Casey did nothing to provoke Johnson\u2019s attack (other than prosecute him). <em>Roark, </em>182 Va. at 251, 28 S.E.2d at 696; <em>M'Whirt\u2019s Case, </em>44 Va. (3 Gratt.) at 611; <em>Williams, </em>13 Va.App. at 398, 412 S.E.2d at 205. Johnson, in an act of \u201cunmitigated brutality,\u201d <em>Roark, </em>182 Va. at 251, 28 S.E.2d at 696, simply approached Casey and dealt him a closed fist punch to the head and ear. An unsuspecting victim like Casey is \u201cdefenceless,\u201d M'W<em>hirt\u2019s Case, </em>44 Va. (3 Gratt.) at 611, making him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>more likely to suffer serious wounds than someone having the opportunity to prepare for an attack. The lack of provocation is significant evidence of an intent to seriously harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Second, the evidence clearly reveals Johnson employed great force in striking Casey. This becomes evident from the fact that Casey suffered a concussion, two cuts in his ear, one of which necessitated four stitches, and soreness in his shoulder lasting several weeks.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Shackelford, </em>183 Va. at 427, 32 S.E.2d at 684; <em>Williams, </em>13 Va.App. at 398, 412 S.E.2d at 205. It is also clear from the fact that Johnson\u2019s momentum from delivering the punch caused him to fall near Casey. One would not normally expect the delivery of a punch to have such a drastic effect on the assailant. Indeed, such a result is inconsistent with a fistfight or even a boxing match, where each party could throw and receive multiple blows while remaining standing. That Johnson utilized such power as to carry him onto the floor with Casey strongly indicates an intent to severely harm. <em>Dawkins, </em>186 Va. at 62, 41 S.E.2d at 503-04.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">Finally, Johnson\u2019s consistent statements after the incident reveal a premeditated attack to punish Casey for perceived injustices in local prosecution policies. Johnson expressed pride in his actions and vowed to do the same thing again if given the opportunity. <em>Cf. Rhodes v. Commonwealth, </em>238 Va. 480, 486, 384 S.E.2d 95, 98-99 (1989) (finding lack of remorse probative of a murder suspect\u2019s intent to kill); <em>Archie v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 684, 689, 420 S.E.2d 718, 721 (1992) (same).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Johnson stated he \u201cgot him good\u201d and that Casey \u201cgot what he deserved.\u201d <em>Shackelford, </em>183 Va. at 427, 32 S.E.2d at 684. The jury could consider this in determining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>Johnson intended for Casey to suffer serious harm. <em>Cf. Davidson v. Commonwealth, </em>167 Va. 451, 458, 187 S.E. 437, 440 (1936) (finding \u201cthe boast of the accused\u201d relevant to affirming that the defendant acted with malice).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Based on all this evidence, a rational fact finder could discern an intent to permanently injure. The circuit court did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">As to the dissent, we simply disagree with the argument that a rational jury could not find an intent to permanently injure. The dissent either ignores or minimizes the evidence considered above. The dissent gives no attention to the unprovoked nature of Johnson\u2019s attack, which represents a fact consistently found important by Virginia courts. The dissent similarly disregards the circumstances surrounding the assault concerning how the devastating force of Johnson\u2019s blow caused him to fall with Casey. The dissent minimizes the severity of Casey\u2019s injuries, claiming they represent simply one result from a range of possibilities. Johnson\u2019s repeated bragging receives light consideration as \u201cinsufficient to prove he acted with the specific intent.\u201d As demonstrated in our analysis above, the jury could evaluate and weigh a number of factors found relevant in prior cases to determine Johnson possessed a specific intent to inflict permanent injury to Casey. Since that holding is rational, we will not disturb it on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">C. <em>Whether the Circuit Court Erred in Denying Johnson\u2019s Brady Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">Lastly, Johnson contends the circuit court erred in denying his motion to set aside the verdict based on the prosecution\u2019s failure to disclose evidence that Casey received a reprimand the day he resigned. Johnson maintains the prosecution had a duty to disclose this as it presented information material to punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">In <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 1196-97, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), the United States Supreme Court held \u201cthat the suppression by the prosecution of evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>dence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.\u201d A defendant asserting a <em>Brady </em>violation must satisfy a three-prong test: \u201c \u2018The evidence at issue must be favorable to the accused, either because it is exculpatory, or because it is impeaching; that evidence must have been suppressed by the State, either willfully or inadvertently; and prejudice must have ensued.\u2019 \u201d <em>Deville v. Commonwealth, </em>47 Va.App. 754, 756, 627 S.E.2d 530, 532 (2006) (quoting <em>Strickler v. Greene, </em>527 U.S. 263, 281-82, 119 S.Ct. 1936, 1948, 144 L.Ed.2d 286 (1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">In order for withheld evidence to qualify under <em>Brady </em>and its progeny, it must be material. <em>Jefferson v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 477, 486, 500 S.E.2d 219, 224 (1998). A piece of evidence is material only if \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A \u2018reasonable probability\u2019 is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>United States v. Bagley, </em>473 U.S. 667, 682,105 S.Ct. 3375, 3383, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985); <em>see also Soering v. Deeds, </em>255 Va. 457, 464, 499 S.E.2d 514, 517 (1998). This standard does not require a defendant to show the likelihood of a different verdict by a preponderance of the evidence or that insufficient evidence would exist to support the verdict. <em>Kyles v. Whitley, </em>514 U.S. 419, 434-35, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 1566, 131 L.Ed.2d 490 (1995). Courts consider the materiality of undisclosed evidence \u201ccollectively, not item by item.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 436, 115 S.Ct. at 1567. \u201cThe mere possibility that an item of undisclosed information might have helped the defense, or might have affected the outcome of the trial, does not establish \u2018materiality\u2019 in the constitutional sense.\u201d <em>United States v. Agurs, </em>427 U.S. 97, 109-10, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 2400, 49 L.Ed.2d 342 (1976); <em>see also Frontanilla v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 220, 227, 562 S.E.2d 706, 709 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">In <em>Taylor v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 429, 435, 585 S.E.2d 839, 842 (2003), we held the failure to disclose witness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>statements that were not \u201cmaterially contradictory of or inconsistent with those witness\u2019 trial testimony\u201d failed the test of materiality. There the evidence at trial showed the defendant and another man fired guns at a house. <em>Id. </em>at 432, 585 S.E.2d at 841. One witness who testified at trial that the defendant participated in the shooting provided a pre-trial statement identifying the other shooter, but making no mention of the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 435, 585 S.E.2d at 842-43. Another witness who testified as to the defendant\u2019s culpability gave a pre-trial statement omitting any consideration of the shooting. <em>Id. </em>at 435, 585 S.E.2d at 843. We held that since the trial testimony did not contradict the pre-trial statements, the undisclosed evidence lacked materiality under <em>Brady. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Other courts have also reached this conclusion. For instance, in <em>Thompson v. Cain, </em>161 F.3d 802, 807 (5th Cir.1998), the defendant claimed the government committed a <em>Brady </em>violation by withholding evidence a witness sought a reward for his testimony. Yet the witness never testified inconsistently with the defendant\u2019s allegations. <em>Id. </em>The court concluded that since \u201cthere are no inconsistencies between the material that Thompson cites and [the witness\u2019] testimony ... no <em>Brady </em>violation occurred.\u201d <em>Id. See also State v. Crawford, </em>848 So.2d 615, 627 (La.Ct.App.2003) (finding that \u201cthe 911 log does not contradict Mr. Mitchell\u2019s trial testimony and is not <em>Brady </em>material\u201d); <em>State v. Hunter, </em>648 So.2d 1025, 1034 (La.Ct.App.1994) (holding \u201c[t]his is not a contradictory statement and therefore would not constitute <em>Brady </em>material\u201d); <em>People v. Goldman, </em>175 A.D.2d 723, 573 N.Y.S.2d 282, 285 (1991) (finding no <em>Brady </em>violation where \u201c[t]he fact that the officer prepared suggestions for a second potential conversation, did not contradict the witness\u2019 trial testimony, in which he essentially admitted that he had been prepared for the first conversation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">We hold the information Johnson claims the prosecution should have disclosed about Casey is not material. Casey testified he resigned as a prosecutor \u201c[i]n part\u201d because of Johnson\u2019s attack on him. When asked whether other reasons existed, Casey stated he \u201cgrew not to like the job.\u201d While <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>information concerning Casey\u2019s professional difficulties may have provided additional relevant background concerning his decision to resign, it would not have contradicted his testimony. Johnson would have had more information to probe the reasons why Casey left, but Casey\u2019s testimony as given would remain. This does not suffice to undermine confidence in the outcome. <em>Kyles, </em>514 U.S. at 435, 115 S.Ct. at 1566; <em>Taylor, </em>41 Va.App. at 435, 585 S.E.2d at 842-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">The circuit court did not err in declining to order a competency evaluation. Confronted only with the vague, unsubstantiated representations of counsel and a history of rational behavior by Johnson, it was reasonable for the circuit court to proceed without an evaluation. Additionally, the evidence sufficed for the jury to infer an intent by Johnson to permanently injure Casey. The lack of provocation by Casey, the severity of Johnson\u2019s blow, and the braggadocio by Johnson combine to make it reasonable for a jury to conclude Johnson harbored an intent to seriously injure- Casey. Since the jury\u2019s finding was rational, this Court will not disturb it. Finally, the evidence Johnson claims the prosecution should have given him under <em>Brady </em>would not have contradicted the prosecution\u2019s evidence, thereby making it fail the required test of materiality. For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b130-16\">. Johnson referred to the trial court as Bradley and Miller.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b134-6\">. On the other hand, a substantive due process claim maintains the defendant was incompetent when tried or sentenced. <em>United States v. General, </em>278 F.3d 389, 396 (4th Cir.2002); <em>see also Vogt v. United States, </em>88 F.3d 587, 591 (8th Cir.1996). Defendants raising this issue bear the burden of demonstrating their incompetence by a preponderance of the evidence, <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>404 F.3d 850, 856 (4th Cir.2005), and this Court reviews only for clear error by the trial court, <em>Orndorff v. Commonwealth, </em>271 Va. 486, 500, 628 S.E.2d 344, 351 (2006). The defendant has a high burden, for \" 'the evidence must indicate a present inability to assist counsel or understand the charges.\u2019 \u201d <em>Burket v. Angelone, </em>208 F.3d 172, 192 (4th Cir.2000) (quoting <em>United States ex rel. Foster v. De Robertis, </em>741 F.2d 1007, 1012 (7th Cir.1984)). Indeed, \"neither low intelligence, mental deficiency, nor bizarre, volatile, and irrational behavior can be equated with mental incompetence to stand trial.\" <em>Medina v. Singletary, </em>59 F.3d 1095, 1107 (11th Cir.1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b141-10\">. This represents a different question from whether the defendant acted with malice, although the two are closely related and cases often speak of them together.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b146-7\">. Although Casey suffered fewer injuries than the victims in other cases, they still presented a significant harm.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b146-8\">. We perceive no reason why contrition should prove relevant in determining an intent to kill, but not an intent to permanently injure. To the contrary, the level of a defendant\u2019s braggadocio about a crime may rightly be expected to correlate with the level of harm anticipated and inflicted.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b150-8\">HUMPHREYS, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ARG\">concurring, in part, and dissenting, in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">I concur with the majority\u2019s holding and analysis with respect to all issues presented with the exception of its holding that the evidence was sufficient to prove an intent to permanently maim, disfigure, disable or kill, as required by Code \u00a7 18.2-51. I respectfully dissent from that portion of the majority opinion because I believe the evidence was insufficient to prove such intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>Code \u00a7 18.2-51 provides: \u201c[i]f any person maliciously shoot, stab, cut or wound any person or by any means cause him bodily injury, <em>with the intent to maim, disfigure, disable, or kill, </em>he shall, except where it is otherwise provided, be guilty of a Class 3 felony.\u201d (Emphasis added). The Supreme Court of Virginia has held that, under ordinary circumstances, the requisite intent cannot simply be presumed from a blow with a bare fist. <em>See Lee v. Commonwealth, </em>135 Va. 572, 115 S.E. 671 (1923); <em>see also Fletcher v. Commonwealth, </em>209 Va. 636, 166 S.E.2d 269 (1969). However, as the majority correctly notes, when an assailant employs a sufficient degree of brutality while attacking with his bare fists, the trier of fact may infer the intent to maim, disfigure, disable or kill. <em>See Dawkins v. Commonwealth, </em>186 Va. 55, 63, 41 S.E.2d 500, 504 (1947). In light of both of these precedents, the question becomes whether the record contains sufficient evidence to prove the defendant employed \u201ca sufficient degree of brutality\u201d to support an inference of an intent to maim, disfigure, disable or kill. <em>Id. </em>I would hold that this record, even when viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, cannot support such an inference.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">The majority finds that from the extent of the injury to the victim, a rational fact finder could discern intent to permanently injure. Essentially, the majority argues backward from the result, holding that the fact that the -victim was disfigured as a result of the blow supports a finding that Johnson acted with the requisite intent. The majority relies for this conclusion on the common law concept that the fact finder may infer that a person intends the natural and probable consequences of his acts. <em>Campbell v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 476, 483-84, 405 S.E.2d 1, 4 (1991) <em>(en banc). </em>I do not accept the majority\u2019s contention that permanent harm or disfigurement is a \u201cnatural and probable consequence\u201d of a single blow with a bare fist, when unaccompanied by other circumstances of unusual violence or brutality.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Although obviously not binding on us, the British House of Lords has provided valuable perspective regarding the phrase \u201cnatural and probable consequences,\u201d as used in this venera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>ble principle of the common law. In <em>Regina v. Woollin, </em>4 All ER 103 (1998), the Law Lords overruled precedent from the Court of Appeal of England and Wales, which equated the phrase \u201cnatural and probable consequences\u201d to \u201chighly probable.\u201d Lord Steyn found that the standard used by the Court of Appeal was not sufficiently analogous to the common law requirement and held that in order for a consequence to be \u201cnatural and probable,\u201d it must be the \u201cinevitable\u201d result of an action rather than merely \u201chighly probable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">In its most recent pronouncement on the subject, albeit in a civil tort context, our Supreme Court has held that \u201cthe injury should have been foreseen <em>in the light of the attending circumstances.\u201d Interim Personnel v. Messer, </em>263 Va. 435, 442, 559 S.E.2d 704, 708 (2002) (emphasis added). The degree to which this standard equates to that of our common law cousins is an intellectual discussion that can be left for another day and a higher court. However, the comparison is instructive in illustrating that the historical construction of the phrase does not support a finding that a specific intent can be discerned from a merely theoretically possible outcome, which seems to me to be the essence of the majority\u2019s holding in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">Under Virginia law, maiming, disfigurement, disablement or death are not the inevitable, probable, or reasonably foreseeable consequences of a blow with a bare fist. Thus, an assailant\u2019s intent to render such harm with his fist must be discerned from either his statements or unusual \u201ccircumstances of violence and brutality.\u201d <em>Roark v. Commonwealth, </em>182 Va. 244, 250, 28 S.E.2d 693, 695-96 (1944). Because Johnson\u2019s blow was not accompanied by such statements or circumstances, I do not believe that the evidence supports an inference of intent to maim, disfigure, disable or kill.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">The cases cited by the majority in support of its position are easily distinguished from the case at bar. In <em>Shackelford v. Commonwealth, </em>183 Va. 423, 425, 32 S.E.2d 682, 683 (1945), the defendant stated, \u201cthis time I will finish you\u201d before repeatedly striking the victim in the nose, head, and ear. In affirming his conviction, the Supreme Court of Virginia found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>that the defendant acted with the intent to permanently injure as evidenced by his statements both before and after the attack. <em>Id. </em>at 427, 32 S.E.2d at 684. The Court emphasized that the defendant \u201cstruck at least three severe blows on her face and head <em>with the expressed intention to \u2018finish\u2019 her.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Like <em>Shackelford, </em>the assault at issue in <em>Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 393, 395, 412 S.E.2d 202, 203 (1991), was accompanied by circumstances supporting an inference of the requisite intent. In <em>Williams, </em>the defendant broke into the house of a former girlfriend where he found a man dressing for work. <em>Id. </em>The defendant proceeded to attack the man, striking him repeatedly until the police arrived. <em>Id. </em>Two days before the incident, the defendant wrote his former girlfriend a note stating, \u201cyour ass ... can ran but you can\u2019t hide.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This Court affirmed the conviction based upon the unusual level of violence and brutality finding \u201c[t]he record supports the trial court\u2019s determination that the attack on [the victim] was made by [the defendant] with the intent to maim, disfigure, disable or kill.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 398, 412 S.E.2d at 205.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">The circumstances surrounding Johnson\u2019s assault are decidedly different from those in <em>Shackelford </em>and <em>Williams. </em>In this case, even viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the record is devoid of either direct evidence of specific intent as existed in <em>Shackelford </em>or circumstantial evidence of unusual violence or brutality to support an inference that Johnson acted with the specific intent as was the case in <em>Williams. </em>In contrast to those cases, Johnson\u2019s attack involved but a single blow with the fist, without any accompanying statements expressing an intention to maim, disfigure, disable or kill. The majority gives great weight to the fact that \u201cJohnson expressed pride in his actions and vowed to do the same thing again if given the opportunity. Johnson stated he \u2018got him good\u2019 and that [the victim] \u2018got what he deserved.\u2019 \u201d \u00b0 While these statements illustrate Johnson\u2019s lack of remorse for his actions, they are insufficient to prove he acted with the specific intent to maim, disfigure, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>disable or Mil at the time of the assault, as required by Code \u00a7 18.2-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">A single blow with the fist may reasonably result in a range of <em>possible </em>injuries, running the gamut from a temporary bruise or contusion through a laceration resulting in a permanent scar, as is the case here, to the other end of the spectrum where such a blow may result in severe, permanent neurological damage. Common sense would seem to suggest that the severity of injuries resulting from a single blow with a closed fist are a function of a number of variables including the strength of the assailant, the amount of force used, the victim\u2019s physical condition, and whether the damage has been compounded by the victim striMng furniture or other objects as he fell. This record is bereft of any evidence that the nature of the injuries sustained were anything more than merely a <em>possible </em>result of Johnson\u2019s single blow with his fist. Thus, an inference that the result was intended is insufficient here as a matter of law to sustain a conviction for malicious wounding.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">In conclusion, without some evidence that Johnson intended to cause the injuries that resulted in the form of contemporaneous statements, use of a weapon, or other evidence of <em>unusual </em>violence or brutality, one cannot reason backward from the result, as the majority has done, and find the requisite intent solely from the resulting injury and a remorseless comment. What the majority has done today is extend its holding beyond established precedent, a point they themselves recognize: \u201cAlthough we have not previously held in a reported opinion that a single blow with a bare fist may constitute sufficient evidence to prove an intent to permanently injure, we hold that under the circumstances of this case the jury could make such a determination.\u201d In so doing, the majority has lowered the bar of a previously significant permissible inference to the point that in the future, it will require little, if any, effort to step over it.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">For these reasons, I believe the trial court erred in finding the evidence, on the issue of intent, sufficient to convict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>Johnson of malicious wounding under Code \u00a7 18.2-51. At most, I believe the evidence supports a conviction of the lesser-included offense of assault and battery, and I would reverse and remand this case to the trial court for the entry of a judgment and sentence for that offense. <em>See Commonwealth v. South, </em>272 Va. 1, 630 S.E.2d 318 (2006).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
