ELDER, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">James Aaron Pearce (appellant) appeals from his jury trial conviction for possessing a firearm as a convicted felon in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2. On appeal he contends that the trial court erred by allowing the cross-examination of appellant regarding his drug use and alcohol consumption at the time of his arrest because it constituted impermissible \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence. Alternatively, appellant argues that the trial court erred by not giving a limiting instruction advising the jury that it could consider appellant\u2019s prior drug use only for impeachment purposes. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm appellant\u2019s conviction of possessing a firearm as a convicted felon.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b158-12\">\u201cOn appeal, *we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u2019 \u201d <em>Archer v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 1, 11, 492 S.E.2d 826, 831 (1997) (quoting <em>Martin v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 438, 443, 358 S.E.2d 415, 418 (1987)). So viewed, on February 1, 2007, at 8:30 p.m., Officers Clyde Lindsey and Thomas Gilbert were patrolling in an unmarked police car when they observed a group of five individuals, with appellant among them, consuming alcohol <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>from open containers. While the officers conducted an investigatory stop, all of the individuals, including appellant, continually placed their hands in their pockets, despite Officer Lindsey\u2019s request that they refrain from doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">To ensure their safety, the officers proceeded to pat down the individuals for weapons. As Officer Lindsey began patting down the second individual in the group, appellant \u201ctook off running.\u201d As Officer Lindsey gave chase, he saw appellant throw a dark medium-sized object with his left hand. When Officer Lindsey tackled appellant, appellant wrestled free, leaving his shirt and jacket behind. Officer Lindsey apprehended appellant approximately thirty seconds later.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">After placing appellant in custody, Officer Lindsey returned to the site of the initial struggle to retrieve appellant\u2019s clothes. Near the clothes, Officer Lindsey found a loaded firearm, which was warm and dry to the touch, despite the fact that it was drizzling. Appellant\u2019s shirt and jacket were not covering the firearm. Officer Lindsey did not see any other contraband in the vicinity, nor did he see any other individuals in the area. No fingerprints were found on the gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">After the Commonwealth concluded its case-in-chief, appellant objected to the anticipated questioning about his drug and alcohol consumption on the night of his arrest, arguing that it would be more prejudicial than probative. The Commonwealth responded that it would limit the inquiry about appellant\u2019s drug use to the night of his arrest to test his ability to recall and did not intend to offer extrinsic evidence on the issue. The trial court permitted the line of questioning, \u201cto test [appellant\u2019s] ability to recall,\u201d provided that \u201cit [was] asked properly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">Appellant testified in his own defense, asserting that he did not throw a gun. Otherwise, his description of the events matched the testimony of Officers Lindsey and Gilbert. During cross-examination and over counsel\u2019s objection, appellant admitted to having been intoxicated at the time of his encounter with the police, though he could not recall how much he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>had to drink. He also admitted to being under the influence of illegal narcotics.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">At the conclusion of the trial, the parties reviewed the jury instructions before delivering closing arguments. Appellant did not request any limiting instructions as to the purpose for which his drug use testimony might properly be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">ADMISSIBILITY OF APPELLANT\u2019S TESTIMONY</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">\u201cThe admissibility of evidence is within the broad discretion of the trial court, and a ruling will not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Bottoms v. Commonwealth, </em>22 Va.App. 378, 384, 470 S.E.2d 153, 156 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-10\">Appellant contends the trial court erred by allowing the Commonwealth to question him regarding his alcohol consumption and drug use at the time immediately prior to his arrest. Such testimony, according to appellant, amounted to impermissible \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence because it would not have been admissible during the Commonwealth\u2019s case-in-chief as evidence of motive, intent, or knowledge. As such, the testimony was collateral to the main issue of appellant\u2019s guilt of the charged offense and should not have been admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-11\">The Commonwealth responds that the sole purpose for questioning appellant was to challenge his ability to perceive and remember the events leading up to his arrest. Because appellant placed his credibility at issue when he gave a different account than Officer Lindsey of the night in question, the Commonwealth argues that any evidence tending to make its own witnesses more believable in the eyes of the jury was relevant and was properly admitted. We agree with the Commonwealth that appellant\u2019s testimony was properly admit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>ted for impeachment purposes and does not fall under the ambit of the \u201cother crimes\u201d prohibition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">To begin, appellant mischaracterizes the purpose for which the Commonwealth offered the drug use testimony. Appellant\u2019s claim that the Commonwealth\u2019s right to offer evidence of \u201cthe defendant\u2019s drug and/or alcohol use for impeachment purposes [does not] override[ ] the general rule against admission of other crimes evidence\u201d provides for an incomplete analysis. <em>See </em>Charles E. Friend, <em>Law of Evidence in Virginia </em>\u00a7 12-14(a), at 479 (6th ed. 2003) (noting that \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence is automatically excluded \u201conly where the sole purpose in introducing the evidence is to show a pre-disposition on the part of the accused to commit crime\u201d and the evidence lacks \u201csome logical bearing on a material issue\u201d). \u201cEvidence that reveals commission of another crime is not necessarily just \u2018prior crimes evidence\u2019; where relevant, such evidence may be admissible for other purposes and under other rules of evidence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">For other crimes evidence, the general rule is that in a criminal prosecution, \u201cproof which shows or tends to show that the accused is guilty of the commission of other crimes and offenses at other times ... is incompetent and inadmissible for the purpose of showing the commission of the particular crime charged.\u201d <em>Kirkpatrick v. Commonwealth, </em>211 Va. 269, 272, 176 S.E.2d 802, 805 (1970). \u201cSuch evidence implicating an accused in other crimes unrelated to the charged offense is inadmissible because it may confuse the issues being tried and cause undue prejudice to the defendant.\u201d <em>Guill v. Commonwealth, </em>255 Va. 134, 138, 495 S.E.2d 489, 491 (1998). Of course, there are exceptions to the rule. Evidence of other crimes may be admitted to impeach the credibility of the witness or criminal defendant, <em>Hackney v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 288, 293, 504 S.E.2d 385, 388 (1998), or to prove a relevant issue such as motive, intent, or knowledge of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>defendant, <em>McGowan v. Commonwealth, </em>274 Va. 689, 694, 652 S.E.2d 103, 105 (2007). However, \u201cthe circumstances [of the other event]\u201d must have an \u201cintimate connection with the main fact,\u201d and \u201cif they constitute no link in the chain of evidence ... they ought to be excluded.\u201d <em>McGowan, </em>274 Va. at 695, 652 S.E.2d at 106 (quoting <em>Guill, </em>255 Va. at 139, 495 S.E.2d at 492).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">The rules regarding the admissibility of evidence used to impeach the credibility of a witness are entirely different. \u201cWhen a witness takes the stand, she puts her credibility at issue in the case.\u201d McCarter <em>v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 502, 506, 566 S.E.2d 868, 869 (2002). Thus, the opposing party may impeach the witness by \u201cdrawing into question the accuracy of the witness\u2019s perception, recordation, recollection, narration, or sincerity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 506, 566 S.E.2d at 869-70 (quoting 1 <em>McCormick on Evidence </em>\u00a7 33 n. 5, at 123 (John W. Strong ed., 5th ed. 1999)). \u201cAny evidence which would tend to convince the jury that the witness\u2019s perception, memory, or narration is defective ... is relevant for purposes of impeachment.\u201d Friend, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 4-1, at 128. The Supreme Court of Virginia has long held that \u201cthe testimony of a witness may be impeached by a showing that he was intoxicated at the time of the occurrence of events about which he testified.\u201d <em>Burnette v. Commonwealth, </em>172 Va. 578, 581, 1 S.E.2d 268, 269 (1939); <em>see Allstate Ins. Co. v. White, </em>257 Va. 73, 76, 510 S.E.2d 461, 463 (1999) (holding that while evidence that the plaintiff had been drinking did not impeach his ability to tell the truth, it could be used to suggest \u201cthat, at the time of the accident, his perception of the details and events may have been impaired, and, therefore, that the testimony was not reliable\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">Appellant relies on the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>McGowan </em>to support his argument that his prior drug use was beyond the scope of cross-examination. In that case, the defendant was charged with unlawfully and feloniously distributing cocaine. <em>McGowan, </em>274 Va. at 692, 652 S.E.2d at 104. As part of her defense, the defendant took the stand and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>testified that she \u201cwouldn\u2019t know crack cocaine if [she] saw it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 693, 652 S.E.2d at 104. In an attempt to impeach the defendant\u2019s testimony, the Commonwealth asked her during cross-examination if she possessed cocaine when she was arrested several months later, which she denied. <em>Id. </em>The trial court allowed the Commonwealth to call the arresting detective to testify that the defendant indeed possessed cocaine on the day of her arrest. <em>Id. </em>The trial court reasoned that such testimony was admissible, holding that because the defendant \u201chad not objected to initial questions concerning her lack of knowledge of crack cocaine, she had ... \u2018opened the door\u2019 to the evidence of her later possession of the drug,\u201d and the court gave a limiting instruction to the jury to consider the subsequent possession of cocaine as evidence only of defendant\u2019s knowledge of the drug. <em>Id. </em>at 693, 652 S.E.2d at 104-05. The Supreme Court of Virginia reversed, holding that the testimony lacked probative value and was highly prejudicial. <em>Id. </em>at 696, 652 S.E.2d at 106.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">This reliance on <em>McGowan </em>is misplaced, as it is distinguishable from the case at hand and does not require the automatic prohibition of all evidence that implicates other crimes. First, the Commonwealth in that case attempted to impeach the defendant through extrinsic evidence: the testimony of the arresting detective who found the cocaine on defendant\u2019s person. Here, the Commonwealth asked appellant about his drug consumption immediately prior to the events leading up to his arrest but did not attempt to introduce extrinsic evidence. <em>See id. </em>at 695, 652 S.E.2d at 106 (allowing the Commonwealth to attack the credibility of the defendant on cross-examination, but requiring \u201c \u2018the answer of the witness [to] be conclusive\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Allen v. Commonwealth, </em>122 Va. 834, 842, 94 S.E. 783, 786 (1918))). Significantly, the Court in <em>McGowan </em>prohibited the Commonwealth from eliciting testimony during cross-examination for the purpose of contradicting the defendant afterwards through extrinsic evidence. <em>Id. </em>Here, by contrast, the Commonwealth sought to impeach statements appellant made during his direct examination by defense counsel. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cClearly, a criminal defendant ... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>cannot expect to make a misleading statement to the jury without also \u2018open[ing] the door to cross-examination for the purpose of attacking [her] credibility.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Santmier v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 318, 319-20, 228 S.E.2d 681, 682 (1976))). Moreover, the drug use at issue in <em>McGowan </em>occurred <em>after </em>the events leading up to the crime for which the defendant was charged. Thus, the subsequent possession of drugs \u201chad little, if any, tendency to prove that McGowan had knowledge of cocaine\u201d at the time of the charged crime. <em>McGowan, </em>274 Va. at 696, 652 S.E.2d at 106. Here, the Commonwealth\u2014per the trial court\u2019s instructions\u2014limited the inquiry to the time immediately prior to appellant\u2019s arrest, i.e., the time when the drugs and alcohol could have impaired appellant\u2019s perception and memory. Thus, a fair reading of <em>McGowan </em>indicates that its principles do not call for an automatic bar on all impeachment evidence that tends to implicate other crimes. Rather, <em>McGowan </em>proscribes the proper protocol for introducing such evidence so as to limit undue prejudice to the defendant and confusion to the jury. Here, the scope and manner in which the Commonwealth attempted to elicit appellant\u2019s drug and alcohol consumption were limited in nature and did not implicate the concerns addressed in <em>McGowan.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">In this case, the Commonwealth did not seek to introduce appellant\u2019s drug use testimony as substantive evidence. Rather, the Commonwealth merely sought the opportunity to \u201cimpeach! ] the credibility of [appellant]\u201d using his own admission of drug use. <em>Hackney, </em>28 Va.App. at 293, 504 S.E.2d at 388. As such, it had every right to attack the credibility of appellant when he maintained that he never made a throwing motion as he ran from the police, contrary to what Officer Lindsey testified. Thus, appellant\u2019s level of intoxication at the time of these events was highly relevant to his ability to perceive them.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Furthermore, the Commonwealth elicited this evidence in a way that conformed to our jurisprudence. As noted above, the Commonwealth limited the scope of its inquiry of appellant\u2019s consumption to the time period during which his version <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>of events diverged from Officer Lindsey\u2019s testimony. The Commonwealth did not attempt to introduce extrinsic evidence of appellant\u2019s drug and alcohol consumption. The inquiry stopped after the Commonwealth established appellant\u2019s drug consumption and its possible effect on his mental state. This approach was permissible and not inconsistent with <em>McGowan.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">FAILURE TO PROVIDE LIMITING INSTRUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">Appellant argues that even if the trial court properly admitted the testimonial evidence, it committed reversible error by failing to give a limiting instruction advising the jury that it could consider appellant\u2019s prior drug use only for impeachment purposes. Without such an instruction, appellant contends that the \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence confused the jury and unfairly suggested criminal propensity. However, appellant did not request such a limitation when the parties reviewed the original jury instructions with the trial judge. Accordingly, he asks this Court to use the \u201cends of justice\u201d exception to reverse and remand his conviction for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">Rule 5A:18 provides that \u201cNo ruling of the trial court ... will be considered as a basis for reversal unless the objection was stated together with the grounds therefor at the time of the ruling, except for good cause shown or to enable the Court of Appeals to attain the ends of justice.\u201d Accordingly, absent extenuating circumstances, unless a defendant made a contemporaneous objection at trial, he may not argue on appeal that the court erroneously instructed the jury. <em>See Wubneh v. Commonwealth, </em>51 Va.App. 224, 228, 656 S.E.2d 418, 420 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">The \u201cends of justice\u201d exception to Rule 5A:18 is \u201cnarrow and is to be used sparingly.\u201d <em>Bazemore v. Commonwealth, </em>42 Va.App. 203, 219, 590 S.E.2d 602, 609 (2004) (en banc). Generally, we will invoke the \u201cends of justice\u201d exception in relation to a jury instruction only where \u201c \u2018a granted instruction omitted some essential elements of the offense\u2019 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>\u2018no evidence was produced relating to those elements,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 219, 590 S.E.2d at 610 (quoting <em>Jimenez v. Commonwealth, </em>241 Va. 244, 251, 402 S.E.2d 678, 681-82 (1991)), or the trial court otherwise failed in its \u201c\u2018affirmative duty properly to instruct a jury'\u201d regarding a \u201c \u2018principle of law vital to a criminal defendant,\u2019 \u201d <em>Campbell v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 988, 991, 421 S.E.2d 652, 654 (1992) (quoting <em>Jimenez, </em>241 Va. at 250, 402 S.E.2d at 681).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">In this case, the limiting instruction appellant now requests does not relate to an element of the crime charged and was not vital to his defense. <em>See Gaines v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 562, 568, 574 S.E.2d 775, 778 (2003) (\u201cIt was not an abuse of discretion to fail to give a cautionary instruction <em>sua sponte </em>in this case because tactically the defendant may not have wanted the point emphasized.\u201d). Thus the \u201cends of justice\u201d exception does not excuse his failure to request such an instruction at trial. The crime at issue is whether appellant possessed a firearm as a convicted felon. Evidence regarding his intoxication was wholly separate from the main elements the Commonwealth was required to prove in order to obtain a conviction. <em>See, e.g., Campbell, </em>14 Va.App. at 992, 421 S.E.2d at 655 (remanding a conviction where the jury instructions erroneously negated the required element of intent in the crime charged, thereby relieving the Commonwealth of its burden to prove a specific intent crime). While appellant was certainly entitled to a limiting instruction <em>upon his request, </em>his failure to request one waived the right on appeal to argue his entitlement to such an instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">In short, because evidence of appellant\u2019s drug consumption at the time leading up to his arrest was relevant to his credibility and not excludable as impermissible \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting it into evidence. Further, because appellant failed to request a limiting instruction and the court\u2019s failure to give one <em>sua sponte </em>on the facts of this case was not amenable to review under the ends of justice exception to Rule 5A:18, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>do not consider that issue on the merits. For these reasons, we affirm appellant\u2019s conviction for firearm possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b161-7\">. Appellant also argues that the admission of the drug use testimony was not harmless error. Because we hold that the evidence was admissible, we need not evaluate that claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
