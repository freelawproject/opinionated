Gordon, Jr. appeals the decision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission denying him benefits on his change-in-condition application. Gordon argues on appeal that the commission\u2019s conclusion that his claim was time-barred by Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A) should be reversed because it \u201cerred in ruling that [Code \u00a7 ] 65.2-708(0 extends only once during the life of a workers\u2019 compensation case and that the tolling provision did not apply to the facts of this case.\u201d For the following reasons, we agree with Gordon and reverse the commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-10\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b660-11\">The relevant facts are not in dispute. Gordon suffered a compensable injury by accident on January 9, 2000 while working at Ford\u2019s production plant in Norfolk. Thereafter, the commission entered a series of awards to Gordon for disability benefits based on this injury. The last of these awards, entered on January 13, 2003, was an open-ended award of compensation for partial disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-12\">Pursuant to the commission\u2019s awards, Gordon intermittently received payments of compensation for various periods of temporary total and temporary partial disability. One of the periods of temporary total disability extended from January 3, 2001 to February 19, 2001. Gordon received his last payment of compensation on February 23, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>Following his injury, Gordon worked only in a light-duty position for Ford (when not temporarily totally disabled) because of restrictions arising from the injury. From October 23, 2000 through January 3, 2001 and from April 1, 2002 through June 30, 2002, Gordon worked in such a position and earned wages at or above his pre-injury wage. Gordon also worked in a light-duty capacity for Ford from April 20, 2003 through September 11, 2006, again earning wages equal to or higher than his pre-injury average weekly wage.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">On September 11, 2006, Gordon was temporarily laid off from his position at Ford because the plant was shut down for production reasons. On September 25, 2006 and again on November 6, 2006 Gordon applied for disability benefits based on lost wages caused by this change in condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">Ford defended against Gordon\u2019s application for benefits, in part, by arguing that it was not filed within two years of his last payment of compensation and thus it was barred by the statute of limitations in Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A). Relying on Code \u00a7 65.2-708(C), Gordon claimed that his application was timely because all the wages he received until April 20, 2005<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> were deemed to be compensation. He therefore asserted that the two-year statute of limitations in Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A) did not begin to run until that date. Ford responded that the extension of time provided in Code \u00a7 65.2-708(0 was triggered when Gordon returned to work, in a light-duty position, in October 2000. Ford reasoned that when Gordon was again awarded temporary total disability benefits in January 2001, the extension ended. Thus, Ford concluded, \u201cthereafter, all claims for further compensation would have to be filed within two years from the date for which compensation was last paid per [Code] \u00a7 65.2-708(A) and that [Code \u00a7 65.2-708(C) ] could not be used to extend the period during which compensation was said to be paid.\u201d Ford maintained that since Gordon was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>last paid workers\u2019 compensation benefits on February 23, 2003, he had until February 23, 2005 to apply for benefits based on a change in condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">The deputy commissioner rejected Ford\u2019s argument and awarded Gordon the benefits he requested. The deputy commissioner determined that \u201cnothing in the statute indicates that the provisions of Code \u00a7 65.2-708(C) do not begin to run anew after later periods of partial disability or temporary total disability for which awards are entered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">Ford appealed the deputy commissioner\u2019s decision to the full commission. The commission held that Gordon\u2019s change-in-condition application was time-barred. The commission explained its holding as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-7\">We have held that the term \u201cconsecutive\u201d in \u00a7 65.2-708(C) means \u201cfollowing successively without interruption.\u201d <em>Frisk v. Marshall\u2019s, </em>VWC File No. 183-99-55 (June 6, 2007); <em>Crites v. Slurry Pavers, Inc., </em>VWC File No. 202-99-47 (February 15, 2005) (finding the statute tolled only for one consecutive period). We have additionally held that this section provides <em>\u201can </em>extended limitation period\u201d and the consecutive twenty-four month period begins on the date the claimant is provided light duty work. <em>Phelps v. Safeway Stores, Inc., </em>77 OCE 138 (1998) (emphasis added), <em>affd, </em>Record No. 1246-98-4 (Ct.App.1999) (unpub.). Our holdings are consistent with the language of the statute referring to \u201ca period\u201d and not to multiple periods. <em>See also Greene v. Gwaltney of Smithfield, Inc., </em>13 Va.App. 486, 492, 413 S.E.2d 650, 654 (1992).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">Therefore, according to the commission, the Code \u00a7 65.2-708(C) tolling provision does not \u201c \u2018begin to run anew<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> after later periods of awarded disability.\u201d In other words, the provision is applicable only once to a compensable injury regardless of the number of awards of compensation for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>subsequent periods of disability that may arise from the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">Under Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A), a party may ask the commission to \u201creview any award\u201d of benefits based upon a change in condition. However, \u201c[n]o such review shall be made after twenty-four months from the last day for which compensation was paid, pursuant to an award under this title....\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A). Code \u00a7 65.2-708(C), in turn, operates as a tolling provision that extends this limitation. This tolling is effected by an expanded definition of compensation to include light-duty wages that are equal to or greater than the employee\u2019s pre-injury wages:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-7\">All wages paid, for a period not exceeding twenty-four consecutive months, to an employee (i) who is physically unable to return to his pre-injury work due to a compensable injury and (ii) who is provided work within his capacity at a wage equal to or greater than his pre-injury wage, shall be considered compensation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">Code \u00a7 65.2-708(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-9\">The parties concede that the wages paid to Gordon following his compensable injury met the statutory test, to the extent that (i) he was unable to return to his pre-injury work due to restrictions from the injury, and (ii) Ford provided him light-duty work at wages equal to or greater than his pre-injury wage. However, the parties disagree as to the meaning of the phrase \u201cfor a period not exceeding twenty-four consecutive months\u201d in Code \u00a7 65.2-708(C) as applied in this case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>Under well-settled rules of statutory construction, \u201cwe consider the language of a statute to determine the General Assembly\u2019s intent from the plain and natural meaning of the words used.\u201d <em>Alcoy v. Valley Nursing Homes, Inc., </em>272 Va. 37, 41, 630 S.E.2d 301, 303 (2006) (citations omitted). That is, \u201cwords [in a statute] are to be given their ordinary meaning, unless it is apparent that the legislative intent is otherwise.\u201d <em>Phelps v. Commonwealth, </em>275 Va. 139, 142, 654 S.E.2d 926, 927 (2008) (citations omitted). And \u201cwe must assume that \u2018the legislature chose, with care, the words it used when it enacted the relevant statute, and we are bound by those words as we interpret the statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rasmussen v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 233, 238, 522 S.E.2d 401, 403 (1999) (quoting <em>Frazier v. Commonwealth, 27 </em>Va.App. 131, 135, 497 S.E.2d 879, 881 (1998)). Furthermore, it is our \u201cduty ... \u2018to interpret the several parts of a statute as a consistent and harmonious whole so as to effectuate the legislative goal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Oraee v. Breeding, </em>270 Va. 488, 498, 621 S.E.2d 48, 52 (2005) (quoting <em>Virginia Elec. &amp; Power Co. v. Board of County Supervisors of Prince William County, </em>226 Va. 382, 387-88, 309 S.E.2d 308, 311 (1983)). Thus, we \u2018\u201cwill look to the whole body of [a statute] to determine the true intention of each part.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>McDaniel v. Commonwealth, </em>199 Va. 287, 292, 99 S.E.2d 623, 627 (1957)).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">Under the Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, a claimant may be paid compensation pursuant to multiple awards based on multiple periods of disability arising from the same compensable injury, as occurred in this case. Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A) contemplates a succession of awards by authorizing the commission to \u201creview <em>any </em>award\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> upon \u201cthe ground of a change <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>in condition,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and \u201con such review ... make an award ending, diminishing or increasing the compensation previously awarded, subject to the maximum or minimum provided in this title____\u201d (Emphasis added.) Furthermore, the two-year statute of limitations under subsection A is tolled while the claimant receives compensation. Subsection A also provides, however, that (i) a \u201cchange of condition (cause of action) must occur\u201d and (ii) the change of condition application must be filed \u201cwithin twenty-four months from the date for which the last compensation was paid.\u201d <em>Whitten v. Mead Paperboard Products, </em>4 Va.App. 182, 186, 355 S.E.2d 349, 350 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">The date for which compensation was last paid under any award is thus the determining factor as to whether a change-in-condition application is time-barred under Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A), subject to subsection C of the statute. Subsection C sets forth a caveat to the operation of the subsection A statute of limitations by providing that wages, when paid under the prescribed circumstances, are \u201cconsidered compensation.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-708(C). As a result, the payment of such wages tolls the statute of limitations in the same manner as the payment of compensation. This caveat, in turn, is subject to the condition that the wages will cease being treated as compensation at the point when <em>\u201ca </em>period\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of such payment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>of wages \u201cexceed[s] twenty-four consecutive months.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-708(C) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Accordingly, the Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A) statute of limitations runs anew under each successive award of compensation for a compensable injury, and is triggered on the last day for which compensation was paid. Subsection C, in providing for wages to be treated as compensation under subsection A, is likewise subject to application under each such award as subsection C supplements subsection A, A and C operating in conjunction with each other. Subsection C is not a stand-alone provision\u2014it instead provides a definition for the tolling mechanism applied to subsection A, when applicable. The Code \u00a7 65.2-708 change-in-condition/statute of limitations scheme thereby functions, in its entirety, on an award-by-award basis\u2014not on what amounts to a hybrid award-by-award/injury-by-injury basis under the commission\u2019s construction of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">Here, after entry of the commission\u2019s January 13, 2003 open-ended award of compensation to Gordon for partial disability, Ford placed him in a light-duty position earning wages equal to or more than his pre-injury wage. This continued, without interruption, from April 20, 2003 to September 11, 2006. Therefore, during the first twenty-four months of this period, Gordon\u2019s wages were to be \u201cconsidered compensation\u201d for purposes of tolling the Code \u00a7 65.2-708 statute of limitations. Code \u00a7 65.2-708(C). The statute of limitations was thus tolled through April 20, 2005, meaning Gordon\u2019s change-in-condition application, filed in 2006, was not time-barred under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">For these reasons, we reverse the commission\u2019s decision and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b661-6\"><em>. </em>April 20, 2005 was twenty-four months from the beginning of the April 20, 2003 to September 11, 2006 period during which Gordon worked for Ford in a light-duty capacity earning wages equal to or higher than his pre-injury average weekly wage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b662-9\">.

Maha Lakshmi Motors, Inc., </em>48 Va.App. 493, 498, 632 S.E.2d 628, 631 (2006) (\u201cWhen interpreting a statute, we must give every word some meaning where possible. To that end, we must evaluate each word within the entire phrase of which it is a part.\u201d (internal citations omitted)). Here, the legislature was specific when it defined the nature of the twenty-four-month period in Code \u00a7 65.2-708(C): the twenty-four months must be consecutive. The word \u201cconsecutive\u201d means \u201csuccessive; succeeding one another in regular order; to follow in uninterrupted succession.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>304 (6th ed.1990); <em>see also Am. Heritage Dictionary </em>313 (2d ed. 1982) (\u201cFollowing one after another without interruption.\u201d); <em>Hudson v. Youell, </em>179 Va. 442, 465, 19 S.E.2d 705, 715 (1942) (Hudgins, J., dissenting) (quoting <em>Webster\u2019s Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>to define \u201cconsecutive\u201d as \u201c \u2018[following a train; succeeding one another in a regular order; having no interval or break; <em>sequent\u2019\u201d). </em>Each month of that twenty-four-month period must \u201cfollow in uninterrupted succession.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, swpra </em>at 304. Hence, under the plain language of the statute, if there is a break in that uninterrupted succession\u2014as happened when Gordon intermittently received disability benefits rather than light-duty wages\u2014the tolling period must begin anew upon a subsequent period of light-duty employment and continues until twenty-four consecutive months have been reached. Or, in other words, the statute does not permit a combination of multiple periods of shorter duration to end the tolling provisions of subsection C. And, if multiple periods of shorter duration do not satisfy the twenty-four consecutive month period, it is illogical to think that a single period of shorter duration would do so. Had the General Assembly intended the statute to apply to any period of shorter duration, it simply would have omitted the word \u201cconsecutive\u201d and defined the period as \u201cnot to exceed twenty-four months.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\">Second, I believe that this interpretation is consistent with our stated purpose of the statute. According to our decision in <em>Scott v. Scott, </em>16 Va.App. 815, 819, 433 S.E.2d 259, 262 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>(1993), Code \u00a7 65.2-708(0 exists \u201cto prevent employers from lulling partially disabled workers into a false sense of security ... by providing employees light duty work at their pre-injury wage for two years and then terminating the employee without liability for future disability benefits.\u201d The dissent\u2019s interpretation of Code \u00a7 65.2-708(0 would cut off the tolling provision at the end of a claimant\u2019s first period of light-duty employment\u2014no matter how short the duration of that employment. Thus, after only one day of light-duty employment an employer could temporarily lay off a claimant, who would then receive temporary total disability benefits. After the claimant\u2019s return to light-duty employment for two years (the duration of the statute of limitations in subsection A), the employer could terminate the claimant with no further workers\u2019 compensation liability. This result runs contrary to the intent behind the statute, and renders subsection C meaningless.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">Finally, I must take issue with the dissent\u2019s suggestion that this interpretation ignores the phrase \u201cnot exceeding.\u201d The facts of this case demonstrate how this phrase is consistent with our reading of the statute. Here, Gordon worked in a light-duty capacity from April 20, 2003 through September 11, 2006. However, only a portion of that total period\u2014from April 20, 2003 through April 19, 2005\u2014did not exceed twenty-four months. Thus, after April 20, 2005 Gordon\u2019s light-duty wages were no longer deemed compensation and the limitation period of subsection A began.</p>\n<author id=\"b668-5\">HALEY, J.,</author>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<p id=\"Acb\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">I respectfully dissent. I would hold Code \u00a7 65.2-708(0 provides only one extension of the statute of limitations contained in Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A). Since the time provided by the statute of limitations, even with the extension contained in subsection (C), expired before Gordon filed his claim, I would hold Gordon\u2019s claim time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">In relevant part, Code \u00a7 65.2-708 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>A.

The Code contains this limitation by authorizing tolling of <em>\u201ca period not exceeding </em>twenty-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>four <em>consecutive </em>months.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-708(C) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\">Although the majority holds the General Assembly intended to permit multiple periods of extension, our case law shows the language of \u201ca period\u201d contemplates only one period. Our Supreme Court addressed this issue in <em>Corns v. School Board of Russell County, </em>249 Va. 343, 454 S.E.2d 728 (1995). There the Court considered the meaning of statutory language requiring \u201c[a] probationary term of service for three years\u201d for teachers. <em>Id. </em>at 349, 454 S.E.2d at 732. The Court held that while the phrase \u201cservice for three years\u201d could \u201cbe interpreted as service in each of three intermittent school years ... [t]he words \u2018a term\u2019 mean one such period.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Van Dresser v. Firlings, </em>305 Mass. 51, 24 N.E.2d 969, 970 (1940) (\u201cThe word \u2018period\u2019 as applied to time carries with it the idea of the separation of a designated interval of time from the flow of time in general. The words \u2018a period\u2019 do not readily expand to include an irregular succession of times or periods of varying length____\u201d). As applied here, the language in Code \u00a7 65.2-708(0 of \u201ca period\u201d likewise means one period. It was not necessary for the General Assembly to use the word \u201cone\u201d to indicate one period.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">If the General Assembly had intended to permit multiple periods of tolling under Code \u00a7 65.2-708(C), it could have easily done this by writing the statute to authorize <em>\u201cperiods </em>not exceeding twenty-four consecutive months.\u201d It seems more rational to use the plural to mean the plural than to use the singular to mean the plural, as the majority holds. Long ago Justice Hudgins suggested as much when he remarked that \u201cit would be unreasonable to state that \u2018periods\u2019 refer to \u2018one single term.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hudson v. Youell, </em>179 Va. 442, 465, 19 S.E.2d 705, 716 (1942) (Hudgins, J., dissenting); <em>cf. Rasmussen v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 233, 237-39, 522 S.E.2d 401, 403-04 (1999) (holding that where a scientific test took multiple samples to produce a single result and the statute gave the defendant the right to observe the \u201cbreath test,\u201d \u201csample,\u201d and \u201cblood alcohol reading,\u201d phrased in the singular, the defendant only had the right to see the final printed result).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>When combined with the language of a single period, the statutory grant of an extension <em>\u201cnot exceeding </em>twenty-four consecutive months\u201d also evidences an intent to limit tolling to a defined period. Code \u00a7 65.2-708(C). The term \u201cnot exceeding\u201d is defined: \u201cUsually a term of limitation only, denoting uncertainty of amount.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1061 (6th ed.1990). Our Supreme Court has referred similarly to the term, calling it \u201cclear words of limitation.\u201d <em>Southern Ry. Co. v. Commonwealth, </em>206 Va. 831, 836, 147 S.E.2d 72, 75 (1966). Another court stated that \u201cnot exceeding\u201d means an amount \u201cshall not be more, but may be less.\u201d <em>Stuyvesant Ins. Co. v. Jacksonville Oil Mill, </em>10 F.2d 54, 56 (6th Cir.1926). The court remarked that any other interpretation \u201cdoes violence to the plain and unambiguous language.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Still another court held that where a contract required a company to operate a business \u201cfor a period \u2018not to exceed sixty days,\u2019 \u201d any amount up to sixty days satisfied the contract. <em>Union Liquors, Inc. v. Finkel &amp; Lasarow, Inc., </em>44 Cal.App.2d 706, 113 P.2d 19, 21 (1941). Thus, the words \u201cnot exceeding\u201d in Code \u00a7 65.2-708(C) reveal the General Assembly\u2019s intention to limit the tolling of the statute of limitations to up to, but no more than twenty-four consecutive months. <em>See also Rohanna v. Commonwealth, </em>168 Va. 696, 701, 190 S.E. 171, 173 (1937) (holding that where a statute authorized a court to require a criminal defendant to give a bond for \u201ca term not exceeding one year,\u201d the court lacked power to require bonds beyond the term of the initial year); <em>Cox v. Hagan, </em>125 Va. 656, 680, 100 S.E. 666, 674 (1919) (using \u201cnot exceeding\u201d to refer to up to a maximum amount). Twenty-four consecutive months represents the maximum extension.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">The majority\u2019s conclusion allows numerous periods of tolling, thereby negating the General Assembly\u2019s intent that the tolling not exceed twenty-four consecutive months. Suppose, for example, that an employee sustains a compensable injury, then works forty-seven months in a job tolling the statute of limitations for the first twenty-four months. The employee then briefly leaves work and collects benefits due to the injury. Under the majority\u2019s holding, such an employee re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>ceives an additional twenty-four months of tolling upon returning since the statute of limitations under Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A) never fully expired. I believe this runs plainly contrary to the General Assembly\u2019s intent to provide a limited benefit of tolling.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">The concurrence\u2019s conclusion that the term \u201cconsecutive\u201d means the period of extension described in Code \u00a7 65.2-708(C) must run until reaching twenty-four months misconstrues the statutory language of \u201cnot exceeding.\u201d As mentioned above, the term \u201cnot exceeding\u201d is defined: \u201cUsually a term of limitation only, denoting uncertainty of amount.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, supra </em>at 1061. \u201cThe words \u2018not exceeding,\u2019 in themselves, are words not of grant or apportionment, but of limitation only, and standing alone are ordinarily so construed.\u201d <em>City of Kingsville v. Meredith, </em>103 F.2d 279, 281-82 (5th Cir.1939); <em>see also Boston &amp; M.R.R. v. United States, </em>265 F. 578, 579 (1st Cir.1920). \u201cThe words denote uncertainty of amount. Such language imposes no duty to adopt the maximum amount rather than some lesser amount authorized.\u201d <em>Saxhaug v. County of Jackson, </em>215 Minn. 490, 10 N.W.2d 722, 724 (1943) (citation omitted). Hence, the meaning of a term \u201cnot exceeding twenty-four consecutive months\u201d is a period up to, but no more than twenty-four consecutive months. Any length of time from a day to two years is a period not exceeding twenty-four consecutive months. As the dictionary states, the time is unspecified. Yet for the concurrence, the statute specifies a twenty-four month period. This changes the language of \u201ca period not exceeding twenty-four consecutive months\u201d to \u201ca period equal to twenty-four consecutive months.\u201d I cannot reconcile \u201cnot exceeding\u201d with \u201cequal to.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>Further contrary to the concurrence and generally supporting my position, the General Assembly could have good reason to include the word \u201cconsecutive\u201d without intending to guarantee a full twenty-four-month period. Consecutive is defined: \u201cSuccessive; succeeding one another in regular order; to follow in uninterrupted succession.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, swpra </em>at 304; <em>see also Hudson, </em>179 Va. at 465, 19 S.E.2d at 715 (Hudgins, J., dissenting) (quoting <em>Webster\u2019s International Dictionary </em>to define \u201cconsecutive\u201d as \u201c \u2018[following in a train; succeeding one another in a regular order; having no interval or break; <em>sequent \u2019 </em>\u201d). This Court has further noted that as applied to time the inclusion of the word consecutive connotes a definite period. <em>Va. Employment Comm\u2019n v. Davenport, </em>29 Va.App. 26, 30, 509 S.E.2d 522, 524 (1999). By including the word \u201cconsecutive,\u201d the General Assembly could intend that the single period provided be temporally whole. In other words, the period could not begin, stop, and then begin again until the time reached twenty-four months. Such a result could cause lengthy protraction of a claim, defeating the purpose of the statute of limitations.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The word \u201cconsecutive\u201d remedies these possible ills; it does not reveal a guarantee of time, especially given the other statutory language.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">In summary, the language of Code \u00a7 65.2-708(C) provides only one period of extension from the statute of limitations in Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A). The language authorizing \u201ca period\u201d rather than \u201cperiods\u201d denotes a single period. Taken together, the words \u201cnot exceeding\u201d and \u201cconsecutive\u201d show the General Assembly desired an extension of the statute of limitations up to but no greater than twenty-four consecutive months.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">Aside from this textual analysis, the majority ignores an important principle of statutory construction: \u201cIt is well settled that where the construction of a statute has been uniform <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>for many years in the administrative practice, and has been acquiesced in by the General Assembly, such construction is entitled to great weight with the courts.\u201d <em>Dan River Mills, Inc. v.

Radiator &amp; Standard Sanitary Corp., </em>202 Va. 13, 19, 116 S.E.2d 44, 48 (1960) (\u201cThe elementary rule of statutory construction is that the construction accorded a statute by public officials charged with its administration and enforcement is entitled to be given weight by the court. The legislature is presumed to be cognizant of such construction.\u201d); <em>Chauncey F. Hutter, Inc. v. Va. Employment Comm\u2019n, </em>50 Va.App. 590, 594, 652 S.E.2d 151, 153 (2007); <em>cf.
