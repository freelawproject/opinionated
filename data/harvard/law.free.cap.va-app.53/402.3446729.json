HUMPHREYS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b445-12\">This matter comes before the Court on a rehearing <em>en banc </em>following a divided panel opinion of this Court. Shakil Edwards (Edwards) appeals her conviction for possession of a tool, implement or outfit with the intent to commit larceny, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-94. Edwards contends that the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to prove that the purse she carried at the time she committed the larceny was a tool, implement or outfit within the meaning of Code \u00a7 18.2-94. For the following reasons, we agree and reverse her conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">\u201cUnder well-settled principles of appellate review, we consider the evidence presented at trial in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the prevailing party in the circuit court.\u201d <em>Porter v. Commonwealth, </em>276 Va. 203, 215-16, 661 S.E.2d 415, 419 (2008). However, the facts of this case are not in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">On June 23, 2006, Edwards entered a department store in Chesterfield County with three other women. Each woman carried a purse that \u201cappeared to be concave\u201d and not \u201cfull like a typical woman\u2019s purse looks.\u201d A department store security guard observed the women taking clothing from the children\u2019s and juniors\u2019 sections of the store and carrying it into the fitting room area. When the women exited the fitting rooms, their purses appeared \u201clarger in size.\u201d After the women left, the security guard entered the fitting rooms, found empty hangers on the floor, and discovered that merchandise was missing from the children\u2019s and juniors\u2019 sections.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">The security guard stopped Edwards and the other women after they left the store. The security guard found four items of children\u2019s clothing inside Edwards\u2019 purse. The three other women also had stolen merchandise in their purses. Other than the stolen merchandise, three of the women\u2019s purses, including Edwards\u2019 purse, were completely empty. The fourth woman had a pair of slippers in her purse. Edwards admitted that they entered the store to steal merchandise and that she had stolen the clothing found in her purse. She was arrested and subsequently charged with grand larceny and possession of a tool, implement or outfit with the intent to commit larceny.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">At the conclusion of the Commonwealth\u2019s case-in-chief, Edwards moved to strike the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, arguing that her purse was not a tool, implement or outfit. The trial court denied the motion. Edwards testified in her own defense and admitted to stealing the clothing. Edwards also explained why she carried an empty purse into the store. The trial court asked Edwards, \u201cWhy were you carrying an empty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>purse around?\u201d Edwards answered, \u201cOh, \u2018cause I wanted to go to the store and steal.\u201d \u201cAnd steal?\u201d responded the judge. Edwards replied, \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">At the close of her case, Edwards again moved to strike the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence on the grounds that her purse was not a \u201ctool, implement or outfit\u201d as contemplated by Code \u00a7 18.2-94. The court denied her motion, finding that the purse \u201cwas used to steal, and ... it fits within the definition of burglary tools.\u201d The trial court subsequently convicted Edwards of petit larceny<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and possession of burglarious tools. Edwards appealed her conviction for possession of burglarious tools to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">On May 27, 2008, a divided three-judge panel of this Court reversed Edwards\u2019 conviction. The majority held that Edwards\u2019 purse is not a tool, implement or outfit within the meaning of Code \u00a7 18.2-94. The dissent reasoned then, as it does today, that Edwards, by emptying the purse of all its contents, \u201cclearly used the purse for a purpose other than its ordinary, lawful one, thereby causing it to become something other than an ordinary purse.\u201d <em>Edwards v. Commonwealth, </em>52 Va.App. 70, 79, 661 S.E.2d 488, 493 (2008) (Beales, J., dissenting). The dissent concluded that Edwards\u2019 purse was an \u201coutfit\u201d within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">The Commonwealth petitioned the full Court for rehearing <em>en banc. </em>On July 1, 2008, we granted the Commonwealth\u2019s petition and stayed the mandate of the panel opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">On appeal, Edwards reiterates her argument that her purse is not a tool, implement or outfit. She claims that this is so because her purse \u201ccan in no way be considered innately burglarious in character.\u201d The Commonwealth argues that tools, implements and outfits need not be \u201cinnately burglari<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>ous\u201d to fall within the scope of Code \u00a7 18.2-94 and that Edwards\u2019 purse is an \u201coutfit,\u201d within the meaning of the statute. We agree with the Commonwealth that Code \u00a7 18.2-94 does not apply only to burglarious tools, implements and outfits. However, we disagree with the Commonwealth\u2019s characterization of the purse as an \u201coutfit.\u201d Thus, for the following reasons, we hold that Edwards\u2019 possession of the purse is not punishable under Code \u00a7 18.2-94.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">First, contrary to Edwards\u2019 argument, Code \u00a7 18.2-94 does not apply only to \u201cinnately burglarious\u201d items. Code \u00a7 18.2-94 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-6\">If any person have in his possession any tools, implements or outfit, with intent to commit burglary, robbery or larceny, upon conviction thereof he shall be guilty of a Class 5 felony. The possession of such burglarious tools, implements or outfit by any person other than a licensed dealer, shall be prima facie evidence of an intent to commit burglary, robbery or larceny.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">Under a cursory reading of the statute, there appears to be a disconnect between the first and second sentences. The first sentence criminalizes the possession of <em>\u201cany </em>tools, implements or outfit[s]\u201d with the intent to commit one of the listed crimes. <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). However, the second sentence, apparently referring to the first sentence, states <em>\u201csuch burglarious </em>tools, implements or outfit[s]____\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). One might read the word \u201csuch burglarious tools ...\u201d in the second sentence as modifying the first or at least indicating that the General Assembly only intended to punish the possession of <em>burglarious </em>tools, implements and outfits.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-10\">However, in <em>Burnette v. Commonwealth, </em>194 Va. 785, 75 S.E.2d 482 (1958), the Supreme Court explained that the use of the word \u201csuch\u201d was simply surplusage. The Court noted that the original version of Code \u00a7 18.2-94, enacted in 1887, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-11\">\u201cIf any person ha[v]e in his possession any tools, implements, or other outfit <em>known as burglars\u2019 tools, implements, or outfit, </em>with intent to commit burglary, robbery, or larce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>ny, he shall be deemed guilty of a felony, and on conviction thereof, shall be punished by confinement in the penitentiary not less than five nor more than ten years. The possession of such burglarious tools, implements, or outfit, shall be prima facie evidence of an intent to commit burglary, robbery, or larceny.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 787-88, 75 S.E.2d at 484 (quoting Code of 1919, sec 4437) (emphasis added). In 1919, the General Assembly amended the statute, removing the phrase \u201cknown as burglars\u2019 tools, implements, or outfit\u201d from the first sentence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Supreme Court explained the effect of that amendment on the rest of the statute, particularly the word \u201csuch\u201d: \u201cThe word \u2018such,\u2019 as originally used was descriptive and relative, and its antecedent was \u2018known as burglars\u2019 tools, implements, or outfit.\u2019 Elimination of this antecedent <em>left the word meaningless; </em>and the Revisors\u2019 failure to eliminate it also was obviously inadvertent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 788, 75 S.E.2d at 484 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">If, as Edwards argues, the word \u201cburglarious\u201d still modifies the words \u201ctools, implements or outfit\u201d in the first sentence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>\u201csuch\u201d would then clearly not be meaningless. Essentially, Edwards contends that the statute should be read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACF\">If any person have in his possession any [burglarious] tools, implements or outfit, with intent to commit burglary, robbery or larceny, upon conviction thereof he shall be guilty of a Class 5 felony. The possession of such burglarious tools, implements or outfit by any person other than a licensed dealer, shall be prima facie evidence of an intent to commit burglary, robbery or larceny.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Clearly, inserting \u201cburglarious\u201d into the first sentence gives meaning to \u201csuch\u201d in the second sentence. Contrary to the holding in <em>Burnette, </em>Edwards\u2019 interpretation makes \u201csuch\u201d \u201cdescriptive and relative\u201d as it would clearly refer to the burglarious tools, implements and outfits mentioned in the first sentence. \u201cSuch\u201d is only meaningless if the tools, implements and outfit in the first sentence are something broader, or at least different, from the burglarious tools, implements and outfit in the second sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">Reading the first sentence as applying to all tools, implements or outfits and the second sentence as applying only to burglarious tools, implements and outfits relieves any tension between the two sentences. <em>Burnette </em>implied as much when it explained the basis for distinguishing between ordinary tools and burglarious tools. The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-7\">[T]ooIs or implements may be, and usually are, designed and manufactured for lawful purposes. But it is unusual for a person, on a lawful mission, to have in his possession a combination of tools and implements suitable and appropriate to accomplish the destruction of any ordinary hindrance of access to any building, or to a vault or safe. All the statute does is to create a presumption of a criminal intent from proof of possession of <em>burglarious </em>tools or implements.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_O\"><em>Id. </em>at 790, 75 S.E.2d at 486 (emphasis added). Viewing burglarious tools as a subset of the larger categories of tools in the first sentence, the presumption of criminal intent in the second sentence makes sense. Code \u00a7 18.2-94 criminalizes the possession of <em>any </em>tool, implement or outfit with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>requisite intent. The second sentence merely recognizes that the burglarious nature of certain tools makes it so unusual for a person to lawfully possess them, that mere possession of the tools is indicative of a criminal intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Construing the statute in this way is consistent with prior precedent. In <em>Moss v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 1, 5, 509 S.E.2d 510, 512 (1999), we explained \u201cCode \u00a7 18.2-94 requires proof that the offending tools, implements or outfit were intrinsically \u2018burglarious\u2019 only when the Commonwealth relies upon the statutory presumption to establish the requisite criminal intent.\u201d We held that the Commonwealth may convict someone of possessing non-burglarious tools with the requisite criminal intent. However, it must do so \u201cwithout benefit of the statutory presumption.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3, 509 S.E.2d at 511. Thus, we reject Edwards\u2019 argument that the evidence was insufficient merely because her purse was not burglarious. However, that conclusion does not end our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">In order to convict Edwards under Code \u00a7 18.2-94, the Commonwealth was required to prove that Edwards\u2019 purse was either a tool, implement or outfit. \u201cThe terms \u2018tools,\u2019 \u2018implements,\u2019 and \u2018outfit\u2019 are not defined statutorily.\u201d <em>Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>50 Va.App. 337, 342, 649 S.E.2d 717, 719 (2007). However, we have defined each of these terms in previous cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">In <em>Williams, </em>we recognized that \u201c[cjlearly, the terms \u2018tool,\u2019 \u2018implement\u2019 and \u2018outfit\u2019 have somewhat different but overlapping meanings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 343, 649 S.E.2d at 720. Consistent with that principle, we explained that a \u201ctool\u201d is \u201can instrument (as a hammer or saw) used or worked by hand,\u201d or \u201can implement or object used in performing an operation or carrying on work of any kind.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We went on to define \u201cimplements\u201d as \u201citems associated with devices, instruments, equipment or machinery as they relate to an occupation or profession.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 345, 649 S.E.2d at 721. In doing so, we explained that giving a broader interpretation to \u201ctools\u201d and \u201cimplements\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>would lead to \u201cabsurd results.\u201d <em>See Washington [v. Commonwealth, </em>272 Va. 449, 455, 634 S.E.2d 310, 313 (2006)]. For example, one obvious result ... would be that every concealment of merchandise in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-103, regardless of the item\u2019s value, would also constitute a Class 5 felony under Code \u00a7 18.2-94 because any and every item used to accomplish the element of concealment from public view, such as a purse, coat or a pocket, would also constitute a \u201clarcenous implement.\u201d Had the General Assembly intended such a result, they would have punished the crime of concealment accordingly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 342, 649 S.E.2d at 719.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">Clearly, an ordinary purse is neither a \u201ctool\u201d nor an \u201cimplement\u201d as we defined those terms in <em>Williams. </em>However, it remains for us to determine whether a purse constitutes an \u201coutfit\u201d as contemplated by Code \u00a7 18.2-94. In doing so, we conclude that our holding that a broad definition of tools, implements and outfits would lead to absurd results is inconsistent with our earlier definition of \u201coutfit.\u201d In <em>Mercer v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 380, 384, 512 S.E.2d 173, 175 (1999), we referred to \u201ccommonly accepted definitions\u201d to define \u201coutfit.\u201d Those definitions are \u201c(1) the act or process of fitting out or equipping, (2) materials, tools, or implements comprising the equipment necessary for carrying out a particular project, and (3) wearing apparel designed to be worn on a special occasion or in a particular situation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Of those definitions, we focused on the third one in particular.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">Under <em>Mercer\u2019s </em>definition of outfit, the possession of any \u201cwearing apparel\u201d that a thief chose to wear for the \u201cparticular\u201d purpose of committing burglary, robbery or larceny would be punishable under Code \u00a7 18.2-94. That broad definition of outfit would lead precisely to the \u201cabsurd results\u201d we warned of in Williams\u2014the conclusion that any and every item of apparel used to accomplish the element of concealment from public view, such as a coat or a pocket, would also constitute a \u201clarcenous outfit.\u201d As we explained in <em>Williams, </em>the General Assembly could not have intended that result.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>The broad definition used in <em>Mercer </em>is also inconsistent with the traditional rule of statutory construction known as <em>noscitur a sociis. Noscitur a sociis </em>is the principle that \u201ca word is known by the company it keeps.\u201d <em>S.D. Warren Co. v. Maine Bd. of Envtl. Prot., 547 </em>U.S. 370, 378, 126 S.Ct. 1843, 1849, 164 L.Ed.2d 625 (2006). It \u201cprovides that the meaning of a word takes color and expression from the purport of the entire phrase of which it is a part, and it must be read in harmony with its context.\u201d <em>Turner v. Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 456, 460, 309 S.E.2d 337, 339 (1983). To define \u201coutfit\u201d as wearing apparel would be to distinguish it from \u201cthe company it keeps.\u201d <em>S.D. Warren Co., 547 </em>U.S. at 378, 126 S.Ct. at 1849. Rather than defining \u201coutfit\u201d broadly as \u201cwearing apparel,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we conclude today that the other definitions referenced in <em>Mercer </em>are more consistent with our previous definitions of \u201ctools\u201d and \u201cimplements.\u201d Indeed, as is implicit in the first definition noted in <em>Mercer, </em>the etymology of the term \u201coutfit\u201d is from the phrase \u201cfit out\u201d or equip, such as to outfit a ship for a voyage. <em>See The Century Dictionary, An Encyclopedic Lexicon of the English Language </em>4183 (1914). In light of the definitions of the words \u201ctools\u201d and \u201cimplements\u201d immediately preceding \u201coutfit\u201d\u2014terms with which \u201coutfit\u201d has an \u201coverlapping meaning[ ],\u201d <em>Williams, </em>50 Va.App. at 343, 649 S.E.2d at 720,\u2014we overrule <em>Mercer </em>to the extent that it defines \u201coutfit\u201d as \u201cwearing apparel\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and hold that, in the context of Code \u00a7 18.2-94, the appropriate definition of \u201coutfit\u201d is \u201cthe articles forming an equipment\u201d or \u201cthe tools or instruments comprised in any special equipment; as a carpenter\u2019s or a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>surgeon\u2019s outfit.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary of the English Language, Second Edition </em>1733 (1948).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Under that definition, we hold that an ordinary purse is not \u201cspecial equipment\u201d for the purpose of shoplifting. The fact that Edwards deliberately emptied the purse in order to facilitate a theft does not change that fact. Emptying the purse to conceal stolen items does not convert the purse into a shoplifter\u2019s \u201coutfit\u201d anymore than slipping a hammer into one\u2019s belt would convert the belt into a tool belt and thus make it part of a carpenter\u2019s \u201coutfit.\u201d Thus, in the case before us, Edwards\u2019 purse does not constitute a larcenous \u201coutfit\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 18.2-94.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">For these reasons, we hold that the trial court erred in holding that the evidence was sufficient as a matter of law to prove that Edwards violated Code \u00a7 18.2-94. Therefore, we reverse her conviction and dismiss the indictment for that offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b447-10\">. At trial, the Commonwealth failed to prove that the clothing Edwards stole was worth over $200. Thus, the court only convicted her of petit larceny rather than grand larceny. See Code \u00a7 18.2-95.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b449-7\">. As codified in 1919, the statute in its entirety read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-8\">If any person break and enter the dwelling-house of another in the night time with the intent to commit a felony or larceny therein, he shall be deemed guilty of burglary, though the thing stolen or intended to be stolen, be of less value than fifty dollars. If any person be guilty of burglary, he shall be punished with death, or in the discretion of the jury, by confinement in the penitentiary for not less than five nor more than eighteen years. If any person have in their possession any tools, implements or outfit, with the intent to commit burglary, robbery, or larceny, he shall be deemed guilty of a felony, and be punished by confinement in the penitentiary not less than five nor more than eighteen years. The possession of such burglarious tools, implements, or outfit by other than a licensed dealer shall be prima facie evidence of an intent to commit burglary, robbery or larceny.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">Code of 1919, Sec. 4437. The Revisors\u2019 note referred to in <em>Burnette </em>immediately follows the above paragraph and reads in full as follows: \"The phraseology of this section has been changed so as to include common law burglary under the statute, and there is a transposition of sentences at the beginning of the section, but no material change has been intended.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b453-5\">. \"Wearing apparel\u201d is itself a broad term and in the context of clothing, \"outfit,\u201d customarily refers to a \"set of garments\u201d rather than a single item or accessory e.g. a new Easter outfit and would not, in any event, include a purse which is carried rather than worn. <em>See Oxford\u2019s English Dictionary </em>1015 (1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b453-6\">. Although we overrule <em>Mercer\u2019s </em>definition of outfit, we do not pass judgment on whether the pants worn by the appellant in <em>Mercer </em>fall within the scope of the statute.

Commonwealth, </em>194 Va. 785, 75 S.E.2d 482 (1953), and the legislative history of Code \u00a7 18.2-94, constrains this Court to construe Code \u00a7 18.2-94 as prohibiting only the possession, with the requisite intent, of \u201cburglarious tools,\u201d i.e., those tools, implements, or outfit that are \u201csuitable and appropriate to accomplish the destruction of any ordinary hindrance of access to any building, or to a vault or safe.\u201d <em>Burnette, </em>194 Va. at 790, 75 S.E.2d at 486.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">The statute creating the crime of possessing \u201cburglarious tools, implements or outfit\u201d was part of legislation first adopted by the General Assembly in 1878 (Acts of 1877-78, p. 288), and as the <em>Burnette </em>Court noted, the statute read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AK\">\u201cAny person who shall be guilty of burglary, shall be punished with death, or, in the discretion of the jury, by confinement in the penitentiary for a period not less than five nor more than eighteen years. If a person break and enter the dwelling-house of another in the night time, with intent to commit larceny, he shall be deemed guilty of burglary, though the thing stolen, or intended to be stolen, be of less value than twenty dollars.

The possession of such burglarious tools, implements, or outfit, shall be <em>prima facie </em>evidence of an intent to commit burglary, robbery, or larceny.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Avl\"><em>Burnette, </em>194 Va. at 787-88, 75 S.E.2d at 484.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">The 1878 statute codified burglary as it then existed and created a statutory offense to possess \u201cburglarious tools, implements, or other outfit known as burglar\u2019s tools, implements, or outfit, with the intent to commit burglary, robbery or larceny....\u201d The \u201cburglarious tools, implements or outfit\u201d in the statute were \u201cknown as burglar\u2019s tools.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">The statute continued in that form without change in the Code of 1887 as section 3704. However, in 1919 the language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>of the statute was altered by transposing several sentences, and included the definition of common law burglary and omitted the descriptive phrase \u201cknown as burglar\u2019s tools, implements, or outfit.\u201d The 1919 Code Revisors\u2019 note to the amended code section stated: \u201cThe phraseology of this section has been changed so as to include common law burglary in the definition of burglary under the statute, and there is a transposition of sentences at the beginning of the section, <em>but no material change has been intended.\u201d Burnette, </em>194 Va. at 788, 75 S.E.2d at 484.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">At its 1950 Session, the General Assembly recodified the earlier statute as Code \u00a7 18-159. The recodified statute included the same two criminal provisions, burglary and the possession of \u201cburglarious tools\u201d with the requisite intent, as was in the 1919 statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">In 1953, in <em>Burnette, </em>the Supreme Court, considering a constitutional challenge to the evidentiary presumption contained in Code \u00a7 18-159, noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-7\">[t]he statutory crime with which defendant is charged consists of two essential elements: (1) possession of <em>burglarious tools; </em>and (2) an intent to commit burglary, robbery, or larceny therewith. The burden was upon the Commonwealth to prove possession of such tools by defendant beyond a reasonable doubt. The statute makes possession <em>prima facie </em>evidence of the criminal intent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 792, 75 S.E.2d at 487 (emphasis added). There the Supreme Court clearly declared that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-9\">[t]he mere possession of burglarious tools is not a crime under the statute. It is possession with intent to use them to commit a crime. The tools or implements may be, and usually are, designed and manufactured for lawful purposes. But it is unusual for a person, on a lawful mission, to have in his possession a combination of tools and implements suitable and appropriate to accomplish the destruction of any ordinary hindrance of access to any building, or to a vault or safe.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 790, 75 S.E.2d at 486. It concluded that the combination of tools at issue there,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-5\">a loaded 32-caliber Colt\u2019s blue steel revolver, two new 10 inch hacksaw blades ..., [ ] one pair of white cotton gloves[,] ... one 36 inch pick, one 30 inch wrecking bar[,] one 3 pound sledge hammer[,] one 18 inch screw driver[,] one two-cell flashlight, one 1/2 inch steel drill bit, one 7/16 inch steel drill bit[,] ... four 1/4 inch steel drill bits[,] ... [and] one pair of work gloves with buck palms and cotton baeks[,]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">while designed for, and adaptable to, lawful uses, \u201cwere implements and tools commonly used by house breakers and safe crackers,\u201d which \u201cprove[d] that they were \u2018burglarious tools\u2019 within the meaning of the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 791, 792, 75 S.E.2d at 486, 487.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">Subsequently, at its 1960 session, the General Assembly recodified Code \u00a7 18-159, creating two separate statutes embodying the two substantive offenses formerly contained in Code \u00a7 18-159: Code \u00a7 18.1-61 (burglary) and Code \u00a7 18.1-87 (possession of \u201cburglarious tools, implements or outfit\u201d). At its 1975 session, the General Assembly again recodified Code \u00a7 18.1-87, this time as Code \u00a7 18.2-94, the code section under which appellant was convicted. It placed Code \u00a7 18.2-94 in Chapter 5, Article 2 of Title 18.2, entitled \u201cBurglary and Related Offenses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">Since its inception in 1878, the crime of possession of \u201cburglarious tools\u201d has been combined with and associated with the crime of burglary. That the General Assembly has since 1878 continually placed the statutory offense of possession of \u201cburglarious tools\u201d in that part of the Code pertaining to burglary demonstrates, in my view, that the General Assembly intended to retain the close historical connection between the offenses of the possession of \u201cburglarious tools, implements or outfit\u201d and burglary. Expanding the meaning of \u201cburglarious tools, implements or outfit\u201d beyond \u201ca combination of tools and implements suitable and appropriate to accomplish the destruction of any ordinary hindrance of access <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>to any building, or to a vault or safe,\u201d is, in my view, a departure from its historical mooring, particularly considering the legislative history of the \u201cburglarious tools\u201d statute and the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis of Code \u00a7 18.2-94\u2019s predecessor, Code \u00a7 18-159, in <em>Burnette.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">In my view, this Court, in <em>Mercer v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 380, 512 S.E.2d 173 (1999), erroneously began a journey away from the established construction of the \u201cburglarious tools\u201d statute, finding that an altered pair of pants, used to facilitate shoplifting, was a \u201clarcenous outfit.\u201d While I concur in the judgment of the majority overruling <em>Mercer </em>\u201cto the extent that it defines \u2018outfit\u2019 [under Code \u00a7 18.2-94] as \u2018wearing apparel,\u2019 \u201d in my view, the majority errs in not overruling our holding in <em>Mercer </em>in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">Accordingly, while I concur in the judgment of the majority in concluding that appellant\u2019s purposefully emptied purse, used to conceal merchandise which she had stolen, was not a \u201ctool\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 18.2-94, I am unable to join in its rationale, which in my view unnecessarily expands those items made criminal by Code \u00a7 18.2-94 to include items not \u201csuitable and appropriate to accomplish the destruction of any ordinary hindrance of access to any building, or to a vault or safe.\u201d <em>Burnette, </em>194 Va. at 790, 75 S.E.2d at 486. If the General Assembly had desired to expand the statutory definition of \u201cany tool[ ], implement ] or outfit\u201d beyond that which, in my view, is compelled by the existing statute, it clearly could have done so.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b458-7\">BEALES, J., with whom KELSEY and HALEY, JJ.,</author>\n<p id=\"An1\">join, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">Although I agree with the majority that Code \u00a7 18.2-94 does not solely criminalize possession of just \u201cburglarious\u201d tools, implements, and outfits, I would find here, given appellant\u2019s preparation of her purse before she entered the store so that it better assisted her with her plan to commit larceny by inconspicuously stealing merchandise, that the trial court did not err in convicting her under Code \u00a7 18.2-94. Therefore, I must dissent from the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>Code \u00a7 18.2-94 criminalizes the possession of \u201cany tools, implements <em>or </em>outfit, with intent to commit burglary, robbery <em>or </em>larceny\u201d (emphasis added), as a Class 5 felony. The legislature\u2019s use of the term \u201cor\u201d twice in this statute is important, both linguistically and conceptually, because the placement of \u201cor\u201d in these lists creates two sets of disjunctive variables, thus creating nine combinations of words: burglary tools, larcenous outfits, robbery implements, and so on. Thus, the statute by its plain language prohibits the possession of nine categories of items, if the perpetrator possesses any of them with the requisite criminal intent. The one thing the statute clearly does not do\u2014as its title misleadingly suggests<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u2014is criminalize <em>only </em>possession of <em>just </em>burglary tools, that is, tools (not implements or outfits) possessed with the intention to use them in the commission of burglary (not robbery or larceny). <em>See Moss v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 1, 3-4, 509 S.E.2d 510, 511 (1999) (noting, \u201cThe gravamen of the offense arises from the possessor\u2019s \u2018intent to use\u2019 these \u2018common, ordinary' objects [tools, implements, or outfits] for a criminal purpose specified by statute, <em>burglary, robbery or larceny\u201d). </em>Therefore, I agree with the majority opinion that a trial court can convict a defendant under Code \u00a7 18.2-94 for possessing a larcenous outfit, even where the evidence did not prove that the outfit was also burglarious.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">However, after reviewing the facts in this case and the relevant law, I must respectfully disagree with the majority opinion\u2019s conclusion that possession of this purse was not criminal behavior as defined by Code \u00a7 18.2-94. In the case currently before us, appellant chose a particular purse, emp<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>tied it, and carried it into the store with the admitted intention to use the purse to hide items that she was stealing from the store. Thus, the issue in this case is whether a purse, purposefully emptied of everything that it would ordinarily contain so that it can be used for shoplifting, can be considered a larcenous \u201coutfit.\u201d As opposed to the majority opinion\u2019s definition of \u201coutfit,\u201d I define \u201coutfit\u201d by reference to the plain meaning of the term and our previous precedent, and, therefore, I would find the trial court did not err in finding appellant violated Code \u00a7 18.2-94 when she prepared and carried the purse into the store with the intention to use the purse as an aid to her plan to steal from the store. Therefore, I must dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">When \u201ca statute contains no express definition of a term, the general rule of statutory construction is to infer the legislature\u2019s intent from the plain meaning of the language used.\u201d <em>See Hubbard v. Henrico Ltd. Pshp., </em>255 Va. 335, 340, 497 S.E.2d 335, 338 (1998). I would hold that, looking at the plain meaning of the word, an \u201coutfit\u201d includes, among other things, \u201cwearing apparel <em>with accessories </em>designed to be worn on a special occasion or in a particular situation or setting.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third International Dictionary </em>1601 (1981) (emphasis added); <em>see American Heritage Dictionary </em>797 (2d ed. 1991); <em>Mercer v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 380, 384, 512 S.E.2d 173, 175 (1999). Therefore, the trial court did not err in convicting appellant under Code 18.2-94.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">When I consider the archetypal burglar\u2019s outfit, I imagine a black jumpsuit with multiple pockets for stowing tools, perhaps topped off by a black ski mask and a sack for carrying away the loot. Appellant, however, was a shoplifter, not a burglar. She had no reason to put on a conventional burglar\u2019s outfit, which would have defeated her purpose by, contrary to her intention, actually drawing attention to her presence in the store rather than, as she hoped by carrying the purse, allowing her to blend into the crowd. Appellant wanted everyone to think that she was just another shopper out spending her paycheck. Rather than hiding in the shadows, appellant, as a shoplifter, needed an inconspicuous container in which to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>conceal stolen merchandise that also allowed her to blend in with the crowd. For appellant, as a female shoplifter, perhaps the most obvious and best option for an outfit that would assist in her larcenous intent was a large purse that she emptied before entering the store. Therefore, looking at the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, as we must when a defendant appeals her conviction, I would find the trial court did not err in convicting appellant of violating Code \u00a7 18.2-94. <em>See Riner v. Commonwealth, </em>268 Va. 296, 330, 601 S.E.2d 555, 574 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">The majority opinion, instead of deferring to the ordinary meaning of outfit, proposes to define outfit as \u201cthe tools or instruments comprised in any special equipment; as a carpenter\u2019s or a surgeon\u2019s outfit.\u201d This definition ignores the plain meaning of \u201coutfit\u201d and instead defines the term such that it has no meaning apart from \u201ctool\u201d or \u201cimplement.\u201d This new definition of the term runs counter to the \u201celementary rule of statutory construction that every word in the statute must be given its full effect if that can be done consistent with the manifest purpose of the act.\u201d <em>Home Beneficial Life Ins. Co. v. Unemployment Compensation Comm\u2019n, </em>181 Va. 811, 819, 27 S.E.2d 159, 162 (1943). Under the analysis used in the majority opinion\u2014despite the majority opinion\u2019s assertion in footnote 4\u2014clothing apparently is not actually included in the list of prohibited items under Code \u00a7 18.2-94, perhaps even if it is altered to conceal the theft, as occurred in <em>Mercer</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Thus, a purse or pocketbook specifically carried into a store to conceal stolen items is not included under the statute, under the definition advocated by the majority opinion. \u201cOutfit,\u201d under the majority opinion\u2019s interpretation of this term, sim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>ply becomes the plural of \u201ctool\u201d and \u201cimplement,\u201d effectively deleting \u201coutfit\u201d from Code \u00a7 18.2-94.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Therefore, I cannot agree with the majority opinion\u2019s definition of \u201coutfit\u201d as it simply renders the term superfluous. As this Court stated in <em>Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>50 Va.App. 337, 344 n. 4, 649 S.E.2d 717, 720 n. 4 (2007), \u201c[T]o the extent that the terms [in Code \u00a7 18.2-94] may be interchangeable, we can only conclude that the General Assembly did not view the terms as such, but rather, found the differences to be of importance.\u201d The majority opinion\u2019s definition eviscerates the important differences between these three terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">In support of its definition, the majority opinion expresses concern that the every day definition of \u201coutfit\u201d would allow every instance of hiding stolen merchandise in a pocket to fall under Code \u00a7 18.2-94. I find this position unpersuasive and, thus, disagree with the majority opinion\u2019s analysis on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">First, I believe this concern is more appropriate to an argument in the policy context involving the appropriate lan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>guage to use in a statute, as opposed to a legal analysis in an appellate opinion addressing the actual language used in a statute. An appellate court examines the language of a statute to determine what behavior the General Assembly intended to criminalize; it is not the role of the courts to evaluate the wisdom of the language codified by the legislature. <em>Watkins v. Hall, </em>161 Va. 924, 930, 172 S.E. 445, 447 (1934). Under the explicit language in Code \u00a7 18.2-94, only people possessing the criminal intent to commit burglary, larceny, or robbery can be convicted, since the legislature in its drafting of this statute placed that specific limitation on prosecutions under this statute. If the General Assembly had intended to restrict convictions under Code \u00a7 18.2-94, then that body could have deleted the word(s) \u201ctool\u201d or \u201cimplement\u201d or \u201coutfit.\u201d The General Assembly also could have included only the intention to commit \u201cburglary\u201d and left out the intention to commit \u201clarceny\u201d and \u201crobbery.\u201d However, the General Assembly did not enact either of these versions of the statute. Thus, this Court must address the language actually used in the statute, which includes the term \u201coutfit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Second, although a panel of this Court noted in <em>Williams, </em>50 Va.App. at 346, 649 S.E.2d at 721, that \u201cHad the General Assembly intended such a result, they would have punished the crime of concealment accordingly,\u201d I do not believe that affirming this conviction here would result by any means in the punishment of every concealment. As noted in the panel dissent in this case, <em>Edwards v. Commonwealth, </em>52 Va.App. 70, 78, 661 S.E.2d 488, 492-93 (2008), appellant here prepared the purse by emptying it of its contents, with the admitted purpose of using the now-empty purse to conceal stolen property and help her take that property out of the store. She had no other purpose for carrying the purse. To her, it existed solely as a means to commit larceny. When asked at trial why she had carried the empty purse into the store, appellant plainly admitted that she had the purse because she \u201cwanted to go to the store and steal.\u201d The evidence did not provide any other reason for her possession of the purse nor did the evidence even hint that the purse had any other use besides assisting appellant with her attempted larceny.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>To me, this fact differentiates appellant\u2019s situation from a shoplifter who places a stolen item in a purse that is otherwise being used normally. The pocketbook in such a situation would not fall under the proscription in Code \u00a7 18.2-94 because the thief possessed it primarily for an innocent purpose. Here, in contrast, appellant went to some trouble before entering the store, planning this part of her outfit so that it served her criminal purpose rather than any innocent one. She had no innocent reason for possessing the purse when she entered that store\u2014instead, she had it with her as \u201cspecial equipment\u201d to aid her in her larceny. Therefore, I do not believe we, as an appellate court, should second-guess both the trial court\u2019s finding and appellant\u2019s own characterization of the item as specifically intended, and only intended, so that she could \u201cgo to the store and steal.\u201d <em>Carter, </em>223 Va. at 532, 290 S.E.2d at 867 (\u201c[T]he verdict of the trial court will not be disturbed unless it appears to be plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u201d). Based on the foregoing analysis, I would find that the evidence was sufficient to convict Edwards under Code \u00a7 18.2-94, and I would affirm her conviction. Consequently, I must respectfully dissent from the majority opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b459-6\">. Although Code \u00a7 18.2-94 is titled \"Possession of Burglarious Tools, Etc.,\u201d that title does not add an additional element to the crime or dictate the actual elements of the crime proscribed by that statute. <em>See Mason v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 321, 323, 228 S.E.2d 683, 684 (1976) (\"[T]he summary title is not part, and does not determine the meaning, of the body of a statute.\u201d); <em>Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>215 Va. 143, 146, 207 S.E.2d 833, 836 (1974) (\"[U]se of the word \u2018jurisdiction\u2019 in the summary title is not controlling. The summary title is not part of the body of the statute____\u201d). At most, \"burglarious tools\u201d provides a shorthand phrase for the behavior criminalized in Code \u00a7 18.2-94.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b461-6\">. Contrary to the view expressed in the majority opinion, I believe <em>Mercer </em>was properly decided. The holding in <em>Mercer </em>is consistent with the plain language of the statute, allowing a conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-94 if the person possesses an \"outfit\u201d intending to use it to commit \"larceny,\u201d one of the nine classes of objects proscribed under that statute. In addition, it is interesting to note that the appellate history of <em>Mercer </em>includes the denial of Mercer\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court of Virginia. <em>Mercer v. Commonwealth, </em>Rec. No. 990848 (Va. Aug. 2, 1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b462-7\">. The majority opinion suggests in a footnote that \"outfit\u201d still has meaning because a collection of innocent items becomes an \"outfit,\u201d citing <em>Burnette v. Commonwealth, </em>194 Va. 785, 75 S.E.2d 482 (1953), as an example. However, each of the items in the collection listed in <em>Burnette </em>would become a burglarious tool based on the suspect\u2019s intended use of the item, rendering the term \"outfit\u201d unnecessary even in this context. <em>Cf. Carter v. Commonwealth, </em>223 Va. 528, 290 S.E.2d 865 (1982) (affirming conviction for possession of a burglarious tool where the defendant possessed an unaltered screwdriver). And, it should be noted, the <em>Burnette </em>opinion did not address burglarious <em>outfits; </em>instead, it addressed \"burglarious tools,\u201d since the Commonwealth argued only that the items possessed by Burnette were tools used to commit burglary. <em>Id. </em>at 791-93, 75 S.E.2d at 486-87 (emphasis added). The Commonwealth did not argue that Burnette possessed a burglarious outfit or implement, so the opinion did not address the meaning of those terms. Thus, the Court in <em>Burnette </em>affirmed a conviction for possession of a set of tools without recourse to the term \"outfit.\u201d Thus, contrary to the majority opinion\u2019s suggestion, <em>Burnette </em>actually proves, if the majority opinion\u2019s definition of \"outfit\u201d is correct, that the term \"outfit\u201d is essentially meaningless as the term \"tool\u201d subsumes the term \"outfit.\u201d In other words, even if the statute did not include the word \u201coutfit,\u201d Burnette's conviction would have been affirmed as he possessed burglarious <em>tools.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
