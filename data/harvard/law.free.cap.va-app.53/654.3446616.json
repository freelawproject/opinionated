After exhausting the administrative grievance process, Stevens appealed the termination decision to the circuit court. The court vacated the termination as \u201ccontradictory to law\u201d and awarded Stevens his attorney fees. Agreeing with VDOT that the circuit court erred in doing so, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">Ordinarily an appellate court recites the facts in the light most favorable to the prevailing party in the circuit court. In cases involving administrative review of state employee grievances, however, the light-most-favorable rendition of the facts is inapt. The facts of this case came before the circuit court, as they do to us, \u201con the record\u201d developed in the agency proceedings. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 2.2-3004(E) (precluding the admission of new evidence in the judicial proceeding except when \u201cnecessary to resolve any controversy as to the correctness of the record\u201d or as the \u201cends of justice\u201d may require). In reviewing agency factfinding, a circuit court acts much like an appellate court\u2014reviewing the facts developed in the agency record in the light most favorable to the party prevailing in that forum and deferring to agency factfinding unless patently insubstantial. <em>See Va. Dep\u2019t of Corr. v. Compton, </em>47 Va.App. 202, 217-18, 623 S.E.2d 397, 404 (2005).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">In this case, the agency record reveals that the termination process began with an investigation into two incidents involving Stevens, an employee of VDOT. In the first incident, witnesses reported that Stevens shouted \u201cKiss my fucking ass\u201d to a crew leader in response to the suggestion that he \u201churry up\u201d with his assigned task. In the second incident, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>co-worker reported that Stevens came to her home after work and demanded in a threatening manner to know if she was one of the witnesses who reported the cursing incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">VDOT issued a \u201cDue Process Letter\u201d to Stevens stating that his cursing episode violated state policy forbidding the use of obscene language. VDOT also stated the encounter with the co-worker violated a policy forbidding threats and coercion of other state employees. VDOT advised Stevens he would be terminated as a result of these two infractions. Stevens demanded review by a hearing officer appointed by the Department of Employee Dispute Resolution (DEDR). Upon receiving evidence from VDOT and Stevens, the hearing officer made these factual findings:</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">\u25a0 After being reminded to \u201churry up\u201d with the task at hand, Stevens told his crew leader, \u201cKiss my fucking ass.\u201d The crew leader asked, \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d \u201cKiss my fucking ass,\u201d Stevens replied, in an angry and confrontational manner. This exchange, the hearing officer found, violated state employee policy forbidding the use of \u201cobscene or abusive language.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">\u25a0 Later that same day, Stevens drove home and passed a co-worker \u201cat a high rate of speed.\u201d Stevens \u201cpulled in front of her and slowed down.\u201d The co-worker made a turn and drove home another way. As she got out of her vehicle, Stevens showed up \u201cmad and loud.\u201d He demanded, \u201cwhat [are] you doing telling on me?\u201d and warned, \u201cwhat goes around comes around.\u201d Frightened, the co-worker locked herself in her home and immediately called her VDOT supervisor. The hearing officer found this incident violated state policy against \u201cthreatening or coercing\u201d co-workers.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">Hearing Officer Decision, No. 8752 (Dec. 14, 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">Stevens objected to both rulings. He claimed he did not say \u201cKiss my fucking ass\u201d to his crew leader in an angry and threatening tone. He only said, \u201cKiss my ass.\u201d And he said it in a non-threatening manner \u201ccommonly used among crew-members\u201d even when referring to their bosses. As for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>incident with the co-worker, Stevens said she misunderstood his intentions. He was merely visiting her at her home \u201cin order to apologize to her for having to overhear his comments to the crew leader.\u201d The hearing officer found Stevens not credible and confirmed VDOT\u2019s decision to terminate him.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">Stevens appealed the hearing officer\u2019s decision to the Department of Human Resources Management (DHRM) to contest the hearing officer\u2019s interpretation of the policy. DHRM reviewed the case and issued a written \u201cPolicy Ruling\u201d opinion, which concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-5\">It is indisputable that the grievant used obscene and abusive language in the workplace. In addition, even though his display of threatening behavior was not in the workplace, his behavior was an extension of a job-related incident. Thus, it is the opinion of this Agency that VDOT officials properly applied the provisions of the Standards of Conduct Policy and the hearing officer properly interpreted that policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">DHRM Policy Ruling, No. 8752, at 3 (Feb. 19, 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">Stevens then appealed the hearing officer\u2019s decision to the circuit court. He made two arguments: First, the DHRM policy did not permit termination for either incident. Second, if the policy could be construed to do so, it violated due process principles. The circuit court accepted both arguments, reinstated Stevens to his former position, and awarded $10,789.19 in attorney fees to Stevens.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-9\">Under the State Grievance Procedure, Code \u00a7 2.2-3000 <em>et seq., </em>an administrative hearing officer serves primarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>as a factfinder. <em>Tatum v. Va. Dep\u2019t of Agric. &amp; Consumer Servs., </em>41 Va.App. 110, 121, 582 S.E.2d 452, 458 (2003) (citation omitted). The statute gives DHRM the responsibility to decide \u201cwhether the hearing officer\u2019s decision is consistent with policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). By doing so, the \u201cGeneral Assembly has clearly vested review of policy issues involved in employee grievances in the [DHRM], and not in the courts.\u201d <em>Va. Dep\u2019t of State Police v. Barton, </em>39 Va.App. 439, 446, 573 S.E.2d 319, 323 (2002) (noting that an \u201c[interpretation of state agency policy is itself a matter of policy\u201d outside the scope of judicial review). The statute also vests the DEDR with final authority over \u201call matters related to procedural compliance\u201d with the grievance procedure. Code \u00a7 2.2-1001(5). This too is beyond judicial review. <em>Tatum, </em>41 Va.App. at 124, 582 S.E.2d at 459.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">A grievant may seek judicial review only if an agency decision is \u201ccontradictory to law.\u201d Code \u00a7 2.2-3006(B). In this context, the \u201claw\u201d represents \u201cthe aggregate of legislation, judicial precedents and accepted legal principles.\u201d <em>Tatum, </em>41 Va.App. at 124, 582 S.E.2d at 459 (internal quotation marks, brackets, and citations omitted). The party challenging the hearing officer\u2019s decision must \u201cspecify how that decision is \u2018contradictory\u2019 to the law and what \u2018law\u2019 is thereby being contradicted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThus, because the General Assembly granted to the circuit courts only the authority to consider whether the final determination of the hearing officer is \u2018contrary to law,\u2019 we are likewise limited to such review in considering whether the trial court erred in its determination.\u201d <em>Pound v. Dep\u2019t of Game &amp; Inland Fisheries, </em>40 Va.App. 59, 64, 577 S.E.2d 533, 535 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">In this case, the circuit court held the hearing officer\u2019s decision was \u201ccontradictory to law\u201d because (a) DHRM policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>did not authorize VDOT\u2019s firing of Stevens and, (b) even if it did, applying the policy to Stevens violated his due process rights. We disagree with both holdings.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">A. <em>Termination Consistent with DHRM Policy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">DHRM policy provides an illustrative list of \u201cunacceptable\u201d conduct by state employees that could lead to disciplinary action. The policy begins with this caveat:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-6\">The offenses set forth below are not all-inclusive, but are intended as examples of unacceptable behavior for which specific disciplinary actions may be warranted. Accordingly, any offense that, in the judgment of agency heads, undermines the effectiveness of agencies\u2019 activities, may be considered unacceptable and treated in a manner consistent with the provisions of this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">Standards of Conduct, DHRM Policy 1.60 (Sept. 16,1993).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">The DHRM policy divides unacceptable conduct into three groups based on severity. Use of \u201cobscene or abusive language\u201d falls within Group I, typically resulting in a reprimand or counseling. <em>Id. </em>The most severe category, Group III, includes \u201cacts and behavior of such a serious nature that a first occurrence normally should warrant removal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>One example of a Group III offense is \u201c[threatening or coercing persons associated with any state agency (including, but not limited to, employees, supervisors, patients, inmates, visitors, and students).\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b704-9\">The circuit court recognized that the \u201cobscene or abusive language\u201d offense, a Group I violation, did not warrant termination. This observation, however, leads to no end. VDOT did not fire Stevens only because he cursed his crew leader. He was fired because he cursed his crew leader <em>and </em>threatened a co-worker whom Stevens thought had turned him in. If the latter incident warrants termination, it does not matter whether the former standing alone would as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>As for the \u201c[threatening or coercing\u201d violation, the circuit court held this provision of the DHRM policy did not apply to threats or coercion against co-workers that occur outside the workplace. The court\u2019s reasoning, however, is flawed at several levels. To begin with, nothing in the DHRM policy implies the workplace limitation imposed by the circuit court. To the contrary, the policy makes clear the listed examples do not define the outer boundaries of unacceptable conduct. The text of the \u201c[threatening or coercing\u201d provision, moreover, applies to a broad category of potential victims (all those \u201cassociated with any state agency\u201d), not just those threatened or coerced <em>while </em>working at a state agency worksite.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">More important, whatever the merits of the circuit court\u2019s interpretation of DHRM policy, the court had no authority to enforce it. The legislature \u201chas clearly vested review of policy issues involved in employee grievances in the [DHRM], and not in the courts.\u201d <em>Barton, </em>39 Va.App. at 446, 573 S.E.2d at 323. To be sure, \u201c[interpretation of state agency policy is itself a matter of policy\u201d outside the scope of judicial review. <em>Id. </em>\u201cBy limiting an appeal to issues \u2018contradictory to law,\u2019 the General Assembly underscores a guiding principle of the grievance procedure as set out in Code \u00a7 2.2-3004: \u2018Management reserves the exclusive right to manage the affairs and operations of state government.\u2019 \u201d <em>Barton, </em>39 Va.App. at 447, 573 S.E.2d at 323.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">Here, DHRM interpreted its \u201c[threatening or coercing\u201d provision to apply to Stevens\u2019s angry encounter with his coworker at her home. As DHRM explained, \u201ceven though his display of threatening behavior was not in the workplace, his behavior was an extension of a job-related incident.\u201d DHRM Policy Ruling, No. 8752 (Feb. 19, 2008). The circuit court had no authority to overrule DHRM\u2019s interpretation as \u201ccontradictory to law\u201d under Code \u00a7 2.2-3006(B). The hearing officer\u2019s decision, approved by DHRM, thus remains the final word on whether YDOT\u2019s termination of Stevens complied with DHRM policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>B. <em>Constitutional Due Process Principles</em></p>\n<p id=\"ASs\">We likewise find no merit in the circuit court\u2019s alternative holding that VDOT violated due process principles when it fired Stevens. The due process doctrine gives a state employee with a property interest in his employment the right to \u201coral or written notice of the charges against him, an explanation of the employer\u2019s evidence, and an opportunity to present his side of the story.\u201d <em>Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill, </em>470 U.S. 532, 546, 105 S.Ct. 1487, 1495, 84 L.Ed.2d 494 (1985); <em>see also Garraghty v. Jordan, </em>830 F.2d 1295, 1299 (4th Cir.1987). Stevens concedes he received due process in this traditional sense. It would be hard to argue otherwise. The elaborate statutory grievance procedures more than satisfy the minimal requirements of due process.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">Stevens nevertheless argues his termination violated due process principles because he \u201chad no notice that allegedly threatening or coercive conduct outside the workplace was subject to disciplinary action.\u201d Appellee Br. at 11. Because he had \u201cno notice of the possibility of termination,\u201d Stevens continues, he was denied due process. <em>Id. </em>at 12. Acknowledging \u201cthis might be a little bit of a matter of first impression,\u201d the circuit court accepted Stevens\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">This is a wholly new take on the meaning of due process. It goes beyond a state employee\u2019s procedural right to be heard before being fired and, instead, recognizes a new substantive right not to be fired at all if the employer does not warn the employee of each specific example of misbehavior for which the employee could be fired. This thesis, accepted by the circuit court, confuses the notice required by constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>due process (pre-deprivation notice of an <em>impending </em>termination decision) with the notice typically provided, but not constitutionally required, by state employment policies (notice of possible grounds for a <em>potential </em>termination).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">Seeking to provide the latter type of notice, the DHRM policy included a representative list of offenses that \u201cnormally should warrant removal\u201d and warned that the list was illustrative, \u201cnot all-inclusive.\u201d Stevens can hardly claim that he had a constitutional right to engage in unlisted misbehavior and still keep his job. \u201cThe duty of fair notice does not require such extraordinary and particularized foresight of the specific manner in which a [state employee] might display poor judgment meriting severe discipline.\u201d <em>Swank v. Smart, </em>898 F.2d 1247, 1253 (7th Cir.1990). \u201cVague, catch-all standards for discipline do not violate due process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Brasslett v. Cota, </em>761 F.2d 827, 838 (1st Cir.1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">The same can be said of the circuit court\u2019s holding that VDOT violated the DHRM policy by applying (even with DHRM\u2019s blessing) the \u201c[threatening or coercing\u201d provision to conduct off the worksite. Although the point \u201cis clothed in the language of constitutional deprivation, it does not raise an issue of procedural due process.\u201d <em>Detweiler v. Va. Dep\u2019t of Rehab. Serv., </em>705 F.2d 557, 561 (4th Cir.1983). \u201cThe due process clause does not require state courts to be the final arbiters of the merits of a disciplinary discharge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cWhen the minimal due process requirements of notice and hearing have been met, a claim that an agency\u2019s policies or regulations have not been adhered to does not sustain an action for redress of procedural due process violations.\u201d <em>Goodrich v. Newport News Sch. Bd., </em>743 F.2d 225, 227 (4th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">In sum, the circuit court exceeded its authority by overruling the hearing officer\u2019s decision approving VDOT\u2019s termi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>nation of Stevens. We reverse the circuit court\u2019s reinstatement order and its award of attorney fees to Stevens.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b700-8\">.
