Hargrove (\u201cappellant\u201d) was convicted of possession of more than five pounds of marijuana with intent to distribute, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-248.1(a)(3), and possession of a firearm while in possession of more than one pound of marijuana with intent to distribute, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.4(C). Appellant contends the trial court erred by admitting into evidence the container of marijuana and certificate of analysis related to that evidence, arguing that \u201cthe chain of custody for the container of suspected marijuana was incomplete.\u201d He also contends the trial court erred in finding the evidence sufficient to support his conviction for possession of over five pounds of marijuana with intent to distribute, \u201cabsent sufficient evidence of [his] knowledge of the amount of marijuana contained in the package,\u201d and in finding the evidence sufficient to support his conviction for possession of a firearm while in possession of over one pound of marijuana with intent to distribute, \u201cabsent evidence that [he] exercised dominion and control over the firearm.\u201d For the following reasons, we affirm the judgment of the trial court, but remand to permit the trial court to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>correct an apparent clerical error in its conviction and sentencing orders pursuant to Code \u00a7 8.01-428(B).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">On appeal, \u201c[w]here the issue is whether the evidence is sufficient, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u201d <em>Sandoval v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 133, 135, 455 S.E.2d 730, 731 (1995). \u201cThe judgment of the trial court is presumed to be correct and will be reversed only upon a showing that it is \u2018plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u2019\u201d <em>Viney v. Commonwealth, </em>269 <em>Va. </em>296, 299, 609 S.E.2d 26, 28 (2005) (quoting Code \u00a7 8.01-680).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">So viewed, the evidence proves that, during a routine check at a Federal Express warehouse, a drug-sniffing dog alerted state police officers to a package suspected to contain drugs. The package was to be delivered to \u201cMichelle Guzman\u201d at a Richmond address. After obtaining a search warrant, the officers searched the package and found \u201ca large quantity of ... what appeared to be marijuana.\u201d The officers turned the package over to Richmond City police detectives. Based on this information, Detective James Killingsworth obtained a search warrant for the residence to which the package was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>addressed. A Richmond detective, disguised as a Federal Express employee, delivered the package to the residence. Appellant came to the door and stated that \u201cMichelle Guzman\u201d was upstairs but that he could \u201caccept the package for her.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He accepted the package, stating that he had been \u201cwaiting for this package.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Five to ten minutes later, police executed a search warrant for the residence. They found the unopened package in the pantry and a loaded firearm in the adjoining room \u201con the kitchen table\u201d \u201cunder,\u201d \u201con[,] ... or next to [a] jacket.\u201d The officers also recovered two \u201cdigital ... scale[s],\u201d paperwork, and mail bearing appellant\u2019s name from a bedroom in the residence. Appellant was arrested, read his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and questioned by Detective Killingsworth. He initially told Detective Killingsworth that \u201cthe package that he had received had jerseys in it,\u201d but later told the detective that \u201che knew the package had marijuana in it but he wasn\u2019t sure how much was in it.\u201d He told the detective that \u201can individual ... let\u2019s [sic] him know that a package is coming. [Appellant] then takes the package later and sits it outside and somebody else will pick it up____And ... he does this in exchange for receiving just a small amount of marijuana back for just making the transaction.\u201d Appellant also told Detective Killingsworth that the firearm found on the kitchen table \u201cwas his and he had it for his protection.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">Detective Killingsworth placed the contents of the seized package into an evidence container, sealed it, and placed his initials on the seal. Thereafter, Detective Killingsworth accompanied Detective Wooten, who took the container to the police evidence storage facility where it was placed and secured. On October 10, 2006, the evidence container was received by the Division of Forensic Science laboratory locat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>ed in Richmond, and there assigned a unique case number. On November 29, 2006, forensic lab analyst Corrie Meyer retrieved the container, sealed and initialed in a manner approved by the Division of Forensic Science, from a locked storage area within the Division of Forensic Science lab. Meyer broke the seal on the container, analyzed its contents, and prepared a certificate of analysis. The certificate of analysis identified the evidence container, its assigned laboratory number, and that the substance analyzed within the evidence container was 143 ounces (8.94 pounds) of marijuana. At trial, over appellant\u2019s objection, the trial court admitted the marijuana and the certificate of analysis into evidence. Appellant testified at trial that he was unaware that there was marijuana in the package. He testified that he thought it contained sports jerseys that he was receiving for someone else. At the conclusion of the trial, the trial court stated, \u201cI find [appellant\u2019s] testimony wholly incredible,\u201d and convicted him of possession of more than five pounds of marijuana with intent to distribute and possession of a firearm while in possession of more than one pound of marijuana with intent to distribute. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"AdP3\">A. Chain of Custody</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Appellant contends the trial court erred by admitting into evidence the marijuana seized by the police from his residence and the certificate of its analysis from the Division of Forensic Science. He argues that there was a break in the chain of custody in the handling of the evidence, from the time it was placed in the police evidence room to the time it was removed from the evidence storage locker for testing at the Division of Forensic Science laboratory. Appellant argues that, because there was no \u201ctestimony of the officer who delivered the container to [the Division of Forensic Science lab]\u201d nor was there any evidence that an \u201cauthorized agent ... <em>received </em>the container on behalf of [the lab], ... a vital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>link in the possession and treatment of the evidence [was] left to conjecture.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">He contends, therefore, that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence failed to prove that the evidence seized from his residence by the police was the same evidence, free from tampering, tested by Meyer at the Division of Forensic Science lab. He does not contest the chain of custody from the time the package was first recovered by law enforcement officers at the Federal Express warehouse until the sealed evidence container was locked in the police evidence room, nor does he contest the chain of custody from the time Meyer removed the container from the locked storage area of the Division of Forensic Science lab, analyzed its contents, and returned it to police custody for presentation at trial. The trial court found that the chain of custody was sufficiently established. It concluded that because the evidence container was received at the lab \u201csealed and intact,\u201d there was no evidence that it was subject to tampering between the time it left the police evidence room and the time that it was removed from the lab storage locker. We conclude that the trial court did not err in admitting the evidence container and the certificate of its analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Where evidence is seized and analyzed, \u201c \u2018[t]he purpose of the chain of custody rule is to establish that the evidence obtained by the police was the same evidence tested.\u2019\u201d <em>Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 552, 555, 466 S.E.2d 116, 117 (1996) (quoting <em>Robertson v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 854, 857, 406 S.E.2d 417, 419 (1991)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-6\">\u201c[A] chain of custody is properly established when the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence affords reasonable assurance that the exhibits at trial are the same and in the same condition as they were when first obtained.\u201d Whether the foundation is sufficient to properly establish the chain of custody is a question within the sound discretion of the trial court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number><em>Anderson v. Commonwealth, </em>274 Va. 469, 479, 650 S.E.2d 702, 707-08 (2007) (quoting <em>Vinson v.

In proving the chain of custody, \u201c[t]he Commonwealth must ... account for every \u2018vital link in the chain of possession.\u2019 \u201d <em>Alvarez v. Commonwealth, </em>24 Va.App. 768, 777, 485 S.E.2d 646, 650 (1997) (quoting <em>Robinson v. Commonwealth, </em>212 Va. 136, 138, 183 S.E.2d 179, 180 (1971)) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cWhen a \u201cvital link\u2019 in the possession and treatment of the evidence is left to conjecture, the chain of custody is incomplete, and the evidence is inadmissible.\u201d <em>Jeter v. Commonwealth, </em>44 Va.App. 733, 737, 607 S.E.2d 734, 737 (2005) (quoting <em>Robertson, </em>12 Va.App. at 857, 406 S.E.2d at 419).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">\u201cA court need not hear, however, from every witness who physically handled the samples for the certificate [of analysis] to be admissible. Nor must the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence \u2018exclude every conceivable possibility of substitution, alteration, or tampering.\u2019 \u201d <em>Anderson v. Commonwealth, </em>48 Va.App. 704, 717, 634 S.E.2d 372, 378 (2006) (quoting <em>Pope v.

Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 69, 72, 427 S.E.2d 733, 735 (1993) (quoting Code \u00a7 19.2-187.01). Appellant asserts that, because no request for laboratory examination form was admitted into evidence, there is no proof that an authorized agent of the laboratory received the evidence container. He argues that, absent that proof, there was a fatal break in the chain of custody of the evidence. However, \u201cCode \u00a7 19.2-187.01 does not specifically require the Commonwealth to identify the recipient <em>only </em>through a request for laboratory examination form. The agency relationship prescribed by the statute may be established by other evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 72, 427 S.E.2d at 736 (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted). The Commonwealth \u201cestablished, prima facie, that the contraband was received by such an [authorized] agent\u201d if \u201cthere is no hint that it was received, for example, by some mere non-employee bystander who happened to be loitering on the laboratory\u2019s premises.\u201d <em>Harris, </em>261 Va. at 188-89, 541 S.E.2d at 549.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">In <em>Harris, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201cthe trial court clearly was entitled to infer,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 188, 541 S.E.2d at 548, that the unique identification number assigned to evidence tested by the Division of Forensic Science lab \u201cwas assigned by the person receiving the material,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 189, 541 S.E.2d at 549, and thus, that the evidence was received by \u201can \u2018authorized agent\u2019 of the laboratory, as required by [Code \u00a7 19.2-187.01],\u201d <em>id. </em>at 188, 541 S.E.2d at 548. The Supreme Court noted in <em>Harris </em>that the \u201csame [unique] forensic number appear[ed] on the certificate [of analysis] in question along with the police department case number, the defendant\u2019s name, and the date of receipt of the material.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 189, 541 S.E.2d at 549.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>Here, the evidence at trial proved that Detective Killings-worth placed the suspected marijuana seized from appellant into an evidence container and sealed it. He initialed the sealed container and witnessed its placement in the police evidence room. He testified that the container offered by the Commonwealth as evidence at trial was the same container he sealed and placed in the police evidence room, showing the trial court where he sealed and initialed it. On October 10, 2006, that same sealed evidence container was received by the Division of Forensic Science laboratory. The container was then assigned a unique case identification number by the lab and placed in the lab\u2019s storage locker. Meyer, the Division of Forensic Science lab analyst who retrieved that evidence container from the lab storage locker, testified that the seal on the container was intact before she broke it to perform her analysis on November 29, 2006. She showed the trial court the location of the seal on the container she broke, the \u201cunique forensic case number\u201d assigned to it when it had been received by the lab, and where her initials appeared on the container. Meyer also testified that the seals and initials on the container complied with the procedures followed by the Division of Forensic Science laboratory upon receipt of evidence to be analyzed.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">The record shows that the trial court examined the \u201cacceptance by the lab seal,\u201d as well as the Division of Forensic Science\u2019s \u201cmark or label and initials,\u201d appearing on the evidence container. The trial court also examined the certificate of analysis, dated November 30, 2006, signed by Meyer, which was addressed to Mark E. Wooten of the Richmond Police Department. The certificate refers to the police case number, \u201cCase # : 20061005-0634,\u201d and to the \u201cLab\u201d number, \u201cFS Lab # C06-18058,\u201d names appellant as the \u201cSuspect,\u201d shows the \u201cDate Received: 10/10/2006,\u201d states, \u201cEvidence Submitted By: R.C. Dunn,\u201d and describes \u201cItem 2\u201d as \u201cOne sealed box containing a taped plastic container containing loose plant material, four heat sealed plastic bags containing plant material and a plastic wrapped bundle containing plant material.\u201d The certificate shows the results of the analysis to be \u201cMari<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>juana, total weight: 4055 grams (143.03 ounces) of plant material.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">We have previously noted that \u201c[t]he credibility of the witnesses and the weight accorded the evidence are matters solely for the fact finder,\u201d <em>Sandoval, </em>20 Va.App. at 138, 455 S.E.2d at 732, because, unlike \u201can appellate court which reviews only a cold record,\u201d <em>Harris v. Woodrum, </em>3 Va.App. 428, 433, 350 S.E.2d 667, 670 (1986), the fact finder \u201chas the opportunity to see and hear that evidence as it is presented,\u201d <em>Sandoval, </em>20 Va.App. at 138, 455 S.E.2d at 732.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">From the record on appeal, we find that a reasonable trier of fact could conclude that the required chain of custody of the evidence seized from appellant, analyzed by the Division of Forensic Science laboratory, and received by the trial court as evidence was satisfactorily established. Accordingly, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting into evidence the container of marijuana and the certificate of analysis regarding its contents.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">B. Possession of Marijuana with Intent to Distribute</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">Appellant contends the trial court erred in finding the evidence sufficient to convict him of possession of over five pounds of marijuana with intent to distribute, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-248.1(a)(3). He argues that the evidence presented at trial failed to prove that he \u201cwas aware of the <em>amount </em>of marijuana\u201d contained in the package he possessed and that Code \u00a7 18.2-248.1(a)(3) requires proof of such knowledge. We find appellant\u2019s argument wholly without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">Code \u00a7 18.2-248.1 provides that \u201cit shall be unlawful for any person to sell, give, distribute or possess with intent to sell, give or distribute marijuana.\u201d \u201cCode \u00a7 18.2-248.1(a)(3) provides a penalty of not less than five nor more than thirty years when the controlled substance consists of more than five pounds of marijuana.\u201d <em>Bolden v. Commonwealth, </em>263 Va. 465, 467 n. 1, 561 S.E.2d 701, 702 n. 1 (2002). \u201c[P]roof that the accused possessed the weight of marijuana proscribed by Code \u00a7 18.2-248.1(a)[ (3) ] is an essential element of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>offense.\u201d <em>Hill v. Commonwealth, </em>17 Va.App. 480, 484-85, 438 S.E.2d 296, 299 (1993). However, an accused\u2019s \u201cactual knowledge of the ... quantity of contraband is not critical to the drug quantity determination.\u201d <em>United States v. Fullilove, </em>388 F.3d 104, 108 (4th Cir.2004) (\u201c \u2018[A] defendant who transports a suitcase knowing that it contains a controlled substance ... is accountable for the controlled substance in the suitcase regardless of his knowledge or lack of knowledge of the actual ... amount of that controlled substance.\u2019 \u201d (quoting U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3, comment. (n.2(a)(l)))). As Lord Morris so aptly noted, \u201cThose who skate on thin ice can hardly expect to find a sign which will denote the precise spot where they may fall in.\u201d <em>Knuller v. DPP, </em>[1973] A.C. 435, 463 (H.L.) (appeal taken from Eng.) (U.K.).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">To convict an accused of possession of more than five pounds of marijuana with intent to distribute, the Commonwealth must \u201cprove that he \u2018intentionally and consciously possessed [marijuana], either actually or constructively, with knowledge of its nature and character, together with the intent to distribute it\u2019 \u201d and that the amount he possessed was greater than five pounds. <em>Shears v. Commonwealth, </em>23 Va.App. 394, 402, 477 S.E.2d 309, 313 (1996) (quoting <em>Wilkins v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 293, 298, 443 S.E.2d 440, 444 (1994) (en banc)) (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cPossession of a controlled substance in \u2018a quantity greater than that ordinarily possessed for one\u2019s personal use may be sufficient to establish an intent to distribute it.\u2019\u201d <em>Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>52 Va.App. 194, 202, 662 S.E.2d 627, 631 (2008) (quoting <em>Monroe v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 154, 156, 355 S.E.2d 336, 337 (1987)). A trial court may also consider \u201c \u2018expert testimony, usually that of a police officer,\u2019 ... in determining whether drugs were possessed with intent to distribute.\u201d <em>Askew v. Commonwealth, </em>40 Va. App. 104, 110, 578 S.E.2d 58, 61 (2003) (quoting <em>Shackleford v.

Appellant admitted to the detective that he took possession of the package, which he knew contained marijuana, and that he intended to transfer the package and its contents to another. Detective Killingsworth, an expert witness, testified that the amount of marijuana recovered from appellant\u2019s residence, almost nine pounds, was \u201cvery inconsistent with personal use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AsE\">From the record on appeal, we conclude the Commonwealth satisfied its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant intentionally and consciously possessed marijuana, with knowledge of its nature and character, together with the intent to distribute it, and that the marijuana he intended to distribute weighed more than five pounds. Accordingly, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s convicting appellant of possession of more than five pounds of marijuana with intent to distribute, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2\u2014248.1(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">C. Possession of a Firearm While Possessing Marijuana with Intent to Distribute</p>\n<p id=\"A8G\">Appellant additionally contends the trial court erred in convicting him of violating Code \u00a7 18.2-308.4(0, which provides, in pertinent part, \u201cIt shall be unlawful for any person to possess ... any ... firearm ... while committing or attempting to commit the illegal ... possession with the intent to ... distribute ... more than one pound of marijuana.\u201d He contends the evidence presented at trial proved only that he had knowledge of the firearm, and \u201cnot ... that he exercised dominion and control over [it] at the time it was discovered.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-6\">A conviction for the unlawful possession of a firearm can be supported exclusively by evidence of constructive possession; evidence of actual possession is not necessary. To establish constructive possession of the firearm by a defendant, \u201cthe Commonwealth must present evidence of acts, statements, or conduct by the defendant or other facts and circumstances proving that the defendant was aware of the presence and character of the firearm and that the firearm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>was subject to his dominion and control.\u201d While the Commonwealth does not meet its burden of proof simply by showing the defendant\u2019s proximity to the firearm, it is a circumstance probative of possession and may be considered as a factor in determining whether the defendant possessed the firearm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-5\"><em>Bolden v. Commonwealth, </em>275 Va. 144, 148, 654 S.E.2d 584, 586 (quoting <em>Rawls v. Commonwealth, </em>272 Va. 334, 349, 634 S.E.2d 697, 705 (2006)) (citations omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 284, 172 L.Ed.2d 208 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">Appellant contends the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence failed to exclude all reasonable hypotheses of innocence. He argues that, based on the evidence presented at trial, \u201cit was just as likely\u201d that he had given the firearm, which was found with his brother\u2019s jacket, \u201cto his brother days, weeks, or months before.\u201d \u201c Whether an alternative hypothesis of innocence is reasonable is a question of fact and, therefore, is binding on appeal unless plainly -wrong.\u2019 \u201d <em>Stevens v. Commonwealth, 38 </em>Va.App. 528, 535, 567 S.E.2d 537, 540 (2002) (quoting <em>Archer v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 1, 12-13, 492 S.E.2d 826, 832 (1997)). \u201cThe statement that circumstantial evidence must exclude every reasonable theory of innocence is simply another way of stating that the Commonwealth has the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Hudson, </em>265 Va. 505, 513, 578 S.E.2d 781, 785 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">Here, appellant admitted to Detective Killingsworth that the pistol located on the kitchen table, adjacent to the pantry where he placed the marijuana package, belonged to him and that he used it for his protection. At trial, he testified that the pistol belonged to him. From the record on appeal, we conclude that appellant, who possessed more than five pounds of marijuana with intent to distribute, was \u201c\u2018aware of the presence and character of the firearm and that the firearm was subject to his dominion and control.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bolden, </em>275 Va. at 148, 654 S.E.2d at 586 (quoting <em>Rawls, </em>272 Va. at 349, 634 S.E.2d at 705). <em>See also, Wright v. Commonwealth, </em>53 Va.App. 266, 286, 670 S.E.2d 772, 782 (2009) (affirming conviction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>where accused admitted that \u201cboth drugs and a loaded handgun[,] [found] in close proximity to one another in his residence,\u201d were his).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Accordingly, we hold that the trial court did not err in finding the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant possessed a firearm while in possession of more than one pound of marijuana with intent to distribute violating Code \u00a7 18.2-308.4(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm appellant\u2019s convictions of possession of more than five pounds of marijuana with intent to distribute and possession of a firearm while in possession of more than one pound of marijuana with intent to distribute. However, we remand to the trial court solely to correct its conviction and sentencing orders consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">\n<em>Affirmed on the merits, and remanded with instructions.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b592-8\">. We note the trial court\u2019s sentencing order entered October 13, 2007 and its conviction order entered August 20, 2007, from which this appeal was taken, state appellant\u2019s conviction as \"Distribution of Marijuana,\u201d in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-248.1(a)(3). However, the record reflects that, at trial, the trial court stated it found appellant guilty of \"possession of [more than five pounds of] marijuana with intent to distribute ... in violation of Virginia Code Section 18.2-248.1, Subsection (a)(3).\u201d <em>See Davis v.
