Commonwealth, </em>276 Va. 533, 536, 666 S.E.2d 346, 348 (2008). Having now reviewed that challenge, we find it meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">In 2002, the trial court convicted Logan of selling cocaine. A year later, while on probation, Logan was arrested for possession of cocaine. At trial on the 2003 possession charge, Logan claimed the exclusionary rule barred the admission of the cocaine because the arresting officer entered a common area of Logan\u2019s rooming house without a warrant. It was in this common area, a stairway landing, that the officer observed Logan possess cocaine. The trial court denied the motion to suppress, holding Logan had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the common areas of the rooming house.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-10\">On appeal, two of three judges of a panel of this Court disagreed with the trial court. Citing <em>State v. Titus, </em>707 So.2d 706, 708 (Fla.1998), the panel majority held \u201crooming house residents have an actual expectation of privacy in the common areas of the rooming house\u201d unless the house is open to the general public. <em>Logan v. Commonwealth, </em>46 Va.App. 213, 221, 616 S.E.2d 744, 747 (2005). The panel majority rejected as \u201cunpersuasive\u201d the contrary holding of <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>533 F.2d 1210 (D.C.Cir.1976), which held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-11\">When the police officers entered the rooming house they did not enter appellant\u2019s private dwelling; instead they merely entered the common corridors of the building, which were available to residents of the rooming house, their guests, people making deliveries, and others who had a legitimate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>reason to be on the premises. Consequently, insofar as appellant maintains that he had a constitutionally protected reasonable expectation of privacy in the corridors of the rooming house, we disagree; appellant\u2019s constitutionally protected privacy interest began at the door to room eight rather than at the door to the entire rooming house.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-5\"><em>Logan, </em>46 Va.App. at 223, 616 S.E.2d at 749 (quoting <em>Anderson, </em>533 F.2d at 1214).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">In contrast, the panel dissent found <em>Anderson </em>persuasive and agreed with the trial judge that Logan had no reasonable expectation of privacy in a common area of a multi-tenant rooming house. The <em>Anderson </em>approach, the dissent noted, parallels the view taken by a \u201cmajority of federal courts\u201d addressing the analogous context of common areas (and in particular hallways) of apartment buildings. <em>Id. </em>at 232, 616 S.E.2d at 753 (Haley, J., dissenting) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">Upon reviewing the case <em>en banc, </em>we focused on a purely factual concession made by the Commonwealth on appeal that the rooming house \u201cwas <em>not </em>open to the general public.\u201d <em>Logan v. Commonwealth, </em>47 Va.App. 168, 170, 622 S.E.2d 771, 772 (2005) <em>(en banc) </em>(emphasis added). On this narrow ground, we reversed the trial court. In our ruling, however, we refused to resolve the split in precedents between the \u201cbroad view of the privacy interests associated with rooming houses\u201d (illustrated by <em>Titus) </em>and the' \u201cmore narrow approach\u201d (best described in Anderson), which refused to find a privacy interest in the common areas of boarding houses. <em>Id. </em>at 171, 622 S.E.2d at 773. \u201cFor purposes of this appeal,\u201d the <em>en banc </em>Court made clear, \u201cwe need not endorse or reject either view.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cTo go further than the Commonwealth\u2019s concession,\u201d we explained, \u201cwould conflict with two principles of judicial self-restraint: our reluctance to issue what amounts to an \u2018advisory opinion\u2019 on an inessential subject and our corresponding desire to decide the case \u2018on the best and narrowest ground available.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 171 n. 3, 622 S.E.2d at 773 n. 3 (citations omitted). The case ended there. The Commonwealth did not seek further review by the Virginia Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>Back in the trial court, the earlier 2002 conviction returned to the docket to determine whether Logan violated his probation by possessing cocaine. Logan argued the exclusionary rule prohibited the cocaine from being admissible in his probation revocation proceeding for the same reason it was excluded from his criminal trial. The trial court disagreed, as did we. Central to our analysis was the United States Supreme Court\u2019s unqualified admonition that it had \u201crepeatedly declined to extend the exclusionary rule to proceedings other than criminal trials.\u201d <em>Penn. Bd. of Probation &amp; Parole v. Scott, </em>524 U.S. 357, 363, 118 S.Ct. 2014, 2019, 141 L.Ed.2d 344 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">The particular \u201cother\u201d non-criminal-trial proceeding in <em>Scott </em>was a state parole revocation hearing. Given the <em>ratio decidendi </em>of <em>Scott,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>we found \u201cno relevant distinction between the Supreme Court\u2019s application of the exclusionary rule to parole revocation hearings and our application of the rule to probation violation hearings.\u201d <em>Logan v. Commonwealth, </em>50 Va.App. 518, 524, 651 S.E.2d 403, 406 (2007); <em>see generally Gagnon v. Scarpelli, </em>411 U.S. 778, 782 <em>&amp; </em>n. 3, 93 S.Ct. 1756, 1759 &amp; n.3, 36 L.Ed.2d 656 (1973) (recognizing the \u201cundoubted minor differences between probation and parole,\u201d but noting \u201crevocation of probation where sentence has been imposed previously is constitutionally indistinguishable from the revocation of parole\u201d) (cited in <em>Scott </em>).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>The Virginia Supreme Court disagreed, however, and read <em>Scott </em>narrowly to apply only to parole revocation\u2014but not probation revocation\u2014proceedings. <em>Logan, </em>276 Va. at 536, 666 S.E.2d at 347-48. This interpretation of <em>Scott </em>left standing a <em>pre-Scott </em>ruling in <em>Anderson v. Commonwealth, </em>251 Va. 437, 440, 470 S.E.2d 862, 863 (1996), which held the exclusionary rule applies to probation violation proceedings if the defendant proves \u201cbad faith on the part of the police.\u201d The case was remanded to us \u201cfor a review of Logan\u2019s challenge to the trial court\u2019s determination that the police officer\u2019s actions did not constitute bad faith.\u201d <em>Logan, </em>276 Va. at 536, 666 S.E.2d at 348.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">Since the remand of this case to us, the United States Supreme Court decided <em>Herring v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 695, 172 L.Ed.2d 496 (2009). Clarifying the scope of the exclusionary rule, <em>Herring </em>held the \u201cfact that a Fourth Amendment violation <em>occurred\u2014ie., </em>that a search or arrest was unreasonable\u2014does not necessarily mean that the exclusionary rule applies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at -, 129 S.Ct. at 700. Because \u201cthe exclusionary rule is not an individual right,\u201d prior precedent had \u201crepeatedly rejected the argument that exclusion is a necessary consequence of a Fourth Amendment violation.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b566-11\">\u201cTo trigger the exclusionary rule,\u201d <em>Herring </em>held, the challenged \u201cpolice conduct must be sufficiently deliberate that exclusion can meaningfully deter it, and sufficiently culpable that such deterrence is worth the price paid by the justice system.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 129 S.Ct. at 702. This case-specific, two-pronged test\u2014requiring both deliberateness and culpabili<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>ty\u2014serves as a prerequisite for the application of the exclusionary rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\"><em>Herring </em>also deemphasized any subjectivity from the deliberateness-and-culpability test. \u201cThe pertinent analysis of deterrence and culpability is objective, not an \u2018inquiry into the subjective awareness of arresting officers.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 129 S.Ct. at 703 (citation omitted). That is, the \u201cgood-faith inquiry is confined to the objectively ascertainable question whether a reasonably well trained officer would have known that the search was illegal\u201d in light of \u201call of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cThese circumstances frequently include a particular officer\u2019s knowledge and experience, but that does not make the test any more subjective than the one for probable cause, which looks to an officer\u2019s knowledge and experience, but not his subjective intent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">The circumstances of Logan\u2019s case fall far short of the <em>Herring </em>standard. Logan does not contest that he possessed cocaine in a common area (a stairway landing) of his rooming house. Rather, his complaint is that a police officer was there to see it. Recognizing that this was a matter of first impression in Virginia, a splintered panel of our Court could not address the subject with either unanimity or finality. Relying on a Florida decision, <em>Titus, </em>the panel majority agreed with Logan. Relying on a decision of the United States Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia, <em>Anderson, </em>as well as a battery of cases addressing the analogous context of apart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>ment buildings, the panel dissent disagreed with Logan. Sitting <em>en banc, </em>we endorsed neither the narrow nor the broad view, finding instead that the Commonwealth\u2019s factual concession on appeal had mooted the legal debate.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">The very presence of a principled disagreement among our colleagues on this issue strongly militates against the conclusion that a \u201creasonably well trained officer,\u201d <em>Herring, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 129 S.Ct. at 703, would have known that Logan had a reasonable expectation of privacy in a stairway within a common area of a multi-tenant rooming house. To be sure, in cases where experienced jurists disagree among themselves as to the legality of the police conduct, we can hardly expect law enforcement officers to predict which contesting juristic view will ultimately prevail and become binding precedent. In such situations, it would be hyperbolic to accuse police officers of bad faith when they merely guess wrong. <em>See United States v. Leon, </em>468 U.S. 897, 926, 104 S.Ct. 3405, 3422, 82 L.Ed.2d 677 (1984) (noting that because the legal question created \u201cdisagreement among thoughtful and competent judges,\u201d the judicial application of the \u201cextreme sanction of exclusion is inappropriate\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">We similarly reject Logan\u2019s assertion that our <em>en banc </em>opinion requires a finding of bad faith and, therefore, application of the exclusionary rule. We limited our holding to the Commonwealth\u2019s factual concession, made on appeal, that the rooming house (including its common area stairways) was not open to the public\u2014thus establishing Logan\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy. But we never held the police officer knew or should have known of that newly conceded fact. To the contrary, the officer testified he had previously been \u201cinside the rooming house\u201d and did not see any signs suggesting it was not open to the public. <em>Logan, </em>46 Va.App. at 218, 616 S.E.2d at 746 (superseded panel opinion).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> That he was mistaken, however, does not mean he acted in bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">In sum, the remand mandate instructed us to review \u201cLogan\u2019s challenge to the trial court\u2019s determination that the police officer\u2019s actions did not constitute bad faith.\u201d <em>Logan, </em>276 Va. at 536, 666 S.E.2d at 348. Considering Logan\u2019s challenge in light of <em>Herring, </em>we affirm the trial court\u2019s finding that the officer\u2019s actions did not warrant excluding the cocaine evidence offered during Logan\u2019s probation violation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b565-6\">. <em>See generally Congdon v.
