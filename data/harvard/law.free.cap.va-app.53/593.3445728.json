Jenkins, </em>255 Va. 516, 521, 499 S.E.2d 263, 265 (1998). \u201cThe judgment of a trial court sitting without a jury is entitled to the same weight as a jury verdict and will not be set aside unless it appears from the evidence that the judgment is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u201d <em>Martin v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 438, 443, 358 S.E.2d 415, 418 (1987) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-13\">On March 15, 2007, the Hampton Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court issued a protective order on behalf of the victim against Nolen, the victim\u2019s former boyfriend. The protective order was to remain in effect until March 12, 2009. On March 31, 2007 at about 9:30 p.m., Nolen began telephoning the victim, leaving her threatening messages. At approximately 12:30 a.m. on April 1, 2007, the victim arrived at her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>residence. As she tried to open the door, Nolen appeared and grabbed her keys. He hit her and dragged her toward the backyard. As she sat on the ground, leaning against the house, he kicked her repeatedly in her head, chest, shoulders, face, and back. She estimated he hit or kicked her fifteen to twenty times.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">After the assault, the victim was unable to stand without assistance. She had a large bruise on her chest and other bruises, and shoe prints or tread marks, on her chest and forehead. Her lip was lacerated and bleeding. She was transported to a hospital where she received a chest x-ray, pain medication, and a prescription for pain medication. A witness who arrived on the scene after the assault testified that blood was \u201ceverywhere.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">Photographs of the victim\u2019s injuries were admitted into evidence. One of the photographs, taken several days after the assault, showed a shoe or tread print on her forehead. As a consequence of the assault, she missed four days of work and twice consulted a doctor for pain medication. She testified that she took over 180 prescription and non-prescription pain pills -within a few weeks of the assault and that she was still experiencing pain at the time of the trial on July 25, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">At the conclusion of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, Nolen moved to strike, arguing that the victim\u2019s injuries did not constitute \u201cserious\u201d bodily injury required to prove a felonious violation of Code \u00a7 16.1-253.2. The trial court denied the motion, stating, \u201c[Wjhen a woman is stomped so hard that three days after the injury she has a tread mark of a shoe or work boot on her head, that\u2019s a serious injury.\u201d It noted the victim had a cut and bleeding lip and that a witness had testified that after the assault, blood was \u201ceverywhere.\u201d It convicted Nolen of felonious violation of the protective order.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b639-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">Code \u00a7 16.1-253.2 does not define \u201cserious bodily injury.\u201d No Virginia appellate court has addressed the meaning of the phrase in the context of the statute. Nolen cites Code \u00a7 16.1-283(E) and Code \u00a7 18.2-371.1 and urges that we adopt the definitions found in those statutes. We decline to do so.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">Code \u00a7 16.1-283(E) provides for termination of the parental rights of one who inflicts \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d on a child with whom he resides. The statute provides: \u201cAs used in this section: <em>\u2018Serious bodily injury </em>\u2019 means bodily injury that involves substantial risk of death, extreme physical pain, protracted and obvious disfigurement, or protracted loss or impairment of the function of a bodily member, organ or mental faculty.\u201d We hold that the foregoing definition is inapplicable to this case. By its terms, it applies only to Code \u00a7 16.1-283(E). That statute provides for termination of the highly protected parent/child relationship. It follows logically that invocation of this sanction requires proof of extreme circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">Likewise, Code \u00a7 18.2-371.1 imposes criminal liability on one who inflicts or permits the infliction of \u201cserious injury\u201d on a child in his custody. The statute provides that the term \u201c \u2018serious injury' shall include but not be limited to\u201d certain enumerated specifications. We hold that those specifications do not limit our consideration of the term \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d in this case. They relate to a specific legislative concern, the protection of children in custodial relationships. Furthermore, the statute expressly provides that the term \u201cserious injury\u201d is not limited to the enumerated specifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">The victim in this case was bruised and lacerated, bore marks on her body, and bled. She missed several days of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>work and suffered pain, requiring medication for an extended period of time. \u201c \u2018Bodily injury comprehends, it would seem, <em>any bodily hurt </em>whatsoever.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bryant v. Commonwealth, </em>189 Va. 310, 316, 53 S.E.2d 54, 57 (1949) (quoting John B. Minor, <em>[Exposition] of the Laws of Crimes and Punishments </em>67 (1894)). Unquestionably, the victim suffered bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Turning to the meaning of \u201cserious,\u201d \u201c[i]t is a basic rule of statutory construction that a word in a statute is to be given its everyday, ordinary meaning unless the word is a word of art.\u201d <em>Stein v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 65, 69, 402 S.E.2d 238, 241 (1991) (citing <em>Lovisi v. Commonwealth, </em>212 Va. 848, 850, 188 S.E.2d 206, 208 (1972)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-6\">It is one of the fundamental rules of construction of statutes that the intention of the legislature is to be gathered from a view of the whole and every part of the statute taken and compared together, giving to every word and every part of the statute, if possible, its due effect and meaning, and to the words used their ordinary and popular meaning, unless it plainly appears that they were used in some other sense. If the intention of the legislature can be thus discovered, it is not permissible to add to or subtract from the words used in the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-7\"><em>Posey v. Commonwealth, </em>123 Va. 551, 553, 96 S.E. 771, 771 (1918) (citations omitted). <em>See generally Brewster v. Commonwealth, </em>23 Va.App. 354, 357, 477 S.E.2d 288, 289 (1996) (holding that the phrase \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d referenced in Code \u00a7 46.2-817, the eluding statute, is not unconstitutionally vague).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">Serious is defined as \u201cgrave in ... appearance\u201d or \u201crequiring considerable care.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>2073 (1981). In <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Lamb v. Hill, </em>196 Va. 18, 23, 82 S.E.2d 473, 476 (1954), the Supreme Court addressed the meaning of \u201cserious\u201d in the context of the circumstances under which an operator\u2019s license may be suspended or revoked for a \u201cserious violation\u201d of the motor laws pursuant to former Code \u00a7 46-420 (recodified as Code \u00a7 46.2-402). The Court stated: \u201cThe statute does not define a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>\u2018serious\u2019 violation and hence we give the word its ordinary meaning. Webster\u2019s Unabridged Dictionary lists among its definitions of \u2018serious\u2019: \u2018Not trifling; grave; giving rise to apprehension; attended with danger.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hill, </em>196 Va. at 23, 82 S.E.2d at 476.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">A \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d as proscribed by Code \u00a7 16.1-253.2 is one that can fairly and reasonably be deemed not trifling, grave, giving rise to apprehension, giving rise to considerable care, and attended with danger. The injuries inflicted upon the victim satisfy this definition and support the trial court\u2019s holding that they constituted \u201cserious\u201d bodily injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b638-8\">. The trial court also found appellant guilty of maiming in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-51 and assault and battery in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-57.2. However, appellant does not challenge those convictions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b639-8\">. We need not, and do not, decide whether the victim\u2019s injuries could satisfy the provisions of Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-283(E) or 18.2-371.1. We consider only whether her injuries constituted \"serious bodily injur[ies]\u201d under Code \u00a7 16.1-253.2.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
