Caprino took the stand at trial and claimed he acted in self-defense. Over Caprino\u2019s objection, the prosecutor called a detective as a rebuttal witness to impeach Caprino\u2019s testimony as a recent fabrication presented for the first time from the witness stand. On appeal, Caprino argues his convictions should be overturned because the trial court violated his constitutional right to remain silent by permitting the detective\u2019s testimony. We disagree and affirm Caprino\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">The evidence at trial described an aborted drug sale that ended in gunfire. The seller, Caprino, shot a handgun several times into a vehicle killing one man and grazing another. He fired the shots in self-defense, Caprino testified, because one of the two victims pointed a sawed-off shotgun at him. Investigating officers never recovered a shotgun from either of the two victims, from the crime scene, or from Caprino.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">On rebuttal, the prosecutor called a detective to the stand as a rebuttal witness to impeach Caprino\u2019s self-defense claim as a recent fabrication. The prosecutor asked the detective if he interviewed Caprino. \u201cI had a chance to interview Mr. Capri-no,\u201d the detective answered, \u201cand he declined to speak with me.\u201d Caprino\u2019s counsel objected, arguing \u201c[i]t brings all sorts of inferences to the jury that perhaps he should have. We haven\u2019t talked about a Fifth Amendment clause.... \u201d The prosecutor replied, \u201cIt\u2019s not a comment on his exercise of Constitutional rights. That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t get into advising him of <em>Miranda </em>rights. I just ... want the jury to know that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>this Defendant never talked to a detective.\u201d \u201cIn other words,\u201d the prosecutor stated, \u201cthe point that is made, Your Honor, is that the story that the jury heard is the first time [Caprino has] to\u00edd this to anybody\u201d except his counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">The trial court overruled Caprino\u2019s objection. Immediately thereafter, Caprino\u2019s counsel advised the court: \u201cI have no cross, Your Honor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">In closing arguments, the prosecutor stated to the jury that the detective \u201cnever interviewed\u201d Caprino. \u201cWhat you heard yesterday on the stand was the first time, absent his attorneys and that\u2019s his privilege\u2014the first time anybody has heard Max Caprino\u2019s version of what happened,\u201d the prosecutor argued. Caprino \u201chas had a lot of time to think about what the right answers are,\u201d the prosecutor continued, \u201cwhat the right explanation is, what might satisfy you in believing that he is not guilty of these crimes.\u201d Caprino\u2019s counsel did not object to this argument, move for a mistrial, or request any cautionary instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">In his closing argument, Caprino\u2019s counsel reasserted his client\u2019s testimony that he fired into the vehicle in self-defense. He conceded the shotgun was never found but argued the surviving victim, despite his denials, must have taken the shotgun from the scene of the crime and hidden it from the authorities. The jury, however, rejected this explanation and found Caprino guilty. Caprino now appeals his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">We begin with an important point of clarification: \u201cAbsent clear evidence to the contrary in the record, the judgment of a trial court comes to us on appeal with a presumption that the law was correctly applied to the facts.\u201d <em>Yarborough v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 971, 978, 234 S.E.2d 286, 291 (1977). Today, as a century ago, \u201cnothing is better settled than that everything is to be presumed in favor of the correctness of the rulings of a court of competent jurisdiction, when brought under review in an appellate tribunal, until the contrary is shown.\u201d <em>Early v. Commonwealth, </em>86 Va. 921, 925, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>11 S.E. 795, 797 (1890) (citing <em>Coleman v. Commonwealth, </em>84 Va. 1, 7, 3 S.E. 878, 881 (1887)).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">From that starting premise, we take up the question presented by Caprino\u2019s appeal: \u201cWhether the prosecutor should have been permitted to show that Mr. Caprino had declined to make a statement to the police where he had been advised of his right to counsel.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 2. We answer this question by finding fault with the assumption underlying it.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Caprino relies on <em>Doyle v. Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 49 L.Ed.2d 91 (1976), which held the use for impeachment purposes of a defendant\u2019s silence \u201cat the time of arrest and after receiving <em>Miranda </em>warnings\u201d violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 U.S. 619, 628, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 1716, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993) (quoting <em>Doyle, </em>426 U.S. at 619, 96 S.Ct. at 2245). The <em>Doyle </em>analysis \u201crests on the Due Process Clause, not the Fifth Amendment.\u201d <em>Wainwright v. Greenfield, </em>474 U.S. 284, 293 n. 10, 106 S.Ct. 634, 639 n. 10, 88 L.Ed.2d 623 (1986).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cAfter an arrested person is formally advised by an officer of the law that he has a right to remain silent,\u201d <em>Doyle </em>explained, \u201cthe unfairness occurs when the prosecution, in the presence of the jury, is allowed to undertake impeachment on the basis of what may be the exercise of that right.\u201d <em>Doyle, </em>426 U.S. at 619 n. 10, 96 S.Ct. at 2245 n. 10; <em>see, e.g., Schrum v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 204, 209, 246 S.E.2d 893, 897 (1978) (applying <em>Doyle </em>where a defendant\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>rights were \u201cread to him\u201d and he executed a \u201crights waiver\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>On the other hand, \u201cthe Constitution does not prohibit the use for impeachment purposes of a defendant\u2019s silence prior to arrest, <em>Jenkins v. Anderson, </em>447 U.S. 231, 239 [100 S.Ct. 2124, 2129-30, 65 L.Ed.2d 86] (1980), or after arrest if no <em>Miranda </em>warnings are given, <em>Fletcher v. Weir, </em>455 U.S. 603, 606-07 [102 S.Ct. 1309, 1311-12, 71 L.Ed.2d 490] (1982) <em>(per curiam,).\u201d Brecht, </em>507 U.S. at 628, 113 S.Ct. at 1716. \u201cIn the absence of the sort of affirmative assurances embodied in the <em>Miranda </em>warnings,\u201d no due process violation occurs when the prosecution cross-examines \u201cas to postarrest silence when a defendant chooses to take the stand.\u201d <em>Fletcher, </em>455 U.S. at 607,102 S.Ct. at 1312.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Controlling precedent has \u201cconsistently explained <em>Doyle </em>as a case where the government had induced silence by implicitly assuring the defendant that his silence would not be used against him.\u201d <em>Portuondo v. Agard, </em>529 U.S. 61, 74, 120 S.Ct. 1119, 1128, 146 L.Ed.2d 47 (2000) (quoting <em>Fletcher, </em>455 U.S. at 606, 102 S.Ct. at 1311); <em>see also Wainwright, </em>474 U.S. at 290, 106 S.Ct. at 638. Receiving <em>Miranda </em>warnings from a law enforcement officer serves as a \u201cprerequisite of a <em>Doyle </em>violation,\u201d <em>Greer v. Miller, </em>483 U.S. 756, 763, 107 S.Ct. 3102, 3108, 97 L.Ed.2d 618 (1987), and absent this predicate showing, post-arrest \u201csilence is probative and does not rest on any implied assurance by law enforcement authorities that it will carry no penalty,\u201d <em>Brecht, </em>507 U.S. at 628, 113 S.Ct. at 1716 (citing <em>Jenkins, </em>447 U.S. at 239, 100 S.Ct. at 2129-30). In short, <em>Doyle </em>applies only when the defendant maintains his silence \u201cafter receipt of <em>governmental </em>assurances.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Charles, </em>447 U.S. 404, 408, 100 S.Ct. 2180, 2182, 65 L.Ed.2d 222 (1980) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>In this case, Caprino concedes the trial court record does not \u201ccontain any direct testimony\u201d that police officers ever administered <em>Miranda </em>warnings to Caprino. <em>See </em>Appellant\u2019s Br. at 8. For reasons not discernable from the record, Capri-no\u2019s counsel chose not to cross-examine the detective on the <em>Miranda </em>issue, to proffer that the detective gave Caprino any <em>Miranda </em>warnings, or to put Caprino back on the stand in surrebutal to claim that he had in fact received <em>Miranda </em>warnings\u2014all options available to him had he wished to pursue the <em>Doyle </em>objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">The absence of any evidence demonstrating that Caprino\u2019s silence was in response to any <em>Miranda </em>warnings he received precludes the application of the <em>Doyle </em>due process doctrine. As the United States Supreme Court has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-6\">The significant difference between the present case and <em>Doyle </em>is that <em>the record does not indicate that respondent Weir received any Miranda warnings during the period in which he remained silent immediately after his arrest. </em>The majority of the Court of Appeals recognized the difference, but sought to extend <em>Doyle </em>to cover Weir\u2019s situation by stating that \u201c[w]e think an arrest, by itself, is governmental action which implicitly induces a defendant to remain silent.\u201d <em>[Weir v. </em>Fletcher,] 658 F.2d [1126] at 1131 [ (1981) ]. We think that this broadening of <em>Doyle </em>is unsupported by the reasoning of that case and contrary to our <em>post-Doyle </em>decisions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-7\"><em>Fletcher, </em>455 U.S. at 605-06, 102 S.Ct. at 1311 (emphasis added); <em>see Folston v. Allsbrook, </em>691 F.2d 184, 187 (4th Cir.1982) (holding <em>\u201cDoyle </em>is inapplicable when the record does not indicate that the defendant \u2018received any <em>Miranda </em>warnings during the period in which he remained silent immediately after his arrest\u2019 \u201d (citing <em>Fletcher, </em>455 U.S. at 605,102 S.Ct. at 1311)).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">In short, the due process principles adopted in <em>Doyle </em>do not apply here because the record does not show that Caprino\u2019s silence was in response to any <em>Miranda </em>warnings he received. We thus affirm Caprino\u2019s convictions for second-degree murder, attempted malicious wounding, and felonious use of a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b227-7\">. Caprino relies on both the Federal and Virginia Constitutions. \"Because the due process protections afforded under the Constitution of Virginia are co-extensive with those of the federal constitution, the same analysis will apply to both.\u201d <em>Shivaee v. Commonwealth, </em>270 Va. 112, 119, 613 S.E.2d 570, 574 (2005). \"Our courts have consistently held that the protections afforded under the Virginia Constitution are co-extensive with those in the United States Constitution.\u201d <em>Slayton </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 101, 109-10 n. 2, 582 S.E.2d 448, 452 n. 2 (2003) (citation omitted); <em>see also Craddock v.
