ARTHUR KELSEY, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b67-9\">In a proceeding before the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission, Qwamaine A. Wright requested a change in his treating physician. After the commission granted the request, the employer appealed. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-11\">Wright, a teenager working at a grocery store, fell at work and sustained injuries to his chin, elbows, and wrists. He initially received medical care from a family practitioner who sutured his chin and recommended that Wright see an orthopedic specialist. Wright\u2019s mother called the employer and asked for a referral. The employer\u2019s claims adjuster provided a panel of three physicians, which included two orthopedic surgeons and a plastic surgeon.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-12\">At the mother\u2019s request, the adjuster scheduled an appointment with Dr. Vipool K. Goradia, one of the two orthopedic surgeons. The adjuster advised Wright\u2019s mother that another physician would be provided if Wright or his mother became dissatisfied with Dr. Goradia\u2019s care. The claims adjuster placed no time limitation on her offer to replace Dr. Goradia.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-13\">Not long after Dr. Goradia began treating Wright, his mother became dissatisfied with the doctor\u2019s care and demean- or. Wright thereafter filed a motion requesting the eommis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>sion to order the employer to provide a replacement panel of physicians. The first panel, Wright argued, was defective because one of the three physicians was not an orthopedic specialist. Wright also pointed out the adjuster had earlier agreed to replace Dr. Goradia upon request. In reply, the employer argued Wright could not seek to replace Dr. Goradia after submitting to his course of treatment. The commission disagreed and ordered the employer to provide a new panel of three orthopedic specialists.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">On appeal, the employer argues that the commission erroneously failed to apply the course-of-treatment doctrine which forbids an employee from changing his treating physician without a reasonable justification. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">When an employee enters into a course of treatment with a physician, even in cases where the employer fails to comply with the requirement to provide a proper panel, \u201cthe employee is not at liberty to change therefrom unless referred by said physician, confronted with an emergency, or given permission by the employer and/or its insurer or [the] Commission.\u201d <em>Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Pierce, </em>9 Va.App. 120, 128, 384 S.E.2d 333, 338 (1989) (brackets in original and indirectly quoting <em>Breckenridge v. Marval Poultry Co., </em>228 Va. 191, 194, 319 S.E.2d 769, 770-71 (1984)); <em>see also Macica v. ARA Services Tidewater Vending, </em>26 Va.App. 36, 41-42, 492 S.E.2d 843, 846 (1997).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">Under the course-of-treatment doctrine, an employee may secure the commission\u2019s approval of a change in treating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>physician only upon showing some reasonable justification for the change, such as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-5\">inadequate treatment is being rendered; it appears that treatment is needed by a specialist in a particular field and is not being provided; no progress being made in improvement of the employee\u2019s health condition without any adequate explanation; conventional modalities of treatment are not being used; no plan of treatment for long-term disability cases; [or] failure to cooperate with discovery proceedings ordered by the Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-6\"><em>Apple Constr. Corp. v. Sexton, </em>44 Va.App. 458, 461, 605 S.E.2d 351, 352 (2004) (brackets in original and quoting <em>Allen &amp; Rocks, Inc. v. Briggs, </em>28 Va.App. 662, 675, 508 S.E.2d 335, 341 (1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">The employer claims Wright did not prove any of these circumstances existed. Perhaps so, but we fail to see why that matters in this case. Nearly every expression of the course-of-treatment doctrine has added the qualification that the employee may change treating physicians when \u201cgiven permission by the employer\u201d to do so. <em>Breckenridge, </em>228 Va. at 194, 319 S.E.2d at 771; <em>Macica, </em>26 Va.App. at 42, 492 S.E.2d at 846; <em>Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>9 Va.App. at 128, 384 S.E.2d at 338. When the employer agrees with the requested change in treating physician, the employee need not demonstrate any further justification for the change. The employer\u2019s consent\u2014whether viewed as a reasonable justification in and of itself or viewed as a circumstance mooting the need to prove a reasonable justification\u2014gives the employee an enforceable expectation that he may change his treating physician if he does so consistent with the scope of the employer\u2019s consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">Here, the commission found that the employer\u2019s claims adjuster agreed in advance to accept a change of physician if Wright or his mother became dissatisfied with Dr. Goradia\u2019s care.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The adjuster placed no time limitation on this open-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>ended offer. As factfinder, therefore, the commission had ample evidence to reject the employer\u2019s argument that the \u201cwindow of opportunity on the offer\u201d closed when Wright submitted to a course of treatment with Dr. Goradia. <em>See </em>Appellant\u2019s Br. at 25. Given our \u201chighly deferential standard of review of commission factfinding,\u201d <em>Dunnavant v. Newman Tire Co., Inc., </em>51 Va.App. 252, 258, 656 S.E.2d 431, 434 (2008), we see no reason to second-guess the commission on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">In short, the employer\u2019s unqualified offer authorized Wright to change his treating physician at his election. The commission did not err in requiring the employer to stand by that representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b68-9\">. We agree with the commission\u2019s application of this principle to defectively constituted panels. <em>See Simmons v. Stafford County Sch. Bd., </em>VWC File No. 203-42-59, 2002 Va. Wrk. Comp.
