On appeal, appellant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence, contending that the victim\u2019s perception of the weapon as a firearm is necessary to sustain the conviction. For the reasons stated, we affirm the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-12\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>1</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b549-13\">\u201cOn appeal, Ve review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u2019 \u201d <em>Archer v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 1, 11, 492 S.E.2d 826, 831 (1997) (quoting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number><em>Martin v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 438, 443, 358 S.E.2d 415, 418 (1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">L.S., the victim, owned a restaurant and had earlier employed her Mend, appellant, to help in the kitchen. One evening, appellant discussed with a Mend the idea of robbing L.S. The following evening, appellant, her Mend, and three other individuals went to L.S.\u2019s house to rob her. One of the men, \u201cAl,\u201d was armed with a nine-millimeter pistol.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">As L.S. was getting out of her car, one man wrestled L.S. to the ground and attempted to take her deposit bag, which contained nine to ten thousand dollars in cash. When L.S. did not let go, \u201cAl\u201d struck her in the head five times with the pistol, causing L.S. to release the bag.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">L.S. recalled being struck in the head, but was unable to identify the object with which she was beaten. She testified that she never saw a pistol during this encounter.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">Upon a proffer of the evidence, the trial court convicted appellant of use of a firearm in the commission of robbery. This appeal follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">\n<em>Use of Firearm as a Club</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b550-10\">Appellant argues that the gun was used as a club and Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 does not proscribe the use of clubs in certain felonies.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> She reasons that \u201cAl\u201d ceased to use the pistol in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>manner for which it was designed, namely, as an instrument designed to expel a projectile by force as defined in <em>Armstrong v. Commonwealth, </em>36 Va.App. 312, 549 S.E.2d 641 (2001) <em>(en banc). </em>Using a gun in this \u201caltered\u201d state, she argues, precludes a conviction pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-6\">It shall be unlawful for any person to use or attempt to use any pistol, shotgun, rifle, or other firearm or display such weapon in a threatening manner while committing or attempting to commit ... robbery,____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">\u201c[W]e review the trial court\u2019s statutory interpretations and legal conclusions <em>de novo.\u201d Navas v. Navas, </em>43 Va.App. 484, 487, 599 S.E.2d 479, 480 (2004) (citing <em>Sink v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 655, 658, 507 S.E.2d 670, 671 (1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">In <em>Armstrong v. Commonwealth, </em>263 Va. 573, 584, 562 S.E.2d 139, 145 (2002), the Supreme Court defined a firearm as \u201can instrument which was designed, made, and intended to expel a projectile by means of an explosion.\u201d Appellant contends that if an object is not used to expel a projectile, it is not being used as a \u201cfirearm\u201d and, therefore, its \u201cuse\u201d is not prohibited by Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">Although we construe statutes strictly in criminal cases, we will not apply \u201can unreasonably restrictive interpretation of the statute\u201d that would subvert the legislative intent expressed therein. <em>Ansell v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 759, 761, 250 S.E.2d 760, 761 (1979). \u201c \u2018[T]he plain, obvious, and rational meaning of a statute is always preferred to any curious, narrow or strained construction; a statute should never be construed so that it leads to absurd results.\u2019 \u201d <em>Newton v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 86, 89, 462 S.E.2d 117, 119 (1995) (quoting <em>Branch v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 836, 839, 419 S.E.2d 422, 424 (1992)). We find no language in Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>\u00a7 18.2-53.1 that restricts its application to using firearms only in instances where the firearm expels a projectile by force.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">In <em>Holloman v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 196, 198, 269 S.E.2d 356, 358 (1980), and <em>Wubneh v. Commonwealth, </em>51 Va.App. 224, 656 S.E.2d 418 (2008), the Courts address whether an object can be classified as a \u201cfirearm\u201d based upon the firing capabilities of the object. In essence, the cases simply determine whether a purported firearm may be deemed a \u201cfirearm\u201d for purposes of enforcing Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1. Here, however, appellant concedes the weapon used by \u201cAl\u201d was a firearm, a nine-millimeter pistol. The only question is whether the statute limits the manner in which a gun must be used in order to violate the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">Other jurisdictions have specifically addressed the issue of a gun being used as a club and have found that the concept of \u201cuse\u201d should be broadly construed. The Kansas Court of Appeals was asked to determine whether the appellant, who struck his ex-wife on her head with a gun, was properly classified by the Department of Corrections for purposes of sentencing because he \u201cused a firearm in the commission of [a] crime.\u201d Finding that he did, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-7\">Within the context of [the statute], we believe that the concept of \u201cuse\u201d should be broadly construed and conclude that [appellant] used a firearm in the commission of the aggravated battery \"within the meaning of the statute. This is consistent with the legislative intent in Kansas to address public concern over the increased number of crimes involving firearms and with our Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion that enhancement of a sentence where a firearm is used is a legitimate effort to deter the use of a firearm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-8\"><em>State v. George, </em>20 Kan.App.2d 648, 891 P.2d 1118, 1125 (1995). In reaching its conclusion, the Kansas Court of Appeals considered a previous Kansas Supreme Court case, <em>State v. Smith, </em>232 Kan. 284, 654 P.2d 929 (1982), in which the court was called upon to determine whether the defendant used a rifle within the meaning of a firearm statute. There, the defendant and the victim each had their hands on defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>rifle and were struggling to gain sole possession of the weapon. <em>Smith, </em>654 P.2d at 934. During the struggle, the victim fell over the balcony railing and the defendant argued this did not constitute \u201cuse\u201d of a firearm within the meaning of the firearm statute. <em>Id. </em>The Kansas Supreme Court disagreed, stating that \u201cdefendant\u2019s \u2018mighty heave\u2019 on the firearm is what pulled [the victim] over the railing ...rendering the rifle \u201cthe instrumentality of the aggravated battery.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Considering this, the Kansas Court of Appeals in <em>George </em>concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-5\"><em>Smith </em>is a clear statement by the Supreme Court [of Kansas] that use of a gun in an aggravated battery is not limited to firing it for purposes of the statute. If using a gun to push someone over a railing is use of a firearm, it follows that hitting someone with a gun\u2014a more direct utilization of the gun\u2014is also a contemplated use.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-6\"><em>George, </em>891 P.2d at 1124.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">In <em>People v. Reaves, </em>42 Cal.App.3d 852, 117 Cal.Rptr. 163 (1974), the California Court of Appeal approved a jury instruction which stated that use of a firearm includes \u201cnot only an intentional discharge thereof but also the use thereof as an object with which to hit or strike or display in a menacing manner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 165. In noting that it is the desire of the legislature to prevent death and injury as a result of the involvement of firearms in the commission of crimes, the California court read the statute broadly and concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-8\">[T]he intentional firing of the gun is use of the firearm. The display of the gun in a menacing manner as a means of accomplishing a robbery or the employment of the gun to strike or \u201cpistol whip\u201d the victim is certainly \u201cuse\u201d of the gun in the commonly accepted definition of that term. Because either such \u201cuse,\u201d i.e., the menacing display of or striking the victim with the gun carries the ever-dangerous potential of a discharge of the firearm, both such \u201cuses\u201d are properly included within the spirit and purpose of [the statute]. Thus by defining what constitutes \u201cuse\u201d of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>firearm, [the statute] necessarily informs the jury that \u201cuse\u201d is different than being \u201carmed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 166.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">We further note that \u201c[n]o court of appeals ever has held that using a gun to pistol-whip a victim is anything but the \u2018use\u2019 of a firearm.....\u201d <em>Smith v. United States, 508 </em>U.S. 223, 233, 113 S.Ct. 2050, 2056, 124 L.Ed.2d 138 (1993); <em>see also Bailey v. United States, </em>516 U.S. 137, 148, 116 S.Ct. 501, 508, 133 L.Ed.2d 472 (1995) (\u201cThe active-employment understanding of \u2018use\u2019 certainly includes brandishing, displaying, bartering, <em>striking, </em>and most obviously, firing or attempting to fire a firearm.\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-10\">\u201cA primary rule of statutory construction is that courts must look first to the language of the statute. If a statute is clear and unambiguous, a court will give the statute its plain meaning.\u201d <em>Loudoun County Dep\u2019t of Social Servs. v. Etzold, </em>245 Va. 80, 85, 425 S.E.2d 800, 802 (1993). \u201cGenerally, the words and phrases used in a statute should be given their ordinary and usually accepted meaning unless a different intention is fairly manifest.\u201d <em>Woolfolk v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 840, 847, 447 S.E.2d 530, 534 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-11\">We observe that our legislature did not define the term \u201cuse,\u201d nor did it offer examples of how one might \u201cuse\u201d a firearm. Thus, we are obligated to give \u201cuse\u201d its ordinary and plain meaning. Webster\u2019s dictionary defines use as \u201cto employ for some purpose; to put into service.\u201d <em>Random House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary </em>1414 (2d ed.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-12\">The purpose of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 is to deter violent criminal conduct. <em>Holloman, </em>221 Va. at 198, 269 S.E.2d at 358. The statute is aimed at preventing actual physical injury and also to discourage criminal conduct that produces fear of physical harm. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b554-13\">Keeping in mind the purpose of the statute, we are not persuaded by appellant\u2019s argument that she cannot be convicted because she did not use the gun in the manner for which it was designed, namely, to expel a projectile by force. Once the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>object satisfies the definition of a firearm, any use of the firearm that is intended to cause physical injury is a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1. Clearly, appellant used the gun to inflict physical harm in order to accomplish the robbery. To conclude that the gun was not \u201cused\u201d in the commission of the robbery would be to read the statute too narrowly and is contrary to the legislative intent. Accordingly, we find that appellant used the firearm in the commission of robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">\n<em>Victim\u2019s Perception of a Firearm</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">Appellant argues that a victim\u2019s perception of the weapon as a firearm is necessary to sustain a conviction pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It is undisputed that \u201cAl\u201d possessed a nine-millimeter pistol and struck L.S. in the head with the gun. It is also important to note that appellant is not contesting that the weapon was actually a firearm. Appellant reasons that because L.S. never saw the gun, appellant\u2019s conviction should be reversed. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that a victim\u2019s perception is relevant only in those instances when a perpetrator is \u201cdisplay[ing] such weapon in a threatening manner.\u201d <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">As previously stated, the purpose of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 is to deter violent criminal conduct. <em>Holloman, </em>221 Va. at 198, 269 S.E.2d at 358. \u201cThe statute not only is aimed at preventing actual physical injury or death but also is designed to discourage criminal conduct that produces fear of physical harm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In <em>Yarborough v. Commonwealth, </em>247 Va. 215, 218, 441 S.E.2d 342, 344 (1994), the Supreme Court explained, \u201cthe Commonwealth must prove that the accused actually had a firearm in his possession and that he used or attempted to use the firearm <em>or </em>displayed the firearm in a threatening manner while committing or attempting to commit robbery or one of the other specified felonies.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 is written in the disjunctive, prohibiting either the actual use of a firearm, <em>or </em>the display of a firearm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>in a threatening manner. <em>See Gunn v. Commonwealth, </em>272 Va. 580, 586, 637 S.E.2d 324, 327 (2006) (holding that, where a statute uses the disjunctive term \u201cor,\u201d the provisions of the statute \u201cplainly encompass two distinct situations\u201d). \u201c \u2018[T]he use of the disjunctive word \u201cor,\u201d rather than the conjunctive \u201cand,\u201d signifies the availability of alternative choices.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lewis v. Commonwealth, </em>267 Va. 302, 314-15, 593 S.E.2d 220, 227 (2004) (quoting <em>Hedrick v. Commonwealth, </em>257 Va. 328, 340, 513 S.E.2d 634, 640 (1999)). We conclude that the distinction between using and displaying the firearm is critical, as the former is intended to protect against physical injury whereas the latter is directed at preventing the fear of physical harm. Thus, in evaluating appellant\u2019s argument, we must consider whether appellant\u2019s behavior pertains to prong one of the statute, namely <em>use </em>of a firearm, or prong two, <em>display </em>the firearm in a threatening manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">Citing <em>Holloman </em>and <em>Wubneh, </em>appellant argues that a victim must believe the weapon used against her is a firearm in order to sustain a conviction. We note from the outset that in these cases, appellate courts reviewed application of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 as it related only to the second prong of the statute, namely displaying of the weapon in a threatening manner. As discussed above, we conclude that appellant used the firearm in the commission of the robbery, violating the first prong of the statute. We nevertheless review these cases in answering appellant\u2019s question of whether a victim is required to perceive the weapon as a firearm for a conviction to be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">The sole issue in <em>Holloman </em>was whether the instrument in the appellant\u2019s possession was a \u201cfirearm\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1. Although the instrument \u201cappeared] in size, weight and shape to be a .45 caliber automatic pistol,\u201d it fired BBs \u201cby the force of a spring, not by gunpowder.\u201d 221 Va. at 197, 269 S.E.2d at 357. In commenting that a crime victim \u201ccan be intimidated as much by a revolver that does not fire bullets as by one that does,\u201d the Court held that the evidence was sufficient to convict the appellant of using a firearm in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1, even though the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>instrument was fired by a spring rather than by gunpowder. <em>Id. </em>at 199, 269 S.E.2d at 358. Thus, the <em>Holloman </em>Court reviewed whether the object was a firearm under prong two of the statute, i.e., whether the weapon that was being displayed appeared to the victim to be a firearm, and not whether it was used against the victim. Thus, <em>Holloman </em>underscored the difference between actual violence and the victim\u2019s apprehension of physical harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">In <em>Wubneh, </em>appellant pointed a BB gun at a taxicab driver, said \u201cI have a gun,\u201d and demanded money. 51 Va.App. at 226, 656 S.E.2d at 419. He then hit the driver in the head with a BB gun that looked like a nine-millimeter pistol, and took the driver\u2019s money.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>The issue before this Court was whether the BB gun satisfied the definition of firearm, specifically, having the appearance of firing capacity. <em>Id. </em>at 229, 656 S.E.2d at 420. We held that the evidence was sufficient for the firearm conviction because the weapon appeared to the victim to have firing capability. In referencing <em>Holloman, </em>we emphasized that crime victims are not expected to know the intricate mechanisms of a weapon; it is sufficient if they reasonably perceive the weapon to be one that is capable of firing a bullet. <em>Id. </em>at 230, 656 S.E.2d at 421.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Similarly, in <em>Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 681, 492 S.E.2d 460 (1997), this Court found the evidence was sufficient to prove a BB gun used by Thomas in a robbery was a firearm, based on the victim\u2019s observations and the appearance of the object. We stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-7\">When determining whether a particular object is a \u201cfirearm,\u201d the fact finder may consider the victim\u2019s visual and nonvisual observations of the object, the victim\u2019s knowledge of firearms, the accused\u2019s representations about the object during the commission of the felony, expert testimony, and the appearance of the object itself when it is admitted into evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 687, 492 S.E.2d at 463 (citations omitted). Again, <em>Thomas </em>addressed only the display of a firearm, not the actual use of a weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">Thus, it is clear that the victim\u2019s perception is relevant only in instances when the object is being displayed, not used. In such a case, the injury is intimidation or fear of physical harm. However, if the victim sustains actual physical injury from the use of an actual firearm, the victim\u2019s belief of whether or not the gun is a dangerous weapon is irrelevant. In those instances, the offense is completed when the injury is inflicted. Having already found that appellant used the firearm as contemplated by the statute, we find that in this case L.S. did not have to perceive the weapon to be a dangerous firearm for the conviction to stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">Taking appellant\u2019s argument to the extreme would obligate us to find that if a sniper kills or wounds someone from a great distance, and the victim never sees the weapon, the gunman could never be convicted of using a firearm in the commission of a felony pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1. We decline to read the statute so narrowly. <em>See Ansell, </em>219 Va. at 761, 250 S.E.2d at 761 (discussing that an accused is not entitled to a favorable result based upon an unreasonably restrictive interpretation of a statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">The victim\u2019s injury in this case was physical. L.S.\u2019s inability to perceive that she was being struck with a nine-millimeter pistol is irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the trial court did not err in finding appellant guilty of using a firearm in the commission of robbery. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b549-14\">. The facts were stipulated to and communicated to the trial court by proffer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b550-11\">. Appellant\u2019s question presented asks \"Is a victim's perception of a firearm necessary to sustain a conviction under Va.Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1?\u201d We acknowledge that the question does not specifically address whether the statute prohibits the use of a firearm as a club. However, \"all parties involved in this case addressed the relevant [question] in arguing and deciding the case.\u201d <em>Moore v. Commonwealth, </em>276 Va. 747, 754, 668 S.E.2d 150, 154 (2008). The Attorney General acknowledged at oral argument that the trial court and the appellee on appeal were fully cognizant of appellant\u2019s position. Thus, we find that appellant\u2019s departure from his question presented is not substantial. This issue is not defaulted pursuant to Rule 5A:12. <em>See id. </em>at 753, 668 S.E.2d at 154 (concluding that an appeal should not be dismissed for violation of a non-jurisdictional rule without considering \u201cwhether a party\u2019s failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>adhere strictly to the rule\u2019s requirements is insignificant, or so substantial as to preclude the court\u2019s addressing the merits of the case.\u201d (citing <em>Jay v.

Commonwealth, </em>247 Va. 215, 218, 441 S.E.2d 342, 344 (1994). Thus, once the majority concludes that appellant was guilty of <em>using </em>a firearm in the robbery based on the fact that the victim was hit in the head with a pistol, regardless of whether the victim perceived the pistol, no analysis is required under the second prong of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">Furthermore, in addressing the second prong of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1, the majority, in my opinion, renders an incorrect interpretation of the statute. The majority indicates that, where no physical injury has been inflicted upon the victim with the weapon in the accused\u2019s possession (unlike the instant case), only the second prong of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 is at issue, and the victim\u2019s perception of the weapon as a firearm is a necessary element of the crime. The majority reaches this conclusion based on its reading of <em>Holloman v. Commonwealth, 221 </em>Va. 196, 269 S.E.2d 356 (1980), and <em>Wubneh v. Commonwealth, </em>51 Va.App. 224, 656 S.E.2d 418 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">The Courts in both <em>Holloman </em>and <em>Wubneh </em>concluded that a BB gun constituted a \u201cfirearm\u201d within the meaning of that term under Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 because the BB gun possessed by the perpetrator in each of those cases gave the appearance of having a firing capacity. As such, proscription of the gun under the statute furthered the statute\u2019s intended purpose of discouraging criminal conduct that produces fear of physical harm, as well as preventing actual physical injury or death. <em>Holloman, 221 </em>Va. at 198, 269 S.E.2d at 357-58; <em>Wubneh, 51 </em>Va.App. at 229-30, 656 S.E.2d at 420-21. In neither of those cases, however, did the Court indicate that the victim\u2019s perception of the gun was a prerequisite for sustaining a conviction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>under the second prong of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Rather, the issue was whether the gun should be included within the meaning of \u201cfirearm\u201d under the statute as a matter of law.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In other words, while the determination of whether the gun constituted such a \u201cfirearm\u201d was based on evidence of the gun\u2019s appearance, that determination was not premised upon or limited to the victim\u2019s perception of that appearance. In fact, the Supreme Court in <em>Holloman </em>did not address any evidence regarding the victim\u2019s perception of the gun. The Court, instead, made clear that its conclusion was based on the Court\u2019s own observation of the gun: \u201cThe object in question, part of the record on appeal, appears in size, weight and shape to be a .45 caliber automatic pistol [even though] [testimony showed it fires BBs by the force of a spring, not by gunpowder.\u201d <em>Holloman, </em>221 Va. at 197, 269 S.E.2d at 357.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">For these reasons, I concur in part one of the majority\u2019s analysis and its decision to affirm appellant\u2019s conviction, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>disagree with and would exclude part two of the majority\u2019s analysis as dicta.</p>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b560-6\">. Conduct sought to be deterred by a criminal statute is not necessarily reflected in its entirety in the elements of the crime. <em>See, e.g., Hix </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>270 Va. 335, 341-47, 619 S.E.2d 80, 83-87 (2005) (affirming conviction of attempted indecent liberties with a minor under Code \u00a7 18.2-370 where defendant\u2019s targeted minor victim was, in fact, an adult undercover police officer). Thus, the fact that the intended purpose of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 is, in part, to discourage criminal conduct that produces fear of physical harm does not necessarily mean that proof of a victim's perception of a weapon in a perpetrator\u2019s possession, giving rise to such fear, is an element under either prong of the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b560-7\">. More specifically, the issue was whether a BB gun could be considered a \u201cfirearm\u201d under Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 given that it expelled a projectile by something other than an explosion of gunpowder. In <em>Holloman, </em>the BB gun operated by a spring mechanism, <em>Holloman, </em>221 Va. at 197-98, 269 S.E.2d at 357; and in <em>Wubneh, </em>the BB gun operated by pneumatic pressure, <em>Wubneh, </em>51 Va.App. at 226-27, 656 S.E.2d at 419.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b560-8\">. In <em>Wubneh, </em>this Court considered testimony of both the victim and a witness to the robbery in which the BB gun was used in reviewing evidence of the gun's appearance. <em>Wubneh, </em>51 Va.App. at 226, 656 S.E.2d at 419. Of course, in some cases, the victim will be the sole witness to the weapon in the defendant's possession. <em>See, e.g., Byers v. Commonwealth, </em>23 Va.App. 146, 149-50, 474 S.E.2d 852, 855 (1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
