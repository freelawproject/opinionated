James of conspiracy to commit robbery in violation of Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-58 and 18.2-22. On appeal, James challenges the sufficiency of the evidence used to convict him. Finding the evidence sufficient, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b716-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-14\">On appeal, we review the evidence in the \u201clight most favorable\u201d to the Commonwealth. <em>Commonwealth v. Hudson, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>265 Va. 505, 514, 578 S.E.2d 781, 786 (2003). This principle requires us to \u201cdiscard the evidence of the accused in conflict with that of the Commonwealth, and regard as true all the credible evidence favorable to the Commonwealth and all fair inferences to be drawn therefrom.\u201d <em>Parks v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 492, 498, 270 S.E.2d 755, 759 (1980) (emphasis and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">The evidence at trial showed that Detective Riya Sloan was working undercover in a drug investigation. During telephone conversations, Sloan arranged to purchase marijuana from James. Sloan and James agreed not to bring anyone else to the pre-arranged location. For protection, however, another undercover detective secretly accompanied Sloan to the location. After a phone conversation, James parked his SUV near Sloan\u2019s car, and Sloan gestured for James to come to her car. James refused and demanded that Sloan come to his SUV.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">Sloan went to the driver\u2019s side of James\u2019s SUV and asked to see the marijuana. James declined to show her marijuana, but said he would show it to her if she got into his SUV. Sloan refused. Instead, she walked to the passenger side and spoke to James through an open window. James continued to demand that Sloan get into his SUV, and she repeatedly refused. Police officers listening to the conversation between Sloan and James became concerned and converged on the scene. When officers ordered James from the SUV, an unloaded handgun fell from James\u2019s waistband. One of the officers then found Joshua Mitchell under some clothing in the rear of the SUV. They also discovered a handgun magazine containing bullets in the area where Mitchell was hiding. The magazine matched the handgun that James dropped.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">At the police station, James gave a statement. He said the drug sale was a ruse. He intended to \u201ctake her money.\u201d \u201cIf <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>she was going to give it to me,\u201d James stated, \u201cI was going to apply no force.\u201d His main plan was to simply \u201cintimidate her.\u201d As he explained it, \u201cshe was going to see <em>two dudes </em>and be scared\u201d because \u201cthe game plan was to scare her.\u201d If she handed over the money, \u201cMitchell was going to stay there.\u201d If not, \u201cMitchell was going to scare her.\u201d James said \u201cthat it was <em>two guys </em>against a girl and he figured she\u2019d be scared.\u201d As for the firearm, James initially admitted \u201che was going to show the gun and use it\u201d to get Sloan to give up the money. He later denied this intent. He agreed, however, that \u201cthe <em>two of them </em>were going to scare the girl and take her money.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">Taking the stand in his own defense, James admitted the firearm was his. He said he assumed Mitchell \u201cknew fully what was going on.\u201d Mitchell was in the room when James set up the fake drug deal with Sloan. Mitchell knew James had no marijuana to sell. Mitchell hid in the backseat of the SUV hoping Sloan would not see him. If \u201csomething was going wrong,\u201d James believed, Mitchell \u201cwould jump out or something.\u201d James admitted he told police the firearm would be used, but said he later recanted that statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">On cross-examination, James admitted he intended to \u201ctake the money\u201d from Sloan \u201cby force.\u201d That was his \u201cintention throughout.\u201d He put his \u201cplans into action\u201d with the intent to \u201crob her.\u201d Mitchell observed James retrieve a firearm. James drove to the deal location with his \u201cgun concealed in [his] waistband.\u201d Mitchell was with him \u201cthat whole time.\u201d En route to the planned robbery, Mitchell was initially in the front passenger seat but James ordered him to conceal himself in the backseat. James removed the magazine from the firearm and \u201cthrew the clip to [his] <em>partner </em>in the back.\u201d When asked if he \u201cassumed that [Mitchell] would jump out,\u201d James answered \u2018Tes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">During direct, cross, and redirect testimony, James sought to minimize (and sometimes outright deny) earlier admissions he made to the police and from the witness stand. Though he agreed he intended \u201cto rob her\u201d by himself, James attempted to discount any conspiratorial intent to include Mitchell in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>planned robbery. Sitting as factfinder, the trial court found the evidence proved James and Mitchell conspired together for the purpose of robbing Sloan. James now appeals, claiming the evidence fails as a matter of law to prove him guilty of conspiracy to commit robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Faced with a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, \u201cwe must give trial courts and juries the wide discretion to which a living record, as distinguished from a printed record, logically entitles them. The living record contains many guideposts to the truth which are not in the printed record; not having seen them ourselves, we should give great weight to the conclusions of those who have seen and heard them.\u201d <em>Bradley v. Commonwealth, </em>196 Va. 1126, 1136, 86 S.E.2d 828, 834 (1955). In bench trials, the \u201ctrial judge\u2019s major role is the determination of fact, and with experience in fulfilling that role comes expertise.\u201d <em>Haskins v. Commonwealth, </em>44 Va.App. 1, 11, 602 S.E.2d 402, 407 (2004) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">Consequently, a reviewing court does not \u201cask itself whether <em>it </em>believes that the evidence at the trial established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 318-19, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2788-89, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979) (emphasis in original, citation omitted). Instead, we ask only \u201cwhether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Maxwell v. Commonwealth, </em>275 Va. 437, 442, 657 S.E.2d 499, 502 (2008) (quoting <em>Jackson, </em>443 U.S. at 319, 99 S.Ct. at 2789) (emphasis in original). These principles recognize that appellate courts are \u201cnot permitted to reweigh the evidence,\u201d <em>Nusbaum v. Berlin, </em>273 Va. 385, 408, 641 S.E.2d 494, 507 (2007), because we have no authority \u201cto preside <em>de novo </em>over a second trial,\u201d <em>Haskins, </em>44 Va.App. at 11, 602 S.E.2d at 407.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">To prove a conspiracy, the Commonwealth must offer evidence of \u201can agreement between two or more persons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>by some concerted action to commit an offense.\u201d <em>Wright v. Commonwealth, </em>224 Va. 502, 506, 297 S.E.2d 711, 713 (1982); <em>Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>53 Va.App. 50, 59-60, 669 S.E.2d 354, 358 (2008) (citation omitted). In simplest terms, as Justice Holmes put it, a \u201cconspiracy is a partnership in criminal purposes.\u201d <em>United States v. Kissel, </em>218 U.S. 601, 608, 31 S.Ct. 124, 126, 54 L.Ed. 1168 (1910). Because most conspiracies are \u201cclandestine in nature,\u201d 2 Wayne R. LaFave, <em>Substantive Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 12.2(a), at 266 (2d ed.2003), by \u201cthe very nature of the offense, it often may be established only by indirect and circumstantial evidence,\u201d <em>Wright, </em>224 Va. at 505, 297 S.E.2d at 713 (quoting <em>Floyd v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 575, 580, 249 S.E.2d 171, 174 (1978)). It is a rare case where any \u201cformal agreement among alleged conspirators\u201d can be established. <em>Wilder Enter, v. Allied Artists Pictures Corp., </em>632 F.2d 1135, 1141 (4th Cir.1980); <em>see also Combs v. Commonwealth, </em>30 Va.App. 802, 810, 520 S.E.2d 400, 404 (1999) (holding that proof of an \u201cexplicit agreement is not required\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">As often as not, conspirators play different roles in the criminal plan. Thus, when \u201cit has been shown that the defendants \u2018by their acts <em>pursued the same object, </em>one performing <em>one part </em>and the others performing <em>another part </em>so as to complete it or with a view to its attainment, the [factfinder] will be justified in concluding that they were engaged in a conspiracy to effect that object.\u2019 \u201d <em>Charity v. Commonwealth, </em>49 Va.App. 581, 586, 643 S.E.2d 503, 505 (2007) (emphasis added and citation omitted). As a result, liability \u201cas a conspirator is not dependent on knowledge of the entire scope of the conspiracy.\u201d <em>Amato v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 544, 552, 352 S.E.2d 4, 9 (1987) (citation omitted). \u201cKnowledge need not extend to all the details of the conspiracy, the identity of the other conspirators, the part each member of the conspiracy is to play, or how the spoils of the conspiracy are to be divided.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">Equally important, unlike an attempt crime, a conspiracy is \u201ccomplete when the parties agree to commit an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>offense.\u201d <em>Gray v. Commonwealth, </em>260 Va. 675, 680, 537 S.E.2d 862, 865 (2000). \u201cNo overt act in furtherance of the underlying crime is necessary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>That is, \u201c[w]hen the parties <em>agree </em>to commit an offense, they have committed the crime of conspiracy, regardless of whether an act in furtherance of the underlying crime has been performed.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Commonwealth, </em>52 Va.App. 501, 509, 664 S.E.2d 514, 518 (2008) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">The facts of this case fully support the trial court\u2019s ruling. At trial, James said he planned to \u201crob\u201d Sloan\u2014which, he admitted on cross-examination, meant he intended to \u201ctake the money from her by force.\u201d That was his \u201cintention throughout,\u201d James admitted. He put his \u201cplans into action\u201d with the intent to \u201crob her.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> From that starting premise\u2014 James\u2019s admitted plan to rob Sloan\u2014the trial court found as a fact that Mitchell agreed to participate in James\u2019s plan. From his own statements to police and his testimony at trial, James laid the factual groundwork for the conspiracy inference. James agreed that:</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">\u25a0 The victim \u201cwas going to see <em>two dudes </em>and be scared\u201d because \u201cthe <em>game plan </em>was to scare her.\u201d J.A. at 151.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">\u25a0 It would be <em>\u201ctwo guys </em>against a girl and he figured she\u2019d be scared.\u201d J.A. at 151.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">\u25a0 The <em>\u201ctwo of them </em>were going to scare the girl and take her money.\u201d J.A. at 153.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>\u25a0 If she handed over the money \u201cMitchell was going to stay there.\u201d If not, <em>\u201cMitchell was going to scare her.\u201d </em>J.A. at 151.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">\u25a0 Mitchell, James assumed, <em>\u201cknew fully </em>what was going on.\u201d J.A. at 166.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">\u25a0 Mitchell was in the room when James set up the fake drug deal with Sloan. J.A. at 167.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">\u25a0 Mitchell knew James had no marijuana to sell. J.A. at 167.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">\u25a0 Mitchell hid in the back of the SUV so Sloan would not see him. J.A. at 167, 175.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-9\">\u25a0 If \u201csomething was going wrong,\u201d James expected Mitchell \u201cwould jump out or something.\u201d J.A. at 168.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-10\">\u25a0 Mitchell observed James retrieve a firearm. James drove to the deal location with his \u201cgun concealed in [his] waistband.\u201d Mitchell was with him \u201cthat whole time.\u201d J.A. at 174.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-11\">\u25a0 En route to the planned robbery, Mitchell was initially in the front passenger seat but James ordered him to conceal himself in the backseat. J.A. at 176.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-12\">\u25a0 James removed the magazine from the firearm and \u201cthrew the clip to [his] <em>partner </em>in the back.\u201d J.A. at 177.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-13\">\u25a0 When asked if he \u201cassumed that [Mitchell] would jump out,\u201d James answered, \u201cYes.\u201d J.A. at 180.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-14\">(Emphasis added.) In short, a rational factfinder could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that James intended to rob Sloan and that Mitchell\u2014his \u201cpartner\u201d\u2014agreed to help him do so.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b722-15\">James argues our analysis is incomplete. Even if a rational factfinder could infer a conspiracy to rob, James contends, the factfinder could also have inferred the entire episode was just a series of coincidences betraying no agreed plan of criminality or, if a plan, only a mere conspiracy to obtain \u201cmoney by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>false pretenses.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 14. This logical possibility, James concludes, renders the evidence in support of his conviction insufficient as a matter of law. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">Properly understood, \u201cthe reasonable-hypothesis principle is not a discrete rule unto itself.\u201d <em>Haskins, </em>44 Va.App. at 8, 602 S.E.2d at 405. \u201cThe statement that circumstantial evidence must exclude every reasonable theory of innocence is simply another way of stating that the Commonwealth has the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Hudson, </em>265 Va. at 513, 578 S.E.2d at 785. Thus, the principle \u201cdoes not add to the burden of proof placed upon the Commonwealth in a criminal case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It merely \u201creiterates the standard applicable to every criminal case.\u201d <em>Pease v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 342, 360, 573 S.E.2d 272, 280 (2002) <em>(en banc) </em>(citation and internal quotation marks omitted), <em>affd, </em>266 Va. 397, 588 S.E.2d 149 (2003) <em>(per curiam, </em>order adopting reasoning of the Court of Appeals).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">Whether the hypothesis of innocence is reasonable is itself a \u201cquestion of fact,\u201d subject to deferential appellate review. <em>Haskins, </em>44 Va.App. at 9, 602 S.E.2d at 406 (citation omitted). \u201cMerely because defendant\u2019s theory of the case differs from that taken by the Commonwealth does not mean that every reasonable hypothesis consistent with his innocence has not been excluded. What weight should be given evidence is a matter for the [factfinder] to decide.\u201d <em>Miles v. Commonwealth, </em>205 Va. 462, 467, 138 S.E.2d 22, 27 (1964). \u201cBy finding the defendant guilty, therefore, the factfinder \u2018has found by a process of elimination that the evidence does not contain a reasonable theory of innocence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Haskins, </em>44 Va.App. at 9, 602 S.E.2d at 406 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">True, a factfinder \u201ccannot \u2018arbitrarily\u2019 choose, as between two equally plausible interpretations, one that incrim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>inates the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). The choice becomes <em>arbitrary, </em>however, only when \u201cno rational factfinder\u201d could believe the incriminating inferences and disbelieve the exculpatory inferences. <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In other words, when examining an \u201calternate hypothesis of innocence in a circumstantial evidence case,\u201d the question is not whether \u201csome evidence\u201d supports the hypothesis, but whether a rational factfinder could have found the incriminating evidence renders the hypothesis of innocence unreasonable. <em>Emerson v. Commonwealth, </em>43 Va.App. 263, 277, 597 S.E.2d 242, 249 (2004) (citing <em>Hudson, </em>265 Va. at 513, 578 S.E.2d at 785).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">These principles apply to conspiracy cases no differently than any other. To be sure, in <em>Wright, </em>the Virginia Supreme Court summarized the point just this way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-6\">Defendants further argue that even if this is the case, there is insufficient evidence to show they had conspired to commit a robbery. They argue it is <em>equally likely </em>they had set out to commit another felony or even a misdemeanor. We do not agree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-7\">We have held in a number of cases that <em>the finder of fact may draw reasonable inferences that a defendant intended to commit one crime rather than another.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-8\"><em>Wright, </em>224 Va. at 505, 297 S.E.2d at 713 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-10\">In sum, the evidence supports the trial court\u2019s finding that James conspired to commit robbery in violation of Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-58 and 18.2-22. We thus affirm his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"Az3\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b716-15\">. Earlier in these proceedings, the Virginia Supreme Court vacated James\u2019s convictions for attempted robbery and the attempted use of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>firearm. <em>Jay v. Commonwealth, </em>275 Va. 510, 659 S.E.2d 311 (2008).

At other times during his testimony, James attempted to recant those remarks (particularly when rehabilitated by defense counsel on redirect), but the trial court had no obligation to credit the recantation and discredit the confession. On appeal, \"when 'faced with a record of historical facts that supports conflicting inferences,\u2019 a court reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence 'must presume\u2014even if it does not affirmatively appear in the record\u2014that the trier of fact resolved any such conflicts in favor of the prosecution, and must defer to that resolution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Harper v.
