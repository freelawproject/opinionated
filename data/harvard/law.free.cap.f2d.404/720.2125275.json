In subsequent proceedings to determine his competency to stand trial, an order was entered on February 4, 1966, finding him not competent and he was sent to a federal medical center to receive psychiatric treatment. Again on July 13, 1966, on psychiatric reports from the federal medical center an order was entered finding him still incompetent to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-30\">On December 2, 1966, another hearing on appellant\u2019s competence was held and he was declared competent to stand trial. The trial was held May 1 and 2, 1967. Appellant\u2019s defense was insanity, and two psychiatrists testified for him as expert witnesses. One of them at the time of trial was on the staff of the United States Public Health Service Hospital at Lexington, Kentucky, where appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>lant had been treated. The other psychiatrist had likewise been on the staff of the Lexington hospital at the time he examined appellant. Both testified that at the time of the offense appellant was suffering from serious mental illness (schizophrenia). Neither testified that appellant was so mentally ill as not to know the difference between right and wrong. One testified that \u201cthis act was to a substantial degree a product of his mental illness.\u201d And the other said, \u201cIn my opinion this action could have certainly been related to his mental disorder as to cause and effect.\u201d He answered affirmatively a question as to whether appellant\u2019s illness had substantially impaired his ability to conform his conduct to what he knew to be right.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">The following portion of Dr. Pfeiffer\u2019s testimony is typical of the diagnosis of each psychiatrist:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-5\">\u201cQ. Based upon your examination, Doctor, do you have an opinion as to whether or not Mr. Smith was suffering from the mental illness which you have described, schizophrenic reaction, on October 19, 1965 ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-6\">\u201cA. I saw him during December of 1965 and at that time made a diagnosis of a chronic schizophrenic reaction. We don\u2019t use that term unless we think the illness has existed for at least six months or so. I think that would mean by implication that he must have carried that diagnosis then, too. This is the way we make medical diagnoses. But obviously I didn\u2019t examine him on that date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-7\">\u201cQ. But your considered medical opinion is that he was suffering from that mental illness on October 19, 1965?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-8\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-9\">\u201cQ. Now based upon your examination of the defendant and your diagnosis of this mental illness or defect at the time the robbery was committed, do you have an opinion based on a reasonable medical certainty as to whether the robbery was the product of this mental illness or disorder?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-12\">\u201cA. I would answer that that in my opinion this act was to a substantial degree a product of his mental illness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-13\">\u201cQ. What do you mean by a substantial degree, Doctor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-14\">\u201cA. It played a major role in his committing the act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-15\">\u201cQ. It played a major role?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-16\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-17\">\u201cQ. Doctor, based upon your examination of the defendant again and your diagnosis of mental illness on October 19, 1965, the date the robbery was committed, do you have an opinion based on reasonable medical certainty as to whether the defendant at the time he committed the act charged was capable of knowing right from wrong in respect to such act, and if he did know the difference, whether as a result of his mental illness he was able to conform his actions to the requirements of the law?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-18\">\u201cA. I think he knew that to rob a bank was unlawful. I\u2019m not certain that he fully understood the implications of such an act. I think he knew that it was unlawful to rob a bank. As to the question of whether he was able to adhere to the right, I think here I would say that his ability in this regard was substantially impaired as the result of his emotional disorder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-19\">\u201cQ. Your testimony is that his ability to adhere to the right was substantially impaired?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-20\">\u201cA. Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b784-21\">The government produced no psychiatric testimony but relied upon cross-examination of appellant\u2019s expert witnesses, plus the testimony of its lay witnesses as to appellant\u2019s conduct and statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-22\">Appellant\u2019s attorney presented two requests to charge \u2014 one based upon the <em>Durham </em>rule,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the other upon the American Law Institute\u2019s test of erimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>nal responsibility.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The District Judge gave neither of these charges. Nor was the charge drawn from this circuit\u2019s last major treatment of the problem of criminal responsibility in Pollard v. United States, 282 F.2d 450 (6th Cir. 1960).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Instead, at the government\u2019s request, he gave the following charge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-4\">\u201c \u2018Insane,\u2019 as used in these instructions, means such a perverted and deranged mental condition as renders a person incapable of distinguishing between right and wrong, or incapable of knowing the nature of the act he is committing; or, even where a person is conscious of the nature of the act he is committing, and is able to distinguish between right and wrong, yet his will \u2014 the governing power of his mind \u2014 has been so completely destroyed that his actions are not subject to it, but are beyond his control.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-5\">\u201cFor the purpose of throwing light upon the mental condition of the accused at the time of the alleged offense, the Jury may consider evidence of his mental state both before and after that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-6\">\u201cTemporary insanity, as well as insanity of longer duration, is recognized by the law. If the Jury has a reasonable doubt, from the evidence in the case, whether the defendant was sane at the time of the alleged offense, he should be acquitted, even though it may appear that he was sane at earlier and later times.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b785-13\">This instruction is supported by dictum from the last time (1897) the United States Supreme Court considered an insanity charge. See Davis v. United States (I), 160 U.S. 469, 16 S.Ct. 353, 40 L.Ed. 499 (1895), and Davis v. United States (II), 165 U.S. 373, 17 S.Ct. 360, 41 L.Ed. 750 (1897). It is a variation of the classic M\u2019Naghten right-wrong test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-14\">\u201cTo establish a defense on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved that at the time of committing the act, the party accused was labour-ing under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing; or if he did know it, that he did not know it was wrong.\u201d Daniel M\u2019Naghten\u2019s Case, 8 Eng.Rep. 718, 722 (H.L. 1843).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b785-15\"> A Supreme Court holding directly in point on the issue of criminal responsibility would, of course, foreclose our consideration of any alternative. But three factors weigh strongly against the <em>Davis </em>cases being regarded as such specific authority. First, the advance of scientific knowledge in the field of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>psychiatry since 1897 is itself sufficient to render inapplicable any case decided without benefit of modern knowledge. See Durham v. United States, 94 U.S.App.D.C. 228, 214 F.2d 862, 45 A.L.R.2d 1430 (1954), and authorities collected therein; Sobeloff, Insanity and the Criminal Law: From M\u2019Naghten to <em>Durham, </em>and Beyond, 41 A.B.A.J. 793 (1955). Second, the <em>Davis </em>cases were primarily concerned with burden of proof and laid down no rule of law as to a single insanity test. These cases, at most, said that giving the instruction at issue here was not prejudicial error in 1897. United States v. Freeman, 357 F.2d 606, 613-614 (2d Cir. 1966). And third, many courts prior to now have formulated tests in modern psychiatric terms with at least the tacit sanction<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of the United States Supreme Court. United States v. Chandler, 393 F.2d 920 (4th Cir. 1968); United States v. Shapiro, 383 F.2d 680 (7th Cir. 1967); Pope v. United States, 372 F.2d 710 (8th Cir. 1967); United States v. Freeman, 357 F.2d 606 (2d Cir. 1966); Wion v. United States, 325 F.2d 420 (10th Cir. 1963), cert. denied, 377 U.S. 946, 84 S.Ct. 1354, 12 L.Ed.2d 309 (1964); United States v. Currens, 290 F.2d 751 (3d Cir. 1961); McDonald v. United States, 114 U.S.App.D.C. 120, 312 F.2d 847 (1962), modifying Durham v. United States, 94 U.S.App.D.C. 228, 214 F.2d 862, 45 A.L.R.2d 1430 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">All of these courts have rejected the M\u2019Naghten test. In <em>Durham, </em>Judge Bazelon for the D. C. Circuit said:'</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-6\">\u201cWe find that as an exclusive criterion the right-wrong test is inadequate in that (a) it does not take sufficient account of psychic realities and scientific knowledge, and (b) it is based upon one symptom and so cannot validly be applied in all circumstances.\u201d Durham v. United States, 94 U.S.App.D.C. 228, 214 F.2d 862, 874 (1954).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b786-8\">In <em>Currens, </em>Judge Biggs for the Third Circuit said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-9\">\u201cThe vast absurdity of the application of the M\u2019Naghten Rules in order to determine the sanity or insanity, the mental health or lack of it, of the defendant by securing the answer to a single question: Did the defendant know the difference between right and wrong, appears clearly when one surveys the array of symptom-atology which the skilled psychiatrist employs in determining the mental condition of an individual.\u201d United States v. Currens, 290 F.2d 751, 766-767 (3d Cir. 1961).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b786-10\">In <em>Pollard, </em>Judge McAllister, speaking for the Sixth Circuit, in adding \u201cirresistible impulse\u201d to the M\u2019Naghten test, cited authorities criticizing the use of M\u2019Naghten alone. See Pollard v. United States, 282 F.2d 450, 455-457 (6th Cir. 1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-11\">In <em>Freeman, </em>Judge Kaufman for the Second Circuit said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-12\">\u201cThe true vice of M\u2019Naghten is not, therefore, that psychiatrists will feel constricted in artificially structuring their testimony but rather that the ultimate deciders \u2014 rthe judge or the jury \u2014 will be deprived of information vital to their final judgment. \u2022 For whatever the social climate of Victorian England, today\u2019s complex and sophisticated society will not be satisfied with simplistic decisions, based solely upon a man\u2019s ability to \u2018know\u2019 right from wrong.\u201d United States v. Freeman, 357 F.2d 606, 620 (2d Cir. 1966).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b786-13\">See also Diamond, Criminal Responsibility of the Mentally 111, 14 STAN.L. REV. 59, 60-61 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-14\">In our instant case there was, of course, no occasion to give the M\u2019Naghten charge at all. The defendant did not contend that he was incapable of understanding the difference between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>right and wrong, and there was no testimony to support submission of that issue. Excessive emphasis upon the M\u2019Naghten issue when the facts do not present it can prejudice the jury\u2019s consideration of other relevant tests of insanity.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-4\">Further, the charge given required the jury to find that defendant had a \u201cperverted and deranged mental condition.\u201d No stand\u00e1rds at all are offered the jury in relation to such a finding, and in normal parlance the word \u201cperverted\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> might tend to suggest a requirement that the jury find deviant sex practices on the part of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">The control test set forth in the charge of the court by its wording would seem to eliminate a finding of insanity as to any persons other than idiots or persons under the impact of psychotic panic or complete hallucination. The language is not calculated to suggest that criminal responsibility is absent when <em>the act charged </em>was caused by mental illness. <em>On the </em>contrary, it requires the jury to find that the \u201cwill \u2014 the governing power of his mind \u2014 has been so completely destroyed that <em>his actions </em>are not subject to it, but are beyond his control.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">The charge as given in this case appears to us little improvement on that given by Justice Tracy in 1724, that a man could escape punishment if he \u201cdoth not know what he is doing, no more than an infant, than a brute, or a wild beast.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We shall comment on the temporary insanity portion of the Judge\u2019s charge later.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">In the light of modern knowledge, it is clear that the \u201cright-wrong\u201d test of criminal responsibility is inadequate. There are many forms of mental illness where the illness may be serious enough to deprive the person concerned of any actual choice of conduct where nonetheless he does possess knowledge of what is right or wrong in legal or moral terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-12\">Judge Sobeloff reminds us that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-13\">\u201cThe Royal Commission reported in 1953 that the \u2018right and wrong\u2019 test had been objected to by experienced doctors- for over a hundred years as \u2018based on an entirely obsolete and misleading conception of the nature of insanity, since insanity does not only, or primarily, affect the cognitive or intellectual faculties, but affects the whole personality of the patient, including both the will and the emotions. An insane person may therefore often know the nature and quality of his act and that it is wrong and forbidden by law, and yet commit it as a result of the mental disease.\u2019 [Report of the Royal Commission on Capital Punishment, 1949-1953. Cmd. No. 8932 at page 80.]\u201d Sobeloff, Insanity and the Criminal Law: From M\u2019Naghten to <em>Durham,, </em>and Beyond, 41 A.B.A.J. 793, 794 (1955).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b787-14\"><em>Pollard, </em>of course, added a major new dimension to the insanity test as approved in this circuit. It is clear that <em>Pollard\u2019s </em>temporary insanity test is applicable, regardless of whether the defendant knew the difference between right and wrong. Where under the influence of sudden stresses mental illness developed which deprived a person of free choice of conduct, a jury could find him not guilty because of temporary insanity.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-15\">The irresistible impulse formula has, however, some serious deficiencies. It does not provide for consideration of those cases of mental illness where long brooding of a person mentally ill has as compelling a result as any sudden onset of temporary insanity. As Judge Bazelon stated in <em>Durham:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-16\">\u201cWe find that the \u201cirresistible impulse\u2019 test is also inadequate in that it gives no recognition to mental ill<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>ness characterized by brooding and reflection and so relegates acts caused by such illness to the application of the inadequate right-wrong test. We conclude that a broader test should be adopted.\u201d Durham v. United States, 94 U.S.App.D.C. 228, 214 F.2d 862, 874 (1954).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">The Durham rule when formulated represented an historic break from the ironbound M\u2019Naghten rule. It was hailed (and properly) as making psychiatric testimony both useful and welcome in the courts. See Sobeloff, Insanity and the Criminal Law: From M\u2019Naghten to <em>Durham, </em>and Beyond, 41 A.B.A.J. 793, 794 (1955); Comment, Criminal Law\u2014 Reexamination of Tests for Criminal Responsibility, 53 MICH.L.REV. 963, 965 (1955); 40 CORNELL L.Q. 135, 138 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">But it, too, had weaknesses. If there were any mental illness, any subsequent act might be termed \u201ca product\u201d in some sense of the illness. This fact, plus the fact that psychiatric testimony on the product test tends to invade the jury province, has led to modification of the <em>Durham </em>rule by the court which authored it. In McDonald v. United States, 114 U.S.App.D.C. 120, 312 F.2d 847, 851 (1962), the D.C. Circuit defined mental illness as \u201cany abnormal condition of the mind which substantially affects mental or emotional processes and substantially impairs behavior controls.\u201d This modification appears to us to bring the D.C. Circuit rule very close to the formulation adopted by the ALI which we will discuss later.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">Still another important effort has been made to formulate a legal test of criminal responsibility. In 1961 Judge Biggs of the Third Circuit made a careful analysis of the conflicting views on this topic and the Third Circuit adopted this test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-7\">\u201cThe jury must be satisfied that at the time of committing the prohibited act the defendant, as a result of mental disease or defect, lacked substantial capacity to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law which he is alleged to have violated.\u201d United States v. Currens, 290 F.2d 751, 774 (3d Cir. 1961).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b788-10\">The primary distinction <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> between the Currens test as formulated by Judge Biggs and the ALI formulatioh is that the ALI retains specific reference to the M\u2019Naghten test of knowledge of the wrongfulness of the act committed. Of course, the problem with M\u2019Naghten as a test of insanity was that it defined a very limited class of the insane. M\u2019Naghten was certainly deficient as an exclusive test. But the ALI test elimi-ates the exclusive character of M\u2019Nagh-ten while retaining its substance as one of the tests of criminal responsibility. We do not regard this difference as a critical one.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-11\">Four considerations in relation to what definition of criminal responsibility should be adopted in this circuit are, we believe: First, does it comport with the realities of scientific knowledge and medical and correctional facilities as they presently exist? Second, does it make fully available to the jury such psychiatric information as medical science has to offer in relation to the individual defendant? Third, is it a workable definition which a jury can understand? Fourth, does it serve the development of a generally acceptable federal standard ?</p>\n<p id=\"b788-12\">In the Model Penal Code the ALI formulated this test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-13\">\u201cA person is not responsible for criminal conduct if at the time of such conduct as a result of mental disease or defect he lacks substantial capacity either to appreciate the criminality [wrongfulness] of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law.\u201d MODEL PENAL CODE \u00a7 4.01 (Official Draft, 1962).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b789-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>Four federal circuits have adopted the ALI test squarely. United States v. Chandler, 393 F.2d 920, 927 (4th Cir., 1968); United States v. Shapiro, 383 F.2d 680, 686 (7th Cir. 1967); United States v. Freeman, 357 F.2d 606, 622 (2d Cir. 1966); Wion v. United States, 325 F.2d 420, 427 (10th Cir. 1963), cert. denied, 377 U.S. 946, 84 S.Ct. 1354, 12 L.Ed.2d 309 (1964). As we have pointed out, two other circuits (the Third Circuit in United States v. Currens, 290 F.2d 751 (3d Cir. 1961), and the D.C. Circuit in Durham v. United States, 94 U.S.App.D.C. 228, 214 F.2d 862 (1954)) have adopted formulations which we view as close approximations of the ALI test as we quote and apply it. Several states have likewise squarely adopted or indicated approval of the ALI test. Ill.Ann. Stat. ch. 38, \u00a7 6-2 (Smith-Hurd 1964); Vt.Stat.Ann. tit. 13, \u00a7 4801 (1959); State v. Shoffner, 31 Wis.2d 412, 143 N.W.2d 458 (1966); State v. Schantz, 98 Ariz. 200, 403 P.2d 521 (1965); State v. D\u2019Haemers, 276 Minn. 332, 150 N.W.2d 61 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-4\">We now elect generally to adhere to the test of criminal responsibility quoted above from the Model Penal Code.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We believe it to be a test which a jury will readily comprehend; one which comports with and makes available modern scientific knowledge and one which may serve to aid the continuing development of the federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">The questions for jury consideration pertaining to criminal responsibility when defendant offers an insanity defense are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b789-9\">1. Was he suffering from a mental illness at the time of the commission of the crime?</p>\n<p id=\"b789-10\">2. Was that illness such as to prevent his knowing the wrongfulness of his act?</p>\n<p id=\"b789-11\">3. Was the mental illness such as to render him substantially incapable of conforming his conduct to the requirements of the law he is charged with violating?</p>\n<p id=\"b789-12\">A negative finding as to the first question or negative findings as to both the second and third questions would require rejection of the insanity defense. An affirmative finding as to the first question, plus an affirmative finding as to either the second or the third question, would require a jury verdict of \u201cnot guilty\u201d because of defendant\u2019s lack of criminal responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-13\">If in the judgment of the court the lay and psychiatric testimony provides no issue in relation to the second question, there is no need to submit it to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-14\">We emphasize that by approving the ALI standard and by setting forth the questions above we are not seeking to require judicial instructions in these specific words.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-15\">We have given careful thought to what effect our adoption of the ALI rule should have upon the instant case. We recognize, of course, that the District Judge had reason to rely upon the <em>Davis </em>charge, particularly since the explicit approval of change and development in this area of the law by the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>Supreme Court (see footnote 8 supra) followed rather than preceded his action. We conclude, however, that when an overruling decision is made, it ordinarily should apply at least to the case at issue and similar cases then pending upon appeal. Any other general rule would tend to discourage the growth and development of case law. Since the psychiatric evidence in this record was such as to present an issue of fact for jury consideration under the test we have approved .above, the omission of the ALI rule must be treated as reversible error and occasion remand of the instant case for retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">In so doing we adopt the policy \u25a0on retroactivity recently formulated by the Second Circuit in its well considered en bane decision on this problem. United States v. Tarrago, 398 F.2d 621 (2d Cir. 1968). The ALI test, or some reasonable approximation of it, will be employed in all future criminal trials where the insanity defense is tendered in this circuit. Retrial will be granted only as to those cases involving such defense which are now on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">On retrial of this ease if appellant\u2019s counsel again offers evidence pertaining to diagnosis of appellant as incompetent to stand trial, it should be received in evidence. Although the result of a competency hearing is not admissible at the trial (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4244), evidence obtained in the course of that hearing is relevant and an important part of appellant\u2019s medical history. The statute relied on at this trial to bar such evidence was obviously drafted to bar admission of such evidence <em>against </em>the accused and the accused can waive its benefit. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4244 (1964); Bailey v.

On retrial a different record may be developed, and we do not encourage reliance upon lay testimony to meet psychiatric evidence pertaining to mental illness. But a review of this trial record does not suggest re-examination of the established rule that lay testimony may, at least under some circumstances, serve to create an issue of fact for the jury as to a defendant\u2019s criminal responsibility.

We do not, however, adopt the following additional definition endorsed by the ALI: \u201cAs used in this Article, the terms \u2018mental disease or defect\u2019 do not include any abnormality manifested only by re-peted criminal or otherwise anti-social conduct.\u201d MODEL PENAL CODE \u00a7 4.01(2) (Official Draft, 1962). The purpose of this definitional sentence was obviously to exclude from the definition of insanity \u201cpsychopathic personalities\u201d who demonstrate mental abnormality principally by habitual violation of the law. The ALI commentators argue that to date mental health facilities in this nation offer little hope for curative treatment of these persons, and that mental health facilities are already overburdened by patients as to whom the prospects for successful treatment are considerably brighter. There is, however, great dispute over the psychiatric soundness of section 4.01 (2).
