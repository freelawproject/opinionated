He was convicted in the Adams County, Colorado District Court for burglary, larceny, and conspiracy to commit both offenses. He received consecutive sentences for these offenses totaling thirteen years. In the same year he was convicted of forgery in Denver County and was sentenced to a term of not less than ten, nor more than twelve years, this sentence to run concurrently with the Adams County sentence. Petitioner\u2019s convictions were affirmed in Rhodus v. People, 158 Colo. 264, 406 P.2d 679, and Rhodus v. People, 160 Colo. 407, 418 P.2d 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-17\">This habeas corpus petition filed in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado attacks only the latter sentence, and petitioner would not be entitled to immediate release if relief were granted. Relying on the rule of McNally v. Hill, 293 U.S. 131, 55 S.Ct. 24, 79 L.Ed. 238, that habeas corpus relief was available only when the prisoner was entitled to immediate release, the petition was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-18\">This appeal is limited to a consideration of the effect of Peyton v. Rowe, 391 U.S. 54, 88 S.Ct. 1549, 20 L.Ed.2d 426, and Walker v. Wainwright, 390 U.S. 335, 88 S.Ct. 962, 19 L.Ed.2d 1215, on our application of <em>McNally </em>in such cases as Roberts v. Crouse, 10 Cir., 350 F.2d 299; Browning v. Crouse, 10 Cir., 327 F.2d 529. The <em>McNally </em>case was specifically overruled. In the <em>Peyton </em>case the court concluded \u201cthat the decision in that case was compelled neither by statute nor by history and that today it represents an indefensible barrier to prompt adjudication of constitutional claims in federal courts.\u201d The failure to allege and establish the right to immediate release as applied in <em>McNally </em>and like cases is no longer a basis for denial of relief to one seeking an adjudication of the validity of his detention on constitutional grounds. In addition to the reasons set forth in a companion case, Sciberras v. United States, 10 Cir., 404 F.2d 247, it appears because of the delays inherent in the court system, alluded to by the Supreme Court, Peyton v. Rowe, supra, Rhodus would unnecessarily be confined an extra year after completion of the Denver sentence while attacking the Adams County conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-19\">We hold therefore that Rhodus is \u201cin custody\u201d for the purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(c) (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-20\">The order of dismissal is set aside and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent herewith.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
