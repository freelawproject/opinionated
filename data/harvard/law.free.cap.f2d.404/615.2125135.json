BUJESE, Appellant, v. UNITED STATES of America.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b677-6\">No. 17093.</docketnumber>\n<court data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b677-7\">United States Court of Appeals Third Circuit.</court>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b677-8\">Argued Nov. 22, 1968.</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b677-9\">Decided Dec. 30, 1968.</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b677-17\">Thomas I.

If the District Court finds that Bujese did not, of his own volition, knowingly and intelligently execute the election not to serve his sentence, realizing the effects of such waiver, then the application to reduce his sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 should be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-23\">If the District Court finds to the contrary, it may, if it deems it appropriate under all the circumstances, proceed to determine whether it would be \u201cjust and practicable\u201d, in its opinion, to give retroactive effect to Rule 38(a), Fed.R.Crim. Proc., 18 U.S.C.A., as amended July 1, 1966, to negate Bujese\u2019s election, since the instant case was still pending on the effective date of the stated amendment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b677-24\">The foregoing issues were not presented to this Court at the time of Bujese\u2019s former appeal at our No. 15034, 371 F.2d 120 (1967). Concerning these, and any other relevant issues which may be presented, we express no opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-25\">Accordingly, the judgment will be vacated and the case remanded with directions to proceed in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b677-14\">. This amended rule \u201cshall govern all criminal proceedings thereafter commenced and so far as just and practicable all proceedings then pending\u201d (39 F.R.D. 271). See Leyvas v. United States, 371 F.2d 714, 719 (9 Cir. 1967); McCoy v. United States, 125 U.S.App.D.C. 202, 370 F.2d 224 (1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
