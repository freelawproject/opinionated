This District Court order recited that appellant had filed a prior application (Civil No. 172-67) which was \u201csubstantially the same\u201d and that this order was being entered for \u201cthe reasons set forth\u201d in the Memorandum filed in that prior action on April 20, 1967, when the prior application was denied.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b997-19\">After careful examination of the record and the briefs, the order of November 30, 1967, will be affirmed for the reasons stated by Senior Judge Madden in his Memorandum of April 20, 1967 (Civil No. 172-67, D.N.J.).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b997-15\">. It is noted that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 contains this language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b997-16\">\u201cThe sentencing court shall not be required to entertain a second or successive motion for similar relief on behalf of the same prisoner.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b997-17\">. Since the length of the sentence was less than that permitted on each of the two counts of the indictment to which the pleas of guilty were entered, any deficiency in the court\u2019s not referring at the time of pleas to the intent required under Count I of the indictment did not make the sentence illegal. See Green v. United States, 365 U.S. 301, 306, 81 S.Ct. 653, 656, 5 L.Ed.2d 670, rehearing denied 365 U.S. 890, 81 S.Ct. 1024, 6 L.Ed.2d 201 (1961), where the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b997-34\">\u201cPlainly enough, the intention of the district judge was to impose the maximum sentence of twenty-five years for aggravated bank robbery, and the formal defect in his procedure should not vitiate his considered judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b997-35\">The inadvertent reference in the 4/20/67 Memorandum to the offense in Count II as being a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113 (b) (rather than \u00a7 2113(a)) was at the most harmless error.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
