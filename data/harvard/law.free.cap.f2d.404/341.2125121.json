We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>The evidence presented at the hearing fails to support the appellant\u2019s contentions that he was coerced and physically beaten into signing a confession, that he was denied counsel at the time of his arrest and interrogation, and that his guilty plea was not voluntarily entered. The district judge found appellant\u2019s testimony to be untrustworthy, and the transcript and record support this view. The findings and judgment of the district court are not clearly erroneous and are hereby affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
