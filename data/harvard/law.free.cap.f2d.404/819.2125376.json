SKELLY WRIGHT, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b882-15\">Appellant was convicted on three counts of robbery and sentenced to imprisonment for from two to six years on each count, sentences to be served concurrently. On appeal we consider, first, whether testimony as to a statement Proctor made at the police station was admissible under Miranda v. State of Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), and second whether an in-court identification was proper under Stovall v. Denno, 388 U.S. 293, 87 S.Ct.1967, 18 L.Ed.2d 1199 (1967). We conclude that further facts are necessary before either point can be decided, and hence we remand the case to the District Court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-17\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b882-18\">Two days after four men robbed a Safeway store, Proctor was arrested at home. He was read the <em>Miranda </em>warnings, and taken to the police station. There, in the course of filling out a \u201clineup sheet\u201d on appellant, the arresting officer asked him whether he was employed. According to the officer, Proctor answered that he had not worked for three weeks, but that when he did work it was for his uncle, Alfred Brown.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-19\">At trial Proctor testified that he had been working for his uncle at the time the robbery was committed. On cross-examination he denied having told the officer that he had not worked for three weeks. The Government then brought on the arresting officer, who testified as described above.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-20\"><em>Miranda </em>teaches that suspects have a right to remain silent and a right to the assistance of counsel \u2014 appointed counsel if need be \u2014 when they are subject to in-custody interrogation. 384 U.S. at 467-473, 86 S.Ct. 1602. Statements obtained in derogation of these rights are not admissible into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-21\"> At the outset, we hold that the questions which the arresting officer asked Proctor <em>in </em>the course of filling out the lineup sheet constituted in-custody interrogation. It may be that the officer asked these questions without any intent to elicit from Proctor a statement, damaging or otherwise, bearing on the crime with which he was charged. But the intent with which the questions were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>asked is not relevant here. Even innocent questions asked of a suspect in the inherently coercive atmosphere of the police station may create in him the impression that he must answer them. His answers then cannot be considered voluntary in the sense required by <em>Miranda. </em>Where such answers turn out to be damaging to the suspect, they cannot be used against him at trial, absent a valid waiver of the <em>Miranda </em>rights. As the Supreme Court has held in a related context:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-5\">\u201c * * * The arrested person may, of course, be \u2018booked\u2019 by the police. But he is not to be taken to police headquarters in order to carry out a process of inquiry that lends itself, <em>even if not so designed, </em>to eliciting damaging statements to support * * his guilt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">Mallory v. United States, 354 U.S. 449, 454, 77 S.Ct. 1356, 1359, 1 L.Ed.2d 1479 (1957). (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b883-7\">It is argued that the <em>Walder-Tate </em>doctrine <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> permits the introduction, for impeachment purposes, of evidence obtained in violation of <em>Miranda. </em>According to that doctrine, when a defendant goes beyond a mere denial of complicity in the crime to introduce an affirmative defense, illegally obtained evidence may be introduced to impeach him on collateral matters relating to that defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-8\">Without considering whether the impeachment in this case was on a point sufficiently collateral to come within <em>Walder </em>and <em>Tate, </em>we hold that the <em>Wald-er-Tate </em>exception to the exclusionary rule does not apply to evidence obtained in violation of <em>Miranda.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b883-9\">In <em>Miranda </em>the Court commanded the exclusion of all statements obtained in violation of its strictures:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-10\">\u201c * * * [N] o distinction may be drawn between inculpatory statements and statements alleged to be merely \u2018exculpatory.\u2019 If a statement made were in fact truly exculpatory it would, of course, never be used by the prosecution. <em>In fact, statements merely intended tobe exculpatory by the defendant are often used to impeach his testimony at trial </em>or to demonstrate untruths in the statement given under interrogation and thus to prove guilt by implication. These statements are incriminating in any meaningful sense of the word and may not be used without the full warnings and effective waiver required for any other statement. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b883-13\">384 U.S. at 477, 86 S.Ct at 1629. (Emphasis added.) Thus the Court specifically rejected the use for impeachment purposes of statements intended to be exculpatory. We can discern no reason in logic or policy to treat differently statements, like Proctor\u2019s here, presumably intended as neither inculpatory nor exculpatory. <em>See </em>Blair v. United States, 130 U.S.App.D.C. 322, 401 F.2d 387 (1968;.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-14\">There remains the question whether Proctor\u2019s statement to the arresting officer was made subject to a valid waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. The Court in <em>Miranda </em>held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-15\">\u201c * * * [A] heavy burden rests on the government to demonstrate that the defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his privilege against self-incrimination and his right to retained or appointed counsel. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ads\">\u201cAn express statement that the individual is willing to make a statement and does not want an attorney followed closely by a statement could constitute a waiver. But a valid waiver will not be presumed simply from the silence of the accused after warnings are given or simply from the fact that a confession was in fact eventually . obtained. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-17\">\u201c \u2018 * * * <em>The record must show, </em>or there must be an allegation and evidence which show, <em>that an accused was offered counsel but intelligently and understandingly rejected the offer. Anything less is not waiver.\u2019 \u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b884-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>384 U.S. at 475, 86 S.Ct. at 1628. (Emphasis added.) The immediate availability of offered counsel at the place of interrogation is, of course, a primary consideration in determining the <em>bona fides </em>of the offer and the validity of the waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">The record now before us is inadequate to support a finding of valid waiver under <em>Miranda. </em>Since no <em>Miranda </em>objection was made at trial \u2014 we notice the <em>Miranda </em>issue on appeal as a \u201cdefect affecting substantial rights,\u201d Rule 52(b), Fed.R.Crim.P. \u2014 the Government might not have brought forward all the evidence available to establish a waiver on Proctor\u2019s part. Hence we now remand the case to the District Court for a hearing to determine whether Proctor made his statement to the arresting officer subject to a valid <em>Miranda </em>waiver.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If it is determined that he did not, he must have a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">The Government\u2019s case-in-chief against Proctor consisted of in-court identifications by two eyewitnesses to the robbery. One of these witnesses, Arkadie, made a preliminary identification of Proctor at a police station confrontation. In its memorandum opposing Proctor\u2019s motion for a new trial, the Government apparently concedes that the confrontation took place in the robbery squad office, rather than under proper lineup conditions. There are further suggestions in the trial record itself that the confrontation might have been suggestive.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Finally, the affidavit supporting the arrest warrant issued for Proctor states that the initial identification of him was by photograph. Because the record is unclear on these pre-trial identifications, the District Court should on remand determine whether the procedures used were unnecessarily suggestive, and if so whether they rendered inadmissible Arkadie\u2019s in-court identification of Proctor under the standards laid down in Stovall v. Denno, supra; Simmons v. United States, 390 U.S. 377, 88 S.Ct. 967, 19 L.Ed.2d 1247 (1968); and decisions of this court developing those standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-10\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b883-18\">. Walder v. United States, 347 U.S. 62, 74 S.Ct. 354, 98 L.Ed. 503 (1954); Tate v. United States, 109 U.S.App.D.C. 13, 283 F.2d 377 (1960).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b884-7\">. It is suggested that to deny the prosecution the right to impeach an accused with his own statement is an inducement to perjury. Of course an accused may be impeached with his own statement provided that statement is obtained in compliance with prophylactic rules designed to protect the integrity of the fact-finding process and the rights of an accused without counsel in a police station. <em>Compare </em>Simmons v. United States, 390 U.S. 377, 389-394, 88 S.Ct. 967, 19 L.Ed.2d 1247 (1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b884-8\">. On cross-examination of Arkadie, Proctor\u2019s counsel elicited testimony to the effect that the other men present at the police station confrontation may have been substantially taller than Proctor. The cross-examination did not clarify whether the other men were in a lineup with Proctor, or were merely standing in the robbery squad office.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b884-11\">TAMM, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Az9\">(concurring in part and dissenting in part):</p>\n<p id=\"b884-12\">While I concur in the majority\u2019s holding to remand this case for a determination of the out-of-court identification procedures in the light of <em>Stovall </em>and <em>Simmons, </em>I cannot, in conscience, adhere to its ruling with respect to the <em>Miranda-Tate-Walder </em>issue in this appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant argues that the averment of the defendant, <em>id est, </em>that he had not worked for three weeks, goes directly to the issue of guilt or innocence and not simply that it affects his credibility. For this position they rely on Johnson v. United States, 120 U.S.App.D.C. 69, 344 F.2d 163 (1964). However, in <em>Johnson </em>the statement in question was a direct confession implicating the defendant \u2014 denied from the stand and brought out in rebuttal. Noting that the statement was given in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>violation of the principles espoused in Mallory v. United States, 354 U.S. 449, 77 S.Ct. 1356, 1 L.Ed.2d 1479 (1957), this court looked to see if that same evidence could be utilized by the Government to impeach the defendant under the doctrine of Tate v. United States, 109 U.S.App.D.C. 13, 283 F.2d 377 (1960) and Walder v. United States, 347 U.S. 62, 74 S.Ct. 354, 98 L.Ed. 503 (1954). In <em>Johnson </em>we refused to permit, for impeachment purposes, the introduction of illegally obtained statements <em>\u201cwhich bear directly on a defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence.\u201d Supra </em>120 U.S.App.D.C. at 72, 344 F.2d at 166. (Emphasis supplied.) I am in complete agreement with that principle. However, the <em>Johnson </em>case is distinguishable from the instant case in that his statement was <em>per se </em>inculpatory. The statement of David Proctor on the other hand, was innocuous at the time and place uttered and only became crucial when viewed in the light of his alibi defense at trial. As Judge Burger said in <em>Tate, </em>\u201cwhen (the defendant) gave one story to the police and another in court, and <em>neither story covered any act which was per se inculpatory, </em>the jury is entitled to hear both versions.\u201d Tate v. United States, <em>supra </em>109 U.S.App.D.C. at 16, 283 F.2d at 380 (emphasis supplied). The question of the detective herein was to obtain information for a line-up sheet for police use in identification (Tr. Vol. II p. 40). The answer elicited was neither <em>per se </em>inculpatory nor exculpatory.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It would become inculpatory only if the jury sought to disbelieve it. It was their prerogative.</p>\n<p id=\"A7l\">Appellant also relies on Blair and Suggs v. United States, 130 U.S.App.D.C. 322, 401 F.2d 387 (1968) as requiring a remand on this issue. <em>Blair, </em>however, dealt with a detailed account of the defendant\u2019s whereabouts prior to, during and subsequent to an alleged robbery. Those questions sought to pinpoint the defendant\u2019s whereabouts and were thus \u201cdirectly related to the offense charged.\u201d Blair and Suggs v. United States, <em>supra </em>note 9. Here the questioning was not an attempt to encourage the defendant to explain his whereabouts at the time of the robbery but merely to determine if the defendant was employed. As the Supreme Court said in Walder v. United States, <em>supra </em>347 U.S. at 65, 74 S.Ct. at 356, \u201c[the defendant] must be free to deny all the elements of the case against him without thereby giving leave to the Government to introduce by way of rebuttal, evidence illegally secured by it * * *. Beyond that, however, <em>there is hardly justification for letting the defendant affirmatively resort to perjurious testimony in reliance on the Government\u2019s disability to challenge his credibility.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aum-dedup-2\">\u201cDo you solemnly swear that the testimony you shall give to the Court and jury in the case now on trial <em>mil be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, </em>so help you God?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"arg-dedup-1\">\"I do.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"afr-dedup-0\">Thus begins the testimony of a witness in our trial courts. It is with fear of the Maker and jeopardy of impeachment that the subsequent testimony is supplied, The majority holding vitiates the \u201cjeopardy\u201d element and leaves to an overburdened Providence the sole responsibility for insuring the credibility of a witness.- In a world that preaches \u201cGod is dead\u201d and where it is vogue to flaunt civil authority the question of oaths and truth is slowly becoming academic. The instant ruling gives this defendant a shield which he in turn wields as a perjurious sword against a defenseless prosecutor. We said in <em>Tate </em>that we intend to inhibit testifying falsely. Today we disregard that intention.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b884-14\">. Miranda v. State of Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966); Tate v.
