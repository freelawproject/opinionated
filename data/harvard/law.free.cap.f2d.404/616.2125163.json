It appears from the record that azeotropic compositions \u2014 ones in which the vapor composition is the same as the boiling liquid composition with which it is in equilibrium \u2014 -are advantageous refrigerants compared to non-azeotropic multicomponent mixtures since fractionation or separation of the components of the composition, with attendant increase in condenser pressures and overall loss of efficiency, does not occur during the refrigeration cycle. Appellant\u2019s azeotropic compositions consisting of 30-33 mol % C2F5C1 exhibit a constant, minimum boiling point of -57.3\u00b0 C., whereas mixtures consisting of 13-65% C2F5C1 have boiling points differing only slightly \u2014 about 0.7\u00b0 C. or less \u2014 from that of the azeo-trope. According to appellant, his compositions boil at temperatures lower than the boiling point of either pure component, and thus exhibit a negative deviation from Raoult\u2019s law, an empirical rule to the effect that boiling points and vapor pressures of two-component mixtures vary with concentration between the val<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>ues for the pure components. It appears that the high capacity of appellant\u2019s compositions relative to that of either component is due to the fact that the compositions are azeotropic and boil at a lower temperature than either component alone,</p>\n<p id=\"arv-dedup-0\">Olaim lis representative-Vw/IaxIII JL lo X cUl cocil bw L1V v \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"apf-dedup-0\">, ... 1. A low boiling composition consisting of a mixture of difluorometh-ane and monochloropentafluoroe-thane, in which mixture the mol percent of monochloropentafluoroethane is substantially m the range of 13-65.</p>\n<p id=\"AXn\">The examiner noted that Lewis discloses an essentially azeotropic refrigerant composition consisting of 20-40 mol percent of 1, l-difluoroe\u00edftcme and 60-80 mol percent of the heretofore men-tinned C2F\u201eC1. The actual azeotrope, formed at 69 mol percent C2F5C1, has a minimum boiling point of -41.3\" C\u201e and thus exhibits a negative deviation from Raoult\u2019s Law. Observing that Lewis does not disclose the use of CH2F2 in refrigerant compositions or as a component of an azeotropic mixture, the examiner turned to Midgley, who discloses that CH2F2, C2F5C1 or CH3CHF2, among many other fluorohydrocarbons, each may be used <em>individually </em>as refrigerants <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and also shows the boiling point of each of those compounds in his figures 1 and 2. In the examiner\u2019s view, it \u201cwould be obvious to one having ordinary skill in the art to substitute * * * [CH2F2]. for the * * * [CH3CH2] of Lewis with the expectation of obtaining suitable results\u201d in view of the fact ill /n tt -n \u2022 i i <em>i </em>\u2022 t \u2022 that CH2F2 is a known low boiling* refrigerant and ig the adjacent lower homo. jQg of CH\u00a1\u00a1CHF2- Quite evidently, the examiner felt that the homologous relationship between CH2f2 and CH3CHF2 wouW be suffident in and of itself to enabk one of ordinary skill to predict that CH2F2 and C2F5C1, like the known CH3CHF2 and C2F5C1, would form a useful azeotropic refrigerant composition. The board agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"arf-dedup-2\">Appellant contends here, as below, that notbia? \u201c P\"\" ar* ^ reco\"d gests that CH2F2 and C2.F?C1 would form an azeotropic composition possessing hl*h refrigeration capacity.^ Indeed, apPellant\u00a3 urges that there is no known basis, for Pr^ietmg the formation of an ^eotrope between two given fluorohydrocarbons. In support of that argument, he points to the Kvalnes patent<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> cited by him in his brief before the board, as well as to certain proprietary data appearing in the same brief.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>is appellant\u2019s position that he has established that the mere <em>fact </em>of homology between CH2F2 and CH3CHF2 would be of no material assistance to one in the art in determining or predicting <em>a priori </em>the proclivity of CH2F2 to form an azeotrope with C2F5C1, while the examiner has offered no evidence to support the bare assertion that homology would be of assistance in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">The board acknowledged that appellant \u201cdocuments the unpredictable nature of determining azeotropic pairs of compounds\u201d in his brief before it, thus apparently accepting the comparisons made by appellant and the statements of Kvalnes as factual and accurate.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Like the examiner, however, the board found it could \u201cgive no weight to appellant\u2019s argument that the determination of azeo-tropic mixtures is empirical in nature.\u201d The only reason each assigned was that \u201cthe claims are not limited to azeo-tropic mixtures.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">Strictly speaking, of course, the examiner and board are correct in observing that none of appellant\u2019s claims is directed to a true azeotropic composition consisting of 30-33% C2F5C1 and 67-70% CH2F2. But it appears to us that appellant also is correct in stating that all his claims are directed to compositions which are, for all intents and purposes, <em>essentially </em>azeotropic in nature and which possess the desirable features, e. g. negligible fractionation, of azeo-tropic compositions.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As appellant points out, his specification states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-24\">* * * It has also been found that mixtures consisting of difluoromethane and monoehloropentafluoroethane substantially in the range of 13-65% monoehloropentafluoroethane have boiling points differing only slightly from the azeotropic composition. <em>Compositions within this range will exhibit only negligible fractionation on boiling and represent useful refrigerants. </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-26\">* -X* -X* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-27\">* * * The 13-65% chloropenta-fluoroethane compositions indicated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>each has a boiling temperature variation of less than 0.75\u00b0 C., from the minimum boiling minus 57.3\u00b0 C. azeo-trope composition. As compositions containing 13-65% C2F5CI all boil between about -56.6\u00b0 C and -57.3\u00b0 C., representing a maximum boiling temperature variation within 0.75\u00b0 C., <em>no significant fractionation occurs on distillation of any compositions within this range, and all such compositions are suited for use as refrigerants. </em>******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-4\">The system formed by herein mixtures of difluoromethane and monochloropentafluoroethane provides a broad range of mixture compositions which boil at substantially constant temperature and give a constant boiling composition. The azeotropic and substantially azeotropic mixtures differ from refrigerant mixtures proposed in the past which offer only a relatively narrow range of useful compositions. * * * [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">In view of those statements, it seems to us that the examiner and board were unduly critical of appellant\u2019s claimed subject matter in unnecessarily requiring appellant to limit his claims to true azeo-tropic compositions consisting of 30-33% C2F5CI before giving consideration to his argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">Turning to the arguments presented, we think that whatever reasons the examiner and board may have had \u2014 but not expressed or documented \u2014 for their belief or presumption that the homologous relationship between CH2F2 and CH3CHF2 would be of assistance to those in the art in predicting formation of an azeotrope between CH2F2 and C2F5C1 have been adequately rebutted by appellant. The only other reason offered by the board in support of its finding of obviousness is that one might well predict that substitution of the lower boiling CH2F2 for the higher boiling CH3CHF2 in the Lewis composition would yield a mixture boiling at a lower temperature, and thus possessing a higher refrigerating capacity, than that of Lewis. However true that may be, it would seem there would be no assurance that such a two-component mixture would have a capacity roughly twice that of Lewis as shown by an affidavit of Atwood, or even be a particularly useful or efficient refrigerant, absent a teaching that a minimum boiling, substantially azeotropic, non-fractionating composition would result. It is that teaching which we think is missing here.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-9\">Considering the record in its entirety, we find inadequate evidence to sustain the conclusion below that the claimed subject matter as a whole would be obvious to one of ordinary skill within the purview of \u00a7 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-10\">The decision is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-11\">Reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-12\">SMITH, J., participated in the hearing of this case but died before a decision was reached.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b678-14\">.

In explanation, the specification states:</p>\n<p id=\"b678-18\">The refrigeration capacity of a given amount of refrigerant is largely a funetion of boiling point, the <em>lower boiling </em>refrigerants generally offering the <em>greater capacity </em>at a given evaporator temperature. This factor to a great extent influences the design of refrigeration equipment and affects capacity, power requirements, size and cost of the unit. Another important factor directly related to boiling of the refrigerant is minimum cooling temperature obtained in the evaporator during the refrigeration cycle, the lower boiling refrigerants being used to effect the lower refrigeration temperatures.

To the contrary, CH2F2 is denoted as \u201cF2\u201d in Fig. 1 of Midgley while CH3CHF2 and C2F5C1 are denoted as \u201c0.2\u201d and \u201c3.8\u201d, respectively, in Fig. 2 of the reference. The point is not particularly crucial in view of the fact that appellant has not argued in his brief that the components of his composition were not individually known to be refrigerants at the time of his invention.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"Ak1o\">. U.S. Patent 3,085,065, issued April 9, 1963.</p>\n<p id=\"ATE\">In the course of discussing formation of azeotropic refrigerant compositions of fluorohydrocarbons, Kvalnes states:</p>\n<p id=\"aqj-dedup-1\"><em>* * * It is impossible to predict that an azeotrope will form between any two compounds and so it is impossible to pich any two refrigerants and combine them to obtain an azeotrope boiling at some particular point by prediction.

In his brief, the solicitor urges that the comparisons presented by appellant should be \u201cregarded as argument only, and without merit, since appellant cites no evidence or authority in support of\u201d those comparisons. As we see it, neither the truth of what appellant presented nor its form was placed in issue below.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b680-29\">. Indeed, that those in the art would regard appellant\u2019s claimed compositions to be essentially azeotropic despite minor deviations from the constant boiling point of the azeotrope is clear, we think, from Lewis, who states:</p>\n<p id=\"b680-30\">I have discovered that mixtures of 1,1- difluoroethane and monochloropen-tafluoroethane form an azeotrope boiling at approximately -41.3\u00b0 C., in which about 69 mole percent is monoehloro-pentafluoroethane. The mixture is a highly useful refrigerant * * * This mixture has the further advantage that only slight changes in the boiling point occur when the composition is varied over a considerable range on either side of the actual azeotropic composition. Mixtures containing between 60 and 80 mole percent monochloropentafluoroe-thane all boil between about -41.1\u00b0 and -41.3\u00b0 O., <em>so that there is little tendency for fractionation to take place with any of these mixtures.
