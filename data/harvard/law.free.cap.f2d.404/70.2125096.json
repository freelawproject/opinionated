Appellant complained that appellees knowingly and wilfully, or with gross negligence, presented perjured testimony to the grand jury investigating appellant\u2019s activities and that appellees wilfully and deliberately suppressed from the grand jury exculpating evidence within their knowledge. The grand jury indicted appellant for the crime of grand theft, but the subsequent state court trial resulted in acquittal. The District Court\u2019s jurisdiction was conferred by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343, and ours rests on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-24\">The sole issue is whether appellees are immune from civil liability for the acts of which appellant complained.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-25\">A prosecuting attorney is immune from civil suit for acts committed in the performance of duties constituting an integral part of the judicial process. Robichaud v. Ronan, 351 F.2d 533 (9th Cir. 1965). In <em>Robichaud </em>we discussed the policy behind such immunity as well as its limitations. We stated at 536:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-26\">\u201cThe key to the immunity previously held to be protective to the prosecuting attorney is that the acts, alleged to have been wrongful, were committed by the officer in the performance of an integral part of the judicial process.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-27\"> A California district attorney\u2019s presentation of evidence to a grand jury is clearly within the scope of his duty to advise and present information to the grand jury as authorized by California <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>law. See Cal.Pen.Code, \u00a7 925 (West 1956); Cal.Gov.Code, \u00a7 26501 (West 1955). The function is \u201can integral part of the judicial process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
