Upon a motion for summary judgment filed by the defendant, the District Court held that the remedy of the Plaintiff was limited to claim under the Virginia Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act and judgment was entered accordingly. Sec. 65-37, 65-38 Va.Code (1950). The facts are not in dispute. There being no issue of material fact to be determined and no error of law in the conclusion of the District Court that the Plaintiff was limited to her claim under the Virginia Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, the action of the District Court should be affirmed.
