ROBINSON, III, Circuit J<em>udge:</em></author>\n<p id=\"Au0\">On the afternoon of June 16, 1965, the third-floor apartment of Norma J. Sword -was broken into, and from it were purloined a large stereo set, an extensive collection of records and a piggy bank containing coins. Information vital to the apprehension and prosecution of appeilant as a participant in the affair was supplied^ by Lois M. Vines, a second-fl\u00b0or neighbor. Between 1:30 and 2:00 P- m- on date, she heard noises emanating from Miss Sword s apartment, an(* minutes later saw two men, one with black gloves and a brown paper bag, exit from the basement of the building and leave in a green 1956 Plymouth. Mrs. Vines, checking immediately, found the door to the Sword apartment open, and located the stereo set just outside the building. Then perceiving the Plymouth returning, she retreated to her apartment, and through her window watched the two men put the stereo set into the car- she jotted down the license plate number and later gave it to the police, together with physical descriptions of the two men.</p>\n<p id=\"ay_-dedup-0\">About 2:25 p. m., two police officers received a radio report on the housebreak<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1258\">*1258</page-number>ing, and a few minutes later spotted the Plymouth, which was parked and unoccupied about ten blocks away. During a brief surveillance of the vehicle, appellant came out of a building close by and got into the driver\u2019s seat. The officers then engaged him in conversation, observing in open view on the back seat several records, a brown bag of pennies, two screwdrivers, and a pair of black gloves. Appellant could not produce the registration card for the automobile, and told the officers that he had obtained it on loan from his brother about noon. Thereupon, he was arrested and the trunk was searched for the stereo set.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Com-pliably with appellant\u2019s request, he was escorted to the nearby apartment of a friend, who informed the officers that appellant had been there for the past hour and a half. Appellant was then conducted to a precinct station, where shortly thereafter the events with which this appeal is primarily concerned occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-4\">For the purpose of a possible identification, Mrs. Vines was brought to the station. Approaching it, she noticed the Plymouth, which had been parked in the vicinity, and remarked that it was the car she had seen earlier. She was taken inside, first to a room the transpirations in which the record does not reveal, and then to the threshold of an adjoining room. In the latter were appellant and about a half-dozen police officers in plain clothes. Several of the occupants, including appellant, were Negroes. Appellant was seated and, under Mrs. Vines\u2019 scrutiny, was requested to stand and turn around, which he did. At some point, Mrs. Vines identified him as one of the two participants in the pilferage of Miss Sword\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-12\">Indicted and placed on trial on counts of housebreaking<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and grand larceny,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> appellant insisted that at the time of the offenses he was in the company of friends. Two of them so testified, and appellant\u2019s brother corroborated several aspects of his story.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>On the other hand, and additionally to the Government\u2019s circumstantial showing, Mrs. Vines, without objection, related her prior identification of appellant at the precinct station, and twice again identified him in the courtroom. The jury convicted on both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-13\"> Three contentions are presented for our consideration. We find merit in but one,\u00ae which at the outset we dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1259\">*1259</page-number>tinguish from another which of late we have quite frequently encountered.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> When identified by Mrs. Vines at the precinct station, appellant was unrepresented by counsel, but of this no point is sought to be made, nor could it be. In United States v. Wade <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and Gilbert v. State of California,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> decided after appellant\u2019s trial, the Supreme Court held that a suspect must, as a matter of Sixth Amendment right, be afforded the assistance of counsel at a pretrial lineup.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> But the Court announced contemporaneously in Stovall v. Denno <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> that this constitutional rule is to operate prospectively.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Beyond this, we have declined to apply, in the exercise of our supervisory authority in this jurisdiction, the <em>Wade-Gilbert </em>principle retroactively.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1321-5\">What appellant does urge is that the circumstances surrounding his station house confrontation with Mrs. Vines induced an identification which was not the product of the witness\u2019 objective judgment, and that the Government\u2019s capitalization on it resulted in a deprivation of due process. <em>Stovall </em>confirmed the proposition that a confrontation with a view to identifying a suspect may be \u201cso unnecessarily suggestive and conducive to irreparable mistaken identification that he [is] denied due process of law.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> And this issue an accused may litigate despite non-retroactivity of the <em>Wade-Gilbert </em>requirement of counsel at such confrontations.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1321-20\">The record before us reflects conditions auguring the possibility that the limits set by the demands of due process were exceeded here. \u201cA major factor contributing to the high incidence of miscarriage of justice from mistaken identification has been the degree of suggestion inherent in the manner in which the prosecution presents the suspect to witnesses for pretrial identification.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Moreover, \u201c[t]he practice of showing suspects singly to persons for the purpose of identification, and not as a part of a lineup, has been widely condemned.\u201d <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> From what appears here, there was no lineup, in the commonly accepted sense of the word; rather, the exhibition which may have engendered Mrs. Vines\u2019 positive identification was of appellant alone.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We have declared that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1260\">*1260</page-number>\u201c[t]he presentation of only one suspect in the custody of the police, raises problems of suggestibility that bring us to the threshold of an issue of fairness.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> To this may be added the fact that minutes before the confrontation the identifying witness had recognized the automobile which the culprits had employed in their criminality.</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-4\">On the other hand, \u201ca claimed violation of due process of law in the conduct of a confrontation depends on the totality of the circumstances surrounding it,\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and the record on this appeal does not disclose some, and conceivably many, of the circumstances which may bear importantly on the due process issue. This undoubtedly is a consequence of the fact that the issue was not raised in the District Court.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> That the question was not broached there is quite understandable since the principle giving rise to it appears to have enjoyed its first successful invocation in federal litigation only after appellant\u2019s trial had been concluded,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and in any event its added stature was not bestowed by <em>Stovall </em>until this appeal was pending.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> But lacking the development that only adversary treatment can produce, the record in this connection all too frequently maintains silence in the face of crying needs for additional enlightenment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-17\">We are uninformed as to the characteristics which by Mrs. Vines\u2019 observation served to distinguish appellant from other persons.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> We know relatively little as to the similarities and the differences, respecting appellant and those in the room with him, in age, height, weight, dress and other physical features.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> We are not clear as to whether the contested identification was made before or after appellant was asked to stand.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Nor can we tell whether, all circumstances considered, a lineup was feasible.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> These are but illustrative of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1261\">*1261</page-number>relevant details we cannot fathom from what is before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-5\">Since the inadequacy of the record precludes our decision of the issue, we remand the case to the District Court<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> for an evaluation of appellant\u2019s claim. The court, in application of the standard enunciated in <em>Stovall, </em>will determine whether the method of appellant\u2019s identification was \u201cso unnecessarily suggestive and conducive to irreparable mistaken identification that he was denied due process of law.\u201d <footnotemark>28</footnotemark> If no due process violation is found, the conviction must stand. If, on the other hand, such a violation is found, the dispositional principles delineated in <em>Wade </em><footnotemark>29</footnotemark> and Gilbert<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> should be applied analogously. In sum, the District Court will award appellant a new trial unless it is \u201cable to declare a belief that\u201d Mrs. Vines\u2019 testimony as to her identification of appellant at the precinct station \u201cwas harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> In the event of another trial, any and all testimony as to Mrs. Vines\u2019 identification at the station will be excluded,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> and the Government will be afforded \u201cthe opportunity to es<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1262\">*1262</page-number>tablish by clear and convincing evidence that\u201d her in-court identification was \u201cbased upon observations of the suspect other than the [station house] identification.\u201d <footnotemark>33</footnotemark>' And if, but only if, that burden is carried may Mrs. Vines again undertake upon a retrial an identification of appellant in the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-4\">Remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1320-5\">. The set was not in the trunk, but another screwdriver and another pair of black gloves were found therein. See <em>infra </em>note 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1320-6\">. D.C.Code \u00a7 22-1801 (1967 ed.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1320-7\">. D.C.Code \u00a7 22-2201 (1967 ed.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1320-8\">. Appellant theorized that while he was socializing strangers had taken the Plymouth and committed the offenses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1320-9\">. Appellant complains also of the trial judge\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress the screwdriver and gloves removed from the trunk of the automobile, which were introduced into evidence at the trial, and of his refusal to charge in the language of a requested instruction stating, <em>inter alia, </em>that appellant was not required to prove that another person may have committed the crimes. Unlike the situation in Preston v. United States, 376 U.S. 364, 84 S.Ct. 881, 11 L.Ed.2d 777 (1964), upon which appellant relies, but see Cooper v. State of California, 386 U.S. 58, 87 S.Ct. 788, 17 L.Ed.2d 730 (1967), the examination of the trunk occurred contemporaneously with and at the place of appellant\u2019s arrest under circumstances indicating convincingly his participation in the burglary. These conditions, we have held, justify such a search. Adams v. United States, 118 U.S.App.D.C. 364, 336 F.2d 752 (1964), cert. denied 379 U.S. 977, 85 S.Ct. 676, 13 L.Ed.2d 567 (1965); Jefferson v. United States, 121 U.S.App.D.C. 279, 280, 349 F.2d 714, 715 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-15\">Nor did the judge\u2019s action in regard to the requested instruction constitute error. His charge recognized appellant\u2019s alibi defense as \u201ca legitimate and legal and proper defense.\u201d It included an identity instruction in effect admonishing that one of the \u201cessential elements\u201d the Government had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt was that appellant \u201cwas present at the time and place of the commission of the alleged offenses.\u201d The jury was told <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1259\">*1259</page-number>that appellant \u201cdoes not have to prove his innocence,\u201d and the judge at a number of points restated the Government\u2019s burden of proof as to all elements. We think the charge thoroughly and fairly covered appellant\u2019s defensive theory, and communicated adequately the substance of his well taken position that he had no obligation to show that another was actually the transgressor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1321-7\">.

We do not reach the question, treated in the dissenting opinion, whether an unjustified failure to conduct a lineup <em>ipso facto </em>works a denial of due process.

Since mistaken identifications are probably the greatest cause of erroneous convictions,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we must require the fairest identification procedures available under the circumstances. With the stakes so high, due process does not permit second best.</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-6\">I think this is what the Supreme Court meant in Stovall v. Denno, 388 U.S. 293, 87 S.Ct. 1967, 18 L.Ed.2d 1199 (1967) and United States v. Wade, 388 U.S. 218, 87 S.Ct. 1926, 18 L.Ed.2d 1149 (1967). In <em>Stovall </em>it held that a defendant was entitled to show that the confrontation in his case \u201cwas so <em>unnecessarily </em>suggestive and conducive to irreparable mistaken identification that he was denied due process of law.\u201d 388 U.S. at 301-302, 87 S.Ct. at 1972 (emphasis supplied). The Court went on to say that \u201cThe practice of showing suspects singly to persons for the purpose of identification, and not as a part of a lineup, has been widely condemned.\u201d It affirmed defendant\u2019s conviction only because the record revealed that \u201cthe showing of Stovall to [the eyewitness-victim] in an immediate hospital confrontation was <em>imperative.\u201d Id. </em>at 302, 87 S.Ct. at 1972 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-13\">The clear thrust of <em>Stovall </em>is that, without justifying circumstances, a one-man showup is too unnecessarily suggestive to satisfy due process. A lineup must be conducted unless it will necessitate a delay which is likely to make identification impossible or less reliable;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1324-14\">In <em>Wade </em>the Court pointed out that cross-examination at trial \u201ccannot be viewed as an absolute assurance of accuracy and reliability [in courtroom identifications]. Thus, in the present context, where so many variables and pitfalls exist, the first line of defense must be the prevention of unfairness and the lessening of the hazards of eyewitness identification at the lineup itself.\u201d 388 U.S. at 235, 87 S.Ct. at 1936. In other words, we must insist on the fairest feasible identification procedures and not rely on the courts\u2019 ability to gauge the psychological effects of more suggestive procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-15\">In light of <em>Stovall </em>and <em>Wade, </em>I must reject the majority\u2019s assertion that I am making a new \u201cconstitutional pronouncement.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> I would remand to the District Court to give the Government an opportunity to show that the failure to hold a lineup was justified. Due process requires this showing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1324-9\">. See United States v. Wade, 388 U.S. 218, 229-230, 87 S.Ct. 1926, 18 L.Ed.2d 1149 (1967) and materials cited therein.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1324-10\">. In <em>Stovall </em>there was a substantial likelihood that in the time needed to arrange a lineup in the hospital room the eyewitness might die. In Wise v. United States, 127 U.S.App.D.C. 279, 383 F.2d 206 (1967), the police .captured the suspect a minute or so after the offense and immediately brought him back to be identified by the victims. This one-man show-up was justifiable because, as the court suggested, the fresh identification promoted fairness by assuring reliability. 383 F.2d at 209. Moreover, the identification took place at the scene of the offense rather than in the suggestive atmosphere of a police station.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1324-17\">. <em>Supra </em>p. 1261 n. 28.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
