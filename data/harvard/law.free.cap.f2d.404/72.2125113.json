That the District Court had equitable discretion with respect to the disposition of the petition is well-setted. Porter v. Sabin, 149 U.S. 473, 13 S.Ct. 1008, 37 L.Ed. 815 (1893); Warner v. Conn. et al. (Kopp et al., Appellants), 347 Pa. 617, 620-621, 32 A.2d 740 (1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-20\">We are further of the view that the District Court did not err in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>holding that Joscar \u201chas no lien nor any \u2018vested right\u2019 \u201d with respect to the funds held by the Conservator. Joscar\u2019s New York judgment constituted a lien on real estate in that state, according to the judgment lien law of New York.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Since the New York judgment was not docketed in Pennsylvania until after the appointment of the Conservator, Joscar did not acquire a judgment lien on the property of the defendants since it was then <em>in custodia legis.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Joscar\u2019s rights to the property in possession of the Conservator were fixed as of the time of his appointment on May 11, 1965.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">For the reasons stated, the Order of the District Court denying Joscar\u2019s petition will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b135-14\">. Joscar\u2019s petition for leave to issue execution, etc. was filed May 16, 1966. By agreement of January 3, 1966, authorized by the District Court\u2019s Order of January 12, 1966, the Conservator provided for the settlement in full of the defendants\u2019 general unsecured creditors at 32%% of their claims, to be paid in semi-annual instal-ments over two years. The agreement was later amended so as to provide that if any extra funds remained at the end of the receivership and satisfaction of all claims under the agreement, they would go to parties other than the defendants. A vast majority of creditors agreed to the 32%% of settlement; Joscar did not.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b136-13\">. N.X. Lien Law, McKinney\u2019s Consol.
