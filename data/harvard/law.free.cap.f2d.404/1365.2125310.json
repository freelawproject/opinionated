He appeals from a ten year sentence alleging insufficiency of the evidence to show that a deadly weapon was used to assault a federal officer and bias on the part of the trial judge in the imposition of the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-22\">The basic facts are undisputed. On the evening in question Special Agent Robert E. Hutchings of the Federal Bureau of Investigation accompanied by Lt. Francis Watkins, a police officer of the City of Chickasha, Oklahoma, went to a college campus located in Chickasha to interview Hall who was returning his date to her dormitory. When Hall arrived with his date Hutchings accosted him, identified himself and told him that he wished to interview him concerning a matter then under investigation. Hall, followed by Hutchings, escorted his date to her dormitory door. After the young lady entered her dormitory Hall turned and attacked Hutchings. State Officer Watkins had parked his car and was approaching the door as Hall attacked Hutchings and immediately went to Hutchings assistance. A struggle ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-23\">During the struggle Hall in some way got Watkins\u2019 gun and threatened to shoot unless he was released. The testimony on this by Hutchings and Watkins is not the same. Hutchings testified \u201cI recall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1366\">*1366</page-number>Hall stating, \u2018Let me up, or I will shoot\u2019,\u201d while Watkins\u2019 version was that Hall said \u201cTurn me loose, or I\u2019ll kill him.\u201d Watkins further testified that immediately after this statement the gun hit him in the stomach, he reached down and moved the gun away from him and it was discharged. Neither officer was hit. Throughout this portion of the struggle Hall held the gun. Counsel for Hall rather ingeniously argues that the trial court erred in' submitting to the jury the issue of assault on a federal officer with a deadly weapon. The argument is that the government\u2019s evidence at most shows that the assault with a deadly weapon was committed on Watkins \u2014 a state officer \u2014 not the federal agent, and in no event was the evidence sufficient to justify a jury finding that the assault with a dangerous weapon was committed on the federal officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-4\">The applicable statute provides, in substance and effect, that whoever in the commission of a forcible assault upon any statutorily designated person (including Special Agents of the FBI) \u201cuses a deadly or dangerous weapon\u201d shall be punished as provided in the Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-5\">In its instructions to the jury the court abstractly defined assault as any \u201cintentional display of force such as to place the victim in reasonable apprehension of immediate bodily harm.\u201d The jury was then abstractly instructed that \u201cA person who in fact has the present ability to inflict bodily harm upon another by the use of a dangerous weapon, and willfully threatens or attempts to inflict bodily harm upon such person, may be found guilty of forcibly assaulting such person with a dangerous weapon.\u201d No objections were made to these instructions and nowhere in the record did counsel urge his present argument to the trial court. Nor are we referred to any case to the effect that the threat to use the dangerous weapon is an essential ingredient of the offense charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-7\">The evidence is entirely sufficient to support the findings implicit in the verdict that Hall forcibly assaulted Hutchings; that Hall had in his possession a deadly or dangerous weapon; and that he used it, i. e. he discharged it, and in doing so he attempted to inflict bodily harm upon the person assaulted, i. e. Hutchings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1428-8\">Hall next complains that the 10 year sentence was prompted by \u201cdeep seated passion and prejudice\u201d on the part of the trial judge. As evidence of this bias he points to the court\u2019s comments when commending the jury on its verdict:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1428-9\">\u201cI think you have rendered a very wise verdict in this case. I think both these officers would be dead today, if it were not for the luck of these policemen grabbing that gun, and I commend you, I admire you for reaching the verdict you have reached.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1428-10\">Of course, impartiality on the part of judge and jury is the goal and rule of our judicial system. But there is certainly nothing improper in these remarks and statements when made after the jury returned its verdict. They merely characterize the judge\u2019s view of the seriousness of the offense and the culpability of the of fender. If they have any significance, they go only to the reasons for the sentence which the court subsequently imposed. The sentence was within the limits of the statute and it is invulnerable to attack here. Cooper v. United States, 403 F.2d 71 (10th Cir. 1968); Smith v. United States, 273 F.2d 462 (10th Cir. 1959), cert. den. 363 U.S. 846, 80 S.Ct. 1619, 4 L.Ed.2d 1729.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-11\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1428-12\">. Cf.
