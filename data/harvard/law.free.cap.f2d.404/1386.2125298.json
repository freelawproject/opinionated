It is urged that the court erred in finding (a) that the vessel was seaworthy; (b) that the seaman\u2019s death was due solely to his own fault; (c) that there was no causal connection between negligence, if any, on the part of the vessel\u2019s crew and the death of the seaman; and (d) that the employees of the Government and the shipowner were without fault.</p>\n<p id=\"b1448-22\">Our examination of the record convinces us that the facts found by the trial court are supported by the evidence and that the correct result was reached. Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
