Johnson and James Johnson, Jr., appellants here, sued in Florida state court to recover damages for an automobile accident that had occurred on September 26, 1963. The defendant was an employee of the United States Department of Commerce Weather Bureau. Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2679, the action was removed to the United States District Court and the United States was substituted as defendant. On motion of the United States, based upon the fact that the action had been commenced after the expiration of the two-year limitation imposed by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401, the district court dismissed the action.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b85-21\">The Johnsons, with leave of the court, then filed an amended complaint alleging that on October 9, 1963 their attorneys had sent a letter to the General Services Administration making demand for damages and asking that this matter be referred to the \u201cappropriate agency\u201d.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b86-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>The United States moved for summary-judgment, pointing out that the letter was not a valid administrative \u201cclaim not exceeding $2500\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401 (b). The district court found that there was no genuine issue as to any material fact, that no \u201csufficient\u201d claim was presented \u201cto the appropriate Agency\u201d, and that the action was not commenced within the time permitted by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401. The court granted the motion for summary judgment in favor of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">We agree with the district court that there was no genuine issue of <em>material </em>fact. Four affidavits from various administrative claims officers of the General Services Administration and the Weather Bureau assert that after a search of the records a copy of the letter could not be found. The district court, however, did not need to resolve the dispute whether the letter was presented to General Services Administration. As a matter of law the letter was insufficient to state a claim substantially fulfilling the requirements of \u00a7 2401. (1) An administrative claim must (\u201cshall\u201d) be filed on Government Standard Form 95, prescribed by 15 CFR 2.4(c). (2) It must state the amount of the claim. (3) The amount must not exceed $2500, to extend the statutory time and to be within the settlement authority of the agency under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2672. In the amended complaint the Johnsons claimed $3500 each. (4) Administrative claims must include a statement of the employee, statements of any witnesses, medical and hospital bills, a detailed report by the claimant\u2019s physician, and the claimant\u2019s agreement that the stated amount will be accepted \u201cin full satisfaction and final settlement of the claim\u201d. (5) The administrative claim is required to be made \u201cto the appropriate federal agency\u201d. In this case the appropriate federal agency was the Department of Commerce, or at least, the Department\u2019s Weather Bureau; it was not the General Services Administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">The plaintiffs-appellants failed to meet the requirements of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401(b) to toll the two-year limitation period for tort claims against the United States. <em>See </em>Tobin v. Tomlinson, 5 Cir. 1962, 310 F.2d 648; Grant v.
