The judgment required Robert Lee to serve 40 days imprisonment or pay a fine of $400.00 and E. B. Siegel to serve 50 days imprisonment or pay a fine of $500.00. Appellants paid their fines in lieu of imprisonment and thereafter filed notice of appeal. Appellee now moves to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the eause is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-18\">No application for stay as provided in Rule 38(a) (3), Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, was sought until November 1, 1968, approximately one month after the fines were paid in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-19\">Appellee\u2019s Motion is well taken. Tess-mer v. United States, 328 F.2d 306 (5 Cir. 1964), wherein the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-20\">We find it unnecessary to discuss the merits of this appeal. The satisfaction of the judgment by the payment of the fine rendered this case moot. Murrell v.
