Following an investigation, the appellant Federal Trade Commission, on February 13, 1967, issued a complaint (Docket No. 8729) against appellees, stating that the Commission, \u201chaving reason to believe\u201d that the appellees had violated the Federal Trade Commission Act by engaging in unfair or deceptive practices and the use of false and misleading advertising in the operation of their business, was initiating a proceed-111 respect thereto \u201cin the public interest.\u201d Thereafter, the complaint enumerated the specific details constituting the charge and set forth quotations from the advertigi alleged to be deCeptive. The complaint identified the alleged fal_ sitieg in ^ advertising) described the conduet daimed <em>^ </em>constitute unfair or deceptive practieeSj and concluded with the customary allegation that the identified courses of conduct were in vioIation of gection g of the Federa, Trade Com. mjssion Act<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"agm-dedup-1\">This complaint was mailed to appellees on February 17, 1967. On February OA ,, , , 20, 1967, appellees, mindful and aware .! \u201e . \u00b0f the FTC s Practlce of ^sumg news reJeages and adverse effects resulting therefrom,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> petitioned the Commission to defer the issuance of any news release with respect to this proceeding, <em>id est, </em>Docket No. 8729, until after a final adjudication was had in the proceeding. On March 1, 1967, the Commission notified appellees that their petition had been denied, noting that the contents of the complaint which had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1310\">*1310</page-number>issued were in the public domain. The Commission furnished appellees at that time with a copy of the proposed news release and advised appellees that the news release would be issued on March 3.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1372-4\">On March 2, the appellees commenced the present action by filing a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia in which they sought a restraining order against the issuance of the news release. The motion for the restraining order was denied by a District Court judge on March 2; and on March 3, the Commission promulgated a news release announcing and describing the issuance of the complaint against appellees. As a result, accounts of the complaint appeared in at least two Washington newspapers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-5\">On March 22, 1967, appellees filed in the District Court an amended and supplemental complaint, seeking injunctive and declaratory relief against the Commission\u2019s issuance of further news releases with respect to the proceedings in Docket No. 8729 and requested the court to issue a preliminary injunction retraining any such action by the Commission. Appellees. charged, in affidavits supporting the complaint, that the Commission\u2019s news releases resulted in cancellation of courses by students, inquiries from financial institutions and others with whom appellees were doing business and were generally harmful to \u00e1ppellees\u2019 business. On March 31, the Commission filed in the District Court a cross motion to dismiss the amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-6\">At a hearing held in the District Court on April 13, 1967, the Commission\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint was denied. At the same time, the preliminary injunction requested by appellees was granted, and the Commission thereby was restrained from issuing any news release in Docket No. 8729 \u201cuntil the Commission, after a full adjudication of the case, has issued either a cease and desist order or an order dismissing the Complaint, pending the final hearing and determination of this cause.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The District Court judge, in the findings of fact and conclusions of law supporting the injunction, found that the issuance of the news releases prior to final adjudication constituted, or gave the appearance of constituting, a prejudgment of the issues and that in the event of ultimate adjudication in appellees\u2019 favor by the Commission, the damage suffered by them through the news releases would be beyond \u201crepair or remedy.\u201d The court also expressed \u201cgrave doubt\u201d of the Commission\u2019s authority to issue the releases prior to final adjudication, found irreparable injury to appellees, and defined the Commission\u2019s duty in \u201cquasi-judicial proceedings\u201d to require the avoidance of prejudgment or the appearance of prejudgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-10\">The Commission seeks before this court to reverse the District Court\u2019s order enjoining the Commission\u2019s issuance of press releases and denying its motion to dismiss the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-12\">At the threshold of this case, we are confronted with the question of whether we have jurisdiction to consider the entire case on the merits or whether our review is confined at this time to the propriety of the issuance of the injunction. The pleadings before us are at best ambiguous as to whether the Commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1311\">*1311</page-number>has endeavored to appeal the denial by the District Court of its motion to dismiss the complaint. However, the teaching of Deckert v. Independence Shares Corp., 311 U.S. 282, 61 S.Ct. 229, 85 L.Ed. 189 (1940), indicates that we do have the authority in a case involving an appeal as of right from the granting of an injunction to take note of the denial by the trial court of a motion to dismiss. While it is of course true that in <em>Deckert </em>there was no' question but that the defendants had sought to appeal from the order denying the motion to dismiss as well as from the granting of an injunction, we feel, nevertheless, that the Court\u2019s language in that case minimizes the necessity of a purely formal appeal of an otherwise non-appealable order.' We conclude, therefore, that we have the authority to dispose of the case on its merits and that sound judicial administration requires us to avoid any subsequent unnecessary proceedings in the District Court. Obviously, if we conclude that the motion to dismiss was improperly denied, the question of the propriety of the injunction is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-5\">Congress, in 1914, enacted the Federal Trade Commission Act.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The then broad purpose of the Act was to prevent unfair methods of competition in their inception. Federal Trade Comm. v. Raladam Co., 316 U.S. 149, 162, 62 S.Ct. 966, 86 L.Ed. 1336 (1941). By the Wheeler-Lea amendment,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Congress, in 1938, broadened section 5 of the Act and extended the authority of the Commission to eliminate unfair or deceptive acts or practices in commerce without regard to competition. H.R.Rep.No.1613, 75th Cong., 1st Sess., 1, 3 (1937).</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-6\">Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> provides, <em>inter alia, </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1373-7\">(a) (1) Unfair methods of competition in commerce, and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in commerce, are declared unlawful.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1373-9\">***\u2022\u00bb*#</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1373-10\">(6) The Commission is empowered and directed to prevent persons, partnerships, or corporations, except banks, common carriers subject to the Acts to regulate commerce, air carriers and foreign air carriers subject to the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, and persons, partnerships, or corporations insofar as they are subject to the Packers and Stockyards Act, 1921, as amended, except as provided in section 227(a) of Title 7, from using unfair methods of competition in commerce and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in commerce.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1373-11\">Proceeding by Commission; modifying and setting aside orders</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1373-12\">(b) Whenever the Commission shall have reason to believe that any such person, partnership, or corporation has been or is using any unfair method of competition or unfair or deceptive act or practice in commerce, and if it shall appear to the Commission that a proceeding by it in respect thereof would be to the interest of the public, it shall issue and serve upon such person, partnership, or corporation a complaint stating its charges in that respect and containing a notice of a hearing upon a day and at a place therein fixed at least thirty days after the service of said complaint. The person, partnership, or corporation so complained of shall have the right to appear at the place and time so fixed and show cause why an order should not be entered by the Commission requiring such person, partnership, or corporation to cease and desist from the violation of the law so ch\u00e1rged in said complaint. Any person, partnership, or corporation may make application, and upon good cause shown may be allowed by the Commission to intervene and appear in said proceeding by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1312\">*1312</page-number>counsel or in person. The testimony in any such proceeding shall be reduced to writing and filed in the office of the Commission. If upon such hearing the Commission shall be of the opinion that the method of competition or the act or practice in question is prohibited by sections 41-46 and 47-58 of this title, it shall make a report in writing in which it shall state its findings as to the facts and shall issue and cause to be served on such person, partnership, or corporation an order requiring such person, partnership, or corporation to cease and desist %om using such method of competition or such act or practice. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1374-4\">Section 6 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 46, (1964) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1374-5\">The Commission shall also have power\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1374-6\">Investigation of corporations</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-H\">(a) To gather and compile information concerning, and to investigate from time to time the organization, business, conduct, practices, and management of any corporation engaged in commerce, excepting banks and common carriers subject to the Act to regulate commerce, and its relation to other corporations and to individuals, associations, and partnerships.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-6\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Afq\">Publication of information; reports</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1374-7\">(f) To make public from time to time such portions of the information obtained by it hereunder, except trade secrets and names of customers, as it shall deem expedient in the public interest ; and to make annual and special reports to the Congress and to submit therewith recommendations for additional legislation; and to provide for the publication of its reports and decisions in such form and manner as may be best adapted for public information and use.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1374-12\">Section 1.132 of the Commission\u2019s General Procedures in effect when Docket No. 8729 was initiated, 16 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.-132 (1967) <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> included the following pertinent provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1374-13\">Information in the following classes is public and may be obtained as indicated :</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1374-14\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1374-15\">(c) The decisions of the Commission in adjudicative proceedings and in proceedings disposed of by the entry of consent orders to cease and desist and texts or digests of selected advisory opinions are published periodically in official reports under the title \u201cFederal Trade Commission Decisions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1374-16\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1374-17\">(e) The pleadings, transcript of testimony exhibits and all documents received in evidence or made a part of the record in adjudicative proceedings (except evidence received in camera) * * * are avai]abie at the principal office of the Commission for inspection and copying at reasonable times. ******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1374-18\">(g) Additional information concerning the activities of the Commission is released from time to time through the Commission\u2019s Office of Information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1374-19\">IV.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1374-20\">The appellees, in their amended and supplemental complaint filed in the District Court, charged that while it has been the \u201cuniform and long-established practice\u201d of the Commission to issue news releases in its cases, the action, is unlawful because the Federal Trade Commission Act does not authorize such action by the Commission, violates the Due Process Clause of the Constitution, and constitutes an alignment, or appear-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1313\">*1313</page-number>anee of an alignment, of the Commission \u201cwith the prosecution,\u201d resulting in a prejudgment (or appearance thereof) of the merits of a complaint prior to hearing. Appellees charged in paragraph 14 of their complaint that the Commission action resulted in irreparable damage to them since they, by the press release, \u201care subjected to public and business disrepute, scorn and obloquy; will lose and be deprived of economic opportunities; will suffer serious economic injury ; and their continuing existence will be irreparably impaired.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-4\">We have no doubt that a press release of the kind herein involved results in a substantial tarnishing of the name, reputation, and status of the named respondent throughout the related business community as well as in the minds of some portion of the general public. Three hundred eighty-eight volumes ago, it was observed that \u201c[wjhere much has been said, something will be believed. * * \u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We are confronted, then, not with the question of whether the appellees have suffered actual damage but whether the action of the Commission is so authorized or permitted in law as to place the appellees in the position of suffering <em>damnum absque injuria.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1375-5\">Confronted in 1933 with the question of the Commission\u2019s right to hold an open or public session for the purpose of taking testimony on a complaint against the then appellant charging false and fraudulent advertising and unfair trade methods in commerce, we ruled unanimously that such proceedings were within the Commission\u2019s authority. E. Griffiths Hughes, Inc. v. FTC, 61 App.D.C. 386, 63 F.2d 362 (1933). The thrust of the District Court\u2019s order granting the injunction and denying the Commission\u2019s motion to dismiss is that while the adjudicatory proceedings before the Commission may be public they may not be the subject of a factual press release. Section 1.132 and successor sections 4.8 and 4.9 of the Commission\u2019s General Procedures, <em>supra, </em>make the pleadings, transcripts of testimony, documents, etc., matters of public record, open for public inspection by anyone interested in reviewing them and allow the release of additional information. These regulations, we hold, are a legal exercise of the Commission\u2019s discretionary authority, broadly conferred by subsection (f) of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 46 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-7\">Proceeding, then, to consider whether the Commission may act affirmatively and on its own initiative in publicizing items relating to pending adjudicatory matters by releasing factual information from its own records, we turn, first of course, to the statute creating and empowering the Commission. By 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 45(a) (6) (1964), the Commission is \u201cempowered and directed to prevent * * * unfair methods of competition in commerce and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in commerce.\u201d The Commission is required by 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 45(b) (1964), when it \u201cshall have reason to believe\u201d that a person or corporation has been, or is, using \u201cany unfair method of competition or unfair or deceptive act or practice in commerce,\u201d and if in the Commission\u2019s judgment a proceeding in respect thereto \u201cwould be to the interest of the public,\u201d to issue a complaint, serve it on the respondent, and set a date for a hearing. The complaint (and any additional pleadings or orders) becomes, as heretofore pointed out, a matter of public record. That the basic purpose of the Act is the protection of the public is evident from the clause, \u201cwould be to the interest of the public,\u201d quoted above, and as emphasized at 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 46(f) (1964), <em>supra, </em>\u201cas it shall deem expedient in the public interest.\u201d Indeed, court decisions hold, \u201c[t]he purpose of the Federal Trade Commission Act is' to protect the public, not to punish a wrongdoer, * * * and it is in the public interest to stop a deception at its incipiency.\u201d Regina Corporation v. FTC, 322 F.2d 765, 768 (3d Cir. 1963), citing Gimbel Bros., Inc. v. FTC, 116 F.2d 578, 579 (2d Cir. 1941), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1314\">*1314</page-number>and Progress Tailoring Co. v. FTC, 153 F.2d 103, 105 (7th Cir. 1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-4\">In defining the Commission\u2019s authority and responsibility in protecting the public interest, Congress specifically authorized the Commission \u201c[t]o make public from time to time such portions of the information obtained by it hereunder * * * as it shall deem expedient in the public interest * * 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 46(f) (1964). We reject ap-pellees\u2019 contention that this subsection is applicable only to the antitrust responsibilities of the Commission. We construe \u201chereunder\u201d in the quoted phraseology as applying to the entire chapter 2 of Title 15 U.S.C., restricted of course by the specific limitations set forth in the chapter itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-6\">Since the Commission is charged by the broad delegation of power to it to eliminate unfair or deceptive business practices in the public interest, and since it is specifically authorized to make public information acquired by it, we conclude that there is in fact and law authority in the Commission, acting in the public interest, to alert the public to suspected violations of the law by factual press releases whenever the Commission shall have reason to believe that a respondent is engaged in activities made unlawful by the Act which have resulted in the initiation of action by the Commission. The press releases predicated upon. official action of the Commission constitute a warning or caution to the public, the welfare of which the Commission is in these matters charged. We note that there is no contention in this case that the allegations in the Commission\u2019s complaint were knowingly false.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1376-7\">We recognize that in legislating in the public interest and for the public welfare, Congress was acting to afford protection on a broad and comprehensive scale to millions of citizens residing and working at points far from the scene of Commission complaint, hearing, or other action. Moreover, \u201c[t]he law is not made for experts but to protect the public, \u2014 that vast multitude which includes the ignorant, the unthinking and the credulous, who, in making purchases, do not stop to analyze but too often are governed by appearances and general impressions.\u201d Aronberg v. FTC, 132 F.2d 165, 167 (7th Cir. 1942), citing Florence Manufacturing Co. v. Dowd, 178 F. 73 (2d Cir. 1910).</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-10\">If the unsophisticated consumer is to be protected in any measure from deceptive or unfair practices, it is essential that he be informed in some manner as to the identity of those most likely to prey upon him utilizing such prohibited conduct. Certainly advice through news media as to the actions being taken by a government agency in his behalf constitutes a prophylactic step addressed ultimately to the elimination of the conduct prohibited by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-11\">The Commission, in attempting to bring its action relative to what it has reason to believe is unlawful conduct to the attention of the widely spread public by the issuance of factual press releases, is, we conclude, acting within its authority as defined by statute. In addition, we observe that Congress obviously has long been aware of and acquiesced in the Commission\u2019s press release procedures. See: 1962 FTC Ann.Rep. 20; 1961 FTC Ann.Rep. 20; 1956 FTC Ann. Rep. 18; <em>Hearings before the Subcommittee on Independent Office Appropriations for 1960 of the House Appropriations Committee, </em>86 Cong., 1st Sess. 109 (1959)\u2019. Replies From Federal Agencies to Questionnaire Submitted by the Special Subcommittee on Governmental Information of the Committee on Government Operations, 84th Cong., 1st Sess. 207-221, Nov. 1, 1955.</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1315\">*1315</page-number>V.</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-4\">Invoking a constitutional ground, the appellees, in the proceedings in the District Court, contended that the Commission has a duty in a quasi-judicial proceeding to avoid prejudgment, or giving the appearance of prejudgment, and that the press release program, by violating this duty, constitutes a violation of their due process rights. In substance, it was contended that the Commission, although it must ultimately pass judgment upon the merits of its complaint against the appellees, does, by the issuance of press releases appearing to support and justify its action, prejudge \u2014 or give the appearance of prejudging \u2014 the complaint before the respondents have been afforded a hearing. Declaring due process in an administrative hearing must meet the standards prescribed for criminal proceedings, the appellees conclude that \u201cDue process requires that the accused receive a trial by an impartial jury free from outside influences.\u201d Sheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U.S. 333, 362, 86 S.Ct. 1507, 1522, 16 L.Ed.2d 600 (1966). Pointing out that the Commission\u2019s press releases set forth to the public that the Commission has found \u201creason to believe\u201d that the law has been violated, the appellees conclude that the Commission members are thereafter under a very real pressure to vindicate themselves and justify the charges to which the publicity has been given. \u201c[Ajgency members have a more active and affirmative commitment to achieving the goals and effectuating the policies declared by Congress; their success is measured by the agency\u2019s results in striving to obtain those positive objectives.\u201d Elman, A Note on Administrative Adjudication, 74 Yale L.J. 652, 653 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-5\">Congress has, as a general practice, vested administrative agencies with both the specified power to act in an accusatory capacity through the initiation of an action designed to enforce compliance with or prevent further violation of a statutory provision and with the responsibility of ultimately determining the merits of the charges so presented. In fact, this procedure is recognized by the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 500 (Supp. II, 1965-6), et seq. More specifically, while 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 554(d) (Supp. II, 1965-6) requires separation of the adjudicatory and prosecutorial functions in an agency, subpart (C) of subsection (d) excepts the \u201cagency\u201d or a \u201cmember or members of the body comprising the agency\u201d from that requirement. The Federal Trade Commission\u2019s practice of reviewing the recommendations of subordinate investigative employees of the Commission and then making the decision to initiate a complaint is clearly within this exception to the Administrative Procedure Act. Davis Administrative Law, \u00a7 13.10, p. 242 (2d ed. 1959). \u201cIt is well settled that a combination of investigative and judicial functions within an agency does not violate due process. Belizaro v. Zimmerman, 200 F.2d 282 (3rd Cir., 1952); United States ex rel. Catalano v. Shaughnessy, 197 F.2d 65 (2nd Cir., 1952); Levers v. Berkshire, 159 F.2d 689 (10th Cir., 1947); Roccaforte v. Mulcahey, 169 F.Supp. 360 (D.C.Mass. 1958), aff\u2019d. per curiam, 1 Cir., 262 F.2d 957; Brikley v. Hassig, 83 F.2d 351 (10th Cir., 1936); 2 Davis, Administrative Law Treatise, \u00a7 13.02. See, Federal Trade Comm. v. Cement Institute, 333 U.S. 683, 68 S.Ct. 793, 92 L.Ed. 1010 (1948).\u201d Pangbum v. CAB, 311 F.2d 349, 356 (1st Cir. 1962). While we are unwilling to go as far as the Fifth Circuit in declaring \u201cthe contention that the press release in some manner denied petitioner due process of law in that it prevented the Hearing Examiner and the Judicial Officer from acting fairly in the premises is frivolous,\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> we conclude that the appellees have not been deprived of any due process right by the Commission\u2019s press release in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-7\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-8\">One further aspect of this case requires brief comment. As we have al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1316\">*1316</page-number>ready noted, the practical effect of the Commission\u2019s initial press release, in this or any other complaint proceeding, is undoubtedly deleterious to the respondents\u2019 economic, business, and community status. Recognizing this result, the Commission, in this present proceeding and apparently in all subsequent similar cases, incorporated restrictive and cautionary phraseology in its press release. The second paragraph of the press release issued by the Commission on March 8, 1967 describing the complaint filed against appellees stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1378-4\">(Note \u2014 A complaint is issued whenever the Commission has found \u201creason to believe\u201d that the law has been violated and that a proceeding is in the public interest. It is emphasized! that the issuance of a complaint simply marks the intiation of a formal proceeding in which the charges in the complaint will be ruled upon after a hearing and on the record. The issuance of a complaint does not indicate or reflect any adjudication of the matters charged.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1378-5\">The quoted caution was well intended and is commendable. We have no doubt, however, that its practical value in minimizing the derogatory inferences upon the respondents\u2019 integrity was at best minimal, \u201cfor many will read the charge who may never see the answer * * Respublica v.

The fact that a complaint has been issued, as well as the contents of the complaint, are \u2018public information\u2019, within Section 1.132 <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> of the Commission\u2019s Rules of Practice. A complaint is a pleading in an adjudicative proceeding, and as such is not considered confidential, either as a matter of law or practice or for reasons of public policy. Since complaints fall within the category of public information, the objective of the Commission\u2019s Office of Information, in issuing factual news releases, is to provide, a means whereby such public information is made available, simultaneously and on an orderly basis, to the bar, industry members, the press, and interested members of the public.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1379-15\">If my understanding of the court\u2019s opinion and the Commission\u2019s justifying statement is correct, they present diverging views as to what the Commission had in mind when it promulgated.the release that precipitated this lawsuit. The court says the release was designed as a warning to that segment of the public with which appellees were or might be dealing.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Commission, on the other hand, without any suggestion of so special or confined a purpose, tells us that the release was more broadly conceived as a vehicle facilitating dissemination to the public at large of newsworthy information already in the public domain.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1379-16\">This difference I mention at the outset because it is fundamental in terms of the nature of the problem with which we are confronted. \u201cThe effective functioning of a free government like ours depends largely on the force of an informed public opinion.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Relatively few matters attract more readily the interest of the people than what government is doing for the people. News releasing by the agencies of government has become a standard technique in the operations by which the people are kept knowledgeable as to governmental affairs.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Press releases by public of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1318\">*1318</page-number>ficials, we have said, \u201cserve a useful if not essential role in the functioning of the democratic processes of government.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1380-4\">An incidental and wholesome consequence of general publicity of proceedings challenging the fairness and honesty of particular commercial practices may well be the generation of a desirable if unnecessary measure of public caution in dealings with those identified with such practices.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Publicity, or the specter of publicity, may also, in a very practical way, achieve on its own a degree of informal regulation by deterring those who otherwise might be tempted to take liberties with the law.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> But beyond these factors is the consideration that the business of an important governmental agency is everybody\u2019s business. The people want to know, and are entitled to know, what goes on in government,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and the thirst for information is not limited to those who may have or may contemplate a direct commercial relationship with the subject of governmental concern at the moment. The activities of the Federal Trade Commission constitute news, and any restriction upon its machinery for public accessibility to that news must be taken for what it really is.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1380-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-14\">We dealt with the public nature of the Commission\u2019s adjudicative proceedings in E. Griffiths Hughes, Inc. v. FTC.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> There the Commission filed a complaint charging Hughes with unfair trade methods and false and fraudulent advertising. Hughes sought an injunction, in one respect quite similar to that which our ap-pellees were awarded, \u201crestraining the Commission from making the complaint public and from taking any testimony in public and from making public the transcript of the testimony.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Hughes alleged as the ground for injunctive relief, in much the same vein as our appellees did, \u201cthat, because of the announcements in trade journals of the issuance by the Commission of its complaint, appellant\u2019s business has been injured and that the taking of testimony in public will aggravate and increase the injury, * * \u201d <footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1380-15\">We noted that Hughes\u2019 case was \u201cconfined to the assertion that the Commission has no right to determine to hear evidence in public; that until its final determination its function is wholly in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1319\">*1319</page-number>quisitional, and is therefore necessarily secret.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In response, we pointed to the Commission\u2019s rules opening to public inspection the papers in the case and specifying that hearings on complaints should be public,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> provisions to which we affixed the stamp of our approval.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> And, distinguishing the disclosure of information statutorily protected, we deemed legally innocuous the notoriety associated with pendency of the administrative proceeding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1381-4\">\u201cDoubtless on such a hearing as is here provided the Commission has discretion, on a showing that such a hearing would disclose trade secrets or other data in itself destructive of the business under investigation, to do whatever is proper and necessary to avoid these consequences, but where, as is here alleged, the possibility of loss is founded wholly on the public knowledge that an investigation has been ordered, no good reason exists or can be shown why the public hearing should not continue.\u201d <footnotemark>23</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1381-5\">Our appellees do not press on so broad a front as did Hughes. They do not vie 'for sealed records or nonpublic hearings in the adjudicative proceeding. They do say that the Commission may not enhance the attendant publicity by a news release \u2014 a proposition promotive of rather curious results. Thus, while the papers on file in the proceeding constitute a public record, the Commission could not attract public attention to the record. While an enterprising reporter might flush out newsworthy information from the public docket, the Commission could not focus the attention of the press upon that information. And while individual citizens could, for informational purposes, themselves examine the Commission\u2019s public records and attend the public proceeding, the Commission could not assist affirmatively in the transmission of the same information to them through regular news channels. I turn now to consider whether the restriction for which appellees contend is required either by the Act or by the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-12\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-13\">The Act commands the Commission \u201c[t]o gather and compile information concerning, and to investigate from time to time the organization, business, conduct, practices, and management of\u201d unexempted corporations \u201cengaged in commerce.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> It also authorizes the Commission \u201c[t]o make public from time to time such portions of the information obtained by it hereunder, except trade secrets and names of customers, as it shall deem expedient in the public interest.\u201d <footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Its legislative history attests amply a congressional purpose to create an independent agency empowered not only to investigate and adjudicate, but also to convey the informational fruits of its labors to the American public.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1381-14\">When this litigation was at the administrative level, the Commission had by rule classified as public information \u201c[t]he pleadings, transcript of testimony, exhibits and all documents received in evidence or made a part of the record in adjudicative proceedings (ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1320\">*1320</page-number>cept evidence received in camera),\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark>'' and had provided that \u201c[additional information concerning the activities of the Commission is released from time to time through the Commission\u2019s Office of Information.\u201d <footnotemark>28</footnotemark> For a half-century, the Commission had pursued a policy of issuing news releases upon the initiation of adjudicative proceedings and at important points during the course of such proceedings.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> This consistent practice, involving as it does an administrative interpretation of the statute under which the Commission functions, is entitled to peculiar weight,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> particularly where, as here, it has been made known to and acquiesced in by Congress.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> I conclude that, all circumstances considered, the Commission is fully authorized to make available to news media, in the public interest, factually accurate summaries of significant developments in the adjudicative proceeding it instituted against appellees.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1382-4\">Congress did not, however, confer upon the Commission an unqualified license to propagate the intelligence it garners in the course of its operations. Not only did it prohibit the disclosure of \u201ctrade secrets and trade names of customers\u201d but, by providing for publication of \u201csuch portions of the information. * * * as it shall deem expedient in the public interest,\u201d it articulated two preconditions to divulgence of information of any other type. The first is a judicious exercise of administrative discretion preceding a resolve to publish,<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> a point underscored by the Act\u2019s legislative history.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> The second, incorporated in the decisional standard provided, is expedience of the disclosure in the public interest.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Thus the propriety of an informational release to news media is not established necessarily and automatically by the institution of a complaint proceeding, albeit one directed toward alleged false advertising and deceptive commercial practices.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> And both the discretional function and the Commission\u2019s determination in terms of the public interest clearly require adequate consideration and suit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1321\">*1321</page-number>able weighing of any damage to private property which widespread publicity of unadjudicated charges may be calculated to produce.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1383-4\">I perceive no basis, however, on the record for interfering with the Commission\u2019s observance of its regular practice of periodic news releases during the course of the administrative proceeding against appellees. In justification of its decision to publicize the filing of the complaint, the Commission pointed to the fact that the public was interested in its adjudicative proceedings and to the further fact that the complaint it had filed was a public document.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> The objective of this release, it said, \u201cis to provide a means whereby such public information is made available, simultaneously and on an orderly basis, to the bar, industry members, the press, and interested members of the public.\u201d <footnotemark>39</footnotemark> This was, then, an administrative determination, in conformity with long standing policy, to facilitate the dissemination to the public through usual news media of newsworthy information already open to the public. There is nothing in the record to suggest that substantially the same considerations did not underlie the Commission\u2019s proposal to issue additional releases as the proceeding progressed.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1383-10\">There is no hint that the course the Commission contemplated was a manifestation of discrimination against appellees.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> What the Commission wanted to do in this case it had been doing consistently and uniformly over a period of several decades in all adjudicative proceedings<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Nor is there any indication that the Commission at any time envisioned a press release that would be anything other than a fair, accurate summary of the developments imparting news value to the event to be reported.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1383-11\">The record is skimpy as to some of the transpirations prior to the time appellees came to the District Court.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> From what can be gleaned, however, there is no basis upon which it can fairly be held that the Commission was remiss in its statutory responsibilities.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> Appellees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1322\">*1322</page-number>presented to the Commission a petition incorporating their grievance and their request, and presumably the facts they deemed to support it. The Commission, \u201c[ajfter careful consideration\u201d of the request in the light of specified public interest factors, found \u201cno reason for deferring the issuance of an appropriate news release\u201d concerning the filed complaint.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> If I am to abide appellees\u2019 interpretation, implicit in their arguments here, that this evinced a Commission resolve to pursue its standard news releasing policy as to subsequent administrative developments, I must accept it also as an appraisement that, for similar reasons, the public interest would be served by doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-10\">Congress committed the guardianship of the public interest to the Commission, and it was for it to make the determination which appellees later subjected to judicial scrutiny. Constitutional considerations aside, the Commission\u2019s action could properly be overturned only if it were beyond its statutory powers or if it were proven to be arbitrary.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> I think the Commission had the necessary authority, and the record does not support a conclusion of arbitrariness.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> Unless constitutionally infirm, that action should have been permitted to stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1323\">*1323</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-5\">Appellees\u2019 constitutional plea is an effort to equate Commission preparation of the prehearing news releases it dispenses with prejudgment of the administrative issues yet to be heard. It appears that all releases are cleared by a Commission attorney and the Commission\u2019s chairman, and are then distributed by the Commission\u2019s Office of Information. The gist of appellees\u2019 contention, which the District Court respected, is that such a release, once made, presents an insurmountable obstacle to objectivity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-6\">This position lacks the support of judicial opinion. While occasionally, on particular facts, a predecisional release has been criticized for the outside appearances it created,<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> no case seems to reflect the view that the practice works a deprivation of due process, and the few cases addressing the question have held that it does not.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> Still others have sustained such releases without allusion to due process,<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> apparently for lack of sufficient merit to induce presentation of the point or to entice its judicial treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-7\">Like my colleagues, I am unpersuaded by appellees\u2019 argument, particularly as it must be related to the circumstances of this case. From all that appears, the only person with adjudicative responsibilities who performs any activity with reference to news releasing is the Commission\u2019s chairman, and he only checks proposed releases for accuracy. So minimal a participation in a strictly factual summary of pending charges hardly produces a subjective impact so inimical to fairness as to tender a due process issue.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1378-7\">.

Appellees\u2019 countervailing claim is of injury to their businesses by the publicity. While their petition is not in the record, I am willing to assume that they confided their apprehensions to the Commission and, by the same token, must assume that the Commission gave them due consideration, yet I would not conclude that the Commission\u2019s decision to make news releases was without rational foundation. The public interest in being informed of government business is strong. The pleadings and as well the proceeding remained open to the public. The Commission\u2019s proposal was to release information, not only upon initiation of the proceeding, but as the major events therein unfolded, irrespective of whom they favored. While private injury belongs on the scale when discretion is exercised, see note 37, <em>supra, </em>an administrative decision within legal bounds is not vitiated simply because such injury may follow.
