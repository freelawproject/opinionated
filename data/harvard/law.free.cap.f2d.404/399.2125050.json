A. Products seeks registration of \u201cCONTACT\u201d for \u201cPlastic Gloves\u201d under the \u201cGeneral Class- \u2014 Clothing.\u201d United opposes on the conceded prior use and eleven registrations of \u201cCONTACT\u201d for piece goods, \u201cCON-TACT\u201d for various adhesive coated plastic materials, including flexible plastic sheeting for adhesive application to flat surfaces as a protective and decorative covering, and \u2018\"CON-TACT\u201d combined with other terms for generally related goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-20\">It appears that United\u2019s \u201cCON-TACT\u201d material has been sold throughout this country directly and through distributors to department stores, drug stores, wall paper and paint stores and other retail outlets. The \u201cCON-TACT\u201d plastic material is marketed generally in the house-ware section of department stores, and sold abroad directly or through licensees.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-21\">It also appears that the seamless plastic glove merchandised by R. A. Products is sold in the retail market under the mark \u201cTender Touch,\u201d but the \u201cCONTACT\u201d mark is allegedly restricted to use on gloves bought by professional, commercial and industrial users, particularly beauticians. Gloves bearing the \u201cCONTACT\u201d mark are sold through jobbers and wholesalers for resale and advertised generally in trade publications. Although R. A. Products asserts its \u201cCONTACT\u201d gloves have never been sold in the usual retail market, the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board nevertheless noted that applicant \u201chas advertised \u2018CONTACT\u2019 gloves for factory, laboratory, office and <em>home use, </em>and for protection against <em>household, </em>medical and beauty shop chemicals.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b461-22\">In dismissing the opposition the board stated:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-23\">While applicant\u2019s gloves and oppo-ser\u2019s material are alike in that each is fabricated of a plastic material, they are the products of distinctly different manufacturing methods, they possess nothing in common with respect to their essential characteristics, uses, or sales appeal, they relate to distinctly different fields of trade, and considering that it has not been demonstrated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>that opposer\u2019s adhesive coated plastic can be or is suitable for use in manufacturing gloves, it cannot be said that they are all goods within the natural expansion of opposer\u2019s business under the mark \u201cCON-TACT\u201d. Under these circumstances and in view of the suggestive character of the term \u201cCON-TACT\u201d or \u201cCONTACT\u201d, it is our opinion that, notwithstanding the possibility that these goods could or may be sold in the same retail outlets, the public would not be likely to expect such essentially different goods to originate with the same producer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">In applicant\u2019s favor it can be said that the channels of trade between the competing marks are <em>presently </em>different, and we have no reason to doubt the testimony of applicant that it plans no change in that policy. We cannot, however, ignore the advertisement plugging applicant\u2019s \u201cCONTACT\u201d gloves for general and particularly <em>household </em>uses, where many of opposer\u2019s products are also used, vis-a-vis its alleged primary market restricted to physicians and beauticians.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">It is also true, as the board noted, that the various products are not identical and the manufacturing processes are different. It must be remembered, however, that the statute does not require identity of goods in determining a likelihood of confusion, and we question whether manufacturing processes are of any significance in that respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">With due regard for the board\u2019s position, we are unable to agree with its reasoning or result. The involved products are certainly capable of use in the household where many of opposer\u2019s products are principally used, and when the identical mark is applied to such goods we think confusion is far more, rather than less, likely to occur in the mind of the purchaser.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">It must be remembered that the op-poser has spent time and money in establishing its marks. On the other hand, applicant has not chosen to select a mark so dissimilar to opposer\u2019s mark as to preclude a likelihood of confusion but has acted at its peril in adopting the identical mark used by opposer.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">On this record we think purchasers would be likely to assume the goods emanated from a common source. In any event, we feel doubt on that score should be resolved against the newcomer. The United States Time Corp. v. Jacob Tennenbaum, 267 F.2d 327, 46 CCPA 895.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-10\">The decision is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-11\">Reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-12\">SMITH, J., participated in the hearing of this case but died before a decision was reached.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b461-24\">.
