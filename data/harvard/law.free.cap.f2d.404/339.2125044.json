Such authority as is contained in the above quoted language must necessarily be based upon the assumption that what is dealt with there is a check or funds whose possession in the hands of the depositor can be adequately explained. It appears that the record is fully susceptible to the construction that for some reason or other the decedent wished not to deliver the cheek to Dr. Lerner before the time that Dr. Lerner endorsed it and deposited it in the joint account. In making this statement, we do not in any way imply that Dr. Lerner\u2019s conduct was in any way improper, but we must rely upon a record which is silent on the actual circumstances which would place the check in such posture as would then permit the agreement between the parties and the bank to be effectuated.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-11\">The petition for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-12\">Because of illness, CLAYTON, Circuit Judge, took no part in the consideration of this order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
