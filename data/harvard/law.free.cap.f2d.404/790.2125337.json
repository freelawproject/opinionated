He was represented by private counsel when the pleas were entered to two bills of indictment for murder. In response to the court crier\u2019s inquiry, \u201cHow plead you, guilty or not guilty?\u201d, relator answered, \u201cGuilty generally\u201d. The question of the validity of that plea is now before us. A three-judge court conducted a hearing on the plea under Pennsylvania law and procedure to determine the degree of guilt; after a seventy-minute hearing, relator was sentenced to life imprisonment. Having exhausted his remedies in the state courts, Commonwealth ex rel. Crosby v. Rundle, 415 Pa. 81, 202 A.2d 299 (1964), cert. den. 379 U.S. 976, 85 S.Ct. 677, 13 L.Ed.2d 567 (1965), he petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus in the District Court be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>low. An evidentiary hearing was held; his petition was denied; and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">We must determine whether the plea<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was made voluntarily after proper advice and with full understanding of the consequences; without these ingredients, the due process requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment are not met. Kercheval v. United States, 274 U.S. 220, 47 S.Ct. 582, 71 L.Ed.2d 1009.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">Bills of indictment were returned against relator, charging murder and manslaughter of his wife and her male companion. Three separate arraignments were held. He entered a plea of not guilty at the first. When arraigned a second time, he entered consecutive pleas of guilty, not guilty, and guilty; the arraignment judge then refused to accept any plea from the relator at that time. The third arraignment took place on the day of his trial. The record indicates that the court crier asked him one question on each indictment to which he made the \u201cguilty generally\u201d response. It discloses that relator was asked no questions concerning his understanding of the plea or its consequence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b855-20\">Relator charges that neither his counsel nor the court explained the consequences of his plea of guilty, that he did not understand the nature of it, and that he entered it under the assumption that the trial court would pass on the merits of a defense of excusable homicide. If the plea was not voluntarily and intelligently made, he would be entitled to have it vacated and his sentences withdrawn. A guilty plea, given under circumstances which deprive it of its voluntariness, is void. Machibroda v. United States, 368 U.S. 487, 494, 82 S.Ct. 510, 7 L.Ed.2d 473 (1962). As was stated in Kercheval v. United States, supra, 274 U.S. at 223, 47 S.Ct. at 583: \u201cA plea of guilty differs in purpose and effect from a mere admission or an extrajudicial confession; it is itself a conviction. Like a verdict of a jury it is conclusive. More <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>is not required; the court has nothing to do but give judgment and sentence. Out of just consideration for persons accused of crime, courts are careful that a plea of guilty shall not be accepted unless made voluntarily after proper advice and with full understanding of the consequences.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">Normally a reviewing court is assisted by an examination of the record surrounding the entry of the plea at trial. Faced with a record that is barren of traditional inquiries made of the defendant in such cases, we are quick to recognize the difficulties now before us. There is no record as is contemplated by Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure No. 319 and its federal counterpart, Rule 11, both of which anticipate an inquiry of the defendant to form the factual basis that the plea is \u201ccompetently and intelligently made\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> or \u201cmade voluntarily with understanding of the nature of the charge and the consequences of the plea\u201d.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b856-14\"> Trial courts have a duty to do more than simply listen to an articulation or a verbalization of a plea of guilty by a defendant; they have a duty to insure that the defendant understands the consequences of his act. This is not so much the result of promulgations of federal and state rules of criminal procedure as it is a part of the basic concepts of proper judicial administration in Pennsylvannia<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and in the federal courts.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b857-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>We have heretofore spoken in a chailenge to a guilty plea entered in a Pennsylvania court: \u201c[T]he question whether the plea of guilty is voluntarily and intelligently made can only be determined if it is shown on the record what comprehension the accused had of the nature and elements of the charge against him, of the defenses available to him, and of the consequences which might flow from a plea of guilty, * * * and these facts should appear on the record at the time the plea is entered. United States ex rel. McDonald v. Commonwealth of Pa., 3 Cir., 343 F.2d 447 at 451 (1965.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"avy-dedup-0\">The Pennsylvania Supreme Court has also emphasized that a court must establish such a comprehension by the defendant in murder eases even though the defendant is represented by counsel: \u201cIt would be wise for the court to make particular inquiry as to the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the nature of the charge, of his right to trial by jury, and of the general consequences of his plea. It is desirable to have such matters made known to the defendant by the court even though he be represented by counsel, When a defendant enters a plea to murder, more is required than simply his pleading orally or endorsing the indictment, as in other cases.\u201d Commonwealth ex rel. Barnosky v. Maroney, 414 Pa. 161, 165, 199 A.2d 424, 426 (1964).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A5io\">The trial court did not follow the salutary procedures suggested by tradition, established by good reason, and now mandated by the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure. But this dereliction \u00bf0es not, of itself, debase the trial proceedings; the failure of the state court have the inquiry made does not, of itself, entitle the relator to federal habeas corPus relief- There must be a factual showing that the guilty plea was not intelligently and knowingly entered; that there was an actual deprivation of his constitutionally-protected guarantee of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"Ap_K\">The procedural burden of establishing the validity of a plea of guilty in such cases shifts to the government in federal prosecutions,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and to the Cornmonwealth in Pennsylvania state proceedings. United States ex rel. McCloud v. Bundle, 402 F.2d 853 (3 Cir. 1968).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>Whether the plea was knowingly and voluntarily entered is always a question of fact.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In the absence of an adequate record at arraignment as to the factual basis on which the plea was entered, it becomes necessary to examine thoroughly the \u201ctotality of circumstances\u201d on a case by case basis,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> with the Commonwealth having the burden of proof on the issue. If Crosby did understand the nature and consequences of his plea of guilty, he is entitled to no relief, irrespective of the trial court\u2019s failure to conduct an inquiry into the factual basis of the defendant\u2019s knowledge and understanding of the technical plea entered. United States ex rel. McArthur v. Rundle, 402 F.2d 701 (3 Cir. 1968); United States ex rel. Smith v. Hendrick, 260 F.Supp. 235 (E.D.Pa.1966), aff\u2019d per curiam, 378 F.2d 373 (3 Cir. 1967); Kotz v. United States, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">This is not to say that the action, or inaction, of the trial court is not relevant to our review. Although the non-observance of the recommended procedure of conducting an inquiry into the extent of the defendant\u2019s understanding is not conclusive on the issue, it nevertheless forms an integral part of the totality of circumstances which must be considered in determining whether the plea was knowingly entered. We must now proceed to examine other relevant circumstances attendant to the entry of the plea. In this respect, the nature of the legal advice and information imparted from attorney to client, and the facts adduced at trial become relevant on the issue of the defendant\u2019s actual, rather than presumptive, understanding of his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-9\">There being no dialogue on the record relating to the quality of the relator\u2019s understanding, it becomes necessary to examine the testimony of the trial counsel describing his counseling experience (taken at the habeas corpus hearing before the District Court), and to review the testimony of the relator at the hearing on the guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-10\">Our inquiry becomes important because of the technical particulars of the Pennsylvania law of homicide, and the peculiar nature of the facts before us. The relator admitted firing the shots that caused the fatal wounds. Admitting to an act of homicide, however, is not tantamount to confessing criminal liability. In Pennsylvania, homicide may be justifiable or excusable, and thus carry no criminal guilt in the legal sense.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> If <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>an indictment is returned against the actor, whether the taking of life by him is justified or excused becomes a jury question, capable of being raised only in a plea of not guilty.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Illegal and unlawful homicide is murder or manslaughter, depending upon attendant circumstances; and one indicted for these crimes may plead \u201cguilty generally\u201d to the charges, and thereby waive his constitutionally protected right of trial by jury.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\"> Pennsylvania law<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> permits the defendant to waive trial by jury in all criminal cases \u201cexcept murder and treason\u201d. Commonwealth v. Petrillo, 340 Pa. 33, 16 A.2d 50 (1940). A voluntary plea of guilty is a formal confession of guilt and is equivalent to a jury verdict, Commonwealth v. Simmons, 361 Pa. 391, 65 A.2d 353 (1949); it operates as a waiver of all the constitutional, statutory, and judicially created safeguards afforded a defendant in a trial determination of guilt, including the right to be confronted by and to cross-examine his aceusors, Commonwealth ex rel. West v. Myers, supra; it also operates as a waiver of the privilege against self-incrimination, Commonwealth ex rel. Blackman v. Banmiller, 405 Pa. 560, 176 A.2d 682 (1962); and it admits the facts pleaded in the indictment so as to obviate the necessity for corroborating evidence. Commonwealth ex rel. Hough v. Maroney, 425 Pa. 411, 229 A.2d 913 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-18\">The defense of excusable homicide \u2014 self-defense\u2014denies the existence of any criminal guilt on the accused\u2019s part. Although it admits the act of homicide, it denies the crimes of murder or manslaughter.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> A claim of excusable homicide logically and legally contradicts a plea of guilty to murder.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> This distinction, basic hornbook law though it be, becomes singularly critical when an examination of the testimony of the proceedings below fails to convince us that appellant\u2019s trial counsel understood this at the time of the trial in 1962 or even by the date of the District Court habeas corpus hearing five years later.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b860-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>Crosby\u2019s attorney testified that \u201cif the evidence reveals itself so that if the self-defense \u2018alibi\u2019<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> stood up that we could withdraw the plea of guilty with the permission of the court and proceed at a lesser degree.\u201d (N.T.-248)<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> though this was his trial strategy, he candidly and freely told the hearing judge that he is not positive he ever used the words \u201cself-defense\u201d in discussing the ease with his client (N.T.-210) although he knew that his client was relying on a \u201cplea of self-defense\u201d (N.T.-247); he was \u201cnot positive\u201d he discussed with him the right of trial by jury, but he was positive that he discussed the question of the-death penalty. Defense counsel stressed that the assistant district attorney told him that the Commonwealth would seek the death penalty if the plea was not guilty and that it would seek life imprisonment if a guilty plea were entered. Counsel testified he advised the entry of the guilty plea to re-move the possibility of the death penal-ty.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"APr\">. . ^\u201c \u2122thlng on the, re+cord * m' dicate deffn+se counsel, at any time, explained to relator the legal consequenc- ^ * ,, , es of the guilty plea other than the effect \u00b0 ,, , * would have \u00b0n +\\he dlst/lct a\u00ab\u00aemey s Prosecution. On the contrary, the record reveals the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKiQ\">\u201cA. I told Mr. Crosby that although he pleaded guilty we would have the opportunity of presenting the facts to the ease.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AfG\">, Q- ^hich included that of self-de-ense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7Ii\">A. I don\u2019t know whether I told him the words which included that of self-defense. I told him that he would have the opportunity of presenting all the facts and pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>senting his entire story to the Court, yes, I did.\u201d (N.T.-264)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">He also told his client \u201cif we did plead guilty he would still have the opportunity of testifying and presenting all the facts, that a plea of guilty did not stop all the facts to be presented to the judge\u201d. (N. T.-220) He said that relator never did question him about the meaning of the word \u201cguilty\u201d or what \u201cthe plea of guilty might be\u201d. (N.T.-223)</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">A significant part of the attorney\u2019s testimony compels the conclusion that the attorney himself did not understand the consequence of a guilty plea:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-7\">\u201cQ. Now * * * you knew that there was a plea of self-defense in this case, or didn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-9\">A. I knew that our defe.nse was a claim of self-defense, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-10\">Q. And as a matter of fact, even in the tribunal here and before the tribunal of three judges, you referred to that defense by actually pointing out evidence showing that he was being attacked, didn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-11\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-12\">Q. Now, will you tell me and tell the Court why you advised your client to plead guilty when he had the defense of self-defense in the case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-13\">A. Because of the following: Number one, I believed that there was a possibility that he would receive the death penalty. I believed that if we pled guilty there would not be any pressure by the district attorney for the death penalty. I believed that if the evidence revealed itself so that if the self-defense alibi stood up that we could withdraw the plea of guilty with permission of the Court and proceed at a lesser degree * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b861-14\">The District Court concluded that appellant\u2019s trial counsel advised his client of the consequence of his plea; the court stating that according to trial counsel, \u201cMr. Crosby understood * * * the nature and consequence of a guilty plea and voluntarily decided to plead guilty.\u201d We disagree. There is no such statement by trial counsel in the record, and none may properly be inferred from the testimony. Indeed, we have not been convinced that trial counsel himself understood the consequence of a guilty plea, in view of his continuing to insist that he knew his client was relying on self-defense at the time a plea of guilty was entered. This being so, it is highly improbable that relator obtained the requisite understanding of the consequences of his plea of guilty from any advice of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-15\">Thus far, we have considered in depth two important components of the \u201ctotality of circumstances\u201d surrounding the entry of the plea of guilty: (1) the actual transcript of the arraignment and (2) the extent and quality of advice and information received by the relator from trial counsel. It now becomes necessary to examine the testimony of the relator at the criminal trial proceedings to ascertain whether he himself did understand the meaning and consequences of his plea. In doing so, we bear in mind that \u201ca fundamental requisite of a plea of guilty is that it manifest an unequivocal and knowledgeable admission of the offense charged\u201d. Hulsey v. United States, 369 F.2d 284, 287 (5 Cir. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-16\">The only eye-witness <footnotemark>23</footnotemark> to the shooting who was called at the trial was the defendant himself, a twenty-two year old male practical nurse, married to but separated from one of the victims, Georgia Crosby. When asked why he was carrying a revolver on the day of the shooting, appellant testified that he carried a pistol occasionally because he was an auxiliary policeman, keeping it either at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>home or at his father\u2019s store. On the day of the shooting, he was going to deposit the gun at his father\u2019s house and obtain another which he was in the process of selling to a third party.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">Tracing his steps on the day of the shooting, Crosby testified that he consulted his lawyer after receiving a letter from a social worker concerning his wife\u2019s receipt of welfare payments while being supported by the appellant. He went to his wife\u2019s apartment<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> to discuss the matter with her. After entering the apartment, he saw his wife \u201cand another boy engaged in sexual intercourse in front of my three children\u201d <footnotemark>25</footnotemark> (R-47), whereupon he backed out of the door and talked with the children while \u201cmy wife and this fellow went into the bathroom\u201d. (R-48) Crosby said that his wife reappeared, and, at first, Cliett, his wife\u2019s companion, remained in the bathroom:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"axf-dedup-0\">\u201cWell, anyway, I told her it wasn\u2019t right to accept money from me and get welfare checks too, it wasn\u2019t lawful. She either had to accept my money and leave the welfare alone, that was the idea. So later on she said something about she could get away with anything, and she was going to put more children on me, and she could get away with going to court, because I was married to her. She would say she did it before. (R-50)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-6\">\u201c * * * Well, I said I was going to go and see Mr. Tucker [social worker]. Then she jumped up and said something, and then she told this boy to get me. So this boy grabbed between the bathroom and the closet, a concealed portion there, and grabbed sort of a plank or board, I don\u2019t exactly know what it was. Anyway, he came towards me with it wildly, angrily, and I \u2014 well, I had the gun in my belt. It was loaded; I don\u2019t know how many shots it had in it, but I pulled it and fired in his direction, and from that I don\u2019t exactly know what happened. I didn\u2019t fire to hit him, but I just fired in his direction.\u201d (R-51)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b862-10\">He said that he didn\u2019t remember how many shots he fired, and that when Cliett was coming toward him -with the plank, the wife was \u201ceither directly behind me or somewhere near the door\u201d.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> (R-52) The sole thrust of the brief cross-examination by the Commonwealth, constituting only five pages of transcript, was an inquiry into the claim of self-defense relating to the precise position of Mr. Cliett at the time he was fired upon. Crosby said that Mr. Cliett was swinging the plank at him at the time he fired, that the door behind him was closed, and that \u201cit was impossible for me to run out\u201d. (R-57)</p>\n<p id=\"b862-11\">Following the determination of the degree of homicide to be first degree murder, the defendant was asked if he desired to say anything before sentence was imposed. His reply was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-12\">\u201cYes, I would just like to say that my wife, she didn\u2019t mean the children any good, and she didn\u2019t mean me any good, and she only held the children to get money fro.m me and also to just destroy them. And I didn\u2019t go over there to commit any crime of any kind. It just so happens that she wanted this boy to get me, and I was trying to protect myself to get out of there, and I didn\u2019t mean to shoot her at all, and just trying to get him away from me so he wouldn\u2019t hurt me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-13\">\u201cAnd I want to be with my children very bad. That\u2019s all. I love them, which nobody else probably does but me.\u201d (R-68)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b863-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>His assertion that he \u201cdidn\u2019t mean to shoot her at all\u201d was not an unequivocal. admission of guilt. His claim that he was trying to protect himself fro.m harm was more consistent with a plea of not guilty by reason of self-defense than a plea of guilty to murder. As was noted in <em>Hulsey, </em>a plea of guilty \u201cshould not be accepted if so limited or conditioned that it constitutes * * * little more than an ambiguous expression of qualified guilt coupled with a protestation of innocence\u201d.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">When Crosby\u2019s testimony introduced the element of self-defense, an infirmity crept into the plea of guilty. The articulation of the defendant\u2019s words \u201cguilty generally\u201d signified a formal confession of guilt as a matter of law equivalent to a jury verdict of guilty, Commonwealth v. Simmons, supra, but the words he used to describe the incident contravened this formal confession. His testimony injected the doctrine of self-defense and thereby created an issue of fact. Commonwealth v. Collazo, supra; Commonwealth v. Capaila, supra; Commonwealth v. Bre-yessee, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">Under Pennsylvania law neither a single judge nor a panel of judges may resolve such an issue of fact. The Act of June 11, 1935, P.L. 319, No. 141, as amended, 19 P.S. 786, prohibits a waiver of trial by jury in murder cases,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> and where a defendant pleads guilty to a murder indictment and appears before a judge without a jury, he is not asking that the fact of his guilt or innocence be determined by a judge rather than a jury. This he cannot do in a murder ease in Pennsylvania. By pleading guilty, he does not waive the right of trial by jury to determine the facts; instead, by the very nature of his plea he is asserting that there is no factual issue of innocence to be resolved by any jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-11\">In addressing itself to this phase of the case, the opinion of the District Court states: \u201cRelator gave completely unsatisfactory answers when questioned by the court as to why he did not retreat. Evidently the court totally rejected relator\u2019s story that Cliett ever wielded such a board.\u201d Unfortunately, the District Court misconstrued the appropriate function of a Pennsylvania trial court in a proceeding to receive testimony on a plea of guilty to a murder indictment. Where such plea is entered, it is not the province of the court to accept or reject testimony tending to establish self-defense. Similarly, it is not the responsibility of the judge presiding in a habeas corpus hearing to evaluate the quality of such a defense. A determination of the defense of justifiable homicide \u2014 self-defense\u2014is exclusively a jury question which may be raised only in a plea of not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-12\">Crosby\u2019s testimony must be considered as much a part of his plea as his uttering of the words, \u201cguilty generally\u201d. Bergen v.

Because no such inquiry was made in the instant case, the transcript of the trial proceedings itself does not disclose whether, at the time he entered his plea, appellant misapprehended the effect of the Commonwealth\u2019s decision not to seek to prove the elements of murder in the first degree upon his own desire to show mitigating circumstances. Nonetheless, our cases have not set forth a fixed procedure for determining the validity of a guilty plea; rather we have held that this is a factual issue which must be resolved on a case by case basis according to the defendant\u2019s actual understanding of his plea and his willingness to enter it.\u201d (citations omitted)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b856-18\">. \u201c \u2018Real notice of the true nature of the charge against him\u2019 is a right granted to the accused by the Constitution and it is indispensable to a valid plea.\u201d United States v.

There may be some temptation to equate the precise issue before us with the problem of a claimed deprivation of due process of law based on the alleged ineffectiveness of counsel in the conduct of the trial. The effectiveness of trial counsel\u2019s participation at the hearing or trial is not before us for review, as it was in United States ex rel. Darcy v. Handy, 203 F.2d 407 (3 Cir. 1953). In <em>Darcy, </em>the court was concerned with measuring the conduct of the accused\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>counsel against the constitutional mandate that the criminal defendant shall be represented by effective counsel. The issue was whether counsel had effectively conducted the defense following a plea of not guilty. The court held that the accused is generally bound by his attorney\u2019s decisions undertaken as a part of the strategy of defense. In the present case, we are not concerned with the strategy or trial tactics employed by defense counsel in the trial process, but rather with the basic question of whether the appellant comprehended the nature and effect ... . o le p ea i se . \u00ede sped \u00edc pro es sional activity subjected to our scrutiny is limited to counsel\u2019s participation m dispensing information and legal advice to his client prior to the entry of the plea. \u2018 1 J ^ ^ Counsel s expertise is important m the instant case only insofar as it has a bearing on the question of whether Crosby knowingly and intelligently entered a guilty plea.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"AYau\">. The use of the word \u201calibi\u201d by trial counsel in this context is perplexing. This is a specific defense, requiring a not guilty plea. Under Pennsylvania Rule of Criminal Procedure No. 312 it is specifically referred to as a defense, and until Commonwealth v. Bonomo, 396 Pa. 222, 151 A.2d 441 (1959) it was an affirmative defense compelling defendants to meet certain procedural burdens. Alibi has no place in a guilty plea. When self-defense is asserted, the defense of alibi is a phys-ieal impossibility. In self-defense the defendant admits to being on the scene and committing the act, but sets up circumstances excusing the homicide; in alibi the defendant contends he was not there and claims \u201cpresence in another place than that described\u201d, Bouvier\u2019s Law Dictionary, 8th Ed. 1915; <em>\u201c * * </em>* so removed therefrom as to render it impossible for him to be the guilty party.\u201d Commonwealth v.

Counsel did not hold himself out to be experienced in criminal law. This was his first homicide case. He attempted to remove himself, and petitioned the court prior to trial for the appointment of other counsel. The request was refused in October, 1961. The court ruled that because the twenty-two year old defendant had $50.00 in a bank and had a father who owned a neighborhood store, he could afford to hire private counsel.
