In connection with sentencing, the United States Attorney filed an information, pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7237(c)(2) (1964), showing that appellant had previously been convicted of a narcotics offense as defined in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7237(c)(1) (1964) for violating 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 173 and 174, and had been sentenced as a youth offender under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5010(b) and 5017(c) (1964). Appellant was sentenced to ten years imprisonment as a second offender under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 174.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-19\">The only question raised on this appeal is whether appellant was properly sentenced as a second offender. At the conclusion of the oral argument we held that he was and we now state briefly our reasons for that holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-20\">21 U.S.C. \u00a7 174<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> refers to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7237(c)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to determine whether an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>individual is a second offender. Section 7237(c)(1) provides that \u201can offender shall be considered a second or subsequent offender, as the case may be, if he previously has been convicted of an offense the penalty for which was provided in * * * subsection (c), (h), or (i) of section 2 of the Narcotic Drugs Import and Export Act (21 U.S.C. sec. 174) * * *\u201d or in various other statutes, not including 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5010 and 5017, under which appellant was sentenced for his first conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Appellant argues that he is not a second offender because the penalty he actually received \u201cwas provided in\u201d none of the listed sections.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">The legislative history of \u00a7 7237(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 demonstrates that second offender status is to be determined by a prior conviction under one of the statutes enumerated therein rather than by the actual imposition of sentence under one of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">The predecessor of \u00a7 7237(c) was \u00a7 2557(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939. As enacted in 1939, \u00a7 2557(b) predicated second offender status on a prior conviction for various narcotics offenses and made no mention of the sentence imposed. Internal Revenue Code of 1939, ch. 2, \u00a7 2557(b), 53 Stat. 1, 274-276.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">Section 2557 was amended by the Act of November 2, 1951, ch. 666, 65 Stat. 767, 768, to provide for second offender treatment if an offender \u201cpreviously has been convicted of any offense the penalty for which is provided in this paragraph or in section 2(c) of the Narcotic Drugs Import and Export Act, as amended (U.S.C., title 21, sec. 174), or if he previously has been convicted of any offense the penalty for which was provided in\u201d various statutes that had been repealed or rewritten. The report of the Senate Finance Committee accompanying the bill which was later enacted indicates that the prior conviction rather than the prior sentence was to continue to be the basis for determining second offender status. S.Rep.No. 1051, 82d Cong., 1st Sess. (1951), reprinted in 1951 U.S.Code Cong. and Adm. Service 2602, 2603.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-14\">The Internal Revenue Code of 1954 renumbered \u00a7 2557 as \u00a7 7237 but made no substantive changes in it. 1954 U.S. Code Cong. and Adm.News 4017, 4576, 5256.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-15\">In 1956 \u00a7 7237 was amended to change the determination of second offender status in certain circumstances. The amendment changed the statutory phrase from \u201cis provided\u201d to \u201cwas provided\u201d so that an offender is a second offender if the penalty under his prior conviction \u201cwas provided\u201d in one of the enumerated statutes at the time of the first conviction. This amendment was intended to \u201cclarify the offenses that constitute prior convictions for purposes of the act.\u201d H.Rep. No. 2388, 84th Cong., 2d Sess. (1956), reprinted in 1956 U.S. Code Cong. and Adm.News 3274, 3278. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>There is nothing to suggest that this amendment was intended to change the law by basing second offender status on the sentence imposed for the prior offense, rather than on the fact of the prior conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">Section 7237 was construed by this court in United States v. Toy, 273 F.2d 625 (2d Cir. 1960) and United States v. Buia, 236 F.2d 548 (2d Cir. 1956). In neither case was relevance attributed to the sentence imposed rather than to the prior conviction in deciding whether the defendant was a second offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">The procedure set forth in \u00a7 7237 (c) (2) for determining second offender status under \u00a7 7237(c)(1) also serves to defeat appellant\u2019s argument. It requires a showing of a prior conviction under the listed statutes. No showing need be made with respect to the sentence imposed for the prior conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">Several cases decided under \u00a7 7237 have held the defendant to be a second offender where he was previously convicted under one of the listed statutes even though sentence was suspended. See United States v. Sierra, 297 F.2d 531 (2d Cir. 1961), cert. denied, 369 U.S. 853, 82 S.Ct. 939, 8 L.Ed.2d 11 (1962); United States v. Rivera, 224 F.2d 88 (2d Cir. 1955); Tanzer v. United States, 278 F.2d 137 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 364 U.S. 863, 81 S.Ct. 103, 5 L.Ed.2d 85 (1960).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s situation is closely analogous to the situation of the defendants in the suspended sentence cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">No purpose of the youth offender statute would be served by refusing to treat appellant as a second offender. Section 5010 is designed to afford an opportunity for rehabilitation. Appellant did not take advantage of that opportunity. There is thus no rational basis for disregarding his previous conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-12\">Appellant has filed an application for rehearing on the basis of United States v. Chappell, 292 F.Supp. 494, C.D.Cal., October 8, 1968 decided after the filing of appellant\u2019s briefs, which reaches a result contrary to the decision we announced at oral argument. The <em>Chappell </em>opinion argues that \u00a7 7237 should be strictly construed because the mandatory sentences to which the section refers are undesirably inflexible and tend to be unduly harsh. We do not agree with that basis for statutory interpretation. It is for Congress, and not the courts, to assess the desirability of criminal sanctions in the absence of any constitutional infirmity.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-13\">The judgment is affirmed and the application for rehearing is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b594-10\">. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 174 (1964).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-11\">\u201c \u00a7 174.
