In Part I, we held that Officer Tassa, on the basis of his courtroom testimony, was entitled to relate to the jury a confession claimed to have been made by appellant. The confession was ruled admissible after we concluded on the basis of the record that although appellant was not warned of his constitutional rights, he was not the subject of \u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d at the time he made the admissions. In Part II of the opinion we held that the trial court erred in honoring the Government\u2019s refusal to produce the grand jury testimony of Officer Tassa, and we ordered that appellant\u2019s request be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-18\">The grand jury testimony which was required to be produced is at variance with the foundation assumptions on which Part I of the opinion was bottomed. Contrary to his testimony at trial, Officer Tassa told the grand jury: that Earvel Jeffries (the alleged assault victim) could talk coherently at the time Tassa apprehended appellant; that in a lengthy conversation, related to the grand jury, Jeffries expressly identified appellant as his assailant; and that appellant confessed \u201capproximately ten minutes\u201d after he had been arrested. This, of course, makes out a clear violation of Miranda v. State of Arizona,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for the prohibition of that case against statements, taken without warning of rights, plainly applies even where \u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d takes place on the street.</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-19\">On remand, the District Court ordered a new trial after properly concluding that appellant was prejudiced by not having Tassa\u2019s grand jury testimony. On May 20, 1968, the Government dismissed the case. Appellant asks that Part I of our opinion be re-examined as to the validity of its basis in human experience, characterizing it as an opinion in search of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-20\">There can be no gainsaying the importance of disposing of constitutional issues on a record that presents the facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1337\">*1337</page-number>with verisimilitude.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, we do not think that in this case it is necessary to take the unusual step of rescinding or modifying Part I of our opinion because the facts assumed therein have subsequently been undermined. We think the interest of justice is adequately served by cautionary clarification, in this supplemental opinion, that while our prior opinion suggested that there is modest scope for on-the-street questioning without <em>Miranda, </em>warnings, the court cannot accept such statements in evidence unless it is affirmatively satisfied that they were not preceded or accompanied by custodial interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1399-5\">Motion denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1398-15\">.

It is also entirely dear that they cannot now be developed on remand with any verisimilitude. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b1399-27\">* * * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b1399-28\">* * * Our jurisprudence teaches that we should decide issues on the basis of facts of record.
