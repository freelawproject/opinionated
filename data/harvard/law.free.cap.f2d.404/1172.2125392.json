The Board cross-petitions for enforcement of its order. It is the contention of the petitioner that the record does not support the Board\u2019s finding, contrary to the recommendations of the trial examiner, that Cain\u2019s discharged an employee as a result of his engaging in protected union activity. An additional finding of both the trial examiner and the Board that petitioner violated section 8(a) (1) of the Act by coercively interrogating its employees concerning their union activity prior to a representation election is not here challenged.</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1174\">*1174</page-number>Petitioner is engaged in the marketing of coffee, tea, spices and similar products to grocery stores and restaurants. To accomplish the sale and delivery of these products, salesmen are employed to operate small trucks over assigned routes within the five state area serviced by the company. The present controversy stems from the discharge of one of these salesmen, Gordon Griffin, who was one of thirty-two such salesmen assigned to the Oklahoma City area.</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-4\">On Saturday, June 9, 1966, some of the Oklahoma City salesmen who had attended the company\u2019s regularly scheduled sales meeting adjourned to a local cafeteria for the purpose of preparing certain grievances to be presented to their employer. Griffin, having been appointed chairman and spokesman for the group, was approached while on his sales route the following Monday by Harley Hutsell, the company\u2019s general sales manager, who inquired as to the significance of the \u201csecret meeting.\u201d Hutsell was informed of the nature of the meeting and thereafter suggested that the coming Saturday\u2019s sales meeting be eliminated and the time devoted to a discussion of grievances. At that ensuing meeting the employee proposals were fully discussed. Some thirty days later, Hutsell' again approached Griffin concerning another supposed \u201csecret meeting.\u201d Griffin denied that any such meeting had been held and inquired as to the status of the employer\u2019s consideration of the previously submitted grievances. After being advised that little progress had been made, Griffin called upon the Teamsters Union and discussed the employees\u2019 difficulties with a local union official. Before the discussion concluded, Griffin signed a union authorization card.</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-5\">Soon thereafter, Griffin and two other employees visited Hutsell\u2019s office to inquire as to the employer\u2019s intended disposition of the employee proposals. Hutsell informed them that he had discussed the matter with the company\u2019s president, Jack Durland, and that due to its financial position the company was precluded from taking any immediate action. The employer\u2019s response was relayed to the other salesmen, many of whom then joined the union and filed an election petition with the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-9\">On September' 7, 1966, some three weeks prior to the scheduled election, Durland summoned each salesman individually to his office for the purpose of discussing the election and to ascertain the employees\u2019 thoughts as to the desirability of union representation. Durland indicated that he could not \u201cunderstand why a professional man earning $1,000 a month would want to turn his business over to somebody else to represent him.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> During the interview with Griffin, Durland inquired as to the progress being made in disposing of a motel that Griffin and his wife had previously purchased and which the company had directed him to dispose of in order to conform to an unwritten company policy forbidding \u201cmoonlighting.\u201d Griffin replied that he was in the process of disposing of the motel and would keep Durland advised. At the subsequent Board election, held on September 30, 1966, the union was defeated by a vote of twelve to twenty-two.</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-10\">A few weeks later, on October 21, 1966, Durland sent Griffin a letter in which he restated the company\u2019s opposition to employees engaging in extraneous business activity. Griffin was requested to advise Durland in writing as to the steps being undertaken to rectify the situation. After returning from an intervening vacation. Griffin responded with a detailed explanation of his attempts to dispose of the motel. He indicated that he understood the company\u2019s concern but would not allow the operation of the motel to interfere with his sales performance and would make every effort to eliminate the seven percent loss in sales that he had incurred during the year. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1175\">*1175</page-number>Griffin further stated that although his initial $70,000 investment in the motel had been augmented by an additional $30,000 in improvements, he had been unable to find a buyer even at the reduced asking price of $95,000. On November 12, 1966, Hutsell and George Patrick, Griffin\u2019s immediate supervisor, called Griffin into Hutsell\u2019s office where Griffin was informed that he was being dismissed because his sales had drastically declined, some of his key customers were dissatisfied with him, and his continued operation of the motel was unacceptable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-5\">On the basis of the foregoing facts, the trial examiner found that Cain\u2019s had violated section 8(a) (1) by coercively interrogating its employees with regard to their union activity. The trial examiner further concluded that the company had not violated section 8(a) (3) of the Act. He indicated that Griffin\u2019s declining sales record, his interest in the motel, and his difficulties with the customers, merged to provide good and adequate grounds for a discharge \u201cfor cause.\u201d There was felt to be no credible or persuasive evidence, apart from the timing of the discharge, that tended to link the dismissal with Griffin\u2019s involvement in protected union activity. The Board disagreed, concluding instead that the company\u2019s opposition to union organization as demonstrated by the unlawful interrogation, its knowledge of Griffin\u2019s leadership in the concerted activity, and the timing of the dismissal, were sufficient to sustain a finding of discriminatory discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-6\"> The question presented is the familiar one of determining whether there is substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s conclusion that the discharge was prompted by the employee\u2019s participation in union activity. It is elementary that union membership is no shield against discharge. Employees may be dismissed for any reason, or no reason, and as long as union activity is not the basis for the discharge an order for reinstatement will not issue.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Hence, the evidence must be analyzed to determine whether union discrimination was the motive for the discharge, i. e., the employer would not have acted against the employee were it not for his union activities. In thus examining the record, this court is bound to uphold the Board\u2019s ultimate findings and conclusions unless it can be said that they are clearly erroneous. Nevertheless, it would be an abdication of our judicial function if we were to allow the Board to rely on mere suspicion and thus fail to confine the Board \u201cwithin reasonable grounds.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Viewed in this context, we cannot say that the record substantially supports the Board\u2019s rejection of its examiner\u2019s findings that the discharge was not improperly motivated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-11\">The Board by its own admission relies primarily upon the timing of the discharge to sustain the inference of discrimination. However, even though the dismissal of employees who are active unionists \u201c \u2018is a circumstance of suspicion which may give rise to a justified inference of violative discrimination\u2019 * * * \u2018the issue * * * must * * * be determined by the degree of significance to be given to [the employer\u2019s] explanation of the reason for the discharge.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1176\">*1176</page-number>employer has come forward with evidence to establish a legitimate motive for the dismissal, it is incumbent upon the General Counsel to then explicitly demonstrate that an improper motivation contributed to the discharge.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Failing this, the presence of legitimate business reasons underlying the dismissal is sufficient to preclude a finding of discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-4\">Here the employer introduced evidence that established that when Griffin purchased the motel<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> his sales began a drastic decline until at the time of his dismissal he had suffered a twenty-seven percent loss in coffee sales \u2014 coffee accounted for seventy percent of his total sales. Over the same three-year period his commission based salary decreased thirteen percent. The Board in an attempt to dismiss this evidence as being relatively unpersuasive, pointed to the fact that other salesmen incurred losses, and that on an annual comparison, Griffin ranked third in sales when he was discharged in 1966. This vain attempt to degrade the significance of Griffin\u2019s sales record overlooks the fact, as found by the examiner, that the twenty-seven percent decrease was by far the worst suffered by any of the salesmen in the area.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Furthermore, there were at least three specific instances during the relevant three-year period in which Griffin antagonized his customers. One of these incidents involved a running feud with the manager of a large discount store whose purchases constituted thirty-five percent of Griffin\u2019s sales. It was this conflict that led Griffin\u2019s supervisors to visit that customer and having learned that Griffin continually refused to comply with reasonable requests as to delivery time and shelf space, prompted his discharge the next day.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The foregoing, when coupled with Griffin\u2019s refusal to divest himself of the motel after having been asked to do so more than a year prior to his dismissal, presented more than adequate business justification for the discharge. As stated by the trial examiner: \u201c[I]t is difficult for any reasonable person to understand, why in the light of the evidence adduced by Respondent [Cain\u2019s], any employer would continue the employment of Griffin.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-12\"> In view of the demonstration of a legitimate business justification for the discharge and in the absence of any specific showing of anti-union motivation, we conclude that the Board\u2019s finding was not based on substantial evidence. In circumstances such as these, where there is insubstantial support for the Board\u2019s inference that anti-union animus motivated the dismissal, we must accord respect for a contrary inference especially where, as here, such a contrary inference was also found by the trial examiner.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1239-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1177\">*1177</page-number>The order of the Board to the extent that it relates to the employer\u2019s coercive interrogation in violation of section 8(a) (1) of the Act will be enforced; in all other respects the petition of the Board for the enforcement of its order is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1236-6\">. The employee interrogation involved other statements by the company\u2019s president but because the Board\u2019s determination that this employer conduct violated section 8(a) (1) has not been challenged further elaboration is unnecessary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1237-7\">.
