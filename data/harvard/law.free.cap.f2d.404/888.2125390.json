This appeal is from the judgment of the district court dismissing without an evidentiary hearing Parson\u2019s motion, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, to vacate sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-21\">Appellant\u2019s allegations that competent testimony relating to his past history of mental illness was withheld and that the court erred in its instruction to the jury are not substantiated by the record and must be rejected. His contention that court-appointed counsel was incompetent is unsupported by facts and is therefore conclusory. Moreover, the trial judge was aware of counsel\u2019s career and competence and found no merit to this contention. Appellant\u2019s contention that he was denied the right to take the stand in his own defense is squarely refuted by the affidavit of court-appointed counsel who recited that although Parsons was advised not to testify, \u201che was further advised that even in the light of such advice he was free to testify or not testify according to his own judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b950-22\">With regard to the alleged denial of appeal, appellant was advised of his right of appeal and his court-appointed counsel swore that appellant expressed no desire to directly appeal the conviction. Finally, the trial court has discretion to ascertain whether a claim is substantial before granting a full evidentiary hearing, Sanders v. United States, 1963, 373 U.S. 1, 21, 83 S.Ct. 1068, 10 L.Ed.2d 148, and we cannot conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in this instance by not conducting a full evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-23\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
