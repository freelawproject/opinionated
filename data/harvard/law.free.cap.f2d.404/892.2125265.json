The policy also insured the interest of the mortgagee, Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company of Chicago. Plaintiff brings this appeal from a summary judgment entered in favor of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-9\">The insurance policy in question contains the following pertinent provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AY_\">\u201cConditions suspending or restricting insurance. Unless otherwise provided in writing added hereto this Company shall not be liable for loss occurring</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-10\">(a) * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-11\">(b) while a described building, whether intended for occupancy by owner or tenant, is vacant or unoccupied beyond a period of sixty consecutive days. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-12\">\u201cBUILDINGS AND CONTENTS FORM [Form 18]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-13\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-14\">\u201cTHE PROVISIONS PRINTED ON THE BACK OF THIS FORM ARE HEREBY REFERRED TO AND MADE A PART HEREOF.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-16\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Af-Z\">\u201cEXTENDED COVERAGE ENDORSEMENT</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-17\">(Perils of Windstorm, Hail, Explosion, Riot, Riot Attending a Strike, Civil Commotion, Aircraft, Vehicles and Smoke)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-18\">(Effective Only When Premium for Extended Coverage Indicated on First Page of this Policy)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-19\">In consideration of the premium for this coverage, and subject to the provisions herein and in the policy to which this endorsement is attached including endorsements thereon, this Policy is Extended to Insure Against Direct Loss by WINDSTORM, HAIL, EXPLOSION, RIOT, RIOT ATTENDING A STRIKE, CIVIL COMMOTION, AIRCRAFT, VEHICLES AND SMOKE, except as hereinafter provided. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-20\">\u201cOther Provisions: A claim for loss by any peril insured against by this endorsement shall not be barred because of change of occupancy nor because of vacancy or unoccupancy. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-22\">\u201cProvisions Applicable Only when this Endorsement is attached to a Policy Covering Rents or Consequential Loss: The term \u2018direct,\u2019 as applied to loss, means loss, as limited and conditioned in such policy, resulting from direct loss to described property from the peril(s) insured against; and, while the business of the owner or tenant(s) of the described building(s) is interrupted by a strike at the described location, this Company shall not be liable for any loss due to interference by any person (s) with rebuilding, repairing or replacing the property damaged or destroyed or with the resumption or continuation of business.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b955-23\">The above \u201cExtended Coverage Endorsement\u201d appears twice in the policy, both separately and as part of the \u201cBuilding And Contents Form.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b955-24\">In addition, the policy contains a \u201cStandard Mortgage Clause,\u201d which insures the mortgagee\u2019s interest, and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>form entitled \u201cRent or Rental Value Form For Other than Dwelling Risks,\u201d containing the following sentence: \u201cIf the described building, or any part thereof, whether rented at the time or not, shall be rendered untenantable by the peril(s) insured against, this Company shall be liable to the Insured for not exceeding the actual loss sustained based upon loss of rents of such untenantable parts. * * *\"</p>\n<p id=\"b956-5\">Plaintiff stipulated that at the time of the fire the premises had been \u201cvacant and unoccupied\u201d for more than sixty days, but sought recovery based upon the following allegations:</p>\n<p id=\"b956-6\">(1) The clause in the \u201cExtended Coverage Endorsement\u201d abrogating the vacancy and unoccupancy defense for that endorsement applied to plaintiff\u2019s loss;</p>\n<p id=\"b956-7\">(2) The policy is ambiguous and, when interpreted in the light most favorable to the insured, provided for coverage;</p>\n<p id=\"b956-8\">(3) The unoceupancy defense is at least barred relative to plaintiff\u2019s loss of rental value;</p>\n<p id=\"b956-9\">(4) Plaintiff is subrogated to the rights of the mortgagee, against whom the unoccupancy defense is unavailable.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-10\">Defendant moved for and was granted summary judgment on the ground that the unoceupancy of the premises for more than sixty days barred any recovery by plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-11\">Plaintiff\u2019s main contention is that the clause in the Extended Coverage Endorsement which abrogates the unoccu-pancy defense relates to the entire policy and not, as defendant claims, merely to that endorsement. Plaintiff supports this contention by citing the fact that the endorsement is included in Form 18, which establishes the extent of coverage. Plaintiff argues, moreover, that there are ambiguities in the defendant\u2019s policy which should be resolved in favor of the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-18\">We find, however, that the logical construction of the policy compels the conclusion that the provision in the Extended Coverage Endorsement which abrogates the unoccupancy defense relates only to that endorsement. Although the endorsement is included in Form 18, it also appears separately in the policy and is, by its own terms, merely \u201cattached\u201d to the policy and \u201cEffective Only When Premium for Extended Coverage * * * \u201d is paid. The reason that such extra premium is required is that the endorsement covers many perils other than fire, which are not covered by the other provisions of the policy. Similarly, the reason that the unoccupancy defense is not available to the insurer for the extended coverage is that the risks of the perils insured against by that endorsement are not augmented by unoccupancy of the building. While the risk of fire is far greater in a vacant building, the risks of windstorm, hail, explosion, riot, riot attending a strike, civil commotion, aircraft, vehicles, and smoke are the same regardless of the state of occupancy of the premises., Thus, the provision refers only to \u201cthis endorsement,\u201d rather than the entire policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-19\">Moreover, although we agree with the cases<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> cited by plaintiff \u2014 for the proposition that uncertainty due to ambiguities contained in an insurance contract should be resolved in favor of the insured and if there are conflicting or inconsistent clauses the clause which affords the more inclusive benefit for the insured will govern \u2014 we find no ambiguity in the instant policy. The Extended Coverage Endorsement is a separate item which is merely \u201cattached\u201d to the policy. The provisions contained in the endorsement either pertain to it alone or serve to accommodate it to the rest of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>We reject plaintiff\u2019s argument that, since the \u201cProvisions Applicable Only When This Endorsement is Attached to a Policy Covering Rents or Consequential Loss\u201d apply to other parts of the policy, all the provisions in the endorsement so apply. It must be noted that the above provisions do not differ from any other policy provisions, but merely define certain terms. On the other hand, the provision of the endorsement which abrogates the unoccupancy defense differs from the provision in the policy which creates such defense, due to the nature of the perils covered by the endorsement. Therefore, rather than creating an ambiguity, the language of the various sections of the policy adapts itself to the nature of those sections.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-4\">Since the defense of unoccupancy is abrogated only in relation to the extended coverage, there is no merit in plaintiff\u2019s argument that that defense is barred relative to plaintiff\u2019s loss of rental value. If the loss had been occasioned by one of the perils insured against in the Extended Coverage Endorsement, plaintiff would prevail in its contention; but since the loss in the instant case was occasioned by fire, the unoccupancy defense is available to defendant. Rent is not a \u201crisk\u201d or \u201cperil\u201d against which the insured is protected; <footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>but rather it is an item of property which, like plaintiff\u2019s building, was covered by the various provisions of the policy. There is nothing in the \u201cRent or Rental Value Form\u201d which changes the terms of the other provisions of the policy relative to the perils covered thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-11\">Plaintiff lastly contends that even if its breach of the vacancy and unoccupancy provision otherwise bars it from recovering under the policy, it is subrogated to the mortgagee, who plaintiff claims is entitled to the proceeds of the policy, since plaintiff has paid the entire mortgage indebtedness. We disagree. The plaintiff, as mortgagor, was the principal debtor on the mortgage debt, the mortgagee was the principal creditor, and defendant was the surety under the contract. Once the principal debt was paid, the mortgagee had no right to recover anything from defendant. In fact, the only subrogation possible under this type of policy <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> is that of the surety (defendant) to the rights of the mortgagee against the mortgagor, had the surety paid a claim to the mortgagee under the policy. Kerber v. Girling, 254 Ill.App. 1, 6 (1929); <footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Clark v. Trainor, 237 Ill.App. 269, 275 (1925). Thus, the plaintiff\u2019s argument is for the reversal of the rights of the parties, and is not supported by the authorities or by logic.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-12\">In essence, plaintiff, as mortgagor, is ultimately liable for the principal debt, and since plaintiff lost its right to recover directly from the insurer, by virtue of the unoccupancy of the premises, it cannot recover indirectly by subrogation to the rights of its mortgagee when those rights neither exist nor run in favor of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-13\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment below is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b957-5\">.
