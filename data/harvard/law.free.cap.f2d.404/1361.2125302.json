The husband\u2019s injuries were sustained in a fall when he tripped over a wire that had been left on a sidewalk along which he was traveling. The wire, so appellants aver, had bound a bundle of appellee\u2019s newspapers deposited nearby for delivery, and had been removed and carelessly discarded on the sidewalk.</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-6\">A critical witness for appellants is one Henry Maung, who then was appellee\u2019s carrier on the route covering the point of injury. On January 9, 1961, when the accident occurred, Maung, a 12-year old national of the Union of Burma, resided in the District of Columbia with his family while his father served as a military attache to the Burmese embassy. In March of that year, Maung gave appellants a statement concerning his carrier activities which favored appellants\u2019 litigative theory,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but their suit was not filed until early 1963. The case was reached for pretrial in October, 1965, and trial was set for early 1966. It was then that the difficulty eventuating in this appeal came to light.</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-11\">Counsel for appellants had been informed that the Maung family would remain in the District until 1968, and for that reason Henry Maung\u2019s deposition was not taken. In April, 1966, however, appellants learned that the family had returned to Burma about three months earlier without leaving a forwarding address. After several months of searching appellants obtained a business address for the Maungs in Rangoon, and on October 27, 1966, dispatched a registered letter, with a copy of Maung\u2019s statement, to his father. After the letter was neither answered nor returned, appellants inaugurated a series of efforts looking forward to arrangements, including compulsory process, by which Maung\u2019s testimony would be procured.</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-12\">On January 5, 1967, appellants petitioned the District Court for a <em>dedimus potestatem </em><footnotemark>3</footnotemark> directed either to the American ambassadorial officials in Rangoon or \u201cto The Appropriate Judicial Authority in Burma\u201d authorizing Maung\u2019s examination on written interrogatories. This the court denied without prejudice to renewal \u201cif good cause can be shown for delay in taking deposition.\u201d Four <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1363\">*1363</page-number>days later appellants\u2019 counsel filed an explanatory affidavit and moved for the <em>dedimus potestatem </em>or alternatively for leave to examine Maung pursuant to a letter rogatory<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court responded with an order allowing appellants to take Maung\u2019s testimony on written interrogatories and providing for the issuance of a commission therefor.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Two days later, however, the court vacated this order and entered a new order changing the mode of examination from interrogatories to oral deposition,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and specifying that the deposition be filed by April 10, but omitting the earliest provision for issuance of a commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-5\">Appellants then engaged an attorney in Rangoon for purposes of the deposition, but for more than two months he was unable to locate young Maung. On April 7, the District Court extended to May 17 the period for completing Maung\u2019s deposition, but denied appellants\u2019 plea for \u201ca letter of request\u201d to the Chief Court of the Union of Burma to facilitate Maung\u2019s appearance.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1425-6\">On April 24, a notice was finally served on Maung for the taking of his deposition on May 6, but he failed to appear.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> On May 23, the District Court continued the trial to June 2,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> its order providing \u201cthat no further continuance shall be granted in this case.\u201d Then, on June 5, appellants sought removal of the case from the ready calendar, and requested the issuance of a letter roga-tory as had been specified in the order vacated nearly six months earlier. The motion was denied, and despite appellants\u2019 protest that without Maung\u2019s testimony they could not proceed to trial, on the next day the action was formally dismissed with prejudice.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1425-17\">We note initially that this is not the usual case of dismissal for failure to prosecute, either under the District Court\u2019s Rule 13 <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> or Federal Civil Rule 41,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> or pursuant to an inherent judicial power.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Notwithstanding the rather protracted history of this litigation, we do not pereejve any lack of diligence on appellants\u2019 part, and as late as April, 1967, the District Court had in effect so held.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> It is evident from the record that after the case was alerted for trial, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1364\">*1364</page-number>offending circumstance was the unavailability of Henry Maung\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-4\">The question, then, is simply whether the District Judge erred in refusing judicial collaboration under Rule 28(b) to appellants\u2019 repeated but unsuccessful efforts to acquire that testimony. We think the answer is apparent from the rule itself, which states in pertinent part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1426-5\">\u201cA commission or a letter rogatory shall be issued on application and notice and on terms that are just and appropriate. It is not requisite to the issuance of a commission or a letter rogatory that the taking of the deposition in any other manner is impracticable or inconvenient; and both a commission and a letter rogatory may be issued in proper cases.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1426-6\">This language was inserted by the 1963 amendment, prior to which the notice procedure had been preferred and some courts had been unwilling to issue commissions or letters rogatory unless it was impossible or impractical to obtain the testimony in any other way.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> As the Advisory Committee states, the purpose of the amendment was \u201cto overcome this judicial antipathy and to permit a sound choice between depositions under a letter rogatory and on notice or by commission in the light of all the circumstances.\u201d <footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1426-15\">While there are situations in which it may be proper to refuse the issuance of a commission or letter rogatory,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> this is not one of them. The evidence appellants desire may be vital to their case<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> if it can be made producible at the trial, and the sole obstacle to that end is the apparent reluctance of Henry Maung to yield to the demand for his deposition.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The District Court has not suggested, nor have we fathomed, any good reason for denying them the judicial assistance they so persistently sought to dissolve their manifest dilemma.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1426-16\">We reverse the judgment appealed from and remand with directions to reinstate the case and issue an appropriate commission or letter rogatory for appellants\u2019 use in obtaining the testimony of Henry Maung.</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-17\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1424-7\">. F.R.Civ.P. 28(b) provides for the taking of depositions in foreign countries. Three methods by which such depositions may be taken are specified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1424-8\">\u201c (1) on notice before a person authorized to administer oaths in the place in which the examination is held, either by the law thereof or by the law of the United States, or (2) before a person commissioned by the court, and a person so commissioned shall have the power by virtue of his commission to administer any necessary oath and take testimony, or (3) pursuant to a letter rogatory.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1424-9\">The effectiveness, and even the availability of a particular method depends largely upon the law of the foreign country in which the deposition is to be taken. Some nations do not permit depositions through the notice or commission procedures; in these, only the letter rogatory may be used. Moreover, the \u201cnotice\u201d method has an additional drawback: since, unlike the commission and the letter rogatory, it does not itself embrace compulsory process, the witness must appear voluntarily or the practice in the foreign country must be such as to afford such process in aid therefor. See 4 Moore, Federal Practice \u00b6\u00b6 28.04 at 1923, 28.05 at 1929-31 (2d ed. 1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1424-14\">.

The \u201cletter of request\u201d was the suggestion of appellants\u2019 Burmese attorney.

In lieu of an appearance, Maung sent to the notary a letter in part stating that \u201c[sjince six years had passed, I cannot quite remember the details other than those already stated in the previous statements.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1425-13\">. This continuance was on appellants\u2019 motion occasioned by the temporary absence of the husband-apxiellant from the United States in connection with his employment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1425-14\">. When, on June 5, 1967, the District Court rejected appellants\u2019 final plea for a letter rogatory, their counsel remarked that they were unable to proceed without it \u201cso the case may be dismissed.\u201d As we have stated, the court obliged, dismissing the action with prejudice. Ap-pellee has argued that this disposition is not a final judgment from which an appeal will lie under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, but we disagree with this contention. The dismissal, though perhaps in a very loose sense solicited by appellants, was not voluntary; it was a reaction to the court\u2019s refusal to assist them in obtaining indispensable testimony. The order of dismissal, being \u201cwith prejudice\u201d and finally disposing of the action, is appealable here. United States v.

This is so notwithstanding Maung\u2019s assertion that he lacks present recollection of the circumstances of the accident. At the very least, his letter to the Burmese notary, see note 8, supra, denoted his adherence to his previous written statements and, with a proper foundation laid by his deposition, the statement he furnished appellants would become admissible in evidence at the trial as a memorandum of past recollection recorded. See Shokuwan Shimabukuro v. Higeyoshi Nagayama, 78 U.S.App.D.C. 271, 274, 140 F.2d 13, 16 (1944); 3 J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 734 (3d ed. 1940). More importantly, appellants were entitled to test Maung\u2019s claimed lack of present recollection by an examination on oral deposition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b1426-19\">. Appellants\u2019 showing in this regard is sufficient. As the Advisory Committee states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1426-20\">\u201cA letter rogatory may also be preferred when it cannot be demonstrated that a witness will be recalcitrant or when the witness states that he is willing to testify voluntarily, but the contingency exists that he will change his mind at the last moment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1426-21\">1963 Advisory Committee\u2019s Note to F.R.Civ.P. 28(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b1426-22\">.
