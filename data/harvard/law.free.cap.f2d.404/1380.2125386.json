See Cooper v. Pate, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1382\">*1382</page-number>Warden, 378 U.S. 546, 84 S.Ct. 1733, 12 L.Ed.2d 1030 (1964). Under these circumstances, the order of the District Court, dismissing the action, will be vacated and the case will be remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1443-17\">. The May 18, 1967, order of the U. S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania (#9792), transferring this action to the U. S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a), was clearly proper for the reasons stated in the Memorandum filed with that order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1443-18\">. The following previous memorandum opinions of the U. S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, which were attached to the Memorandum of the District Court filed in support of the order appealed from here and had been filed in cases instituted by appellant, refer to many instances in which he has been granted access to the courts, and other such instances are listed in the Memorandum filed by Judge Marsh in this case:</p>\n<p id=\"b1443-19\">Memorandum Opinion of Chief Judge Gourley dated 12/9/65 in C.A. 65-749,</p>\n<p id=\"b1443-20\">Memorandum Opinion of Judge Willson dated 1/25/66 in C.A. 65-749, and</p>\n<p id=\"b1443-21\">Memorandum Opinion of Judge Weber dated 3/2/66 in C.A. 66-249 and C.A. 66-250.</p>\n<p id=\"b1443-22\">The following litigation which appellant has been permitted to conduct in this court also shows the inaccuracy of his allegation of denial of access to the court: United States ex rel. Wilson v. Maroney, 395 F.2d 207 (3rd Cir. 1968), Nos. 16289, 16290, Misc.Nos. 133, 161, 164, 262, 266, 297, 318, 338, 339, 523, 524, 578, 606, 644, 704, 705 and 749. Reference to the state court offense for which appellant is confined is found in Commonwealth v. Wilson, 205 Pa.Super. 36, 205 A.2d 673 (1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1443-23\">. <em>\u201cCount One:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1443-24\">that defendants are denying plaintiff permission to exercise his religious beliefs in any manner, and have continuously deprived plaintiff of such permission * * *.</p>\n<p id=\"b1443-25\">\n<em>\u201cCount Two:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1443-26\">that defendants are denying plaintiff privilege of correspondence with his Spiritual leader, Minister, or Brothers and Sisters of his faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b1443-27\">\n<em>\u201cCount Three:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1443-28\">that defendants are denying plaintiff permission to purchase publications of his faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b1444-14\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1382\">*1382</page-number>\n<em>\u201cCount Four:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1444-15\">that defendants restrict the prison religious program to three major faiths. (None are Islamic)</p>\n<p id=\"b1444-16\">\n<em>\u201cCount Five:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1444-17\">that defendants force plaintiff to eat foods that are forbidden by his sacred laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b1444-18\">\n<em>\u201cCount Sim:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1444-19\">that defendants actually forced plaintiff to submit to identity under the Catholic faith.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1444-28\">Particularly in view of plaintiff\u2019s claim for actual and punitive damages, his transfer from the prison where the alleged denial of rights took place does not make moot these alleged denials of his civil rights. See Pierce v. LaVallee, 293 F.2d 233, 234 (2nd Cir. 1961); Richey v. Wilkins, 335 F.2d 1, 6 (2nd Cir. 1964); cf. Jackson v. Godwin, 400 F.2d 529 (5th Cir. 1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
