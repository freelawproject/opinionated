He found that Deel\u2019s proof did not establish disability within the meaning of those sections. Failing in his later suit in the District Court against the Secretary, pursuant to Section 205 (g), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g), to obtain these privileges and benefits, the claimant appeals. We, too, must decline his request.</p>\n<p id=\"b1446-11\">The District Judge\u2019s opinion fully states the claim and its environmental circumstances, with specific fact findings and conclusions of law. It demonstrates that substantial evidence was not wanting for the Secretary\u2019s decision. We join in these findings, and for the reasons set forth in the opinion, we now affirm the judgment of the District Court. Deel v. Gardner, Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, 288 F.Supp. 105 (W.D.Va.1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b1446-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
