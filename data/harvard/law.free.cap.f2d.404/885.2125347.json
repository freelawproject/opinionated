Appellant was serving in 1967 a March 16, 1964, sentence imposed by a Pennsylvania court, which sentence recited that it was imposed \u201cin view of his prior record.\u201d Counsel conceded during the argument that the March 16, 1964, sentence was vacated by the state court in March 1968 and a new sentence of probation was imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-14\">In view of this concession, the February 13, 1968, District Court order will be vacated and the case will be remanded with directions that this action be dismissed as moot, without prejudice to any rights appellant may have to challenge the March 1968 sentence or the 1954 courtmartial conviction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b948-12\">. The lengthy brief filed with the District Court (Document 12 in C.A. 43,659) stated that the jurisdictional questions raised (p. 3) were the right of appellant to a writ of habeas corpus or, alternatively, to coram nobis.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
