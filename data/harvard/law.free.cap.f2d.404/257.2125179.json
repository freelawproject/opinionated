This had resulted in the execution of a contract of sale. Appellants had an agreement for the Debtor to pay a modified <em>5% </em>commission upon the closing of the deal.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-15\">Before the closing could <em>occur, </em>the Debtor petitioned for a Chapter XI arrangement. The Referee ordered the sale to be consummated. The sales contract was silent as to any commission. The sale was consummated, and it produced only enough to pay expenses of administration and claims having priority status, with a possibility of a small dividend for ordinary creditors. The United States has a large income tax claim with priority status.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-16\">The appellant contended in the Bankruptcy Court that the circumstances required the creation of an equitable lien or the right to claim its $230,000 commission as a part of the cost of administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-17\">In light of the provisions of 11 U.S.C.A. 96(a) (6)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and in view of the fact that the referee did not authorize the incurring of <em>any </em>expense by the appellant for services in connection with \u201cpreserving the estate <em>subsequent to the filing of the petition\u201d </em>we conclude that the trial court did not err in dismissing the petition for <em>review.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b320-18\">The record discloses that the sales contract was fully executed and the commission earned prior to intervention of the Chapter XI proceedings although not to be paid until the closing. The referee held that the appellant was a common creditor for its earned commission. We are unable to find any basis for converting what the parties considered an unsecured obligation to pay the commission unto a secured claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-19\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b320-11\">. \u201cThe recognition of equitable liens where available means of perfecting legal liens have not been employed is declared to be contrary to the policy of this section.\u201d 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 96(a) (6).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
