We affirmed the conviction on appeal. Pool v. United States, 344 F.2d 943 (9th Cir. 1965). Appellant filed a petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, which the district court dismissed without an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-20\">Our prior opinion disposes of appellant\u2019s contention that his waiver of a jury was invalid under Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure 23(a) because not \u201cin writing,\u201d and we agree with the district court that appellant\u2019s challenge to the validity of the judgment based upon a one-month delay between arrest and indictment was without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-21\">All of the remaining grounds for relief asserted in appellant\u2019s petition rest ultimately upon his assertion that he did not knowingly and voluntarily relinquish his right to a jury trial, to the confrontation and cross-examination of witnesses, and to the exclusion from use against him of matter obtained in violation of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-22\">Contrary to the district court\u2019s apparent holding, an accused\u2019s voluntary intoxication may prevent a finding of the requisite waiver. See Gladden v. Unsworth, 396 F.2d 373, 380-381 (9th Cir. 1968). We think appellant\u2019s allegations regarding the circumstances surrounding the signing of the stipulation of facts and its use <em>in lieu </em>of testimony require an evidentiary hearing to determine whether appellant knew of his rights and intentionally relinquished them. Cf. Brookhart v. Janis, 384 U.S. 1, 86 S.Ct. 1245, 16 L.Ed.2d 314 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-24\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
