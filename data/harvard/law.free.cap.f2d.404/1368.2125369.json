Hall picked him up in a car later found to have been stolen at Fort Hood. When they met a Texas highway patrolman enroute vto Oklahoma, Hall hid the car behind some construction along the highway and waited to see if the patrolman was going to turn around. When he didn\u2019t they continued. Ruiz also testified that he asked Hall why the ignition had been wired and that Hall said it was due to the fact he had lost his keys. All of this is supported only by Ruiz\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1431-16\">Other witnesses testified that after arriving in Chickasha, Hall drove most, if not all, of the time and said the car was his. Around midnight Sunday the Chick-asha police found the car stalled with Ruiz asleep in the car. Hall was arrested several days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b1431-17\">Hall attacks Ruiz\u2019s testimony on the ground Ruiz had been convicted of possession of marijuana found in the car and on cross-examination made the statement \u201cI am not positive about anything.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1431-18\">In our system of jurisprudence the jury is the sole and best judge of factual contentions and whom to believe. They observed and heard the testimony and statements of Ruiz and were properly instructed in light of his prior felony conviction that the weight to be accorded his testimony was for them. In any event, his testimony can hardly be considered critical in light of the remaining evidence. Under our decisions in Garrison v. United States, 353 F.2d 94, 95 (10th Cir.1965) and Gregory v. United States, 364 F.2d 210 (10th Cir.1966) the evidence that the car was stolen Saturday morning from Fort Hood, Texas, and that Hall was seen driving it Saturday afternoon and Sunday in Chickasha, Oklahoma was sufficient, in the absence of a reasonable explanation, to permit the jury to believe that Hall transported the ear in interstate commerce knowing it to be stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b1431-19\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
