ROBINSON, III, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1295-9\">On March 17, 1965, petitioner testified before a grand jury in the District of Columbia investigating the affairs of Robert G. Baker. In separate indictments returned on January 5, 1966, Baker was charged with several offenses, and petitioner was accused in three counts of perjury allegedly committed in the course of his grand jury testimony.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On March 28, 1966, petitioner, invoking amended Rule 21(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> anticipatorily, moved for a transfer of his case to the District of Nevada,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> wherein he resides,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> or to some nearby district and, failing that, for a continuance to a date subsequent to Baker\u2019s trial. District (now Chief) Judge Curran denied the motion for transfer, without prejudice, for prematurity, and granted the continuance requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-11\">The Baker trial ended in a conviction on January 29, 1967, from which an appeal is pending. District Judge Gasch, the respondent here, on February 17, 1967, reheard and on April 11, 1967, denied the motion for transfer, elucidating his reasons in an unpublished opinion. Petitioner now seeks a writ of mandamus, asserting that Judge Gasch ignored a likelihood that prejudicial pub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1234\">*1234</page-number>licity may adversely affect a trial in the District of Columbia, and that his evaluation of the convenience of the parties and the witnesses, a dominant factor under amended Rule 21(b), was \u201carbitrary and unfair.\u201d The order petitioner desires would either change the venue for trial or direct reconsideration of the motion in the light of criteria responsive to that rule.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We find these contentions unacceptable, and deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-5\">Since our call to test the action on the motion by Rule 21(b) comes so close to its revision, we must apply its present provisions without the benefit of a background of prior judicial interpretation which more usually than not is available. We find, however, that our task is eased when the language of the new rule is consulted in the light of its evolution from the old. Thus our treatment of the issues confronting us has its beginning in history.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-13\">The Constitution ordains the trial of offenses against the United States in the state and district of alleged commission.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Surely in general operation \u201c[t]he provision for trial in the vicinity of the crime is a safeguard against the unfairness and hardship involved when an accused is prosecuted in a remote place.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Yet, scarcely a generation ago, the geographical coincidence of the offense and the prosecution left a great deal to be desired in particular instances. Although the Fifth Amendment secures the right to a fair trial,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and the Sixth the right to an impartial jury,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> no method of removing the case was then available, even where prejudice in the locality of the crime made an unbiased verdict quite impossible.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> And in consequence of spatial distribution of the elements of the offense, the Government was frequently presented a choice as to place of trial which almost uniformly was denied to the accused.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1296-14\">The Criminal Rules, which became effective in 1947, implemented the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1235\">*1235</page-number>constitutional mandates<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> but introduced a degree of flexibility of which the accused might optionally avail.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Among the innovations were provisions for inter- or intra-district transfer on motion of the accused upon either of two dissimilar occasions. Rule 21(a) required a change of venue when community prejudice forestalled a fair trial locally.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Rule 21(b), in its original form, authorized removal when, but only when, an offense was committed in more than one district or division and the trial judge found that \u201cin the interest of justice\u201d the proceedings should be relocated to another district or division where venue could have been laid.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The constitutional rationale for these procedures was the accused\u2019s waiver, by his motion for the transfer, of his right to trial where the offense allegedly occurred.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"aiy-dedup-2\">The objectives these provisions were designed to achieve are evident. Rule 21(a) was intended to rectify a deficiency in the law by affording the accused an opportunity to avoid provincial emotion so intense as to doom the objectivity of the trial.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Judicial constructions of the rule in its original form attested both the high standard it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1236\">*1236</page-number>set and the defendant\u2019s responsibility to meet it.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Rule 21(b) shifted from the Government to the court the discretionary exercise by which the choice of venue would finally be determined.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> It exacted, too, a demonstration that in honoring the request for transfer the ends of justice would truly be served.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1298-4\">Both sections of Rule 21 were amended in 1966. Through deletion of previous references to divisions,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> transfers under Rule 21(a) are now confined to situations where the accused is able to demonstrate inability to obtain a fair and impartial trial anywhere the court might lawfully sit within the district.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> And the changes made in Rule 21(b) were much more substantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-5\">As previously stated, Rule 21 in its original form authorized a transfer for reasons other than local prejudice only in multi-venue cases, and then only to a district or division in which venue was also proper. Irrespective of the degree of inconvenience incidental to trial where venue was exclusive, it was not possible to remove the case to a place in which no part of the offense was committed.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> And in situations where a transfer was permitted, there was no assurance that it would run to the most convenient forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-12\">It was to avoid just such difficulties, and the harsh results sometimes occasioned, that Rule 21(b) was rewritten. The most significant change was the elimination of the multi-venue requirement; another was the restatement of the governing test.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Retaining \u201cthe interest of justice\u201d and adding \u201cthe convenience of parties and witnesses,\u201d the 1966 amendment likened the standard in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1237\">*1237</page-number>criminal cases to its civil counterpart.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> With these criteria met, the court derived a discretion to transfer to any district, whether or not associated with the offense in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-5\">But while the amendment makes transfer a possibility in far more cases through elimination of the venue precondition, it did not otherwise create an essentially new yardstick by which requests for removal are to be judged. No major enlargement of authority to transfer flows from the present specification of \u201cthe convenience of parties and witnesses,\u201d for that was an important factor in ascertaining \u201cthe interest of justice\u201d under the original rule.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> And we find nothing in the history or language of the rule to indicate that \u201cthe interest of justice,\u201d independently of \u201cthe convenience of parties and witnesses,\u201d embraces more than its pre-amendment components.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-16\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-17\">Addressing petitioner\u2019s first contention, we note that, contrarily to the position taken initially,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> he now concedes that the \u201cprejudice\u201d upon which the motion was partly premised is not of a type or degree as would preclude the drawing of an impartial jury for his trial in this jurisdiction. Nor, as his counsel with commendable candor admits, is it an existing bias, or one which will accrue other than vicariously through Baker. It is, rather, an aura which petitioner feels is likely to arise during the course of his trial, through unfavorable publicity he feels will \u201cinevitably attend\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1238\">*1238</page-number>it because of its relationship to the Baker case, which may ultimately involve a sequestration of the jury. He insists that a showing insufficient under Rule 21(a), reliance upon which he disavows, commands respect under Rule 21(b), on which his motion for transfer rests.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-4\">Petitioner\u2019s bid is grounded on the charge that Judge Gasch gave \u201cno consideration whatever\u201d to this factor, a contention which in turn is based simply on the fact that the judge\u2019s opinion delineating his ruling does not mention the subject. We cannot accept this argument. Because the briefs and oral arguments presented to the judge in support of and in opposition to the motion were so largely directed to the matter, it would have been difficult indeed for him to have ignored the point. More importantly, to the extent that the situation remains ambiguous, we abide the presumption that the argumentative submissions were suitably weighed.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> And in any event, the claim of prejudice was not eligible for consideration under Rule 21(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-5\">We have pointed out that Rule 21(a) was promulgated to supply a method by which an accused victimized by strong community feeling might be relieved through a change of trial venue. The formulation of Rule 21(a) includes an explicit standard to be met in order that there may be a transfer on this account.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Rule 21(b), on the other hand, is devoted to an entirely different group of independently justified considerations which may support removal \u2014 those relating to \u201cthe convenience of parties and witnesses.\u201d Petitioner, however, would splice the two subdivisions by inclusion in \u201cthe interest of justice\u201d provision of the present Rule 21(b) of circumstances relevant to but insufficient to sustain a Rule 21(a) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-12\">We know of no basis upon which the pre-1966 Rule 21(b) could have been given that construction. And we have already expressed our view that the criteria for transfer under the old and the new Rule 21(b), except for the deletion of the multi-venue requirement, remain much the same. We have found no evidence that new Rule 21(b) was intended to expand radically the \u201cinterest of justice\u201d standard which survived from the old; we have seen nothing to suggest that, although coupled with \u201cthe convenience of parties and witnesses,\u201d \u201cthe interest of justice\u201d now embraces substantially more or less than it did before. It is clear to us that the amendment, rather, was designed to explicate a category of factors \u2014 pertinent only to the convenience of trial participants\u2014 which were already recognized as vitally involved in any determination as to the direction in which the ends of justice lay.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1300-13\">Moreover, Rule 21 is to be construed in the light of past and contemporary practice respecting claims of local community prejudice. Transfer of the proceedings is but one method of combatting the evil once its existence has been definitely ascertained. A continuance of the trial, as once was done in petitioner\u2019s case on his motion, frequently avoids the need for transfer,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> so also may the proceedings which occur on a Rule 21(a) motion preliminarily to its grant. \u201cThe ultimate question\u201d on such a motion \u201cis whether it is possible to select a fair and impartial jury, and the proper occasion for such a determination is upon the <em>voir dire </em>examination.\u201d <footnotemark>32</footnotemark> It is then, and more usually only then, that a fully adequate appraisal of the claim can be made, and it is then that it may be found that, despite earlier prognostications, removal of the trial is unnecessary. Jurors manifesting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1239\">*1239</page-number>bias may be challenged for cause; <footnotemark>33</footnotemark> peremptory challenges may suffice to eliminate those whose state of mind is suspect.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Frequently the problem anticipated works itself out as responses by prospective jurors evaporate prior apprehensions.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> These alternatives, which the mechanism of Rule 21(b) \u2014 transfer before trial begins \u2014 can ill accommodate, are preserved when indicia of community bias are scrutinized within the sphere of Rule 21(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-5\">In sum, we find nothing in the history or language of Rule 21 to indicate that circumstances relevant only to a motion to transfer on account of local prejudice which do not meet the test of Rule 21(a) are to be weighed under Rule 21(b). We are aware of no case adopting the novel theory urged by petitioner. We hold that the standard of Rule 21(a) is the exclusive gauge by which circumstances of that character are to be measured.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-7\">Petitioner\u2019s motion for transfer was also grounded on the claim that trial of the case in the District of Columbia would seriously incommode the rather large number of potential defense witnesses. He presented an affidavit designating 69 residents of Nevada and California, and giving their respective addresses and occupations. Of these, 29 were said to be \u201cabsolutely essential\u201d to his defense on the merits, and the remaining 40 to be available to avouch his reputation for truth and veracity.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> The Government\u2019s response stated that it anticipated the use of 20 witnesses, of whom 13 reside in this area.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-15\">At the hearing, each side indicated in some degree the nature of the evidence witnesses on the merits were expected to furnish. Petitioner undertook a general showing on the materiality of the testimony of most of the witnesses named on his list. These included representatives of a Las Vegas savings and loan association,<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> executives of California savings and loan associations,<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, employees of a Las Vegas tele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1240\">*1240</page-number>phone company<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> and others.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> In a similar vein, the Government categorized the testimony it anticipated from its witnesses.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> The presentations also embraced additional circumstances competing for priority in the judicial assessment on the balance of convenience.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1302-10\">In his resolution of the motion, Judge Gasch treated petitioner\u2019s Nevada residence as \u201ca factor to be considered,\u201d but \u201cnot the controlling factor,\u201d deriving significance solely from its relationship to the convenience of witnesses, records and counsel.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Adverting to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1241\">*1241</page-number>merits witnesses listed by petitioner, he observed that \u201c[n]owhere does the defendant disclose the nature of their expected testimony nor does he provide an adequate basis to enable the Court to determine whether these individuals may even be properly classified as \u2018witnesses.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> From \u201cthe limited disclosure made by the defendant\u201d he had \u201csome doubt whether these 29 individuals will all be necessary witnesses to matters of relevance for the defense.\u201d He felt that inconvenience to character witnesses was not so impressive a factor as the size of the group might suggest because of the court\u2019s discretion to reasonably limit their number.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1303-5\">Moreover, as the judge pointed out in ruling, 13 of the Government\u2019s 20 prospective witnesses reside in this area, and all relevant books and records are located here. A transfer, he said, would necessitate the selection of new Government counsel, and a lag incidental to a fair opportunity for new counsel to become acquainted with the case and to prepare for trial. Conversely, the judge stated, \u201cthere is no adverse factor of delay in this district,\u201d and a definite trial date can be assigned as soon as the disposition of pretrial motions could be completed. In sum, he did \u201cnot feel that the defendant has demonstrated a sufficient balance of inconvenience to himself to warrant the removal\u201d sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-16\">We do not discount the importance, in the decision of motions of this type, of constant vigilance to safeguard opportunities for full presentation of the defense,<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> nor do we lose sight of the value of character witnesses in perjury cases. But it is obvious that some amount of inconvenience- \u2014 to Government or to petitioner, and perhaps to both\u2014 will inevitably accompany petitioner\u2019s trial, wherever it might occur. The judge\u2019s challenge was to strike the balance truly, and this, we know, is a task all too frequently so difficult and delicate that reasonable minds may plausibly differ on the result. Surely the Government\u2019s convenience as well as petitioner\u2019s was to be considered; no less certain it is that there was range to prefer testimonial quality over mere quantity.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Judge Gasch assigned to the individual factors in competition values we cannot characterize as irrational, and upon weighing them reached a conclusion we do not regard as farfetched. It is not for us to make the decision, which to him alone was confided,<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> and we are not persuaded that we should set his judgment in the matter for naught.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1242\">*1242</page-number>Motions for change of venue invoke \u201cthe sound discretion of the trial court,\u201d which \u201cshould not be overturned where there is no clear showing of abuse.\u201d<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> And mandamus is an extraordinary remedy, \u201c \u2018reserved for really extraordinary causes\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> and exercisable \u201c \u2018then only to confine an inferior court to a lawful exercise of its prescribed jurisdiction or to compel it to exercise its authority when it is its duty to do so.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Only if the decision on transfer rests upon an improper factor <footnotemark>52</footnotemark> or amounts to a plain abuse of discretion,<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> are we empowered to issue the writ. Appellant does not contend that any element foreign to the inquiry invaded the adjudicatory process,<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> and we find no perversion of the broad authority inherent in that function. We conclude that petitioner did not so plainly carry the day on \u201cthe convenience of parties and witnesses\u201d and \u201cthe interest of justice\u201d that relief by way of mandamus should now be afforded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-5\">We come lastly to the position of our dissenting brother that Judge Gasch was not at liberty to \u201cremain silent during petitioner\u2019s explicit offers to disclose the nature of his defense, and then deny the motion because disclosure had not been made.\"<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> We start, as we must, with a brief summary of the events giving rise to this observation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-15\">Judge Gasch conducted a full hearing affording the litigants broad opportunities to support their respective positions, and there was no visible restraint upon the content of the presentations. Early in the proceeding, however, the judge made known his interest in general descriptions of the nature of the testimony which the prospective witnesses would give, ostensibly to enable sagacious decision of the motion. Near the beginning of his argument, petitioner\u2019s counsel represented that the defense \u201cmay well require all of [its 29] witnesses to testify on the merits of this case,\u201d whereupon the judge inquired as to \u201c[w]hat, in general, would these witnesses testify?\u201d<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> Counsel then outlined<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> the testimony he anticipated.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1305-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1243\">*1243</page-number>On his rebuttal argument, petitioner\u2019s counsel several times sought to meet the Government\u2019s strenuous challenge to the relevance of the contemplated defense testimonial proffer by representations, rather than more concrete demonstrations, that the testimony would be important. On one such occasion, the representation was coupled with an offer to do more if, but only if, the judge indicated that he wished him to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1305-5\">\u201cNow, I have represented to the Court, and I repeat, as an officer of this Court, in my honest judgment, we will need the witnesses that we have represented we will need. Now, if that is not enough, and the Court feels that I should go on and delineate at great length what our defense is going to be, I shall be pleased to do it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1305-6\">Somewhat later, the judge made an inquiry, admonishing \u201c[n]ow, if I am asking an unfair question, kindly ignore it.\u201d Counsel nevertheless voiced an answer, expressing the \u201chope [that] I am not going to be required to go into the defense here,\u201d to which the judge responded \u201cOh, no.\u201d Counsel added: \u201cBut I represent to the Court in good faith it is an integral part of the defense and a fundamental part of the defense.\u201d<footnotemark>59</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1305-7\">A motion to change the venue of a criminal trial invokes an application of the governing criteria to the trenchant facts of the particular case. Rule 21(b) \u201cpermits a transfer in any case on motion of the defendant <em>on a showing </em>that it would be for the convenience of parties and witnesses, and in the interest of justice.\u201d <footnotemark>60</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) The process involves, not merely a choice between antagonistic assertions as to convenience and justice, but a sound determination by a.judge. This responsibility cannot be abdicated to the appraisals of counsel, however earnestly constructed, or discharged by the simple expedient of counting the noses of the witnesses. On the other hand, the showing the motion summons the movant to make certainly does not, as the dissent suggests, require him \u201cto disclose his case.\u201d <footnotemark>61</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1305-9\">It is for the accused to make the showing,<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> and for the judge only to decree its sufficiency. We do not conceive the latter\u2019s obligation or function on a transfer motion, any more than at other stages of the litigation, to encompass dictation of the scope or depth of the accused\u2019s presentation, or periodic announcements as to how well his points have been scored. A venue motion is committed to the sound discretion of the trial judge. In ruling on the motion in this case, we think Judge Gasch conducted himself, affirmatively and negatively, within legitimate bounds, and that his action must be sustained. Certainly there is no abuse of discretion shown requiring the issuance of a writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-10\">Petition denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1295-12\">. Count 9 of the Baker indictment named petitioner and Wayne L. Bromley as co-conspirators with Baker in an alleged scheme, to falsify, for federal income tax purposes, the incomes of Baker and Bromley during 1963 and 1964, in part by causing First Western Financial Corporation, a Nevada corporation of which petitioner was an officer and director and in which he had a substantial stock interest, to make certain payments, represented by 12 checks, to Bromley as a conduit to Baker. Petitioner\u2019s indictment charged that he testified falsely when he told tlie grand jury that he had not caused any payments of that character to be made (count 1), when he denied having liad any conversation in Bromley\u2019s presence wherein the payment of money to Baker was discussed (count 2), and when he stated that Bromley had been retained as a lawyer to perform services with respect to legislation and had furnished legislative materials to petitioner (count 3).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1295-13\">.

For grounds the motion stated that \u201cRule 21(b), as amended, Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, requires that the instant case be transferred for the convenience of the parties and witnesses and in the interest of j'ustice,\u201d and that \u201c [i] t is improbable that the defendant can be fairly tried in this jurisdiction by reason of prejudicial considerations stemming from the charges made in the indictment.\u201d When the motion was first presented, and prior to the 1966 amendment of F.R.Crim.P. 21(b). transfers pursuant to that rule could be made only to a district or division in which venue of the. prosecution was proper. See note 15, <em>\u25a0infra. </em>Since the offenses charged in petitioner\u2019s indictment were committed, if at all, only in the District of Columbia, the motion could not satisfy the multi-venue condition imposed by the rule in its then form.

Petitioner seeks alternatively a direction for the grant of a further continuance, which was denied concomitantly with Judge Gasch\u2019s refusal to transfer, until completion of appellate proceedings in Baker\u2019s case. Petitioner contended in support of this request that count 9 of the Baker indictment is inconsistent with count 1 of his indictment, see <em>supra </em>note 1, and that Baker\u2019s conviction, if upheld, will exonerate petitioner on that count.

In this connection, \u201cat least four agents\u201d and \u201cat least three representatives of the telephone company and probably others\u201d will be required on the motion to suppress. The Government pointed out that the civil case had been pending for more than two years, thus antedating petitioner\u2019s indictment, and that no motion to suppress had been forthcoming although this prosecution had been pending for more than a year. We note from the record that no motion to suppress was filed until after the motion to transfer was submitted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"40\">\n<p id=\"b1302-5\">. Count 2 of the indictment charged that petitioner spoke falsely when ho testified that he had not conversed in Bromley\u2019s presence about the payment of money to Baker. See note 1, <em>supra. </em>The Government contends that conversations on that subject occurred in hotels in Nevada, and petitioner says that \u201ccertain witnesses from some of the hotels\u201d are necessary on this account. We can definitely identify two on petitioner\u2019s list as falling within that category.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"41\">\n<p id=\"b1302-6\">.

For this conclusion, which is not attacked here, Judge Gasch relied, very properly we think, on Platt v. Minnesota Mining &amp; Mfg. Co., <em>supra </em>note 26, where the Court, speaking of a motion by a corporate defendant for a transfer under original Rule 21(b), said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1302-16\">\u201cThe fact that Minnesota is the main office or \u2018home\u2019 of the [movant] has no independent significance in determining whether transfer to that district would be \u2018in the interest of justice,\u2019 although it may be considered with reference to such factors as the convenience of records, officers, personnel and counsel.\u201d 376 U.S. at 245-46, 84 S.Ct. at 772.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1302-17\">While <em>Platt </em>involved a corporate defendant, we are unable to read out of its broad language those defendants who are natural persons. See United States v. Ray, 234 F.Supp. 371, 372 (D.D.C.1964); United States v. Cohen, 35 F.R.D. 227, 232 (N.D.Cal.1964); United States v. Luros, <em>supra </em>note 20, 243 F.Supp. at 174; United States v. Jessup, 38 F.R.D. 42, 44 (M.D.Tenn.1965). We think, too, that the <em>Platt </em>holding survived the amendment of Rule 21(b). The deletion of the multi-venue requirement was designed, not to facilitate removal of the proceedings to the accused\u2019s home district simply for the sake of getting it there, but to serve \u201cthe convenience of parties and witnesses\u201d; and the \u201cinterest of justice\u201d standard, as we have said, remains about the same after the amendment as it did before.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"44\">\n<p id=\"b1303-6\">.

He was subsequently indicted for perjury. Relying on Rule 21 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, petitioner sought a transfer of his trial to the District Court in Nevada or some other nearby district.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1244\">*1244</page-number>The District Judge declined to transfer the case. United States v. Jones, 43 F.R.D. 511 (D.D.C.1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-4\">Petitioner\u2019s transfer motion was supported by an affidavit giving the names and addresses of twenty-nine persons all of whom are residents of Nevada or California and each of whom was alleged to be \u201cabsolutely essential * * * for the development of my defense upon the merits.\u201d Additionally, the affidavit set forth the names and addresses of forty potential character witnesses, including the Governor of Nevada, the Mayor and Chief of Police of Las Vegas, Nevada, and a Justice of Nevada\u2019s Supreme Court. Several of these character witnesses, including Nevada\u2019s Governor, submitted letters stating that a trial in Washington would be a severe inconvenience and might preclude their appearance. At oral argument before the District Judge, petitioner\u2019s counsel estimated that the cost of transporting these witnesses to Washington would be fifteen thousand dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-5\">The Government opposed a transfer asserting, <em>inter alia, </em>that it would call twenty unidentified witnesses, thirteen of whom were District of Columbia residents.</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-6\">The District Judge dismissed petitioner\u2019s claim that \u201cthe convenience of the parties and witnesses, and * * * the interest of justice\u201d required a transfer because petitioner had not \u201cdisclose[d] the nature of [the] expected testimony nor does he provide an adequate basis to enable the court to determine whether these individuals may even be properly classified as \u2018witnesses.\u2019 \u201d 43 F.Supp. at-513. Both in the District Court and here, petitioner has maintained that a criminal defendant is not required to disclose his defense in order to secure a transfer. Alternatively, however, his counsel represented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1306-7\">as an officer of this Court, in my honest judgment, [that] we will need the witnesses that we have represented we will need. <em>Now, if that is not enough, and the Court feels that I should go on and delineate at great length what our defense is going to be, I shall be pleased to do it. </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1306-10\">With all respect, I am uncertain whether this court rules that (a) although petitioner\u2019s showing of the relevance and materiality of his witnesses may have been sufficient disclosure, denial of transfer was not an abuse of discretion (see Part III); or, (b) that petitioner\u2019s disclosure was insufficient in respects which are not specified. Since I dissent from either view, it is unnecessary for me to consider other issues reached by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-12\">It seems clear from the District Court\u2019s opinion that it struck all of petitioner\u2019s 29 non-character witnesses from consideration because he had not overcome the court\u2019s \u201cdoubt whether these 29 individuals will all be necessary witnesses to matters of relevance for the defense.\u201d If furnishing the names, addresses and occupations of the witnesses together with \u201ca general showing on the materiality of the testimony of most of the witnesses named\u201d is sufficient, and I am inclined to think that it is, I suggest we are bound to remand with directions to apply this view. Platt v. Minnesota Mining &amp; Mfg. Co., 376 U.S. 240, 84 S.Ct. 769 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-13\">Moreover, I think the role of character witnesses is entitled to specific consideration in the balancing process. Of course, a trial court has broad discretion to limit the number of character witnesses that may be called. But I take it as settled that the court cannot prevent the defense from presenting a reasonable number of these witnesses, particularly in a perjury case where this testimony is of unusual importance. In this connection, it is reasonable to consider not only the expense and inconvenience of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1245\">*1245</page-number>transporting character witnesses across the country, but the unavoidable dilution of their testimony which naturally attends trial in a distant location. United States v. Johnson, 323 U.S. 273, 279, 65 S.Ct. 249, 89 L.Ed. 236 (1944) (concurring opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-5\">Finally, I question whether the Government\u2019s claim of countervailing inconvenience is supported by the record. The District Court relied on the Government\u2019s statement that it will call 20 witnesses to prove its case, 13 of whom are District of Columbia residents. But it appears that the presence of all may not be required:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1307-6\">THE COURT: How many witnesses would the Government have?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1307-7\">MR. BITTMAN: Approximately 20, and several of these relate only to documents. Some of the Las Vegas people will have to be called only to put in the vouchers and the checks relating to the First Western transaction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1307-8\">This probably could be disposed of by stipulation. The witnesses have already testified in the Baker case and the exhibits already entered in the Baker case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1307-9\">Another witness would be the Court reporter that transcribed Clifford Jones\u2019 grand jury testimony. The only witness of any length that I believe would testify would be Wayne Brom-ley.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1307-10\">On rebuttal, however, petitioner\u2019s counsel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1307-11\">Now, Mr. Bittman made a reference here to the fact that he had a great many witnesses that he could get through with in a great hurry, those who had formal matters to care for, like the reporter at the Grand Jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1307-3\">That is no problem. I will stipulate with you on that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Autt\">The records you talk about, the checks, I will stipulate with you on that. Sure the checks were issued, no question about it. If that will eliminate the great bulk of your witnesses, fine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1307-15\">About the only witness I heard him mention \u2014 and this comes as no surprise of course \u2014 was Mr. Wayne Brom-ley. I would concede the Government is going to have Mr. Wayne Bromley in connection with this case. If it is transferred, they might have to transport one witness out of the District of Columbia.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1307-16\">In sum, petitioner says he has a large number of California and Nevada residents who will testify; the Government says it has some \u201cLas Vegas people\u201d who will testify together with a number of District of Columbia residents; and the petitioner has offered to stipulate as to formal matters which may eliminate the bulk of the \"Government\u2019s District of Columbia witnesses. Since the District Court did not even mention this proffer in its carefully written effort to strike the \u201cbalance sheet of convenience,\u201d it is conceivable that the court inadvertently overlooked the proffer.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> I would, therefore, remand for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-17\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-18\">On the other hand, if the court believes the disclosure of name, address, occupation and a general showing of materiality is insufficient, I respectfully suggest that there is need to lay down the principles which require more.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-19\">Whatever may be the merit of incorporating the open disclosure contemplated by the civij rules, such a policy has not yet found its way into the criminal process <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and, generally speaking, nei<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1246\">*1246</page-number>ther the prosecutor nor the defendant is required to disclose his case in advance of trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Whether, in order to prevail on a Rule 21 transfer motion, a defendant must disclose the nature of his defense is a question I find exceedingly difficult. On the one hand, it may fairly be argued that frivolous and dilatory transfer requests are deterred by a disclosure requirement.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On the other hand, a disclosure requirement, with its constitutional ramifications,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> raises troublesome problems. A not dissimilar dilemma arose under Rule 17\u2019s requirement of <em>\u201ca </em>satisfactory showing * * * that the presence of the witness is necessary to an adequate defense\u201d before an indigent could obtain a subpoena. See Greenwell v. United States, 115 U.S.App.D.C. 44, 317 F.2d 108 (1963). That rule was amended for the express purpose of obviating these difficulties<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to permit the defendant to make the necessary showing <em>ex parte.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1308-4\">In any event, I do not think the District Court may remain. silent during petitioner\u2019s explicit offers to disclose the nature of his defense,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and then deny the motion because disclosure had not been made. As I have said, the court\u2019s failure to even refer to these proffers in its written opinion allows speculation that they were inadvertently overlooked.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1308-13\">Petitioner is free to subpoena these witnesses to a Washington trial. But exercise of his right to compulsory process carries a price tag estimated at fifteen thousand dollars. Rule 21 seems to me designed to eliminate that type of expense and the resulting inconvenience to the witnesses. I fully agree that we are not at liberty to disturb the District Court\u2019s ruling simply because, had the discretion been ours, we might have exercised it differently. But we have a duty to ensure that the court applied \u201cappropriate criteria\u201d in exercising this discretion. Platt v. Minnesota Mining &amp; Mfg. Co., <em>supra. </em>On the record before us I think that duty requires a remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1305-18\">. In response to the Government\u2019s suggestion that it would not get a fair trial in Nevada \u2014 an argument which Mr. Justice Harlan has ruled \u201cwholly out of bounds,\u201d Platt v. Minnesota Mining &amp; Mfg. Co., 376 U.S. 240, 246, 84 S.Ct. 769 (1964) (concurring opinion) \u2014 petitioner\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1244\">*1244</page-number>counsel made it clear that lie was not insisting on Nevada and that another nearby district, such as Arizona, California or Utah, would substantially ameliorate the inconvenience and expense of a Washington trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1307-12\">. The Government\u2019s opposition in this court, filed on behalf of the District Judge, stated: \u201cAs to the so-called offer to disclose testimony, government counsel does not recall such an offer nor does the opinion of the [district] court mention one.\u201d We are advised that the court reporter who transcribed the argument in the District Court was ill, and the transcript of that argument was not filed until the District Judge had prepared and filed his memorandum opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"avv-dedup-1\">.

This, of course, explains the presence of P.B.I. agents on petitioner\u2019s witness list and I assume that the expense and necessity of summoning witnesses for a suppression hearing, no less than for a trial, is a factor properly to be considered in a transfer motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
