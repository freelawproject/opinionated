He was sentenced to a term of twenty-five years. This court affirmed. United States v. Kanton, 264 F.2d 588 (7th Cir. 1959). Thereafter, Kanton filed a motion to correct the sentence, under Rule 35, Fed.R.Crim.P. and appealed from the judgment denying his motion. This court again affirmed. Kanton v. United States, 345 F.2d 427 (7th Cir. 1965). We rejected Kanton\u2019s contention that his sentence should be reduced to twenty years, the penalty under \u00a7 2113, because the indictment did not charge that the robbery was aggravated, by placing the life of a person in jeopardy, so as to violate 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(d), since the indictment charged only the \u201cviolation of Sec. 2113(a).\u201d We found the words of \u00a7 2113(d) \u201calmost precisely\u201d stated in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-25\">In the \u00a7 2255 petition now before us, Kanton contends that his conviction and sentence of twenty-five years should be set aside on the grounds: (a) that the gun used in the holdup was not itself put in evidence so as to support the charge under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(d), and (b) that he was denied his Fifth and Sixth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>Amendment rights of due process and trial by jury, respectively, because the trial court improperly instructed the jury by failing to explain that the word \u201cjeopardy and not merely putting the victim ally putting the life of a victim in jeopardy and not meredly putting the victim in fear that his life was in jeopardy, and that therefore an essential element of the offense charged was effectually withheld from the jury. He seeks a new trial, or in the alternative, a resentencing of twenty years under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) instead of the twenty-five years under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">This court in the first <em>Kanton </em>appeal settled the first ground adversely to Kanton\u2019s claim, by affirming his conviction on testimony of a victim that in the robbery \u201cone of them\u201d pointed a gun at her and forced her to sit down, and testimony of Kanton\u2019s confederate that Kanton was the \u201cone.\u201d See also Wagner v. United States, 264 F.2d 524 (9th Cir. 1959). There was no necessity of introducing the gun itself. Kanton cites no cases holding that that real evidence is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">Neither Robbins v. United States, 345 F.2d 930 (2d Cir. 1966), nor Wagner v. United States, 264 F.2d 524 (9th Cir. 1959), supports Kanton\u2019s argument that because of the failure to produce the gun, the twenty-five year sentence was rendered invalid, and that that sentence should have been corrected to a twenty year sentence. In <em>Robbins </em>the district attorney in oral argument \u201csuggested\u201d that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding of aggravation. The court said that \u201cunless\u201d there was sufficient evidence the remedy would be a sentence of twenty years. There is no such suggestion by the government here, and we cannot say the evidence is insufficient. In <em>Wagner, </em>264 F.2d at 530 the court made a similar statement, i. e., \u201cif\u201d the evidence was insufficient, the sentence would have to be reduced. Here we think that the testimony of the bank employee and petitioner\u2019s confederate was sufficient. <em>Robbins </em>and <em>Wagner </em>are not pertinent.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\"> There is no merit in the contention that the claimed omission in instructing the jury amounted to withholding from the jury an element of the offense charged. The district court instructed the jury in the language of the statute and accordingly the jury was told technically what the elements were. Better practice would require \u201cspelling out\u201d that the element of aggravation means that the victim\u2019s life was actually in jeopardy, but failure to do so is not necessarily reversible error, Smith v. United States, 284 F.2d 789, 791 (5th Cir. 1960), let alone violation of the right to a jury trial or right to due process. There was no dispute, in the evidence at Kanton\u2019s trial, of the fact that force was used. His defense was alibi. See United States v. Hilbrich, 341 F.2d 555, 559 (7th Cir. 1965). We think the jury could infer from the evidence that the victim\u2019s life was actually in danger.</p>\n<p id=\"A6eO\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
