The validity of the Maine conviction may relate to the question of guilt of the federal charge but it does not affect the legality of petitioner\u2019s being held to answer to the charge. Trial, and not habeas corpus, is the appropriate manner of resolving the issue of guilt of the federal crime and subordinate issues relating to elements of the crime. If the holding in Burgett v. Texas, 389 U.S. 109, 88 S.Ct. 258, 19 L.Ed.2d 319 (1967), has been erroneously applied by respondent that fact can be raised upon appeal from final judgment. An interlocutory ruling upon the question is not an appealable order and we decline to review the question at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"AK0\">Leave to file petition for writ of mandamus is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"AtV\">Viewing the action of respondent as a denial of a writ of habeas corpus, certificate of probable cause is denied,</p>\n<p id=\"Aqh\">These proceedings are dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
