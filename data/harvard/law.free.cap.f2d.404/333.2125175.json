Bell v. United States, N.D.Miss.1966, 265 F.Supp. 311, aff\u2019d 5 Cir., 375 F.2d 763, cert. denied, 389 U.S. 881, 88 S.Ct. 121, 19 L.Ed.2d 175. Petitioner now has a direct appeal from his conviction pending before this Court, and therefore the motion to vacate was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-27\">Petitioner\u2019s motion to correct sentence under Rule 35 is based on the contention that the four year sentence imposed was in excess of the maximum allowable under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1708 for offenses involving stolen mail materials valued at less than $100. Section 1708, however, was amended in 1952 to provide a maximum prison term of five years for the offense, regardless of the monetary value of the stolen item. The amendment being in force at the time of petitioner\u2019s offense and his trial, the motion to correct sentence was also properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-28\">Finally, the denial of petitioner\u2019s request for release on his own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>recognizance pending appeal was a matter vested within the discretion of the trial court, and we cannot conclude that the trial judge abused that discretion in this instance. Should this Court reverse the conviction and order a new trial in petitioner\u2019s direct appeal, he can again seek such relief from the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
