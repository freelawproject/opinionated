Strauss, 5 Cir. 1967, 373 F.2d 691, 643, 644, wherein the Court succinctly stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b949-23\">\u201cThe referee in Bankruptcy has reasonably broad discretion in granting or refusing a discharge to a bankrupt. When the referee\u2019s determination has been approved by the district court, it should not be disturbed on appeal except for the most cogent reasons. Minella v. Phillips, 5 Cir. 1957, 245 F.2d 687, 690.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b949-24\">\u201cBy confirming the referee\u2019s findings the District Court made them his own.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b949-25\">\u201cFed.R.Civ.P. 52(a) precludes reversal on a factual issue unless it is found to be clearly erroneous, Chaney v. City of Galveston, 5 Cir., 1966, 368 F.2d 774. The sole inquiry here, then, is whether the factual issues were resolved erroneously, and clearly so * * * <em>ft</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b949-27\">On this appeal the bankrupt has the burden to demonstrate that the Referee\u2019s \u201cFindings of Fact and Conclusions of Law\u201d were clearly erroneous. He has not sustained this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-28\">Accordingly, the District Court\u2019s order denying the Petition for Review should be and is hereby affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
