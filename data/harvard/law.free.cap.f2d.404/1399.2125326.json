Kohnstamm &amp; Co., Inc.\u2019s application<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to register the trademark DUSTOP for goods described as \u201cAn Oil for Impregnating Dust Cloths and Oil Mops for Use as an Aid in Cleaning,\u201d asserting use since November 12, 1963. Appellant, The Drackett Company, opposed on the ground of likelihood of confusion, based upon its registered trademark ENDUST <footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>for a \u201cDust Absorbing Composition for Application to Dust Mops and Dust Cloths as an Aid in Cleaning,\u201d asserting use since April 25, 1952.</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-26\">Neither party took testimony, the op-poser relying upon a certified copy of its trademark registration and certain advertising material appearing in periodical publications. There was no evidence as to the extent of any use of appellant\u2019s mark, the channels of trade, or the specific nature of appellant\u2019s product. Although both products are cleaning aids for use with dust cloths and mops and thus are presumably of a competitive character, appellee\u2019s product is an oil and appellant\u2019s product is a dust absorbing composition of unspecified consistency. Appellant\u2019s priority of adoption and use are not in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1400\">*1400</page-number>Based on this factual background, the basic issue is whether appellee\u2019s mark DUSTOP so resembles appellant\u2019s registered mark ENDUST as to be likely to cause confusion or mistake as to source when applied to the involved goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-4\">We believe that the board correctly decided there was no likelihood of confusion and properly dismissed the opposition. The board stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1462-5\">The marks \u201cENDUST\u201d and \u201cDUS-TOP\u201d are highly suggestive terms which were obviously adopted to indicate that the products sold thereunder are intended to end or stop dust or dusting. It is well settled that the scope of protection afforded marks of this character must necessarily be narrow, and the opposer, as the prior user and registrant, cannot preclude the registration by others of similarly suggestive but otherwise distinguishable notations or trademarks for similar goods. * * * Accordingly, although the designations \u201cDUSTOP\u201d and \u201cENDUST\u201d may have similar meanings, the differences between them in both sound and appearance are sufficient, in view of the nature of such marks, to obviate any likelihood that purchasers would attribute the goods sold thereunder to the same source.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1462-7\">The board correctly found that appellee\u2019s mark ENDUST does not resemble appellant\u2019s mark DUSTOP and that there is no likelihood that purchasers would attribute the goods sold thereunder to the same source. There is very little resemblance in appearance or sound; the only common feature from this standpoint is the inclusion of the word \u201cdust\u201d in which appellant can have no exclusive right in connection with products for disposing of dust. Concerning resemblance in meaning, appellant argues that \u201cEND and STOP are synonymous terms\u201d and that \u201c[b]oth marks, therefore, have identical meanings, that is, to end or stop dust or dusting.\u201d However, if the marks have any significance as argued by appellant, it must be the highly suggestive meaning found by the board and thus ENDUST is a weak mark which is entitled to only a limited scope of protection. Although ENDUST may not be <em>descriptive </em>in the sense that the product actually <em>ends </em>dust or dusting, the mark <em>is </em>suggestive. The scope of protection afforded such highly suggestive marks is necessarily narrow and confusion is not likely to result from the use of two marks carrying the same suggestion as to the use of closely similar goods.
