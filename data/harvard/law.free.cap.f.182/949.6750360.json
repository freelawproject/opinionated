McPHERSON, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AQu\">In December, 1903, the bankrupt took out a 30-year endowment policy in the Prudential Insurance Company of America for $10,000, payable to herself, or, in the event of her death during the endowment period, to her executors, administrators, or assigns. The application contained the following question and answer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b965-20\">\u201cQ. Do you wish the privilege of changing the beneficiary at any time, if the policy or any interest therein be not then assigned? A. Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b966-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>And the policy contained, inter alia, the following provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b966-3\">\u201cCash Surrender Val\u00fae. \u2014 If this policy he legally surrendered to the company within three months from the end of the second year from its date or of any year thereafter, and- all premiums, required by the terms of the policy, to the end of that year have been .paid in full, the company will pay, therefor the sum indicated by the following table.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">' In this- table a column shows the cash surrender value of the policy at the end of each year.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b966-5\">\u201cChange of Beneficiary. \u2014 -The insured may at any time while this policy is in force, .by written notice to the company at its home office,. change the beneficiary or beneficiaries under this policy, such change to take effect only upon indorsement of the-same on the policy by the company, whereupon all rights of .the former benefiqiary or beneficiaries shall cease; provided, however, that no such change of beneficiary shall be valid if the policy or any interest therein be assigned at the time of such change.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b966-6\">\u201cAssignments. \u2014 If this policy shall be assigned; the assignment must be in writing, and the company shall not be deemed to have knowledge of such assignment unless the original or a duplicate thereof is filed at the home office of the company and its receipt duly aclmowledged. The company will not assume any responsibility for the validity of an assignment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b966-7\">On July.28, 1908,-the insured.signed the .following paper:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b966-8\">\u201cRequest for Amendment of Ordinary Policy Contract.

Dolan, and Joseph Dolan, beneficiaries,- children-of the insured, share and share alike,, or1 .to the survivors or survivor, if any, otherwise unto the executors, administrators .or assigns of the insured.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b966-16\">\u25a0 In March, 1910, when, the adjudication was entered, the'policy had a cash surrender value of $798.92, and this sum1 is claimed by the trustee and also by the persons that were named as beneficiaries in the foregoing papers. The insured is still living. The\u2019 referee (Al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>fred Driver, Esq.) sustained the trustee\u2019s contention and made an appropriate order.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-3\">I agree with the referee\u2019s conclusion and direct that his order be affirmed. It is sought to avoid the effect of the writings \u2014 which are clearly a mere change of beneficiary and not an assignment \u2014 by the testimony of the bankrupt and an agent of the company to the effect that the bankrupt intended to assign the policy and supposed that she was carrying out such intention. It- is enough to say of this attempt that it has not been successful. In my opinion the meaning of the writings is plain and unambiguous. If they are open to attack at all, they have not been overthrown by the testimony. They contain no trace of an intention to assign, and- the provisions of the policy concerning assignments were not complied with. Taking all the evidence together, the writings themselves and the testimony, I find as a fact \u2014 agreeing with the .referee in this respect \u2014 that in July, 1908, the bankrupt did just what she then intended to do, namely, to change the beneficiary. Of course, under the terms of the policy, she was still at liberty to change the beneficiary again and as often as she pleased, and this was the situation when she was proceeded against in bankruptcy. The policy was therefore property which she could have transferred prior to the filing of the petition (Act July 1, 1898, c. 541, section <em>70a(5), </em>30' stat. 565 [U. S. Comp. St. 1901, p. 3451]) and passed to the trustee. A recent decision supporting this conclusion is In re Orear (C. C. A.) 178 Fed. 632.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-4\">The order of the referee is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
