J.\n </judges>\n <opinion>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Orange County District Attorney brought an action for civil penalties under this state's unfair competition law (UCL; Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17200 ) and fair advertising law (FAL;\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   ., \u00a7 17500) against an employer. The action alleged the employer violated workplace safety standards established by the state occupational safety and health law (Cal/OSHA; Lab. Code, \u00a7 6300 et seq. ) and attendant regulations. The employer contended, and the Court of Appeal\n   concluded, that the district attorney's action was preempted by the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (federal OSH Act;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20651\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 651\n   </extracted-citation>\n   et seq. ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   For the reasons set forth below, we conclude that the federal act does not preempt unfair competition and consumer protection claims based on workplace safety and health violations when, as in California, there is a state plan approved by the federal Secretary of Labor. The district attorney's use of UCL and FAL causes of action does not encroach on a field fully occupied by federal law, nor does it stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment of the federal objective of ensuring a nationwide minimum standard of workplace protection. In addition, the federal act's structure and language do not reflect a clear purpose of Congress to preempt such claims. Therefore, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

In 2007, it installed at the facility an electric water heater that was designed for\n   residential use. In March 2009, the water heater exploded, killing two employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Division of Occupational Safety and Health\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   investigated and \"determined the explosion had been caused by a failed safety valve and the lack of 'any other suitable safety features on the heater' due to 'manipulation and misuse.' \" In an administrative proceeding, the agency charged Solus with five violations of state occupational safety and health regulations. ( Cal. Code Regs., tit. 8, \u00a7 467, subd. (a) [failure to provide a proper safety valve];\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   ., \u00a7 3328, subds. (a) [permitting unsafe operation of machinery and equipment], (b) [improper maintenance of machinery and equipment], (f) [failing to use good engineering practices], (h) [permitting unqualified and untrained personnel to operate and maintain machinery and equipment].) The Division also cited Solus with a willful violation for failing to maintain the water heater in a safe condition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In addition, because two employees had died and there was evidence of violations of law, the Division forwarded the investigation results to the District Attorney of Orange County. (See Lab. Code, \u00a7 6315, subd. (g).) In March 2012, the district attorney filed criminal charges against Solus's\n   plant manager and its maintenance supervisor for felony violations of Labor Code section 6425, subdivision (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The district attorney also filed the present civil action against Solus. The complaint alleged four causes of action, \"all based on the same worker health and safety standards placed at issue in the administrative proceedings.\" Only two of the causes of action are at issue here. One \"allege[d] that Solus's failure to comply with workplace safety standards amount[ed] to an unlawful, unfair and fraudulent business practice under Business and Professions Code section 17200, and the district attorney request[ed] imposition of civil penalties as a consequence of that practice, in the amount of up to $2,500 per day, per employee, for the period from November 29, 2007, through March 19, 2009.\" The second was a claim that Solus \"made numerous false and misleading representations concerning its commitment to workplace safety and its compliance with all applicable workplace safety standards, and as a result of those false and misleading statements, Solus was allegedly able to retain employees and customers in violation of Business and Professions Code section 17500.\" The district attorney requested imposition of civil penalties in the same amount for the same period.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Solus demurred on the ground that the two causes of action were preempted by the federal OSH Act. (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20651\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 651\n   </extracted-citation>\n   et seq. ) The trial court overruled the demurrer. Solus challenged the order and the Court of Appeal summarily denied Solus's petition for writ of mandate. This court granted the petition for review filed by the district attorney and transferred the matter back to the Court of Appeal with directions to issue an order to show cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Court of Appeal issued its order to show cause and concluded that the federal OSH Act preempted the district attorney's UCL and FAL claims. Its conclusion was based in part on a misapprehension concerning the date that unfair competition penalty provisions were enacted compared with the date the federal Secretary of Labor approved California's occupational safety and\n   health plan. This court granted review and transferred the matter back to the Court of Appeal for reconsideration in light of former\n   section 3370.1 of the Civil Code, a provision enacted in 1972. As the Court of Appeal acknowledged in its second opinion, this statute, which provided penalties for unfair competition, \"was in effect when California's plan was approved\" by the federal Secretary of Labor. The Court of Appeal nonetheless concluded that the UCL and FAL claims were preempted by the federal statute. In its view, federal law preempted any state occupational safety and health standard or method of enforcing such a standard that did not appear in the California occupational safety and health plan submitted to and approved by the federal Secretary of Labor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   This court granted the district attorney's petition for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Discussion\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    The Court of Appeal held that the UCL and FAL claims are preempted by the federal OSH Act both expressly and through application of the principles of implied preemption. It concluded that Congress has essentially occupied the entire field of workplace safety regulation and enforcement other than workers' compensation and the precise provisions of an approved state plan. It reasoned that \"[b]ecause the [federal] OSH Act allows a state to avoid\n    federal preemption only if it obtains federal approval of its own plan, it necessarily follows that a state has no authority to enact and enforce laws governing workplace safety which fall outside of that approved plan.\" In its view, the district attorney's use of UCL and FAL actions based upon violations of approved Cal/OSHA standards was an attempt to govern workplace safety without securing approval by the federal Secretary of Labor.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    As the Court of Appeal observed, the federal OSH Act expressly states what is\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    preempted-state laws governing workers' compensation, a broad category of statutory and common law actions touching on worker safety, and any occupational safety or health issue as to which there is no federal standard.

As the Court of Appeal's analysis further reflects, the federal OSH Act does not expressly describe what state regulation\n    <em>\n     is\n    </em>\n    preempted. This omission does not preclude a finding of explicit preemption; as Justice Kennedy noted in\n    <em>\n     Gade,\n    </em>\n    the high court has \"never required any particular magic words\" to establish express preemption. (\n    <em>\n     Gade, supra\n    </em>\n    , 505 U.S. at p. 112,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1481203\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/88/#p92\">\n     112 S.Ct. 2374\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .) But as illustrated by Justice Kennedy's concurring opinion, when a court attempts to discern from a statutory scheme the expression of an intent to displace state law, the analysis may be substantially similar to an implied preemption analysis.

Finally, even if\n    any new enforcement method that is related to an existing approved standard should be submitted to the Secretary-a question we need not answer-it does not follow that the new method is preempted until approved.

That provision disclaims any intent to interfere with state law in a broad domain affecting occupational safety and health, whether or not there is an approved state plan. Specifically, notwithstanding the existence of federal standards, not only are state workers' compensation actions not preempted, but state tort claims and criminal prosecutions also survive, although they may be based on duties established by state occupational safety and health standards.

As explained below, under state law, actions under the UCL or FAL are not considered to be a means of enforcing the law claimed to have been violated; rather, they provide a remedy for economic damage suffered as a result of violations of a wide array of other laws. Furthermore, to the extent these claims may be a considered an enforcement mechanism with respect to the state plan's substantive standards, these claims merely supplement enforcement of state standards.

( Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 25249.5 et seq. ; 62 F.R. \u00a7 31159-01.) In addition to adopting the substantive standards of Proposition 65, \"the Cal/OSHA standard incorporate[d] the enforcement mechanism of Proposition 65, which provides for supplemental judicial enforcement by allowing the State Attorney General, district attorneys, city attorneys, city prosecutors, or 'any person in the public interest' to file civil lawsuits against alleged violators.\" (62 Fed.Reg.,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , at p. 31161.) Some comments regarding the proposed Standard contended that Proposition 65's private right of action violated the federal requirement that an agency be designated to enforce the state plan. The Board's decision noted that \"[i]f a State standard is not identical to Federal standards, the State standard (and its enforcement) must be at least as effective as the comparable Federal standard.\" (62 Fed.Reg,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , at p. 31160.) It also observed, \"Although [the\n    federal OSH Act] does not authorize private enforcement, OSHA State plans do not operate under a delegation of Federal authority but under a system which allows them to enact and enforce their own laws and standards under State authority. Therefore, nothing in the Act prevents States with approved plans from legislating such a supplemental private right of action in their own programs.... [\u00b6] In the case of Proposition 65, private enforcement is supplemental to, not a substitute for, enforcement by Cal/OSHA.

Finally, the federal OSH Act allows a state with an approved plan to implement modifications or additions without prior approval of the plan change by Federal OSHA.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    In the absence of a clear and manifest congressional purpose to preempt claims such as the UCL and FAL claims asserted in this action, such claims are encompassed in the presumption against preemption that arises upon a state's assumption of responsibility under the federal OSH Act to regulate worker safety and health.

In the\n     <em>\n      Industrial Truck Ass'n\n     </em>\n     case, unlike here, it was undisputed that the challenged regulations themselves constituted occupational safety and health standards, and that there were inconsistent federal standards on the same issue; that case did not present a situation implicating mere additional enforcement measures for existing, approved standards. Moreover, as the Ninth Circuit recognized, \"[a]n agency's interpretation of the preemptive effect of its regulations is entitled to deference where Congress has delegated authority to the agency, the agency's interpretation is not contrary to a statute, and agency expertise is important to determining preemption.\" (\n     <em>\n      Id\n     </em>\n     . at p. 1311.) In light of this principle, the Ninth Circuit should have given deference to the federal Department of Labor's decision approving California's incorporation of provisions from Proposition 65 into a standard under the state plan. (62 Fed.Reg,\n     <em>\n      supra\n     </em>\n     .) As noted above, that decision reflects the federal agency's view that a state may modify its enforcement mechanisms without prior federal approval. (62 Fed.Reg., supra, at p. 31165.) Proper consideration of the federal Department's decision would have led to a narrower reading of the federal OSH Act's preemptive effect.
