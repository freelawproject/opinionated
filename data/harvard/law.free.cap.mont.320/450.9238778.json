Did the District Court correctly find that Alexander\u2019s complaint alleged property damage?</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">\u00b68 Alexander was insured under a Commercial General Liability (CGL) policy issued by Generali from April 4,1999, to April 4,2000. In addition to this policy, Alexander also carried a Products Completed Operations Hazard (PCOH) policy. Each policy had separate limits. \u00b69 The CGL policy stated, under Coverage A, that: \u201cWe [Generali] will pay those sums that the insured [Alexander] becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of \u2018bodily injury\u2019 or \u2018property damage\u2019 to which this insurance applies. We will have the right and duty to defend the insured against any \u2018suit\u2019 seeking those damages. However, we will have no duty to defend the insured against any \u2018suit\u2019 seeking damages for \u2018bodily injury\u2019 or \u2018property damage\u2019 to which this insurance does not apply.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">\u00b610 Property damage under the CGL policy was defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-10\">(a) Physical injury to tangible property, including all resulting loss of use of that property. All such loss of use shall be deemed to occur at the time of the physical injury that caused it;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-11\">or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-12\">(b) Loss of use of tangible property that is not physically injured. All such loss of use shall be deemed to occur at the time of the \u201coccurrence\u201d that caused it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-13\">\u00b611 Although not delineated as a separate policy, the PCOH policy for which Alexander paid separate premiums, was separately defined as including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-14\">[A]ll \u201cbodily injury\u201d and \u201cproperty damage\u201d occurring away from premises you own or rent and arising out of \u201cyour product\u201d or \u201cyour work\u201d except:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-15\">(2) Work that has not yet been completed or abandoned. However, \u201cyour work\u201d will be deemed completed at the earliest of the following times:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-16\">(a) When all of the work called for in your contract has been completed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>(c) When that part of the work done at a job site has been put to its intended use by any person or organization other than another contractor or subcontractor working on the same project.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-4\">Work that may need service, maintenance, correction, repair or replacement, but which is otherwise complete, will be treated as completed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">\u00b612 Kenneth J. Hansen and Nancy C. Hansen (the Hansens) sought a proposal from Alexander for plumbing work on heating the hot pools in their building addition at the Lolo Hot Springs Motel. In their complaint against Alexander, the Hansens alleged in pertinent part that Alexander failed to provide a plumbing and heating system that would perform as he represented.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">\u00b613 Under the terms of his CGL policy, Alexander submitted a claim to Generali, requesting Generali to defend and indemnify against the Hansens\u2019 complaint. Generali then filed a motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">\u00b614 The District Court found that although the Hansens had suffered physical property damage, the exclusions under Alexander\u2019s CGL policy did defeat applicable coverage. Hence, Generali had no duty to defend Alexander. In its findings, the District Court did not rule on the coverage applicable to the Hansens\u2019 claim of fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">\u00b615 Alexander now appeals the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">\u00b616 Additional facts will be discussed as they become applicable in the following analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-10\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b475-11\">\u00b617 We review a district court\u2019s grant or denial of a motion for summary judgment <em>de novo. Cole ex rel. Cole Revocable Trust v. Cole, </em>2003 MT 229, \u00b6 8, 317 Mont. 197, \u00b6 8, 75 P.3d 1280, \u00b6 8. The movant must prove that no genuine issues of material fact exist. Once the movant demonstrates this, the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to prove that a genuine issue of material fact does exist. After a district court determines that no genuine issues of material fact exist, the district court must then determine whether the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Cole, </em>\u00b6 8. We review a district court\u2019s legal conclusions for correctness. <em>Cole, </em>\u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-12\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b475-13\">\u00b618 1. Did the District Court err in finding that Generali did not have a duty to defend Alexander based on Alexander\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>general liability coverage?</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">\u00b619 Alexander argues that although the Hansens did not allege \u201cproperty damage\u201d in their complaint, the Hansens advanced claims of property damage as those words are commonly understood and defined under Alexander\u2019s policy. Specifically, Alexander argues that because the heating systems he installed are \u201cintegral to the real property as a whole and are alleged to function in such a way as to materially alter the building and render the building and pools unsafe for occupation,\u201d-i.e., in their complaint, the Hansens claimed lost profits resulting from their inability to use the buildings and the hot pools because of inadequate heat and water-damage from the system\u2019s malfunction constitutes physical property damage. Hence, the Hansens claimed lost profits \u201cstem from the physical impairment to the real property, and thus, are covered under [Alexander\u2019s] [p]olicy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">\u00b620 Generali contends that the allegations in the Hansens\u2019 complaint do not \u201ctrigger\u201d the coverage Alexander claims here, as the Hansens sought damages for lost profits. As such, Generali had no duty to defend or indemnify Alexander because Alexander\u2019s policy coverage did not apply. In addition, Generali contends that because it charged Alexander only one premium, which covered his entire policy, the damage to the Hansens\u2019 property from PCOH comes within Coverage A of Alexander\u2019s CGL policy. Further, Generali contends that unless specifically excluded, the property damage alleged by the Hansens must have been caused by an \u201coccurrence\u201d which took place during the policy period. Such occurrence, Generali contends, did not take place.</p>\n<p id=\"AX1\">\u00b621  In determining whether coverage under an insurance policy exists, it becomes necessary first to examine whether the allegations contained within the complaint set forth facts that bring the event within the insurance policy provisions. <em>Graber v. State Farm Fire and Cas. Co. </em>(1990), 244 Mont. 265, 270, 797 P.2d 214, 217.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">\u00b622 The Hansens alleged in their complaint specifically that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-7\">[A]s a result of Defendants [Alexander] failure and refusal to provide Plaintiffs [the Hansens] with a heating and plumbing system that could perform the functions Defendant Alexander represented and promised that it could do, which failure constitutes breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of fitness for use, or both, all of the work performed by Defendants was rendered useless, and Plaintiffs have been damaged in the full amount of the sums paid by Plaintiffs to Defendants, which Plaintiffs allege to be at least $25,788.00. Plaintiffs are entitled to a full refund of the sums paid to Defendants.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>\u00b623 Alexander\u2019s CGL policy states that Generali is obligated to provide coverage \u201cfor those sums that the insured [Alexander] becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of... \u2018property damage\u2019 to which this insurance applies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">\u00b624 Property damages is defined under the CGL policy as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-5\">(a) Physical injury to tangible property, including all resulting loss of use of that property. All such loss of use shall be deemed to occur at the time of the physical injury that caused it;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-6\">or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-7\">(b) Loss of use of tangible property that is not physically injured. All such loss of use shall be deemed to occur at the time of the \u201coccurrence\u201d that caused it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">\u00b625  As the above-quoted complaint language shows, the Hansens allege that due to Alexander\u2019s breaches, they were \u201cdamage[d] in the full amount of the sums paid\u201d by them to Alexander-an amount totaling $25,788. The Hansens seek compensation for these lost payments and not for physical injury to their property, nor for loss of use of that property.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">\u00b626 Therefore, we hold that Generali had no duty to defend nor a duty to indemnify Alexander under Alexander\u2019s CGL policy, as the Hansens did not seek compensation for property damage as that term was defined under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-10\">\u00b627 2. Did the District Court err in concluding that Alexander\u2019s general liability policy excluded coverage under the Products Completed Operations Hazard coverage he also carried?</p>\n<p id=\"b477-11\">\u00b628 Alexander argues that because his PCOH policy carries its own limit and has its own definition, it operates as coverage for a separate risk not included in his CGL policy or in any CGL exclusion thereby. As such, under the \u201creasonable expectations\u201d doctrine, Alexander asserts that if Generali \u201cpurports to assume the risk of property for which [Alexander] could he held liable, through two separate policy limits of coverage, and then works to completely avoid the risk through exclusions, then the risk was not just limited, it was never assumed at all.\u201d Hence, in effect, Alexander argues that he \u201cpaid premiums for a risk that was illusory.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b477-12\">\u00b629 Generali contends that the exclusions listed under Coverage A of Alexander\u2019s CGL policy precludes coverage, as PCOH \u201cdo not have their own Insuring Agreement and Exclusions.\u201d In addition, Generali contends that the Hansens\u2019 complaint indicates that Alexander did not complete his work, thereby not bringing him within the definition of PCOH.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>\u00b630  We have held that \u201c[expectations which are contrary to a clear exclusion from coverage are not \u2018objectively reasonable,\u2019 \u201d although the \u201creasonable expectations doctrine\u201d does not apply in situations \u201cwhere clear policy language excluded the coverage.\u201d <em>Wellcome v. Home Ins. Co. </em>(1993), 257 Mont. 354, 359, 849 P.2d 190, 194. We enforce the terms of an insurance policy as written. <em>Brabeck v. Employers Mut. Cas. Co., </em>2000 MT 373, \u00b6 12, 303 Mont. 468, \u00b6 12, 16 P.3d 355, \u00b6 12. \u00b631 Specifically, the Hansens\u2019 complaint states in pertinent part that: \u201cDespite repeated requests by Plaintiffs that Defendants complete the project, and despite repeated promises by Defendant Alexander that he would do so, Defendants never completed the work agreed....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">\u00b632 As PCOH is defined, work is completed and thereby triggers coverage under PCOH when: (1) all of the work contracted for is completed; or (2) part of the work completed has been put to its intended use, with the qualification that work which \u201cmay need service, maintenance, correction, repair or replacement, but which is otherwise complete, will be treated as completed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">\u00b633 Here, the Hansens alleged in their complaint that Alexander never completed the work for which he was hired to do. Specifically, they alleged: (1) that \u201cin a number of instances they were billed by Defendants for materials that were never installed, are of no use to Plaintiffs, and, in some cases, cannot be found;\u201d (2) that \u201cDefendant Alexander caused his company to bill Plaintiffs for labor not actually performed upon Plaintiffs\u2019 project;\u201d and (3) that \u201c[ajfter Defendants ceased working... Plaintiffs learned from a representative of Mountain Supply Company that the system which Defendant Alexander had \u2018sold\u2019 to Plaintiffs was wholly inadequate for the purpose intended....\u201d \u00b634 As we held in <em>Wellcome, </em>the reasonable expectations doctrine is not applicable where the policy language excludes such coverage. Here, under the PCOH language, Alexander did not \u201cotherwise complete\u201d the work for which the Hansens hired him to do, as materials were never installed, labor was never performed, and the system that was installed was inadequate for the Hansens\u2019 intended purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">\u00b635  Therefore, regardless of reaching the question of whether PCOH constitutes its own policy, we hold that PCOH coverage is not applicable on the facts presented here. Alexander did not complete his work, and hence did not trigger PCOH coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">\u00b636 3. Did the District Court err in failing to find that Alexander\u2019s claims for fraud were not specifically excluded from his general liability coverage?</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">\u00b637 Alexander argues that the CGL policy coverage did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>\"specifically exclude the fraudulent actions of Alexander as alleged in [the Hansens\u2019] complaint.\u201d He argues that the page of the policy explaining the fraud exclusion did not include a listing of the CGL, as did other policy endorsements, namely the asbestos exclusion and the lead exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">\u00b638 Generali contends that, as the District Court found, \u201cthe acts or omissions complained of by [the] Hansens were excluded by the [CGL] policy.\u201d As such, \u201cwithout a covered \u2018occurrence\u2019 or \u2018property damage,\u2019 no coverage existed....\u201d In addition, Generali argues that the first page of the CGL policy \u201cclearly and unequivocally\u201d includes a section stating that Generali will not pay for loss in a case of fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">\u00b639 We have held that we interpret \u201can insurance policy\u2019s terms according to their usual, common sense meaning as viewed by a reasonable insured.\u201d <em>Brabeck, </em>\u00b6 12. In addition, we \u201cinterpret any doubts in coverage strictly against the insurer,\u201d but we do not engage in this interpretation \u201cwhere the policy\u2019s terms are not ambiguous,\u201d as we will not rewrite the terms of a policy, and will instead enforce the terms as written. <em>Brabeck, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">\u00b640 Here, the CGL policy states on the first page, \u201cForms applicable to all Coverage Parts.\u201d This section contains endorsements which the policy does not cover. One such endorsement is entitled \u201cMontana Changes - Concealment, Misrepresentation or Fraud,\u201d and states the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-7\">We [Generali] will not pay for loss (\u201closs\u201d) or damage in a case of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-8\">1. Concealment or misrepresentation of a material fact; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-9\">2. Fraud committed by you or any other insured (\u201cinsured\u201d), whether before or after the loss (\u201closs\u201d) and relating to coverage of the loss (\u201closs\u201d) under this policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-10\">\u00b641  We conclude that the District Court\u2019s ultimate conclusion that the acts and omissions complained of by the Hansens were excluded by the CGL policy is correct, as both the policy language and the exclusions contained therein are clear and explicit.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-11\">\u00b642 4. Did the District Court correctly find that Alexander\u2019s complaint alleged property damage?</p>\n<p id=\"b479-12\">\u00b643 Because we hold that the District Court did not err in granting summary judgment to Generali, we do not address Generali\u2019s cross appeal here.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-13\">\u00b644 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b479-14\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES REGNIER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b479-15\">Justice Jim Rice</author>\n<p id=\"Aq0\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>\u00b645 I concur with the Court on all issues but would resolve Issue 1 under the rationale set forth by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">\u00b646 Hansens\u2019 complaint alleged that \u201call of the work performed by [Alexander] was rendered useless\u201d because of Alexander\u2019s faulty installation of the plumbing system. Section V(15) of the CGL policy broadly defines \u201cproperty damage\u201d to include \u201c[l]oss of use of tangible property that is not physically injured.\u201d I would conclude that Hansens\u2019 claim fell within this definition. However, though qualifying under that definition, the claim was nonetheless removed from coverage under Section I, Coverage A(2)(m), which provides that \u201cinsurance does not apply to\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-5\">Damage to Impaired Property or Property Not Physically Injured</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-6\">\u201cProperty damage\u201d to \u201cimpaired property\u201d or property that has not been physically injured, arising out of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-7\">(1) A defect, deficiency, inadequacy or dangerous condition in \u201cyour product\u201d or \u201cyour work\u201d; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-8\">(2) A delay or failure by you or anyone acting on your behalf to perform a contract or agreement in accordance with its terms.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">The policy here narrowed the coverage for \u201cproperty damage\u201d involving property not physically impaired by excluding coverages for alleged defective conditions in Alexander\u2019s work product and for any alleged failure by Alexander to perform as agreed in regard to such property. These definitions include Hansens\u2019 claim in regard to the plumbing system.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-10\">\u00b647 I concur in affirming the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
