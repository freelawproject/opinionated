In granting summary judgment, the District Court ruled, as a matter of law, that Senate Bill 258, Senate Bill 445 and Senate Joint Resolution 23 are \u201cunconstitutional and of no force and effect.\u201d We affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-9\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b38-10\">\u00b62 As noted by the District Court, there are no disputed facts. The only issues are legal issues. The factual background is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b38-11\">\u00b63 Plaintiffs Mike Wheat, Jon Tester, and Ken Hansen (the \u201cSenators\u201d) are members of the Montana Senate who were elected to office in 2002, for terms to run from January 1, 2003, through December 31, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-12\">\u00b64 Defendant Bob Brown is Secretary of State for the State of Montana. His primary responsibility is maintaining the official public records for the State of Montana and for conducting elections.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-13\">\u00b65 The complaint in this case arises out of the 2003 redistricting of the State of Montana into one hundred House districts and fifty Senate districts for election of the state Legislature. Specifically, the case below involves the assignment of \u201choldover senators\u201d who were elected under the old districting system, but need to be assigned to redrawn districts under the new system. Senators Wheat, Tester, and Hansen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>are three of the six senators whose district assignment by the Legislature differs from the Commission\u2019s assignment, as more fully explained below.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">\u00b66 Montana\u2019s legislative districts are determined after each federal census. A Districting and Apportionment Commission (Commission) is appointed according to the terms of Article V, Section 14, of the Montana Constitution. Once the Commission is formed, it must prepare a plan for redistricting and submit that plan to the Legislature during its regular session. The Legislature then has thirty days to make recommendations and return the plan to the Commission. Within thirty days after receiving the Legislature\u2019s recommendations, the Commission must file its plan with the Secretary of State, and the plan becomes law.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">\u00b67 A federal census was conducted in 2000. As required by the Montana Constitution, the legislative leadership appointed four members to the Commission, and because those members did not timely select a fifth member, the fifth member was appointed by the Montana Supreme Court. The Commission submitted its final plan to the Secretary of State on February 5, 2003. The Commission\u2019s submission to the Secretary of State included assignments of \u201choldover senators\u201d to the newly-redrawn Senate districts.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">\u00b68 The term \u201choldover senator\u201d refers to those state senators who have served two years of their four-year terms at the time of redistricting, and are, therefore, not required to seek election at the general election held immediately following the districting plan becoming law. After each ten-year redistricting, twenty-five holdover senators must be assigned to newly-redrawn districts, where the holdover senators serve the final two years of their terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">\u00b69 After the 2000 census, the Commission submitted its 2003 plan, along with proposed holdover senator assignments, to the Legislature for its \u201crecommendations.\u201d In response, the Legislature passed \u00a7 5-1-116, MCA (also known as Senate Bill 258). Section 5-1-116, MCA, provides in relevant part that \u201c[i]n the session in which the legislative redistricting plan is submitted to the legislature for recommendations, the legislature, by joint resolution, shall assign holdover senators to districts for the remainder of those senators\u2019 terms.\u201d The statute further provides that \u201c[t]he districting and apportionment commission may not assign holdover senators to districts for the remainder of those senators\u2019 terms.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">\u00b610 On April 9,2003, Governor Martz signed into law Senate Bill 445, which provides in relevant part that \u201cSection 3 of the districting and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>apportionment plan of 2003, the transition provision assigning holdover senators to new legislative districts, is repealed.\u201d On April 20, 2003, the Legislature filed with the Secretary of State Senate Joint Resolution 23, a joint resolution that had been approved by both houses, assigning holdover senators to the newly-drawn Senate districts.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">\u00b611 The Commission\u2019s holdover assignments differ from the Legislature\u2019s with respect to six of the twenty-five holdover senators, affecting eleven districts. The differences are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">Name of Senator Commission Legislature\u2019s Assignment Assignment</p>\n<p id=\"AD\">Jon Tester SD 15 SD 17</p>\n<p id=\"A5\">Ken Hansen SD 17 SD 16</p>\n<p id=\"AJ\">Brent Cromley SD 25 SD 26</p>\n<p id=\"Aql\">John Bohlinger SD 28 SD 27</p>\n<p id=\"AM7\">Mike Wheat SD 32 SD 33</p>\n<p id=\"Al\">Sherm Anderson SD 42 SD 43</p>\n<p id=\"b40-13\">\u00b612 Commencing January 26, 2004, candidates for seats in the Montana Senate could file a declaration for nomination to run in the primary election. March 25, 2004, is the last day candidates for seats in the Montana Senate may file a declaration for the nomination to run in the primary election, and the statewide primary for the Montana Senate is June 8, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-14\">Issue Presented</p>\n<p id=\"b40-15\">\u00b613 Does the task of legislative redistricting, as constitutionally assigned to the Montana Districting and Apportionment Commission, Article V, Section 14, of the Montana Constitution, include assigning \u201choldover\u201d senators to districts under a new redistricting plan? Stated alternatively, does the Montana Constitution prohibit the Montana Legislature from enacting legislation establishing a procedure for assigning \u201choldover\u201d senators to newly-drawn districts?</p>\n<p id=\"b40-16\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b40-17\">\u00b614 The applicable standard of review in appeals from summary judgment is de novo. <em>Danelson v. Robinson, </em>2003 MT 271, \u00b6 11, 317 Mont. 462, \u00b6 11, 77 P.3d 1010, \u00b6 11. When reviewing a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, this Court applies the same evaluation as the district court under Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P. <em>Danelson, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>\u00b615  As legislative enactments, \u00a7 5-1-116, MCA, Senate Bill 445 and Senate Joint Resolution 23 are presumed constitutional, <em>Merlin Myers Revocable Trust v. Yellowstone County, </em>2002 MT 201, \u00b6 21, 311 Mont. 194, \u00b6 21,53 P.3d 1268, \u00b6 21, and the party challenging the statute has the burden of establishing its unconstitutionality. <em>Harper v. Greely </em>(1988), 234 Mont. 259, 269, 763 P.2d 650, 656.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">\u00b616 We start the analysis with a review of Article V, Section 14,1972 Montana Constitution, which provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-6\">(1) The state shall be divided into as many districts as there are members of the house, and each district shall elect one representative. Each senate district shall be composed of two adjoining house districts, and shall elect one senator. Each district shall consist of compact and contiguous territory. All districts shall be as nearly equal in population as is practicable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-7\">(2) In the legislative session following ratification of this constitution and thereafter in each session preceding each federal population census, a commission of five citizens, none of whom may be public officials, shall be selected to prepare a plan for redistricting and reapportioning the state into legislative districts and a plan for redistricting the state into congressional districts. The majority and minority leaders of each house shall each designate one commissioner. Within 20 days after their designation, the four commissioners shall select the fifth member, who shall serve as chairman of the commission. If the four members fail to select the fifth member within the time prescribed, a majority of the supreme court shall select him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-8\">(3) Within 90 days after the official final decennial census figures are available, the commission shall file its final plan for congressional districts with the secretary of state and it shall become law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-9\">(4) The commission shall submit its plan for legislative districts to the legislature at the first regular session after its appointment or after the census figures are available. Within 30 days after submission, the legislature shall return the plan to the commission with its recommendations. Within 30 days thereafter, the commission shall file its final plan for legislative districts with the secretary of state and it shall become law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-10\">(5) Upon filing both plans, the commission is then dissolved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AL\">\u00b617 The language of the Constitution clearly assigns the Commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>the responsibility for redistricting, after receiving \u201crecommendations\u201d from the Legislature. The Constitution requires the Commission to develop and submit a \u201cplan for legislative districts.\u201d The Senators contend that no plan for redistricting could possibly be complete without identifying the correspondence between the new districts and the old districts. Having reviewed the text and history of Article V, Section 14, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">History of Article V. Section 4 at the Constitutional Convention</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">\u00b618 Recognizing that the text of Article V, Section 14, of the Montana Constitution does not specifically mention \u201choldover\u201d senators, we look to the transcripts of the constitutional convention relating to the adoption of this provision. The rule is well established that, in construction of a constitution, recourse may be had to proceedings of the constitutional convention. <em>School Dist. No. 12, Phillips County v. Hughes </em>(1976), 170 Mont. 267, 272, 552 P.2d 328, 331.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">\u00b619 In 1972, the Constitutional Convention delegates were keenly aware that political differences had stymied most legislative attempts to redistrict. This state of affairs was recognized in the legislative committee\u2019s proposal, introduced by Delegate Skari, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-7\">The Montana experience was that in 1965 the Legislature was unable to reapportion. About a dozen bills were introduced, and not a single one was accepted. Consequently, it fell to the federal District Court to reapportion the state. In 1971 the Legislature drew up one plan which was invalid because of a 37 percent variance. After working through the regular session [and] one special session, the Legislature finally came up with the present plan in the second special session ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">Mont. Const. Conv. Tr., Vol. IV at 682.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-9\">\u00b620 In response to this untenable situation, the Constitutional Convention assigned the duty of redistricting to a separate body, the Montana Districting and Apportionment Commission. Noting the conflict of interest inherent in having the Legislature redistrict itself, Delegate Skari explained the purpose behind the Commission as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-10\">The majority report recommends the establishment of a commission on reapportionment and redistricting which would initiate a reapportionment and redistricting plan which would essentially-which would be appointed by the legislative leadership but would be somewhat independent and autonomous. <em>It would, in effect, bypass the Legislature from this point on.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ADN\">Mont. Const. Conv. Tr., Vol. IV at 682 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>\u00b621 In recognition of the inherent difficulties in having the legislators redistrict, Delegate Blend stated: \u201cI do not think that the Legislature is psychologically fitted to reapportion itself. I think it\u2019s too lengthy a program for them to undertake for something that should be accomplished by a nonpartisan, or at least impartial group.\u201d Mont. Const. Conv. Tr., Vol. IV at 685. In a similar vein, Delegate Sch\u00fctz observed that, \u201cthe Legislature is totally unable to reapportion itself. It has too many interests that are not necessarily in accord with the broad interests of the state, and this kind of a commission would do it.\u201d Mont. Const. Conv. Tr., Vol. IV at 720.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">\u00b622 With the advent of single-member districts and residency requirements, it was anticipated that the redistricting would become even more thorny in the future. Mont. Const. Conv. Tr., Vol. IV at 682 (Delegate Skari). The Senators suggest that Delegate Skari\u2019s observation about residency requirements illustrates that the Convention delegates were, in fact, addressing the issue of \u201choldover\u201d senators since residency requirements are relevant to the redistricting process only as it concerns assignment of holdovers. Secretary Brown does not dispute this assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">\u00b623 It is clear from the transcripts of the Constitutional Convention that, in recognition of the Legislature\u2019s inability to redistrict itself, the Convention assigned the task of redistricting to the Commission-an independent, autonomous entity-and limited the Legislature\u2019s role to that of making \u201crecommendations.\u201d We now turn to the history of the implementation of Article V, Sectionl4.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">History of Implementation of Article V, Section 14</p>\n<p id=\"A5m\">\u00b624 As the District Court aptly noted, the conclusion that the assignment of holdover senators is part and parcel of the redistricting process is not a novel approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">\u00b625 The Constitution requires that within ninety days after each decennial census, the Commission shall file its final plan for congressional districts with the Secretary of State. Since the 1972 Constitutional Convention, there have been three federal censuses: in the years 1980, 1990 and 2000. In 1980, there was a controversy over whether senators should be held over at all. In response to an inquiry from the Senate, the Attorney General issued an opinion stating that the Commission had \u201cinherent authority\u201d to resolve \u201cdetails\u201d such as \u201chow holdover senators fit into the reapportionment plan.\u201d 40 Mont. Op. Atty. Gen. 7 (1983). The 1983 Senate subsequently criticized the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>Commission for failing to assign holdovers in its draft plan<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">\u00b626 After the federal census in 1990, the Commission honored the Attorney General\u2019s instructions and included assignments for holdover senators, including then-Senator Bob Brown, as part of its plan. The plan was filed and became law. Although the history of implementation does not address the ultimate issue of constitutionality, it certainly illustrates decades of consensus that the Commission\u2019s authority to redistrict necessarily includes the assignment of holdover senators.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">The 2003 Legislation</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">\u00b627 Citing the proposition that \"the people, through the legislature, have plenary power, except in so far as inhibited by the Constitution,\u201d <em>Missouri River Power Co. v. Steele </em>(1905), 32 Mont. 433, 438, 80 P. 1093, 1094, Secretary Brown contends that, since Article V, Section 14, is silent as to \u201choldover\u201d senators, the Legislature has constitutional leeway to transfer the authority to assign holdovers from the Commission to the Legislature, as it did in passing \u00a7 5-1-116, MCA, set forth below:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>(1) In the session in which the legislative redistricting plan is submitted to the legislature for recommendations, the legislature, by joint resolution, shall assign holdover senators to districts for the remainder of those senators\u2019 terms. The districting and apportionment commission may not assign holdover senators to districts for the remainder of those senators\u2019 terms. The assignments must occur after the plan becomes law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-4\">(2) In making the assignments provided for in subsection (1), the legislature, if possible, shall assign a holdover senator to a district based upon the greatest percentage of population in the new district that voted for the senator in the prior election and the senator\u2019s residence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-5\">(3) For the purposes of this section, a holdover senator is a senator who is not required to seek election at the general election held immediately following the districting plan becoming law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">\u00b628 Secretary Brown argues that the Montana Constitution mandates the Legislature enact legislation necessary to \u201cinsure the purity of elections and guard against abuses of the electoral process.\u201d Art. IV, Sec. 3, Mont. Const. The Secretary cites to Delegate Vermillion\u2019s explanation of the phrase \u201cinsure the purity of an election\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-7\">This is very broad language which would leave the Legislature the power to pass whatever statutes it deems necessary, much as it has in the election laws now, to make sure that there are no frauds perpetrated upon the people of Montana in elections. It is purposely kept broad to give the Legislature power to keep the elections free of fraud.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">Mont. Const. Conv. Tr., Vol. Ill at 450. Two aspects of this commentary are significant. First, having used \u201celection laws now\u201d as the point of reference, it is clear that the power conferred upon the Legislature in Article IV, Section 3, was designed to be commensurate with the then-existing election laws. The election laws both prior and subsequent to the adoption of the 1972 Constitution address the <em>mechanics </em>of the election process and do not address the legislative redistricting process. Title 13, Mont. Code Annotated. Secondly, the focus of Article IV, Section 3, as characterized by Delegate Vermillion, was to \u201cmake sure that there are no frauds perpetrated upon the people of Montana in elections.\u201d Applying those principles to the issue at hand, it is clear that \u00a7 5-1-116, MCA, does not address the mechanics of the election process. Furthermore, it is not at all apparent how leaving the power to assign holdovers with the Commission would perpetrate a fraud on the electors thereby necessitating the transfer of that power to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>Legislature to \u201censure the purity\u201d of an election.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">\u00b629 The Secretary devotes considerable time to extolling the merits of the objective statutory criteria for assigning holdovers embodied in \u00a7 5-1-116, MCA. We need not, however, address the specifics of these criteria since the issue presented is not whether the specific criteria are appropriate or well-intended. Rather, the more fundamental constitutional issue is whether the Legislature can inject itself into the redistricting process through the adoption of <em>any </em>criteria pertaining to holdovers.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">The Oregon Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">\u00b630 It appears the Oregon Supreme Court is the only other appellate court that has addressed the question of constitutional power to assign holdovers after a redistricting. <em>Cargo v. Paulus </em>(Or. 1981), 635 P.2d 367.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">\u00b631 As of 1980, redistricting under the Oregon Constitution was performed in the first instance by the legislature. In 1980 the Oregon legislature\u2019s redistricting plan designated half of the thirty senatorial districts as \u201copen\u201d and the other half as filled. The plan, however, did not designate a correspondence between the heldover senators and the filled districts. Thus, those senators were left serving the remainder of their terms without a clearly identified constituency. The Oregon supreme court held that each senator must be identified with a particular district. <em>McCall v. Legislative Assembly </em>(Or. 1981), 634 P.2d 223. As required by the Oregon Constitution, the court directed the secretary of state to submit a revised plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">\u00b632 The revised plan came before the court in <em>Cargo v. Paulus </em>in which the intervenors challenged the secretary\u2019s assignment of holdover senators. The Oregon court thus had to decide whether Oregon recognized holdover senators at all or whether all senate seats would be declared vacant. The court held that no senator\u2019s term should be shortened.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-9\">\u00b633 The Oregon court then had to decide whether the secretary had the authority to assign the holdovers as part of the redistricting plan. Although the Oregon Constitution was silent as to the assignment of holdover senators, it did authorize the court to direct the secretary of state to draft a plan. The Oregon court held that \u201cthe unavoidable inference is that the Secretary is authorized to do what is necessary to draft a reapportionment plan ....\u201d <em>Cargo, </em>635 P.2d at 369. Because the court had decided that the Oregon Constitution \u201cenvisages the assignment of Senators in a reapportionment,\u201d <em>Cargo, </em>635 P.2d at 369, rather than shortened terms, it followed that making the assignments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>was part of planning for reapportionment and redistricting. On an historical note, the court observed that Oregon had previously enacted two reapportionment plans which assigned senators to districts, thereby reflecting \u201ca continuing view that an assignment of Senators is a valid part of a reapportionment plan and we so hold.\u201d <em>Cargo, </em>635 P.2d at 369. This parallels the situation in Montana which, as noted earlier, also has a history of enacting redistricting plans which assign holdover senators. As a result of <em>Cargo, </em>Oregon\u2019s Constitution has since been amended, and as of 1986 it expressly refers to holdovers and requires that they be assigned as part of redistricting.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">\u00b634 Although the Montana Constitution places the redistricting authority with the Districting and Apportionment Commission rather than the Secretary of State, we, like the District Court, find the <em>Cargo </em>reasoning to be persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">\u00b635  Having reviewed the text of Article. V, Section 14, and the Constitutional Convention transcripts, we conclude that Article V, Section 14's mandate that the Commission effect redistricting is self-executing and that, as the history of implementation illustrates, the power to assign holdover senators to districts is an inherent part of the redistricting process. By granting redistricting authority to the Commission under Article V, Section 14, the Constitution denied the Legislature any latitude to invoke its plenary powers. The legislation designed to transfer the power to assign holdover senators from the Commission to the Legislature violates Article V, Sectionl4, of the Montana Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">\u00b636 [3] The District Court\u2019s well-reasoned opinion is hereby affirmed. Senate Bill 258 (codified as \u00a7 5-1-116, MCA), Senate Bill 445 and Senate Joint Resolution 23 are hereby declared unconstitutional and of no force and effect.</p>\n<judges id=\"b47-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, WARNER, NELSON, REGNIER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b44-7\"> On the matter of holdovers, the Senate stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-8\">WHEREAS, each Montana Senate district must have an identifiable representative; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-9\">WHEREAS, the Commission failed to assign Senators to new districts who have terms which expire in 1986; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-10\">WHEREAS, the Attorney General of the state of Montana has issued an opinion to the President of the Montana Senate indicating the necessity of designating districts for holdover senators whose terms do not expire until 1986; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-11\">WHEREAS, Montana Constitution Article V, section 14(2), does not provide for any regulation or control over the Commission;...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-12\">NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF THE STATE OF MONTANA:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-13\">... that the Montana Districting and Apportionment Commission designate senatorial districts for each senator whose term expires in 1986 in such a manner that each Senate District have an identifiable representative; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-14\">BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Montana Districting and Apportionment Commission establish election dates for the Senate Districts consistent with Montana Constitution Article V, section 3; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-15\">BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that if there is insufficient time for the Commission to accomplish such task that the Montana Supreme Court assume the responsibility of redistricting and reapportionment; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-16\">BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that copies of the following documents be attached to this resolution:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-17\">(1) Attorney General Opinion to Senator Stan Stephens dated January 21, 1983; Attachment C, 3 pages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b44-18\">Sen.
