Following a non-jury trial, the District Court entered Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Decree of Dissolution, dissolving the parties\u2019 marriage, distributing the couple\u2019s property, setting child support obligations, and approving the shared parenting plan. Richard appeals, and Teresa cross-appeals, from the District Court\u2019s property distribution. Teresa additionally cross-appeals from the court\u2019s failure to award attorney fees.

Did the District Court err by including the entire value of Richard\u2019s Merrill Lynch retirement account and a 1992 Ford pickup in the marital estate when the equity in these properties represented gifted or inherited funds?</p>\n<p id=\"b94-12\">\u00b65 3. Did the District Court err in excluding Richard\u2019s fractional interest in his family\u2019s properties in Broadwater County and a cabin near Canyon Ferry Lake from the marital estate?</p>\n<p id=\"b95-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>\u00b66 4. Did the District Court err in not awarding Teresa attorney fees?</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">\u00b67 Richard and Teresa were married August 8, 1987, in Helena, Montana. About a year and a half prior to the marriage, Richard had inherited in excess of $50,000 in gold and silver from his father. On the day before the parties\u2019 wedding, Richard purchased a condominium in Seattle, Washington, using money that had been gifted to him from his father as a down payment. After the wedding, Richard and Teresa moved to Seattle, where Richard worked as a mechanical engineer for Boeing and Teresa sought employment. Teresa eventually gained work as a receptionist at a nearby shopping mall and then shortly thereafter as a receptionist for Boeing. The parties thereafter sold the condominium and, using the sale proceeds, purchased another home in the Seattle area.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">\u00b68 In 1993, shortly after the birth of their second child, Richard and Teresa returned to Helena. For the next two years, they lived with Richard\u2019s mother while they constructed a home on a lot that Richard, along with his mother and four siblings, had inherited from Richard\u2019s father in 1986. In October 1994, Richard\u2019s family deeded the property to Richard and Teresa, based upon an oral promise to pay $15,000 for the lot, which was subsequently never paid. By the time of trial, the lot was valued at $51,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">\u00b69 In financing the construction of the Helena residence, Richard and Teresa used the money they received from the sale of their Seattle residence, approximately $25,000, as well as $30,000 from a Workers\u2019 Compensation settlement which Richard received as a result of work-related injuries in the early part of 1996. Richard also contributed a portion of his gold inheritance, between $30,000 and $40,000, as well as $20,000 which had been gifted to him by his godmother.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">\u00b610 For her part, Teresa contributed approximately $10,000 to the construction of the Helena residence-funds from her retirement account at Boeing-and acted as the primary caretaker for the parties\u2019 minor children. Teresa also shared in a mortgage on the family residence, which was originally $65,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">\u00b611 In 1995, after moving into the Helena residence, Richard and Teresa had their third child. Shortly thereafter, Teresa obtained employment at a local physical fitness center, working part-time in the center\u2019s daycare facility. As she did so, she continued to care for the parties\u2019three minor children, who accompanied Teresa at work. Teresa maintained her employment at the fitness center for the duration of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>the parties\u2019 marriage, and, at the time of trial, was working full-time as the center\u2019s bookkeeper.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">\u00b612 Richard also maintained employment throughout the marriage. After returning to Helena, Richard worked briefly for State Farm Insurance Company before obtaining a sales position at a local car dealership, where he worked for approximately one year. Richard thereafter went to work for Allstate Insurance Company as a claims representative, where he continued to work up through the time of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">\u00b613 In conjunction with his past employment, Richard held a Merrill Lynch retirement account, which was valued at approximately $23,255 at the time of trial. Although the account represented retirement contributions Richard accrued during his employment with Boeing, the account was funded, in principle part, by a $14,000 gift from Richard\u2019s godmother.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">\u00b614 Richard also owned a fractional interest in several parcels of real property. In 1995, Richard purchased a one-half interest in a lot located in Broadwater County for $1,250, again using a portion of the gold he inherited from his father. The only expense associated with this property was the payment of taxes, which were minimal, and which Teresa helped to pay. At trial, the parties agreed the lot was worth $7,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">\u00b615 Additionally, Richard held a one-fifth interest in a cabin located near Canyon Ferry Lake, which he and his four siblings had inherited from Richard\u2019s parents. Throughout the marriage, Richard and Teresa shared the use of the cabin with Richard\u2019s siblings, and paid a proportionate part of the expenses associated with the cabin. At trial, the parties agreed the cabin was worth a total of approximately $60,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">\u00b616 In June 2000, Richard and Teresa separated. The following month, Teresa petitioned for dissolution of marriage in district court. At trial, the parties agreed to a shared parenting schedule. However, they disputed the division of assets, many of which Richard considered as non-marital, or as being acquired with his inherited and gifted funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">\u00b617 On March 26,2002, the District Court issued its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Decree of Dissolution, concluding that all of the monies acquired during the marriage, regardless of source, were commingled and used for the parties\u2019 mutual benefit, and that Teresa\u2019s non-monetary contributions as a homemaker equaled the value of Richard\u2019s inherited and gifted contributions to the family residence. As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>such, the court divided the parties\u2019 marital property almost equally, and awarded Teresa one-half of the equity in the family home, or $93,000. The court additionally concluded that Richard\u2019s Merrill Lynch account and 1992 Ford pickup, acquired primarily with inherited funds, were marital assets, and awarded each of these items to Richard. However, the court excluded Richard\u2019s interests in the Broadwater property and Canyon Ferry cabin from the marital estate, reasoning that these properties were not titled in Teresa\u2019s name, and had been kept separate from the parties\u2019 other marital assets. Both parties appeal from the District Court\u2019s distribution of property, and Teresa additionally appeals from the court\u2019s failure to rule on her request for attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">\u00b618 The standard of review of a district court\u2019s division of marital property is whether the district court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether the court correctly applied the law. <em>In re Marriage of Foreman, </em>1999 MT 89, \u00b6 14, 294 Mont. 181, \u00b6 14, 979 P.2d 193, \u00b6 14. A finding is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence, if the district court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if our review of the record convinces us the district court made a mistake. <em>In re Marriage of Deist, </em>2003 MT 263, \u00b6 14, 317 Mont. 427, \u00b6 14, 77 P.3d 525, \u00b6 14. Where substantial credible evidence supports the court\u2019s findings and judgment, this Court will not alter the district court\u2019s decision unless there is an abuse of discretion. <em>In re Marriage of Griffin </em>(1996), 275 Mont. 37, 43, 909 P.2d 707, 710-11. The test for abuse of discretion in a dissolution proceeding is \u201cwhether the district court acted arbitrarily without employment of conscientious judgment\u201d or whether the district court \u201cexceeded the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Engen, </em>1998 MT 153, \u00b6 26, 289 Mont. 299, \u00b6 26, 961 P.2d 738, \u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">\u00b619 Did the District Court err in awarding Teresa one-half of the equity in the family home when a substantial portion of the funds to construct the home came from Richard\u2019s inherited or gifted monies?</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">\u00b620 Richard challenges the District Court\u2019s equal division of the equity in the parties\u2019 marital residence, arguing that the court erred in applying the provisions of \u00a7 40-4-202, MCA (1999), which controls distribution of a marital estate. He maintains that it is well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>established that a non-acquiring spouse is entitled only to share in the appreciated or preserved value of pre-acquired or inherited property which is attributable to his or her efforts. Richard contends that, because more than half of the equity in the marital residence was funded by his gifts and inheritances, the District Court erred in awarding Teresa half of the equity in this asset. In response, Teresa maintains that her non-monetary contributions as a homemaker facilitated the maintenance and appreciation of the marital residence, and that, consequently, she is entitled to half of the equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">\u00b621 Section 40-4-202, MCA, provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-5\">In a proceeding for dissolution of a marriage ... the court, without regard to marital misconduct, shall ... equitably apportion between the parties the property and assets belonging to either or both, however and whenever acquired and whether the title thereto is in the name of the husband or wife or both.... In dividing property acquired prior to the marriage; property acquired by gift, bequest, devise, or descent; property acquired in exchange for property acquired before the marriage or in exchange for property acquired by gift, bequest, devise, or descent; the increased value of property acquired prior to marriage ... the court shall consider those contributions of the other spouse to the marriage, including:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-6\">(a) the nonmonetary contribution of a homemaker;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-7\">(b) the extent to which such contributions have facilitated the maintenance of this property; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-8\">(c) whether or not the property division serves as an alternative to maintenance arrangements.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">As we have previously recognized, this section provides for equitable distribution of pre-acquired property, regardless of the manner in which title to the property is held, taking into consideration the contributions of the non-acquiring spouse to its preservation or appreciation. <em>Stoneman v. Drollinger, </em>2000 MT 274, \u00b6 18, 302 Mont. 107, \u00b6 18, 14 P.3d 12, \u00b6 18. A non-acquiring spouse is entitled to an equitable share of the appreciated or preserved value of the inherited property which is attributable to his or her efforts. <em>Stoneman, </em>\u00b6 18. However, pre-acquired or gifted property need not be included in the marital estate where the non-acquiring spouse did not contribute to the property\u2019s preservation or appreciation. <em>See Engen, </em>\u00b6 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-10\">\u00b622 In this case, Richard concedes that Teresa\u2019s monetary and non-monetary contributions as a homemaker facilitated the maintenance and appreciation of the marital residence. Accordingly, it is undisputed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>that Teresa is entitled to an equitable portion of the equity in the family home. Nonetheless, we conclude the District Court erred in its division of the equity in the marital residence because the court failed to correctly apply the provisions of \u00a7 40-4-202, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">\u00b623  The District Court equally divided the equity in the marital residence on the basis that Richard\u2019s gifted and pre-acquired properties had been commingled with the parties\u2019 joint funds. However, it is well-settled that, <em>\u201cregardless of who holds title, </em>pre-acquired or gifted property need not be included in the marital estate unless the nonacquiring spouse contributed to its preservation or appreciation.\u201d <em>Engen, </em>\u00b6 29 (emphasis added). While it is inequitable to award the value of an asset solely to the acquiring spouse upon dissolution when an inheritance is not traceable and both parties have contributed to the increased value, <em>see In re Marriage of </em>Steinbeisser, 2002 MT 309, \u00b6 37, 313 Mont. 74, \u00b6 37, 60 P.3d 441, \u00b6 37, that is not the case here. As demonstrated by its factual findings, the District Court was able to reasonably trace the parties\u2019 respective contributions to the construction of the marital residence. For instance, the court found that Richard inherited more than $50,000 in the form of gold and silver from his father prior to the marriage, and that, of this amount, $30,000 to $40,000 had been invested in the parties\u2019 home. The home was constructed on a lot valued at $51,000 at the time of trial, which had been deeded to the pai\u2019ties by Richard\u2019s family. The court additionally found that Richard received a $28,000 gift from his godmother during the construction of the marital residence, and that approximately $20,000 of this was used to build a garage and finish the home\u2019s basement. Because Richard\u2019s pre-acquired and gifted contributions were traceable, the District Court erred when it simply divided the equity in the marital residence equally, without regard to the parties\u2019 contributions. Teresa is entitled only to an equitable share of the appreciated or preserved value of Richard\u2019s pre-acquired and gifted contributions which is attributable to her efforts.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">\u00b624 We note that the District Court further supported its decision to award Teresa one-half of the home\u2019s equity by finding that the property division served as an alternative to maintenance. <em>See </em>\u00a7 40-4-202(l)(c), MCA. However, Teresa did not seek maintenance at trial, and the parties concurred in their proposed findings that neither party was entitled to receive maintenance. Accordingly, we hold the District Court erred in its application of \u00a7 40-4-202, MCA, and thus in its division of the equity in the marital residence. We reverse this portion of the decree and remand for further proceedings to determine the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>portion of equity in the family home to which Teresa is entitled by way of her contributions to the home\u2019s preservation and appreciation in value.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">\u00b625 On remand, it is appropriate for the District Court to consider the extent to which Teresa\u2019s contributions, including her non-monetary contributions as a homemaker, facilitated the preservation or appreciation of the marital residence. <em>See </em>\u00a7 40-4-202(l)(a), MCA. As we have previously recognized, the work of a homemaker can be an important contribution because the marital estate may be substantially depleted if those necessary services had to be purchased. <em>In re Marriage of Smith </em>(1995), 270 Mont. 263, 268, 891 P.2d 522, 525. In this case, the record reflects that Teresa acted as the primary caretaker of the parties\u2019 three minor children and maintained the family household throughout the parties\u2019 marriage. She additionally helped support the family through part-time employment and contributed her Boeing retirement account, a $10,000 value, to the construction of the marital residence. The task upon remand is to determine the extent to which these, and other such contributions, facilitated the preservation or appreciation of the pre-acquired and gifted monies invested in the marital residence, and to apportion the equity between the parties accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">\u00b626 Did the District Court err by including the entire value of Richard\u2019s Merrill Lynch retirement account and a 1992 Ford pickup in the marital estate when the equity in these properties represented gifted or inherited funds?</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">\u00b627 As in the previous issue, Richard contends the District Court erred by including his Merrill Lynch retirement account, valued at approximately $23,255 at the time of trial, and 1992 Ford pickup within the marital estate because each of these assets were acquired using his gifted monies. In its Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, the District Court found that the Merrill Lynch retirement account was funded by Richard\u2019s Boeing retirement and approximately $14,000 that he received as a gift from either his mother or godmother. This notwithstanding, the court found the entire account was a marital asset since its value and balance had fluctuated throughout the marriage and its proceeds had been used to pay various marital expenses. The court likewise found that the 1992 Ford pickup was a marital asset, despite determining that it had been purchased primarily with gifted and inherited monies, because Teresa had helped to operate and maintain the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">\u00b628 The disposition of these properties is once again controlled by \u00a7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>40-4-202, MCA. As assets acquired by gift, bequest, devise, or descent during the marriage, they are not part of the marital estate unless the non-acquiring spouse made contributions to the preservation or appreciation of that property. <em>In re Marriage of Rolf, </em>2003 MT 194, \u00b6 22, 316 Mont. 517, \u00b6 22, 75 P.3d 770, \u00b6 33; <em>see also In re Marriage of Herron </em>(1980), 186 Mont. 396, 404, 608 P.2d 97,101. Moreover, \u201ca non-acquiring spouse is not entitled to a share of the increase in premarital property when the property\u2019s appreciation is due simply to market factors.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of </em>Steinbeisser, \u00b6 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">\u00b629  As we have stated before, the first prong of our standard of review of a district court\u2019s finding is whether it is supported by substantial evidence. <em>In re Marriage of Gerhart, </em>2003 MT 292, \u00b6 29, 318 Mont. 94, \u00b6 29, 78 P.3d 1219, \u00b6 29. In this case, Teresa presented no evidence that she contributed to the appreciation or preservation of Richard\u2019s Merrill Lynch retirement account, which fluctuated in value over the course of the marriage. The fact that funds from the account were occasionally used for family expenses does not justify an equal division of this asset. <em>See In re Marriage of Luisi </em>(1988), 232 Mont. 243, 245, 756 P.2d 456, 458 (finding that husband did not contribute to preservation of inheritance where, due to insufficient household budget, wife was forced to use her inheritance to feed, clothe, and shelter her family). Furthermore, Teresa\u2019s use and periodic maintenance of the 1992 Ford pickup does not constitute a contribution so significant as to entitle her to half of its value. Because the District Court\u2019s findings with respect to the Merrill Lynch account and 1992 Ford pickup are not supported by substantial credible evidence, they are clearly erroneous, and the conclusion of law based thereon is incorrect. Accordingly, we reverse that portion of the decree, and award these assets to Richard.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">\u00b630 Did the District Court err in excluding Richard\u2019s fractional interest in his family\u2019s properties in Broadwater County and a cabin near Canyon Ferry Lake from the marital estate?</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">\u00b631 On cross-appeal, Teresa argues that the District Court erred in failing to award her an equitable portion of the appreciation in the Canyon Ferry cabin and Broadwater properties, because the parties paid taxes and expenses associated with the properties from marital funds. However, as Richard points out, the Broadwater property was acquired strictly with his inherited monies, and the taxes associated with the property were minimal, approximately $40 per year. The District Court additionally found that the marital funds expended to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>maintain the Canyon Ferry cabin were minimal, and excluded this asset from the marital estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">\u00b632  In determining the exact distribution of an asset acquired by gift or bequest during the marriage, no set formula can be established as to how the assets should be equitably distributed. <em>Herron, 186 </em>Mont. at 402, 608 P.2d at 100. In this case, there is no evidence that Teresa made any significant contribution to the preservation or appreciation of these non-marital assets. Accordingly, we hold the District Court did not err in excluding the Broadwater property and Canyon Ferry Lake cabin from the marital estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">\u00b633 Did the District Court err in not awarding Teresa attorney fees?</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">\u00b634 Teresa asserts that the District Court erred in disregarding her request for attorney fees, which she sought pursuant to her Verified Petition for Dissolution. However, Teresa presented no evidence or argument in support of her request for attorney fees after initially raising it as an issue in her petition, and we will not fault the District Court for failing to consider evidence which was never presented. See <em>In re Marriage of Rush </em>(1985), 215 Mont. 498, 502, 699 P.2d 65, 67 (a ffirming district court\u2019s denial of attorney fees where no supporting evidence was submitted at any of the hearings). We further note that Teresa effectively waived this as an issue on appeal when, in her Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, she concluded that \u201c[e]ach of the parties has been allocated resources sufficient such that each party is responsible for his or her own attorneys fees and costs.\u201d Accordingly, we cannot conclude that the District Court erred in disregarding Teresa\u2019s request for attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">\u00b635 Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b102-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, REGNIER, COTTER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
