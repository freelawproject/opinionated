Appearing <em>pro se, </em>Cobell filed a petition for postconviction relief in the Eighth Judicial District Court, Cascade County, claiming that his counsel had been ineffective. The District Court summarily dismissed the petition. Cobell appeals this dismissal. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">\u00b62 The sole issue on appeal is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b145-10\">\u00b63 Did the District Court eir in dismissing Cobell\u2019s petition for postconviction relief as a matter of law?</p>\n<p id=\"b145-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b145-12\">\u00b64 On December 14, 2000, Cobell and a number of other inmates at the state prison side of the Cascade County Regional Detention Center got drunk on a prison-made brew concocted from tomatoes, sugar, and yeast. During their bout of drinking, several fights erupted and some of the inmates, including Cobell, began smashing footlockers, causing the metal attached to the lockers to become loose and separate. When confronted by correctional officers, Cobell grabbed the loose metal strips, wrapped them around his wrists, and threatened to stab the officers. The inmates were ordered several times to \u201clock down,\u201d or return to their cells, and refused. Control was re-established several hours later when the inmates relinquished their weapons and returned to their cells.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-13\">\u00b65 On January 17, 2001, Cobell was charged by Information with possession of a deadly weapon by a prisoner, a felony, in violation of \u00a7 45-8-318, MCA, and was subsequently appointed defense counsel. Cobell entered a plea agreement on April 12,2001, wherein he agreed to plead guilty to the offense charged in exchange for the State\u2019s recommendation of a five-year sentence to the DOC, the minimum sentence prescribed by statute. By signing the plea agreement, Cobell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>acknowledged that he understood that the State\u2019s recommendation was not binding on the court in passing sentence. He also signed an \u201cacknowledgment of waiver of rights by plea of guilty\u201d form, underscoring the rights which were being relinquished pursuant to the plea agreement, and stating that he was satisfied with the services of his attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">\u00b66 A sentencing hearing was held June 14, 2001. Pursuant to the plea agreement, the State recommended a five-year term of commitment to the DOC, to run consecutively to the sentences Cobell was already serving. Cobell requested the sentence be suspended entirely. The court denied Cobell\u2019s request and sentenced him to five years to the DOC, with no part of the sentence suspended, and ordered the sentence to be served consecutively with his other sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">\u00b67 On May 22, 2002, Cobell filed a petition for postconviction relief alleging various claims, including ineffective assistance of counsel. The court summarily dismissed Cobell\u2019s petition, without hearing or responsive briefing. From this dismissal, Cobell appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">\u00b68 A district court may dismiss a petition for postconviction relief as a matter of law for failure to state a claim for relief. Section 46-21-201(l)(a), MCA. We review a district court\u2019s denial of a petition for postconviction relief to determine whether the court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether its conclusions of law are correct. <em>Porter v. State, </em>2002 MT 319, \u00b6 13, 313 Mont. 149, \u00b6 13, 60 P.3d 951, \u00b6 13. However, claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are mixed questions of law and fact for which our review is <em>de novo. Hope v. State, </em>2003 MT 191, \u00b6 13, 316 Mont. 497, \u00b6 13, 74 P.3d 1039, \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">\u00b69 Did the District Court err in dismissing Cobell\u2019s petition for postconviction relief as a matter of law?</p>\n<p id=\"b146-10\">\u00b610 Cobell asserts that the District Court erred when it summarily dismissed his petition for postconviction relief, which alleged ineffective assistance of counsel prior to the change of plea hearing and during sentencing. The State counters that the District Court correctly dismissed the petition because Cobell\u2019s allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel were unsupported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-11\">\u00b611 The District Court\u2019s order dismissing Cobell\u2019s petition consisted of one sentence denying the petition, with no explanation of the grounds upon which relief was denied. We take this opportunity to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>urge the district courts, in the event a petition for postconviction relief is found to be without merit, to set forth the reasoning for that conclusion, which will facilitate review of the district court\u2019s decision on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">\u00b612  A person requesting postconviction relief has the burden to show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the facts justify the relief. <em>Griffin v. State, </em>2003 MT 267, \u00b6 10, 317 Mont. 457, \u00b6 10, 77 P.3d 545, \u00b6 10. If a district court finds that the allegations in a petition are without merit or would not otherwise entitle a petitioner to relief, a district court may deny an application for postconviction relief without holding an evidentiary hearing. <em>Bishop v. State </em>(1992), 254 Mont. 100, 107-08, 835 P.2d 732, 737; <em>State v. Peck </em>(1993), 263 Mont. 1, 3-4, 865 P.2d 304, 305-06.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">\u00b613 In his petition for postconviction relief, Cobell alleged that he was denied his right to effective assistance of counsel when, prior to signing the plea agreement, counsel gave him the impression that he would receive a suspended sentence, and failed to advise him that his offense carried a five-year mandatory minimum sentence, which could only be reduced if one of the mitigating factors set forth at \u00a7 46-18-222, MCA, applied. Cobell maintained that if he had known his offense required a minimum of five years incarceration, he would not have pled guilty, and would have insisted on going to trial. Cobell also claimed that he was denied effective assistance of counsel at sentencing in that counsel failed to bolster any argument in support of an exception to the mandatory minimum sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">\u00b614 A petitioner seeking to reverse a court\u2019s denial of a petition for postconviction relief bears a heavy burden. <em>Schaff v. State, </em>2003 MT 187, \u00b6 18, 316 Mont. 453, \u00b6 18, 73 P.3d 806, \u00b6 18. In assessing claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, we apply the two-pronged test set forth in <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. The first prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test requires the defendant to show that his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. at 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d at 693. To demonstrate that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, the defendant must prove that counsel\u2019s performance fell below the range of competence reasonably demanded of attorneys in light of the Sixth Amendment. <em>Bishop, </em>254 Mont. at 103, 835 P.2d at 734. The second prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test requires the defendant to prove that his counsel\u2019s deficient performance prejudiced the defense. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. at 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d at 693. To show prejudice, the defendant alleging ineffective assistance of counsel must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>demonstrate a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, he would not have pled guilty and would have insisted on going to trial. <em>State v. Thee, </em>2001 MT 294, \u00b6 9, 307 Mont. 450, \u00b6 9, 37 P.3d 741, \u00b6 9. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome. <em>Thee, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">\u00b615 Although we have often discussed the performance component of an ineffectiveness claim prior to the prejudice component, we have recognized that a court is not required, when deciding an ineffective assistance claim, to approach the inquiry in that order, or even to address both components of the inquiry when the defendant makes an insufficient showing on one. <em>State v. Morgan, </em>2003 MT 193, \u00b6 10, 316 Mont. 509, \u00b6 10, 74 P.3d 1047, \u00b6 10; <em>State v. Hagen, </em>2002 MT 190, \u00b6 19, 311 Mont. 117, \u00b6 19, 53 P.3d 885, \u00b6 19. If it is easier to dispose of an ineffectiveness claim on the ground of lack of sufficient prejudice, that course should be followed. <em>Morgan, </em>\u00b6 10; <em>Hagen, </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">\u00b616 Bearing the foregoing principles in mind, we turn to Cobell\u2019s claim that his defense counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to properly advise him of the mandatory minimum sentence prescribed by statute. Cobell maintains that he suffered prejudice as a result of counsel\u2019s allegedly deficient performance because, had he been properly advised, he would not have pled guilty and would have insisted on going to trial. However, this claim is incredible in light of the record, which shows that the Information charging Cobell with the offense informed him that the maximum penalty for his crime was \u201ca fine of not more than $50,000 and imprisonment in the state prison for a term <em>not less than 5 years </em>or more than 15 years or both.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, notwithstanding counsel\u2019s alleged failure to advise his client of the mandatory minimum sentence, Cobell was on notice of the minimum sentencing requirements prior to entering the plea agreement, and nonetheless agreed to plead guilty. Accordingly, we are unconvinced that Cobell would have insisted on going to trial had he received additional notice of the sentencing requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">\u00b617  Moreover, we note that Cobell entered the plea agreement knowing that it was non-binding on the District Court. Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Cobell\u2019s counsel failed to advise him as to the minimum sentencing requirements, Cobell still accepted the plea agreement understanding that the court was free to reject the agreement and impose any sentence it deemed appropriate. Given the uncertainty implicit in this arrangement, and the fact that Cobell received the benefit of his bargain-five years to the DOC-we conclude that Cobell was not prejudiced by counsel\u2019s alleged mistake. Because we find no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>prejudice, we decline to address whether counsel\u2019s performance was deficient under the first prong of <em>Strickland, </em>and uphold the District Court\u2019s dismissal of Cobell\u2019s petition for postconviction relief as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">\u00b618 Asa final matter, we note that Cobell claims ineffective assistance in that his attorney failed to argue in support of the statutory exceptions to the mandatory minimum sentencing requirements set forth at \u00a7 46-18-222, MCA. However, Cobell\u2019s argument consists of four sentences in his opening brief and is not supported by any authority. This Court indulges a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s actions fall within the wide range of reasonable and professional assistance and Cobell has failed to overcome this presumption. <em>See Thee, </em>\u00b6 8. Accordingly, we cannot conclude that defense counsel rendered ineffective assistance in this sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">\u00b619 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b149-6\">JUSTICES WARNER, COTTER, NELSON and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
