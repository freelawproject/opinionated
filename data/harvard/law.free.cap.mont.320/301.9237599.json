We accepted the certified questions by order dated January 7, 2003. Pursuant to Rule 44(d), M.R.App.P., we reformulate and address the following certified question:</p>\n<p id=\"b324-12\">\u00b62 For statute oflimitations purposes, do statutory and common law bad faith claims against an insurer, predicated on actions taken in the adjustment of a workers\u2019 compensation claim, accrue when the Montana Workers\u2019 Compensation Court enters a judgment which orders the insurer to pay for a previously denied benefit, but which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>leaves unresolved the ultimate determinations of the extent and duration of the worker\u2019s disability?</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">\u00b63 After briefing and oral argument by the parties, and for the reasons set forth below, we answer the question in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">\u00b64 In August of 1993, Teddy Ann O\u2019Connor (O\u2019Connor) injured her back when she slipped and fell while working at the WalMart store in Billings, Montana. At the time of O\u2019Connor\u2019s injury, National Union Fire Insurance Company of Pittsburgh, PA (National Union) insured WalMart against workers\u2019 compensation claims. National Union employed Alexsis, Inc. (Alexsis) to adjust O\u2019Connor\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">\u00b65 O\u2019Connor\u2019s original physician recommended against surgei\u2019y to repair the damage to her back. She sought a second opinion and was referred to a neurosurgeon who recommended surgery. O\u2019Connor asked Alexsis for permission to continue treatment with the neurosurgeon and undergo the surgery, but Alexsis denied her request. O\u2019Connor filed a claim with the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court (WCC) requesting various benefits, including that National Union pay for her back surgery. On May 19, 1995, the WCC determined that O\u2019Connor had been temporarily totally disabled since March 16, 1994, and ordered National Union to pay for her surgery and lost wages since that date. Noting that O\u2019Connor had not reached maximum healing, the WCC did not determine National Union\u2019s further liability and stated there was \u201ca legitimate issue as to whether [O\u2019Connor\u2019s] current condition is attributable to her 1993 fall.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">\u00b66 In October of 1996, several months after her surgery, O\u2019Connor filed an action against National Union in the United States District Court for the District of Montana, alleging National Union violated the Montana Unfair Trade Practices Act (MUTPA), \u00a7\u00a7 33-18-101, MCA, <em>et seq., </em>in that it delayed her surgery in bad faith by denying her claim when liability was reasonably clear. National Union moved for summary judgment, arguing that the action was barred by the statute of limitations. The federal trial court denied the motion, but dismissed O\u2019Connor\u2019s action without prejudice on the basis that it was filed prematurely. The court observed that the MUTPA prohibits a third-party claimant from filing an action against an insurer until the underlying claim is settled or reduced to judgment, and National Union\u2019s liability had not been fully determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">\u00b67 In January of 2000, O\u2019Connor filed a second action against National Union in the federal district court in reaction to our ruling in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number><em>Brewington v. Employers Fire Ins. Co., </em>1999 MT 312, 297 Mont. 243, 992 P.2d 237, which she believed established that the underlying workers\u2019 compensation claim need not be resolved completely before a bad faith claim may be brought. She again alleged violations of the MUTPA, and added a common law bad faith claim. National Union filed a third-party complaint against Alexsis for indemnification. Both National Union and Alexsis filed motions for summary judgment, asserting that O\u2019Connor\u2019s claims were barred by the applicable one-year and three-year statutes of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">\u00b68 The federal district court interpreted <em>Brewington </em>as holding that, with regard to workers\u2019 compensation proceedings, an \u201cunderlying claim\u201d included each WCC interim judgment, regardless of whether the claimant\u2019s ultimate disability had been determined. The court then concluded that the applicable statutes of limitations on O\u2019Connor\u2019s claims arising out of the WCC\u2019s May 19,1995, decision began to run at the time that decision was entered and, consequently, those claims were time barred when O\u2019Connor filed her action in 2000. Based on that conclusion, the court granted summary judgment to National Union and Alexsis on those claims, and dismissed as premature O\u2019Connor\u2019s bad faith claims occurring after May 19, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">\u00b69 O\u2019Connor appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals from that portion of the federal district court\u2019s order which granted summary judgment to National Union and Alexsis. The Ninth Circuit then certified two questions to this Court and we reformulated them into one question.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">\u00b610 For statute of limitations purposes, do statutory and common law bad faith claims against an insurer, predicated on actions taken in the adjustment of a workers\u2019 compensation claim, accrue when the WCC enters a judgment which orders the insurer to pay for a previously denied benefit, but which leaves unresolved the ultimate determinations of the extent and duration of the worker\u2019s disability?</p>\n<p id=\"A4U\">\u00b611  A third-party claimant may not bring an action pursuant to the MUTPA \u201cuntil after the underlying claim has been settled or a judgment entered in favor of the claimant on the underlying claim.\u201d Section 33-18-242(6)(b), MCA. Furthermore, the statute of limitations for an action brought by a third-party claimant pursuant to the MUTPA is \u201cwithin 1 year from the date of the settlement of or the entry of judgment on the underlying claim.\u201d Section 33-18-242(7)(b), MCA. The MUTPA does not define the term \u201cunderlying claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>\u00b612  A common law bad faith claim accrues \u201cwhen all elements of the claim or cause exist or have occurred, the right to maintain an action on the claim or cause is complete, and a court or other agency is authorized to accept jurisdiction of the action.\u201d Section 27-2-102(l)(a), MCA. The statute of limitations for a common law bad faith claim is three years and begins to run \u201cwhen the claim or cause of action accrues.\u201d Sections 27-2-204(1) and 27-2-102(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-3\">\u00b613 O\u2019Connor argues that, for purposes of a MUTPA bad faith claim, the settlement of, or the entry of judgment on, the underlying workers\u2019 compensation claim does not occur until all issues contained in that claim-including the ultimate issues of liability, and extent and duration of disability-have been resolved. With respect to common law bad faith claims, she similarly argues that the cause of action does not accrue until all issues in the workers\u2019 compensation claim-including liability, and extent and duration of disability-have been resolved. National Union and Alexsis contend that statutory and common law bad faith claims arising out of the handling of workers\u2019 compensation claims accrue at the time each individual dispute giving rise to the bad faith claim is resolved by settlement or WCC judgment, regardless of whether other issues remain in dispute in the workers\u2019 compensation case. National Union and Alexsis are correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">\u00b614 We first discussed the accrual of a third-party bad faith claim against an insurer arising from conduct in the handling of a workers\u2019 compensation claim in <em>Grenz v. Orion Group, Inc. </em>(1990), 243 Mont. 486, 795 P.2d 444. In that case, Grenz suffered a work-related injury for which the insurer, Orion Group, Inc. (Orion), accepted liability and paid benefits. Grenz initially received temporary total disability benefits. After several years, Orion reduced Grenz\u2019s benefits to permanent partial disability. Grenz challenged the reduction and, eventually, the WCC restored his benefits to temporary total disability. <em>Grenz, </em>243 Mont. at 487, 795 P.2d at 445-46. The WCC did not determine, however, whether Orion had acted unreasonably in reducing Grenz\u2019s benefits. Grenz subsequently brought an action in the district court alleging Orion had acted in bad faith in handling his workers\u2019 compensation claim. Orion moved to dismiss the action, asserting it was premature because the WCC had not determined whether Orion had acted unfairly. The district court granted the motion and Grenz appealed. <em>Grenz, </em>243 Mont. at 488-89, 795 P.2d at 445-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">\u00b615 On appeal, we observed that \u00a7 33-18-242(6)(b), MCA, provides that a third-party bad faith claim may not be brought until after there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>has been either a settlement of or judgment entered on the underlying claim. <em>Grenz, </em>243 Mont. at 491, 795 P.2d at 447. We then concluded the district court correctly determined that, until the WCC ruled on whether Orion\u2019s actions in reducing Grenz\u2019s benefits were improper, Grenz\u2019s bad faith action based on those actions was premature. We affirmed the dismissal of Grenz\u2019s complaint. <em>Grenz, </em>243 Mont. at 490-91, 795 P.2d at 446-47. Thus, in analyzing whether Grenz\u2019s bad faith claim had accrued, we looked to whether the WCC had entered a judgment relating to the specific issue and conduct alleged in Grenz\u2019s district court bad faith complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">\u00b616 We next addressed this issue in <em>Poteat v. St. Paul Mercury Ins. Co. </em>(1996), 277 Mont. 117, 918 P.2d 677. There, Poteat suffered a work-related injury for which she filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim. Poteat and the insurer eventually entered into a settlement agreement wherein Poteat was to receive a lump sum payment and expressly reserve her claim to future medical benefits. <em>Poteat, </em>277 Mont. at 118, 918 P.2d at 678. Poteat subsequently brought a MUTPA action in the district court, alleging various acts of bad faith on the part of the insurer both prior to and after entry of the settlement agreement, as well as breach of the settlement agreement. <em>Poteat, </em>277 Mont. at 119, 918 P.2d at 678. The insurer moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The district court determined that, because the settlement agreement had not resolved the question of Poteat\u2019s future medical benefits, the agreement was not a full settlement of the underlying claim and, as a result, it had no jurisdiction over the bad faith action. On that basis, the court granted the insurer\u2019s motion to dismiss. <em>Poteat, </em>277 Mont, at 119, 918 P.2d at 678-79.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">\u00b617 On appeal, we determined that, with regard to the workers\u2019 compensation claim, Poteat\u2019s claims for compensation and past medical benefits were fully and finally settled upon entry of the settlement agreement. As a result, her bad faith claims arising out of conduct prior to entry of the agreement accrued at that time, pursuant to \u00a7 33-18-242(6)(b), MCA, and Poteat could pursue a MUTPA claim with regard to that conduct. We reversed the district court\u2019s dismissal of those claims. <em>Poteat, </em>277 Mont. at 120-21, 918 P.2d at 679-80. We also concluded, however, that Poteat\u2019s bad faith claims relating to conduct occurring after entry of the settlement agreement, including breach of the agreement itself, would not accrue until she obtained a settlement or WCC judgment resolving the issue of her future medical benefits. <em>Poteat, </em>277 Mont. at 120, 918 P.2d at 679-80. Consequently, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>concluded the district court correctly determined that Poteat\u2019s bad faith claims relating to conduct occurring after entry of the settlement agreement were premature and affirmed its dismissal of those claims. <em>Poteat, </em>277 Mont. at 121, 918 P.2d at 680. As in <em>Grenz, </em>we resolved the issue of when the bad faith claims accrued by looking to whether there had been a settlement or judgment relating to the specific dispute in the workers\u2019 compensation case from which the alleged bad faith conduct arose.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">\u00b618 Our most recent discussion of when a bad faith claim arising out of the handling of a workers\u2019 compensation claim accrues occurred in <em>Brewington, </em>which followed a prior appeal of the underlying workers\u2019 compensation claim in <em>Brewington v. Birkenbuel, Inc. </em>(1986), 222 Mont. 505, 723 P.2d 938 <em>(Brewington I). </em>In <em>Brewington, </em>we set forth the pertinent facts from <em>Brewington I </em>as follows. In 1974, the claimant suffered a work-related injury for which the insurer began paying temporary total disability benefits. Subsequently, when the claimant refused rehabilitation, the insurer changed the benefits to permanent partial disability. The claimant challenged the change in status and the WCC determined he was permanently partially disabled. The claimant appealed, and we concluded the claimant\u2019s disability was permanent and total. We further concluded that the insurer had acted unreasonably in reducing the claimant\u2019s benefits. <em>Brewington, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 6-7. \u00b619 In 1998, the claimant filed an action in district court alleging that, following our decision in <em>Brewington I, </em>the WCC had ordered the insurer to pay the claimant\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees resulting from the appeal and the insurer had refused to do so until February of 1996. The complaint alleged that this conduct constituted common law bad faith. The complaint also alleged that the insurer\u2019s prior unreasonable action in reducing his benefits constituted common law bad faith. <em>Brewington, </em>\u00b6 8. The insurer moved to dismiss the complaint, asserting that the tort of common law bad faith had been preempted by the enactment of the MUTPA and any claim brought pursuant to the MUTPA was barred by the \u00a7 33-18-242(7)(b), MCA, statute of limitations. The district court agreed and granted the motion to dismiss. <em>Brewington, </em>\u00b610.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">\u00b620 On appeal, we first concluded that the MUTPA does not prohibit a party from asserting a common law claim for bad faith and the applicable statute of limitations for such a claim is three years. <em>Brewington, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 14 and 24. We then determined that the claimant had alleged two separate and independent common law bad faith claims and the statute of limitations commenced on a different date for each. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number><em>Brewington, </em>\u00b6 28. The first bad faith claim was based on the insurer\u2019s wrongful reduction of benefits. With regard to that claim, we concluded the elements of the claim existed-and the cause of action accrued-in 1987 when the WCC entered judgment restoring the claimant\u2019s total disability benefits. Consequently, that claim was barred pursuant to the statute of limitations three years later in 1990. <em>Brewington, </em>\u00b6 29. \u00b621 The second independent bad faith claim was based on the insurer\u2019s continued refusal to pay the ordered attorney\u2019s fees. We concluded that claim accrued in February of 1996, when the insurer began to make the payments. Thus, the claimant\u2019s bad faith claim based on that conduct, filed less than three years later in 1998, was timely and the district court erred in dismissing that portion of the complaint. <em>Brewington, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 30-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">\u00b622  As in <em>Grenz </em>and <em>Poteat, </em>it is clear that we reached our decision regarding the date of accrual of a bad faith cause of action in <em>Brewington </em>by examining the particular dispute at issue in the underlying workers\u2019 compensation case which gave rise to the allegations of bad faith conduct, and determining when that dispute was resolved. In other words, we determine the accrual date of a bad faith claim arising out of a separate and independent disputed issue by determining whether that particular issue has been ultimately resolved, regardless of the existence or absence of a resolution of other issues within the workers\u2019 compensation case.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">\u00b623 O\u2019Connor urges that an affirmative answer to the certified question before us will produce the very problems for insurers about which we expressed concerns in <em>Fode v. Farmers Ins. Exchange </em>(1986), 221 Mont. 282, 719 P.2d 414, and might \u201cpromote chaos in court dockets and do violence to judicial economy.\u201d In the referenced case, Fode was involved in a three-vehicle accident and Farmers Insurance Exchange (Farmers) insured one of the other drivers. Fode requested Farmers to pay for the property damage he incurred in the accident, but Farmers denied liability and refused to pay the claim. Fode brought a bad faith action against Farmers for allegedly refusing to settle the claim when its liability was reasonably clear. The district court subsequently granted summary judgment to Farmers and Fode appealed. At the time Fode appealed, the degrees of liability for each party involved in the accident had not been determined. <em>Fode, </em>221 Mont. at 284, 719 P.2d at 415.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">\u00b624 On appeal, we vacated the summary judgment entered by the district court and remanded for further proceedings. <em>Fode, 221 </em>Mont. at 286, 719 P.2d at 416. We observed that, as allowed under then-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>existing law, the bad faith case was being pursued even though liability for the accident had not been determined. We also observed that, under then-current procedures,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-4\">[t]he insurance company is put in a difficult position by having to defend a bad faith case before the underlying case has been determined. Discovery of the insurer\u2019s file in a bad faith case raises difficult \u201cwork product\u201d and \u201cattorney-client\u201d problems affecting the underlying case. The practice also allows for undue leverage to be exerted by forcing the insurer to face the prospect of two lawsuits with the additional costs incurred for defense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ATD\"><em>Fode, </em>221 Mont. at 287, 719 P.2d at 417. For those and other reasons, we held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-5\">all proceedings in a bad faith case, alleging violations of the code which require a showing that liability be reasonably clear, are suspended until the liability issues of the underlying case have been determined either by settlement or judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-6\"><em>Fode, </em>221 Mont. at 287, 719 P.2d at 417. <em>Fode </em>has nothing to advance O\u2019Connor\u2019s position here.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">\u00b625 First, <em>Fode </em>is readily distinguishable by the mere fact that it was not a workers\u2019 compensation case and the law and procedures at issue-and of concern-there have since changed. In addition, our holding related solely to existing law and procedures. Finally, while O\u2019Connor\u2019s concerns about insurers, court dockets and judicial economy are appreciated, they are of limited relevance in light of <em>Grenz, Poteat, </em>and <em>Brewington.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">\u00b626 O\u2019Connor also relies on three other non-workers\u2019 compensation cases <em>\u2019-Ridley v. Guaranty Nat. Ins. Co. </em>(1997), 286 Mont. 325, 951 P.2d 987; <em>Safeco v. Montana Eighth Jud. Dist., </em>2000 MT 153, 300 Mont. 123, 2 P.3d 834; and <em>DuBray v. Farmers Ins. Exchange, </em>2001 MT 251, 307 Mont. 134, 36 P.3d 897-in support of her argument here. Although O\u2019Connor concedes in her brief that none of these three cases involves third-party bad faith claims against an insurer and, therefore, do not address the issue of when such a claim accrues, she asserts that they support her argument by analogy. As discussed above, however, <em>Grenz, Poteat </em>and <em>Brewington </em>do address the issue before us and do so within the context of workers\u2019 compensation cases. Therefore, we need not address <em>Ridley, Safeco </em>and <em>DuBray </em>here.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">\u00b627 Based on the above discussion, we restate and answer the reformulated certified question as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b331-10\">\u00b628  For statute of limitations purposes, do statutory and common law bad faith claims against an insurer, predicated on actions taken in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>the adjustment of a workers\u2019 compensation claim, accrue when the Montana Workers\u2019 Compensation Court enters a judgment ordering the insurer to pay for a previously denied benefit, but leaves unresolved the ultimate determinations of the extent and duration of the worker\u2019s disability? Yes.</p>\n<judges id=\"b332-4\">JUSTICES WARNER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b332-5\">JUSTICE NELSON</author>\n<p id=\"A_R\">concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">\u00b629 I concur in the Court\u2019s Opinion. I write separately to express an additional rationale.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">\u00b630 As noted in the Court\u2019s Opinion, the first and most obvious problem in this and similar cases is that the Montana Unfair Trade Practices Act (MUTPA) does not define \u201cunderlying claim.\u201d While that failure might not pose a problem in non-workers\u2019 compensation cases, it does where workers\u2019 compensation claims are involved because of the various determinations that can be made as the worker\u2019s case proceeds through the workers compensation system. Of necessity, the injured worker can, and often does, seek relief from the system at various times as her injury heals or regresses and as her disability status changes. Her \u201cunderlying claim\u201d is always to obtain the statutory benefits to which she is entitled at that time, whether the case will be disposed of finally at that point or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">\u00b631 As to the definition of common law bad faith \u201cclaims\u201d the statute is no more helpful. Title 27, Chapter 2 of the Montana Code Annotated, does not define the word \u201cclaim\u201d either. Title 27, Chapter 2, dealing with statutes of limitation, primarily is written in terms of \u201cactions\u201d or \u201ccauses of action\u201d (although \u00a7 27-2-102, MCA, seems to include \u201cclaims\u201d as an interchangeable substitute.)</p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">\u00b632 Notwithstanding, a claim and an action are not precisely the same. <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>defines an action as \u201c[a] civil or criminal judicial proceeding;\u201d a \u201csuit.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>28-29 (7th ed. 1999). A claim, on the other hand, is defined in terms of \u201crights.\u201d \u201cThe aggregate of operative facts giving rise to a right enforceable by a court.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>240 (7th ed. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-10\">\u00b633 The Workers\u2019 Compensation Act is written using the term \u201cclaim.\u201d <em>See generally, </em>Title 39, Ch. 71, MCA. Hence, a common law bad faith \u201cclaim\u201d is properly described-at least for workers\u2019 compensation purposes-as the \u201caggregate of operative facts giving rise to a right [benefit] enforceable by [the Workers\u2019 Compensation] court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-11\">\u00b634 Accordingly, as to workers\u2019 compensation cases, it seems to me that, absent any statutory definition of \u201cunderlying claim\u201d or \u201cclaim\u201d the more appropriate interpretation of these words is the final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>judgment on the particular operative facts giving rise to the dispute over the particular benefit at issue-as opposed to the final disposition of the action or cause of action that brought the injured worker before the court in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">\u00b635 In that respect, I respectfully disagree with the Dissent\u2019s interpretation of <em>Poteat v. St. Paul Mercury Ins. Co. </em>(1996), 277 Mont. 117, 918 P.2d 677, and <em>Brewington v. Employers Fire Ins. Co., </em>1999 MT 312, 297 Mont. 243, 992 P.2d 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">\u00b636 In my view, underpinning <em>Poteat </em>and <em>Brewington </em>is the acknowledgment that different claims arise during the progress of an injured worker\u2019s case through the system. Some claims are settled or are otherwise finally resolved. Other claims are left open or are reserved for later disposition. An MUTPA action can be filed in connection with the former; such an action cannot be filed with respect to the latter until there is a final judgment. <em>Poteat, </em>277 Mont. at 120-21, 918 P.2d at 679-80.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">\u00b637 The same is true of common law bad faith actions. The cause of action accrues when all the elements of the claim exist or have occurred. Where there are separate and independent torts, the cause of action accrues when all the elements of that tort exist or have occurred. Thus, the common law bad faith statute of limitations as to each cause of action may commence on different dates depending upon when the underlying judgment was entered as to the particular tort at issue. <em>Brewington, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 26-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">\u00b638 The Dissent\u2019s concerns that our decision will promote a multiplicity of law suits and serial litigation may well be true. On the other hand, the Court\u2019s Opinion-which I believe is grounded in existing precedent-allows the injured worker to appeal any final judgment of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court as to a disputed claim whether the entire cause of action is finally disposed of or not. Thus, the injured worker is entitled to a speedy resolution of that claim. And, if the worker prevails, she will enjoy the relief and benefits to which she is then statutorily entitled without having to wait until the entire case is resolved-which in some cases may take years.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">\u00b639 For these additional reasons, I concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b333-9\">JUSTICE COTTER</author>\n<p id=\"Akg\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">\u00b640 I respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s resolution of the certified questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-11\">\u00b641 I agree that some sort of \u201cbright line\u201d must be drawn so as to alert claimants of the date upon which their statute of limitations begins to run on claims for bad faith against an insurer. I further agree that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>workers\u2019 compensation cases differ from conventional tort matters in that, in workers\u2019 compensation cases, there can potentially be multiple judgments or settlements entered. In spite of that fact, or perhaps because of it, I would conclude, as O\u2019Connor urges, that the bright line should be the point in the disposition of the overall compensation claim where liability and the extent and duration of disability have been resolved by judgment or settlement, and not before.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">\u00b642 I do not agree with the Court\u2019s conclusion that such a point of demarcation would be inconsistent with our holdings in <em>Brewington </em>and <em>Poteat. </em>In <em>Brewington II, </em>we were asked to resolve when the statute of limitations ran on two separate claims brought by Brewington against his insurer: the first arising out of the insurer\u2019s wrongful reduction of benefits, which had accrued in 1987 when the WCC restored his total disability benefits following our resolution of <em>Brewington I, </em>and the second based on the ongoing refusal of the insurer to pay his court-ordered attorney fees. We noted that in <em>Brewington I, </em>decided twelve years earlier, there had been a determination that Brewington\u2019s disability was permanent and total, and that Brewington was entitled to a twenty percent statutory penalty. We determined in <em>Brewington II </em>that the statute of limitations in the reduction of benefits matter had commenced to run in 1987 and that this claim was therefore barred. <em>Brewington II, </em>\u00b6 29. However, we held that the claim for fees did not accrue until 1996, and that his claim as to that issue was timely. <em>Brewington II, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 30-31. \u00b643 Clearly, the issues of liability and the nature and extent of disability were resolved by this Court in <em>Brewington I. </em>It therefore made perfect sense for us to conclude in <em>Brewington II </em>that the statute of limitations for Brewington\u2019s bad faith claims arising out of the insurer\u2019s handling of those issues began to run once the WCC restored his benefits following our <em>Brewington I </em>decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">\u00b644 It is important to note that the Court was silent in <em>Brewington II </em>as to whether it considered resolution of all liability and disability claims in <em>Brewington I </em>dispositive with respect to the running of the statute of limitations, or whether it determined that resolution of one \u201cdispute\u201d was the triggering event. Thus, there is as much support in <em>Brewington II </em>for the dissent\u2019s approach as there is for the majority\u2019s. I therefore disagree with this Court\u2019s characterization of our decision in <em>Brewington II </em>as one made on the basis of the resolution of one \u201cdispute\u201d or another by the WCC.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">\u00b645 The argument for O\u2019Connor\u2019s position finds strong support in <em>Poteat, </em>however. In <em>Poteat, </em>we noted that, one year prior to the filing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>of the bad faith litigation, there had been a full and final compromise settlement agreement entered between the parties, which encompassed everything except future medical benefits. We therefore concluded that the District Court had subject matter jurisdiction over those bad faith claims arising before the settlement, but that the claims as to the denial of future medical benefits were not yet ripe. We said at 277 Mont. 120-121:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-4\">Poteat\u2019s underlying worker\u2019s compensation claims for compensation and <em>past </em>medical benefits have been fully settled. Those counts of her suit which encompass unfair trade practices committed <em>before </em>settlement have their basis in a valid existing settlement agreement. Since an underlying settlement is in place as mandated by \u00a7 33-18-242(6)(b), MCA, Poteat may legitimately pursue a UTPA claim in the District Court regarding pre-settlement unfair trade practices. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">It is thus clear that in <em>Poteat, </em>we found the existence of the type of full and final settlement contemplated by \u00a7 33-18-242(6)(b), MCA, to be of pivotal importance in determining whether a bad faith challenge was timely. We did not, as the Court finds at \u00b6 17, simply reach our decision on the basis that a specific \u201cdispute\u201d within the case had been resolved by settlement or judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">\u00b646 I make the foregoing arguments to demonstrate that neither <em>Brewington II </em>or <em>Poteat </em>provide a solid underpinning for the Coui\u2019t\u2019s resolution of the issues before us. If anything, a comprehensive review of these cases supports O\u2019Connor\u2019s argument rather than that of National Union and Alexsis. Choosing which interpretation is correct is, I believe, more than just an academic exercise.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">\u00b647 The Court concludes at \u00b6 25 that the concerns we voiced in <em>Fode </em>about the chaos which could result from piecemeal bad faith litigation, as well as the concerns over judicial economy, are \u201cof limited relevance ....\u201d I disagree. In my judgment, our decision completely ignores the practicalities of both workers\u2019 compensation and bad faith litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"AHq\">\u00b648 By virtue of our decision today, claimants will be required to file a cause of action covering any perceived act of bad faith that occurred prior to the entry of each interim judgment. Because bad faith over the life of a case-be it real or perceived-is generally a <em>course of conduct </em>rather than a set of discrete incidents, there will be an overlap of the bad faith that occurred before, during the course of, and following each interim judgment. Under our decision, the insurer\u2019s course of conduct will have to be broken into artificial subsets for each successive bad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>faith lawsuit. And in each case, the court will have to figure out what portion of the claims\u2019 file of the insurer should be produced in discovery, the insurer arguing for protection of any reference in the file to unresolved issues, and the claimant arguing that the disclosure is incomplete and therefore inadequate to support the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">\u00b649 In <em>Fode, </em>we expressed the following concerns about premature bad faith litigation, borne, we said, from \u201cexperience in the field\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-5\">The insurance company is put in a difficult position by having to defend a bad faith case before the underlying case has been determined. Discovery of the insurer\u2019s file in a bad faith case raises difficult \u201cwork product\u201d and \u201cattorney-client\u201d problems affecting the underlying case. The practice also allows for undue leverage to be exerted by forcing the insurer to face the prospect of two lawsuits with the additional costs incurred for defense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1M\"><em>Fode, </em>221 Mont. at 287. Obviously, it will not be only the insurer that will experience the practical problems our decision will generate. Both parties to a bad faith cause of action will face a potential multiplication of costs and lawsuits, and associated discovery problems. And the courts will be faced with the prospect of multiple claims arising out of one workers\u2019 compensation case.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">\u00b650 There is irony in the parties\u2019 respective positions. The insurer has encouraged-and won-a decision calling for early and serial bad faith litigation, while the claimant has urged a delayed resolution of such claims until the core issues of the case-liability and extent and duration of disability-have been resolved by settlement or judgment. For there to be a \u201cbright line\u201d visible to all, it is important that we choose one course or the other. I would conclude that precedent, reason, and practicality dictate the latter resolution. I therefore dissent from our Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b336-7\">JUSTICE LEAPHART joins in the dissent of JUSTICE COTTER.</judges>\n<judges id=\"A3F\">JUSTICE REGNIER joins in the dissent of JUSTICE COTTER.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
