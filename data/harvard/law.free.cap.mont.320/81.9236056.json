VCS sought a preliminary injunction preventing the Montana High School Association (MHSA) from enforcing its rule that schools must be accredited to be members. The District Court denied VCS\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction and subsequent motion to reconsider. VCS now appeals that decision. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-15\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b104-16\">\u00b62 VCS is a privately run, religious school, providing an education to students in grades Kindergarten through twelve. VCS is limited in the pool of teachers it may hire by its own criteria. VCS\u2019s most important standard is that teachers personally recognize Jesus Christ as their personal Lord and Savior. VCS\u2019s policy requires teachers to integrate the Bible and the teaching of Christ into their daily subject matter. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>VCS hired Doug Dierking (Dierking) to teach science. Dierking was not certified to teach by the Office of Public Instruction (referred to as OPI or the State). Finding that he lacked moral fitness for the profession due to a previous conviction for cruelty to animals, the State declared Dierking was uncertifiable. Nonetheless, given Dierking\u2019s otherwise excellent credentials and experience teaching at the college level and his philosophical fit with the school, VCS determined Dierking had been \u201ccalled by God\u201d and hired him.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">\u00b63 In order for a school to be accredited by the State, its teachers must be certified. The State does not require private schools to be accredited, but it will accredit private schools which apply and meet the criteria. MHSA is a private, voluntary association of public and private schools in Montana. MHSA promulgates rules and standards for interscholastic activities. Two MHSA bylaws are of import here. First, MHSA membership is conditioned on state accreditation. Second, an MHSA member school may compete on a one-on-one basis with a non-MHSA member school, but any tournament or activity involving more than two schools shall be comprised only of MHSA members. Thus, when VCS hired Dierking, it not only lost the state accreditation it had maintained for fifteen years, but it also lost its MHSA membership and the ability to compete in certain interscholastic competitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">\u00b64 VCS petitioned for a preliminary injunction preventing MHSA from enforcing its membership bylaws against VCS, contending that the bylaws impermissibly burdened its free exercise of religion.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">\u00b65 In reviewing an order granting or denying a preliminary injunction we determine whether the district court committed a manifest abuse of its discretion. <em>Shammel v. Canyon Resources </em>Corp., 2003 MT 372, \u00b6 12, 319 Mont. 132, \u00b6 12, 82 P.3d 912, \u00b6 12. A manifest abuse of discretion is one that is obvious, evident or unmistakable. <em>Shammel, </em>\u00b6 12. However, where the district court denies injunctive relief based on conclusions of law, no discretion is involved, and we review the conclusions of the law to determine whether they are correct. <em>Hagener v. Wallace, </em>2002 MT 109, \u00b6 12, 309 Mont. 473, \u00b6 12, 47 P.3d 847, \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">\u00b66 VCS claims that it has established a prima facie case sufficient to meet any one of the three disjunctive criteria of the preliminary injunction statute. Section 27-19-201, MCA. VCS contends MHSA\u2019s bylaws excessively burden its religious freedom; its fundamental right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>to determine the upbringing of their children; and its freedom of association. VCS claims infringement of multiple rights creates a hybrid free exercise claim, and that hybrid claims merit strict scrutiny analysis as stated in <em>Employment Division, Dep\u2019t. of Human Resources v. Smith </em>(1990), 494 U.S. 872, 881, 110 S.Ct. 1595, 1601, 108 L.Ed.2d 876, 887.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">\u00b67 VCS alleges that its free exercise of religion is being infringed in violation of the United States and Montana Constitutions. U.S. Const, amend. I.; Art. II, Sec. 5, Mont. Const. A facially neutral regulation impermissibly infringes on the constitutional requirement of government neutrality if it unduly burdens the free exercise of religion. <em>Wisconsin v. Yoder </em>(1972), 406 U.S. 205, 220, 92 S.Ct. 1526, 1536, 32 L.Ed.2d 15, 28. The United States Supreme Court has established the following test for determining whether there is a burden on the free exercise of religion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-5\">Where the state conditions receipt of an important benefit upon conduct proscribed by a religious faith, or where it denies such a benefit because of conduct mandated by religious belief, thereby putting substantial pressure on an adherent to modify his behavior and to violate his beliefs, a burden upon religion exists.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AWg\"><em>Thomas v. Review Bd. of Indiana Employment Sec. Division </em>(1981), 450 U.S. 707, 717-18, 101 S.Ct. 1425, 1432, 67 L.Ed.2d 624, 634. For purposes of this appeal, MHSA concedes that, although it is a private association, it meets the criteria of a \u201cstate actor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">\u00b68  The first part of the <em>Thomas </em>analysis is to determine whether an important benefit is at issue. We have previously recognized the important interest high school students have in extracurricular activities. In <em>Bartmess, </em>we applied a middle tier analysis to determine the rights of a public school student to participate in his school\u2019s extracurricular activities. <em>St. ex rel. Bartmess v. Sch. Dist. No. 1 </em>(1986), 223 Mont. 269, 275, 726 P.2d 801, 804. In <em>Kaptein, </em>we recognized a student in a private school had a constitutionally-recognized interest in participating in a public school\u2019s extracurricular activities, but we upheld as reasonable the public school\u2019s policy of only providing those activities to its students. <em>Kaptein v. Conrad Sch. Dist. </em>(1997), 281 Mont. 152, 931 P.2d 1311. In light of our decisions recognizing the rights of high school students to participate in extracurricular activities, membership and participation in the MHSA is an important benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">\u00b69 Thus, our analysis of VCS\u2019s claimed burden focuses on \u201cconduct proscribed by a religious faith\u201d and conduct \u201cmandated by religious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>belief.\u201d <em>Thomas, </em>450 U.S. at 718, 101 S.Ct. at 1432, 67 L.Ed.2d at 634. VCS\u2019s claim is premised on a false dilemma of its own creation. It claims that MHSA\u2019s accreditation bylaw requires it to choose between: (1) hiring Dierking and continuing to provide a Christian education; and (2) participating in MHSA. While the MHSA membership rule very well may put substantial pressure on a private school to hire only certified teachers, this does not violate any religious belief. Nothing before this Court indicates that VCS\u2019s internal standard of hiring teachers of faith precludes it from hiring certified teachers. OPI does not refuse certification to those candidates who are religious. OPI simply refuses to grant certification to candidates with low moral character as evidenced by their criminal record. The record establishes that VCS is able to hire certified or certifiable teachers whose religious beliefs are compatible with VCS. For fifteen years, prior to hiring Dierking, VCS hired certified teachers who presumably met its religious requirements, and for that same fifteen-year period it qualified for state accreditation and membership in the MHSA. The situation presented does not satisfy the <em>Thomas </em>definition of a \u201cburden\u201d on religion. As is evidenced by VCS\u2019s fifteen years of compliance, the requirement that teachers be certified is not \u201cproscribed by religious faith.\u201d Furthermore, the hiring of noncertified teachers (such as Dierking) is not \u201cmandated by religious belief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">\u00b610 Our decision here is easily distinguishable from <em>Wisconsin v. Yoder, </em>upon which VCS relies. In <em>Yoder, </em>the United States Supreme Court struck down a Wisconsin statute which burdened the Amish by requiring that all children attend school until the age of sixteen. A central concept to the Amish faith is a fundamental belief that salvation requires life in a church community separate and apart from the world and worldly influence. <em>Yoder, </em>406 U.S. at 210, 92 S.Ct. at 1530, 32 L.Ed.2d at 22. The Amish religion emphasizes a harmony with nature and the soil, a life of goodness, community welfare, and physical labor. Thus, the Amish allowed their children to attend public school only until the eighth grade, but refused high school because it would impermissibly expose their children to the worldly influence of science, competitiveness and socialization. <em>Yoder, </em>406 U.S. at 211, 92 S.Ct. at 1531, 32 L.Ed.2d at 22. The United States Supreme Court noted that the Amish showing of a burden upon their religion was one that probably few other religious groups or sects could make. <em>Yoder, </em>406 U.S. at 235-36, 92 S.Ct. at 1543, 32 L.Ed.2d at 37. Thus, a facially neutral law, applied in a non-discriminatory fashion, and enacted for the general welfare of the citizenry had to yield to the practices of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>Amish, because it was incompatible with their religion.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">\u00b611  In contrast to the situation in <em>Yoder, </em>VCS has not shown that its religious beliefs are incompatible with teacher certification. Rather than attempting to preserve a unique religious culture and a right to live apart from the predations and vices of modern society, VCS seeks to fully integrate itself, and allow VCS students to exemplify their Christian ideals in competition with the students of other schools. V CS strives to be of the world, but not bound to its rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">\u00b612 The United States Supreme Court has held that the free exercise clause does not imply that incidental effects of government programs which may make it more difficult to practice certain religions, but which have no tendency to coerce individuals into acting contrary to their religious beliefs, require government to bring forward a compelling justification for its otherwise lawful actions. \u201cThe crucial word in the constitutional text is \u2018prohibit\u2019: \u2018For the Free Exercise Clause is written in terms of what the government cannot do to the individual, not in terms of what the individual can exact from the government.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lyng v. Northwest Indian Cemetery Protective Ass\u2019n. </em>(1988), 485 U.S. 439, 450-51,108 S.Ct. 1319, 1326,99 L.Ed.2d 534, 548 (quoting <em>Sherbert v. Verner </em>(1963), 374 U.S. 398, 412, 83 S.Ct. 1790, 1798, 10 L.Ed.2d 965, 975 (Douglas, J., concurring)).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">\u00b6 13 [3] Even if one assumes arguendo that the MHSA bylaw requiring accreditation of member schools limits VCS\u2019s pool of potential teacher candidates and thereby makes it more difficult for VCS to offer a Christian education, the bylaw does not have a tendency to coerce individuals into acting contrary to their religious beliefs. We find no constitutional basis for VCS\u2019s contention that MHSA should have to yield to VCS\u2019s wish to employ a teacher who, although devoted to VCS\u2019s religious principles, is not certified by OPI.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">\u00b614 Finally, we note that VCS\u2019s \u201chybrid claim\u201d argument is premised on an assumption that the MHSA bylaws infringe on the free exercise of religion <em>and </em>the exercise of another constitutionally protected right, such as freedom of association. Here, VCS has failed to clear the first hurdle. It has not shown any burden upon the free exercise of religion. Thus, we need not address the hybrid claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">\u00b615 The order of the District Court denying the preliminary injunction is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b108-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, REGNIER, WARNER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b108-10\">JUSTICE NELSON</author>\n<p id=\"As\">dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-11\">\u00b616 I dissent from the majority\u2019s failure to consider Valley Christian\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>hybrid free exercise claim and the majority\u2019s consequent failure to reverse the District Court\u2019s denial of a preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">\u00b617 Section 27-19-201, MCA, specifies when an order for an injunction may be granted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-5\">(1) <em>when it appears that the applicant is entitled to the relief demanded </em>and the relief or any part of the relief consists in restraining the commission or continuance of the act complained of, either for a limited period or perpetually;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-6\">(2) <em>when it appears that the commission or continuance of some act during the litigation would produce a great or irreparable injury to the applicant',</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-7\">(3) <em>when it appears during the litigation that the adverse party is doing or threatens or is about to do or is procuring or suffering to be done some act in violation of the applicant\u2019s rights, respecting the subject of the action, and tending to render the judgment ineffectual',</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-8\">(4) when it appears that the adverse party, during the pendency of the action, threatens or is about to remove or to dispose of the adverse party\u2019s property with intent to defraud the applicant, an injunction order may be granted to restrain the removal or disposition;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-9\">(5) when it appears that the applicant has applied for an order under the provisions of 40-4-121 or an order of protection under Title 40, chapter 15. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-10\">We have previously stated that the subsections of this statute are disjunctive, consequently, findings that satisfy one subsection are sufficient for an injunction to issue. <em>Sweet Grass Farms v. Board of County Com\u2019rs, </em>2000 MT 147, \u00b6 27, 300 Mont. 66, \u00b6 27, 2 P.3d 825, \u00b6 27 (citing <em>Stark v. Borner </em>(1987), 226 Mont. 356, 359, 735 P.2d 314, 317).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-11\">\u00b618 In conducting a hearing on a motion for a preliminary injunction, it is not the province of a district court to determine matters that may arise during a trial on the merits. <em>Knudson v. McDunn </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 61, 65, 894 P.2d 295, 298 (citing <em>Porter v. K &amp; S Partnership </em>(1981), 192 Mont. 175, 183, 627 P.2d 836, 840). Rather, the court should balance the equities and minimize the damage that could befall the moving party if the status quo is not preserved pending the resolution of the underlying action. <em>Porter, </em>192 Mont. at 182, 627 P.2d at 840. The relevant inquiry then is whether the moving party has made out a <em>prima facie </em>case under any of the disjunctive subsections contained in \u00a7 27-19-201, MCA, or shown \u201cthat it is at least doubtful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>whether or not he will suffer irreparable injury before his rights can be fully litigated.\u201d <em>Sweet Grass, </em>\u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">\u00b6 19 In my opinion, V alley Christian did indeed make out a <em>prima facie </em>case under each of the first three subsections of \u00a7 27-19-201, MCA,-more than sufficient for a preliminary injunction to issue. By ignoring the relevant inquiry under \u00a7 27-19-201, MCA, and by instead prematurely reaching the ultimate issues raised in Valley Christian\u2019s complaint, the District Court committed reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">\u00b620 In reaching its decision, the District Court relied on <em>Windsor Park Baptist Church, Inc. v. Arkansas Activities Ass\u2019n </em>(8th Cir. 1981), 658 F.2d 618, wherein the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals determined that the rule conditioning participation in interscholastic activities on state accreditation was a \u201creasonable regulation\u201d of education and that no violation of the Free Exercise Clause had been made out. The District Court erred in applying the \u201creasonable regulation\u201d standard in the instant case as <em>Windsor Park </em>was decided almost ten years before the United States Supreme Court\u2019s articulation of the hybrid claims doctrine in <em>Employment Division v. Smith </em>(1990), 494 U.S. 872, 110 S.Ct. 1595, 108 L.Ed.2d 876.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">\u00b621 MHSA\u2019s membership bylaw is a neutral law of general applicability. It is neither intended to exclude religious schools from membership in MHSA, nor is it intended to exclude any particular religious constituency from membership in MHSA. While it is constitutionally permissible for a neutral law of general applicability to incidentally infringe upon religious freedom so long as the law has a rational basis, a neutral law of general applicability must withstand strict scrutiny if the law burdens religious freedom in conjunction with another fundamental right. <em>Smith, </em>494 U.S. at 880-82, 110 S.Ct. at 1601-02.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">\u00b622 The majority cites <em>Thomas v. Review Bd. of Indiana Employment Sec. Div. </em>(1981), 450 U.S. 707, 717-18, 101 S.Ct. 1425, 1432, 67 L.Ed.2d 624, wherein the United States Supreme Court held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-8\">[w]here the state conditions receipt of an important benefit upon conduct proscribed by a religious faith, or where it denies such a benefit because of conduct mandated by religious belief, thereby putting substantial pressure on an adherent to modify his behavior and violate his beliefs, a burden upon religion exists. While the compulsion may be indirect, the infringement upon free exercise is nonetheless substantial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">Contrary to the majority\u2019s conclusion that no burden on religion exists in the case <em>sub judice, </em>I would conclude that by forcing Valley <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>Christian parents to choose between their children\u2019s attendance at Valley Christian and their children\u2019s meaningful participation in extracurricular activities, the MHSA membership bylaw does burden religious freedom. Similarly, by forcing Valley Christian to choose between belonging to MHSA and hiring a teacher who can implement the school\u2019s Christian educational mission, the bylaw again burdens religious freedom.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">\u00b623 Along with this burden on the free exercise of religion, Valley Christian has asserted another constitutional right.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-5\">When some other constitutional right is combined with a free exercise claim in a so-called \u201chybrid claim,\u201d the state must demonstrate more than merely a reasonable relation to a valid, secular state purpose to sustain the validity of the regulation over First Amendment concerns. Where either parental interests or free speech are asserted in conjunction with a free exercise claim, something more than a mere \u201creasonable relation to some purpose within the competency of the State is required to sustain the validity of the State\u2019s requirement under the First Amendment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ade\"><em>Alabama &amp; Coushatta Tribes v. Trustees of Big Sandy Indep. Sch. Dist. </em>(E.D. Tex. 1993), 817 F.Supp. 1319, 1332 (citing <em>Wisconsin v. Yoder </em>(1972), 406 U.S. 205, 233, 92 S.Ct. 1526, 1542, 32 L.Ed.2d 15; <em>Smith, </em>494 U.S. at 881, 110 S.Ct. at 1601). Valley Christian has advanced just such a \u201chybrid\u201d claim in that MHSA\u2019s membership bylaw burdens Valley Christian parents\u2019 free exercise of religion in conjunction with the right of Valley Christian parents to direct the upbringing of their children.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">\u00b624 The right to direct the upbringing of one\u2019s children is a fundamental right that is grounded in the Due Process Clause. As the United States Supreme Court has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-7\">The Due Process Clause guarantees more than fair process, and the \u201cliberty\u201d it protects includes more than the absence of physical restraint .... The Clause also provides heightened protection against government interference with certain fundamental rights and liberty interests .... In a long line of cases, we have held that, in addition to the specific freedoms protected by the Bill of Rights, the \u201cliberty\u201d specially protected by the Due Process Clause includes the right[ ]... to direct the education and upbringing of one\u2019s children ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-8\"><em>Washington v. Glucksberg </em>(1997), 521 U.S. 702, 720, 117 S.Ct. 2258, 2267, 138 L.Ed.2d 772 (citing <em>Meyer v. Nebraska </em>(1923), 262 U.S 390, 43 S.Ct. 625, 67 L.Ed. 1042; <em>Pierce v.

Thus, the Supreme Court\u2019s recognition of the right to direct the education and upbringing of one\u2019s children as a liberty specially protected by the Due Process Clause reflects that Court\u2019s conclusion that such a right is \u201c \u2018deeply rooted in this Nation\u2019s history and tradition,\u2019... and \u2018implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,\u2019 such that \u2018neither liberty nor justice would exist if [it] were sacrificed. ...\u2019 \u201d <em>Hicks v.

City of South Bend </em>(Ind. 2001), 744 N.E.2d 443, 452-53 and n.11, 12 (collecting cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>\u00b627 While other courts may have adopted more stringent predicates for a hybrid rights claim, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals determined that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-4\">[although the [United States Supreme] Court \u201chas been somewhat less than precise with regard to the nature of hybrid rights,\u201d we recently held that, to assert a hybrid-rights claim, \u201ca free exercise plaintiff must make out a \u2018colorable claim\u2019 that a companion right has been violated-that is, a \u2018fair probability\u2019 or a \u2018likelihood,\u2019 but not a certitude, of success on the merits.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AMW\"><em>Miller v. Reed </em>(9th Cir. 1999), 176 F.3d 1202, 1207 (quoting <em>Thomas v. Anchorage Equal Rights Comm\u2019n </em>(9th Cir. 1999), 165 F.3d 692, 703, 707). I would conclude that Valley Christian has presented a colorable claim in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">\u00b628 Under \u00a7 27-19-201(1), MCA, a preliminary injunction may be granted \u201cwhen it appears that the applicant is entitled to the relief demanded.\u201d Here, Valley Christian appears entitled to relief because, contrary to the District Court\u2019s determination that a \u201creasonable regulation\u201d standard is all that is necessary when analyzing the bylaw, the bylaw infringes on Valley Christian parents\u2019 free exercise of religion in conjunction with the right of Valley Christian parents to direct the upbringing of their children, thus requiring a strict scrutiny analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">\u00b629 Strict scrutiny requires that the membership bylaw be invalidated unless it is justified by a compelling state interest and employs the least restrictive means of furthering that interest. <em>See, e.g., Armstrong v. State, </em>1999 MT 261, \u00b6 34, 296 Mont. 361, \u00b6 34, 989 P.2d 364, \u00b6 34. Moreover, strict scrutiny places the burden on MHSA to demonstrate the constitutionality of the bylaw. <em>Armstrong, </em>\u00b6 41. This burden will be difficult for MHSA to overcome as not even the Board of Education has the authority to require accreditation or teacher certification of private schools. Indeed, Montana law does not impose any requirements that private schools be publicly or privately accredited or that their teachers be publicly or privately certified. MHSA has imposed requirements upon Valley Christian that the Board of Education has no power to impose. In effect, the District Court has granted MHSA authority that the Legislature has not seen fit to grant to either the Board of Education or MHSA. If there were a compelling state interest in requiring private schools to be accredited by the State and to employ only State certified teachers, that interest would presumably be reflected in the law. Ultimately, MHSA\u2019s membership bylaw is simply a convenient mechanism that allows MHSA to assume <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>that its member schools have all met the same level of educational quality.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">\u00b630 In addition to requiring a compelling state interest, strict scrutiny requires that a state actor use the least restrictive means to accomplish its objective. Here, MHSA\u2019s director conceded that it would not burden MHSA to accept an alternative form of accreditation. Thus, even if the bylaw was justified by a compelling state interest, and even if the bylaw was effective in furthering that interest-neither of which has been demonstrated-the bylaw does not further the purportedly compelling interest in the least restrictive manner. <em>See Alabama, </em>817 F. Supp. at 1330.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">\u00b631 Furthermore, the bylaw is meaningless in the context of MHSA\u2019s operations. MHSA has no authority, legal or otherwise, to assure the educational quality of their member schools-that is the job of the Montana Board of Education and the Office of Public Instruction. There is no evidence in the record that Valley Christian students are not as well, if not better, educated than the students of the public school members of MHSA, the non-certified teacher notwithstanding. Moreover, there is no state requirement that private schools such as Valley Christian be accredited. MHSA is thus, in its capacity as a state actor, imposing upon Valley Christian a requirement that even the State does not impose-accreditation. Furthermore, MHSA\u2019s enforcement of this accreditation requirement frustrates Valley Christian parents in the religious upbringing of their children and in their choice of educational institutions in a way that the State of Montana itself does not. The parents have two choices, hire a certified teacher or forego a non-certified teacher that instructs within the tenets of their religious views. The fact that they could hire a teacher that met both criteria for 15 years does not affect the analysis. Until they were no longer eligible to join MHSA, Valley Christian did not have a justiciable controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">\u00b632 Because there is a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of Valley Christian\u2019s hybrid free exercise claim, Valley Christian is entitled to a preliminary injunction under \u00a7 27-19-201(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">\u00b633 Furthermore, under \u00a7 27-19-201(2), MCA, Valley Christian needed only to present a <em>prima facie </em>case that enforcement of the bylaw pending litigation would cause them irreparable harm. Valley Christian presented ample evidence that enforcement of the bylaw would cause Valley Christian students to lose valuable opportunities to enhance their collegiate opportunities. Even if such enhanced collegiate opportunities are never a certainty, participation in formal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>interscholastic competition is itself a type of important experience that most high school students never repeat after graduation. Such lost opportunities cannot be restored, thus the harm is irreparable.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">\u00b634 Finally, under \u00a7 27-19-201(3), MCA, Valley Christian needed only to present a <em>prima facie </em>case that enforcement of the bylaw pending litigation would infringe upon the rights at issue in a manner that cannot be effectively remedied by a favorable resolution of the case. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has asserted that the infringement of a First Amendment freedom, even for a minimal period of time, cannot be effectively restored. <em>Foti v. City of Menlo Park </em>(9th Cir. 1998), 146 F.3d 629, 643.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">\u00b635 Consequently, I would reverse and remand to the District Court with instructions to issue injunctive relief pursuant to \u00a7 27-19-201, MCA, and I dissent from our failure to do so.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
