A jury in the Eighteenth Judicial District Court, Gallatin County, found Slavin guilty of kidnaping and the lessor offense of misdemeanor assault, and he appeals from the judgment entered therein. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">\u00b62 Slavin presents the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b448-10\">\u00b63 1. Whether the District Court properly quashed the defendant\u2019s</p>\n<p id=\"b448-11\">subpoenas for the newspaper reporter and editor to appear and testify at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-12\">\u00b64 2. Whether the District Court abused its discretion in limiting the testimony of the defendant\u2019s expert witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-13\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b448-14\">\u00b65 Slavin was a caregiver for Marion Merryfield (Merryfield). Merryfield suffers from several medical conditions, including Alpha 1 Antitrypsin Deficiency, which is a lung condition, and Left and Right Complex Temporal Lobe Epilepsy, also commonly known as complex seizures. During a seizure, Merryfield can appear awake, conscious, and under control, but not be aware of what is going on around her. She may also run, flail and injure herself, and may also be aggressive if restrained. Merryfield\u2019s condition requires her to be on oxygen and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>various medications, including Prednisone, which can cause Merryfield to act irrationally.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">\u00b66 Due to her condition, Merryfield usually employs a caregiver. In October of 1999, Merryfield employed Slavin as her live-in caregiver. Thereafter, an intimate relationship developed between them.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">\u00b67 On the night of January 18, 2001, Merryfield and Slavin were drinking at Merryfield\u2019s residence. Sometime after midnight, Merryfield called police and reported that Slavin had thrown her against a bookcase. When Gallatin County Deputy Sheriff Paul Lewis (Lewis) arrived, he questioned Slavin about the reported incident and also about a 9mm gun that Slavin owned. Slavin showed Lewis the gun, which was located in a case under the foot of Slavin\u2019s bed. Lewis permitted Slavin to keep the gun. Lewis testified that, after speaking with Merryfield and Slavin, he could not \u201carticulate that a crime had occurred at the residence,\u201d so he decided to give Slavin a ride to a local motel in order to separate the parties. In so doing, Lewis told Slavin not to return to the house until everybody was sober and calm.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">\u00b68 After Lewis left him at the motel, Slavin called Merryfield and told her to come and get him, but Merryfield reported Slavin\u2019s call to police. Lewis then called Slavin. Slavin informed Lewis that Slavinhad asked a friend to take him to the friend\u2019s home. Lewis replied that was fine, but advised Slavin not to return home. However, a few hours later, Slavin did so, and upon his arrival at Merryfield\u2019s home, he retrieved his gun, threw the gun case at Merryfield\u2019s feet, chambered a bullet in the gun, told Merryfield he was going to kill her, and confined her to the house. While Slavin was using the bathroom, Merryfield tried to get away, but Slavin caught her outside and drug her by the hair back into the home and into the bedroom, where he again threatened her with the gun. Slavin kept the gun on her for approximately four hours but eventually he fell asleep on the floor near the front of Merryfield\u2019s bed. Merryfield testified that if she had wanted to leave the room she \u201cwould have had to have gone around him to get to the door to get out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">\u00b69 The following day Merryfield went to the hospital to attend a previously scheduled doctor appointment. She told a nurse, Jane Jacobsen (Jacobsen), and a doctor, Timothy James Adams, M.D. (Dr. Adams) what had occurred between her and Slavin. Dr. Adams, Merryfield\u2019s physician for an emphysema condition, treated Merryfield for injuries to her face and chest. Dr. Adams entreated Merryfield to call the police, but she was fearful that Slavin would retaliate by killing her cat. After Merryfield agreed, Dr. Adams had Jacobsen call <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>the police. Deputy Sheriff Dan Springer (Springer) responded to the call and interviewed Merryfield regarding the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">\u00b610 Slavin was arrested and charged by Information with kidnaping and assault with a weapon. He was subsequently released on bail after Merryfield contacted a bail bondsman, Ben Thielen (Thielen), to arrange for Slavin\u2019s release. Merryfield told Thielen that she wanted Slavin to come back home because she needed him, and that on the night of January 18-19, 2001, she had suffered an \u201cepisode.\u201d After his release, Slavin, with Merryfield, went to see Slavin\u2019s attorney, Ed Guza (Guza). Merryfield told Guza that the incident with Slavin did not happen. Merryfield also told her subsequent caregiver, Jeff Michael Ohannesian (Ohannesian), that she was drunk on the night of January 18-19,2001, that she had wanted to go outside of her home because she had felt hot and confined, and that she did not remember if anyone was in the trailer. Further, Merryfield called Springer and told him that the incident with Slavin did not happen and that she had \u201cmade it all up.\u201d Then, when Slavin was arrested and placed in jail again following a subsequent assault on Merryfield, Merryfield recontacted Springer and told him that she was going back to her original story because Slavin was in jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">\u00b611 Merryfield also spoke with Kathleen O\u2019Toole (O\u2019Toole), a reporter with the <em>Bozeman Daily Chronicle </em>(Chronicle), and Ray Ring (Ring), the <em>Chronicle\u2019s </em>editor, about the incident. An article was published in the <em>Chronicle\u2019s </em>February 16, 2001, edition, wherein Merryfield was quoted as saying that she could not in \u201cgood conscience\u201d say the incident with Slavin occurred \u201cthe way the police describe it\u201d and that because of her conditions, she needs to be restrained sometimes. After the story ran, Guza met with O\u2019Toole and Ring regarding their interview with Merryfield, and he had subpoenas issued for them on June 19,2001, to appear at trial. O\u2019Toole and Ring moved to quash the subpoenas on July 6, and the District Court, referencing \u00a7 26-1-903, MCA, quashed the subpoenas on July 9, the day before trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">\u00b612 Slavin also filed a motion in limine which sought leave for Slavin\u2019s expert, Dr. Paul Bach (Dr. Bach), to testify regarding certain instances of Merryfield\u2019s past conduct in support of Slavin\u2019s theory that Merryfield, on the night in question, had suffered a seizure in which Slavin had been trying to restrain her. These instances included Merryfield\u2019s accosting of a Great Falls police officer who was investigating a car accident, and her subsequent memory lapse regarding the incident; her threat to shoot a neighbor, viewed as an incident of disorderly conduct, and her later inability to remember the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>incident; her initiation of criminal charges against another individual whom she claimed had shot a telephone out of her hand and her later acknowledgment that she had misrepresented facts to police; her arrest for driving 91mph in a 65-mph zone and the State\u2019s subsequent dismissal of the charges due to her medical conditions; Merryfield\u2019s previous allegation that Slavin had assaulted her, her oral and written retraction of the assault report, and later acknowledgment that her retraction had not been truthful; and two DUI charges that Merryfield had pending against her at the time of trial herein. The District Court ruled that Slavin could inquire into the incident involving Merryfield\u2019s claim that a telephone had been shot out of her hand, and about her previous assault allegation against Slavin, including the untruthful statements Merryfield had given in those incidents. However, Slavin was prohibited from inquiring about the assault on the peace officer, the disorderly conduct incident, the speeding ticket, and two pending DUIs.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">f 13 The District Court also permitted Dr. Bach to testify that he had reviewed Merryfield\u2019s file and had based his opinions on other incidents in which she may have acted in accordance with his conclusion about the effects of the seizure disorder and her medication, but that he could not \u201cget into the specific nature of that prior conduct.\u201d The court allowed Dr. Bach to testify generally as to the nature and symptomatology of Merryfield\u2019s disorder and the side effects associated with her medications, combined with alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">\u00b614 Following trial, the jury convicted Slavin of kidnaping but acquitted him of the offense of assault with a weapon and convicted him instead of misdemeanor assault. Slavin appeals the District Court\u2019s decision to quash the subpoenas for O\u2019Toole and Ring and the District Court\u2019s limitation of Dr. Bach\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">DISCUSSION ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">\u00b615 <em>Did the District Court properly quash the defendant\u2019s subpoenas for the newspaper reporter and editor to appear and testify at trial?</em></p>\n<p id=\"AnZ\">\u00b616 The District Court quashed Slavin\u2019s subpoenas for O\u2019Toole and Ring to appear and testify pursuant to \u00a7 26-1-901 et. seq., MCA, the Media Confidentiality Act, commonly known as the reporter shield statute. Slavin argues that the Sixth Amendment and the Montana Constitution guarantee him the right to compel the attendance of witnesses on his behalf and that these constitutional rights should prevail over the reporter\u2019s shield statute. He asserts that O\u2019Toole and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>Ring\u2019s testimony was necessary because Merryfield\u2019s credibility was at issue, and they could have offered testimony regarding Merryfield\u2019s demeanor during the interviews, how the interviews originated, and the specific recantations Merryfield made in the interviews.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">\u00b617 The State argues, first, that Slavin\u2019s constitutional argument against assertion of the reporter privilege was not preserved for appeal. The State also argues that \u00a7 26-1-902, MCA, provides a privilege against compelling O\u2019Toole and Ring to testify and that, even if O\u2019Toole and Ring\u2019s testimony should have been allowed, any error in excluding it was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">\u00b618 Subpoenas for O\u2019Toole and Ring to testify were issued three weeks before trial, but it was not until the Friday before trial that O\u2019Toole and Ring moved to quash the subpoenas. The parties submitted briefs, which they had a half day to prepare, and thereafter the District Court conducted a hearing and quashed the subpoenas on the basis of \u00a7 26-1-901 et seq., MCA. While Slavin did not make any constitutional arguments in his brief, he did raise the constitutional issue during the hearing. Although the State asserts that Slavin\u2019s constitutional issue was not properly raised because O\u2019Toole and Ring did not respond to this argument during the hearing, and the District Court did not address the issue, the limited opportunity Slavin had to prepare for the hearing, and his raising of the issue orally, mitigate against the State\u2019s position. We hold that Slavin properly preserved the issue for appeal. \u00b619 However, we agree with the State that, even if we would conclude that O\u2019Toole and Ring\u2019s testimony was improperly excluded under \u00a7 26-1-902, MCA, any error was harmless under our analysis adopted in <em>State v. Van Kirk, </em>2001 MT 184, 306 Mont. 215, 32 P.3d 735.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">\u00b620 Generally, a trial error is one that occurs during the presentation of a case to the jury and a structural error is typically one of constitutional dimensions that precedes the trial. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 38,40. While any error here technically occurred before the trial, we conclude that it constitutes trial error. Recently, in <em>State v. Flowers, </em>2004 MT 37, 320 Mont. 49, 86 P.3d. 3, we held that an error in failing to exclude a state\u2019s witness, though occurring prior to trial, was nonetheless trial error. We concluded that the error was not \u201cof such magnitude that it undermined the fairness of the entire trial proceeding.\u201d <em>Flowers, </em>\u00b6 27. While the District Court here excluded the evidence in a pre-trial order, this was an evidentiary issue which affected the testimony presented to the jury during the trial. Thus, any error manifested itself in the trial process and can be \u201cqualitatively ... weighed against the admissible evidence introduced at trial.\u201d <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 38. Further, while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>Slavin raised a constitutional argument in support of the introduction of the evidence, quashing the subpoenas was not, in and of itself, an issue of constitutional dimension which affected the framework within which the trial proceeded. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 38; <em>Flowers, </em>\u00b6 27. Slavin does not argue on appeal that the error was structural.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">\u00b621  Trial error is not presumptively prejudicial, but is analyzed to determine whether the error was harmless under \u00a7 46-20-701(1), MCA, the harmless error statute. <em>Van </em>Kirk, \u00b6 40. Slavin asserts that the case against him rested upon Merryfield\u2019s credibility, and that his ability to challenge her credibility was diminished without O\u2019Toole and Ring\u2019s unbiased testimony. He argues that the error was thus prejudicial, and demonstrates that a reasonable possibility existed that the jury would not have convicted him had O\u2019Toole and Ring testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">\u00b622  In response to a claim that error affected the trial outcome, \u201cit then becomes incumbent on the State to demonstrate that the error at issue was not prejudicial.\u201d <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 42. Here, because the claimed error was a court ruling which excluded testimony, the State must demonstrate there was no reasonable possibility that the exclusion contributed to the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">\u00b623 The State argues that Slavin was not prejudiced because he was able to introduce the same evidence of Merryfield\u2019s statements to O\u2019Toole and Ring during Merryfield\u2019s cross-examination. Merryfield testified that she had made the statements to the reporters which were attributed to her in the article, and the relevant portion of the article was introduced as an exhibit. The State notes that Slavin made no offer of proof at trial demonstrating the additional evidence he sought to introduce through O\u2019Toole and Ring. Slavin responds that the reporters could have testified to Merryfield\u2019s demeanor, her willingness to talk to them and her specific recantations.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">\u00b624 The record indicates that Slavin fully explored the interviews with O\u2019Toole and Ring during his cross-examination of Merryfield. Merryfield testified that she had, indeed, told the reporters that the testimony she had given to police about the incident could have been mistaken. The relevant portion of the article itself was admitted as an exhibit and, during her testimony, Merryfield was asked to read aloud from the article in court. She quoted from the article as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-8\">In an interview with the Chronicle Merryfield said some of the trouble was a misunderstanding that stems from her suffering from epilepsy, temporal lobe seizures. She said that at times she needs to be restrained and that she has known Slavin for 30 years and he is her caregiver. I can\u2019t in good conscious say it happened <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>the way the police described it, she said. Even testimony she gave to the police could have been mistaken due to her condition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">\u00b625 Further, Thielen, Slavin\u2019s bail bondsman, testified that Merryfield had told him she had suffered an \u201cepisode\u201d that night. Guza, Slavin\u2019s attorney, testified that Merryfield had met with him and stated that the incident had not happened. Ohannesian, Merryfield\u2019s subsequent caregiver after Slavin, testified that Merryfield had told him that she was drunk on the night of the incident, had gone outside because she had felt hot and confined, and did not remember if anybody else was in the trailer. Springer testified that Merryfield had called him and told him that the altercation between her and Slavin had not occurred and that she had \u201cmade it all up.\u201d Springer also told the court that Merryfield later contacted him, after Slavin was put back in jail, and told Springer she was reaffirming her original story because Slavin was again in jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">\u00b626  There was an abundance of evidence introduced in this trial for Slavin to challenge Merryfield\u2019s credibility. O\u2019Toole and Ring\u2019s observations about Merryfield\u2019s demeanor during the interviews and their versions of her recantations would have added little or nothing to their report in the newspaper article and the other evidence introduced at trial. We conclude that there was no reasonable possibility that any error in excluding their testimony contributed to Slavin\u2019s conviction, and affirm the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">ISSUE TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">\u00b627 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion in limiting the testimony of the defendant\u2019s expert witness ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">\u00b628 Slavin challenges the District Court\u2019s limitations on Dr. Bach\u2019s testimony. Slavin sought leave for Dr. Bach to testify about six instances of Merryfield\u2019s prior conduct and about the medical and legal documents upon which he had relied in reaching his opinion that Merryfield may have suffered a seizure on the night in question, for the purpose of assisting the jury in understanding Merryfield\u2019s disorder. The District Court permitted Dr. Bach to address two of the six instances specifically, and to testify that he had reviewed Merryfield\u2019s file and had based his opinion on her other incidents. The District Court also permitted Dr. Bach to give a general explanation of the nature and symptomatology of Merryfield\u2019s disorder, including the effect of her medications and alcohol, but prohibited Dr. Bach from testifying about the specific nature of the other incidents revealed in the documents he had reviewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>\u00b629 Slavin argues that the District Court allowed Dr. Bach to testify \u201conly in general terms\u201d about the medical and legal documents he had reviewed, and with the limitation upon the incidents about which Dr. Bach could specifically reference, Dr. Bach was prevented from presenting the full picture to the jury, resulting in unfair trial for Slavin. He argues that the restrictions placed upon Dr. Bach\u2019s testimony are inconsistent with this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Benjamin v. Torgerson, </em>1999 MT 216, 295 Mont. 528, 985 P.2d 734.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">\u00b630 <em>Benjamin </em>involved a civil suit alleging that the defendant had sexually abused the plaintiff. We noted therein that the evidentiary standards under Rule 404(b), M.R.Evid., and the modified <em>Just </em>rule, established in <em>State v. Matt </em>(1991), 249 Mont. 136, 814 P.2d 52, were equally applicable in the civil context. <em>Benjamin, </em>\u00b6 17. This Court affirmed the district court\u2019s admission of testimony by defendant\u2019s experts which referenced several prior untruthful statements by plaintiff that were probative, concluding the evidence did not constitute improper comment upon plaintiffs credibility. <em>Benjamin, </em>\u00b6 49. We also affirmed the district court\u2019s exclusion of plaintiffs evidence of defendant\u2019s sexual abuse of other victims as not satisfying the admissibility requirements of Rule 404(b), M.R.Evid. <em>Benjamin, </em>\u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"Aev\">\u00b631 <em>Benjamin </em>is instructive but does not require reversal. The district court in <em>Benjamin </em>considered the proffered evidence of plaintiffs prior untruthful statements very carefully, admitting testimony about some instances, but excluding others. <em>Benjamin, </em>\u00b6 47. We noted the discretion given to trial courts in handling this difficult issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-5\">The fact that discretion is permitted, infers that there may be more than one permissable [sic] way to resolve an evidentiary issue and that the District Court is in the best position to make that decision. In other words, there is not a purely correct or incorrect answer to every evidentiary issue. This is particularly true regarding evidence of prior acts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-6\"><em>Benjamin, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">\u00b632 Here, the District Court carefully considered each of the incidents about which Slavin sought to introduce'evidence, and allowed specific reference to the two incidents in which Merryfield had misrepresented facts to law enforcement, one of which was a previous report Merryfield had made about Slavin. However, mindful of the general prohibition against the introduction of other crimes, wrongs or acts to establish that Merryfield acted in conformance therewith, Rule 404(b), M.R.Evid., the District Court limited Dr. Bach\u2019s testimony about the remaining incidents to only a general reference, because none of those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>incidents involved an untruthful statement by Merryfield.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">\u00b633  This Court will not overturn a district court\u2019s evidentiary determination absent an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Bingman, </em>2002 MT 350, \u00b6 31, 313 Mont. 376, \u00b6 31, 61 P.3d 153, \u00b6 31. Like the trial judge in <em>Benjamin, </em>the District Court devised a careful solution that admitted evidence of Merryfield\u2019s medical condition and her symptomatology, of the side effects of her medication and alcohol use, of Dr. Bach\u2019s general review of her medical and legal documentation, and of two specific incidents which revealed past untruthful statements. Clearly, Slavin was provided an ample opportunity to demonstrate Merryfield\u2019s conditions and limitations thereunder in support of the defense theory. We conclude that in limiting Dr. Bach\u2019s testimony, the District Court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">\u00b634 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b456-6\">JUSTICES NELSON, LEAPHART, COTTER and REGNIER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
