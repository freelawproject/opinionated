Is Terri entitled to attorney fees and costs on appeal?</p>\n<p id=\"b484-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">\u00b69 Terri and Mike married in 1986 and divorced in 1995. They had four children during their marriage, all of whom are still minors. The parties entered into a settlement agreement which was incorporated into the divorce decree. Among its terms, the agreement provided that Mike would pay Terri $1,065 a month in child support and would pay one-half of the children\u2019s uncovered medical expenses. The parties also agreed that Mike would pay specific sums and assume certain debts as part of their property division settlement. In addition, the agreement provided that in an enforcement action, the prevailing party would be entitled to attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">\u00b610 In 1996, Terri brought a motion for contempt because Mike failed to pay the child support, medical support, or property settlement amounts owed. While her motion was pending, both Mike and the company he ran, Winters Roof Co., Inc., filed for bankruptcy. Before the bankruptcy was finalized, the District Court found Mike in contempt of the divorce decree. The District Court lowered Mike\u2019s monthly child support payment to $900 per month for five years, per stipulation of the parties, and ordered Mike to pay the delinquent child support, medical support, and property settlement amounts then due. Terri was also awarded attorney fees incurred as a result of the contempt motion. Subsequently, the bankruptcy court discharged part of the property settlement that Mike was to pay Terri and also discharged the attorney fees she was awarded as a result of the contempt proceeding. However, the bankruptcy court also declared that $16,363.63 of the property settlement Mike owed Terri was nondischargeable.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">\u00b611 Because Mike continued to be delinquent on child support payments, Terri sought assistance from the Child Support Enforcement Division (CSED). The CSED initiated license suspension proceedings to suspend Mike\u2019s driver\u2019s license. During the administrative proceedings, Mike appeared and requested that his monthly child support obligation be modified due to the decrease in income he suffered after the bankruptcy. CSED lowered his payment to $612 per month in November 1997. The CSED also determined Mike\u2019s child support debt to be $13,234.92. As part of its proceedings, the CSED offered to stay its license suspension process if Mike agreed to pay $612 per month plus $50 per month towards his child support arrearages. On June 12, 1998, Mike agreed to the $662 monthly payment in a License Suspension Financial Hardship Payment Plan Agreement. This agreement provided that its terms would continue for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>only one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">\u00b6 12 About a month after Mike signed this agreement, he went to Terri and asked her if she would get CSED \u201coff his back.\u201d The parties then made an oral agreement that Mike would pay $700 per month and that $88 of this payment would go towards Mike\u2019s child support arrearages. While Mike did not make timely payments each month, he was always able to eventually bring his $700 payments current. This agreement continued for a few years until the proceedings at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">\u00b613 In the summer of 2001, Mike\u2019s relationship with his oldest child began to deteriorate. Their relationship worsened to the point that a counselor the child was seeing as a result of these problems recommended that she have no contact with Mike. Because Mike made clear he would not alter his visitation rights with his daughter without a court order, Terri moved to amend the parenting plan in May 2002. As part of this motion, Terri sought to modify the child support payments as she believed a new parenting plan would necessitate child support adjustments. A week later Terri also moved for an order holding Mike in contempt because he failed to pay child support for thi\u2019ee months, failed to pay his share of the children\u2019s uncovered medical expenses, and failed to pay the property settlement that survived the bankruptcy. However, later testimony established that Mike paid the three delinquent months after Terri filed the motion. \u00b614 Subsequently, Terri and Mike were able to agree to modifications of the parenting plan. Their agreement was incorporated into an order by the court. However, the parties could not settle their financial disputes. Further, while the proceedings were pending, Terri executed on a number of Mike\u2019s accounts which he used personally and to conduct his roofing business. As a result, the clerk of court received $10,750 that Mike had designated for business expenses on a roofing project. The contractor that subcontracted the job to Mike wrote to the court, requesting that the $10,750 be released for Mike\u2019s payroll expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">\u00b615 Following a contentious discovery process regarding Mike\u2019s income and expenses, the court held a hearing on Terri\u2019s motion for contempt and Mike\u2019s motion to dismiss. Both parties testified and introduced evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">\u00b616 The District Court then issued its findings of fact, conclusions of law, and a later judgment. First, the court found that Mike owed $13,234.92 in child support arrearages based on the CSED determination. The court also found Mike owed $5,288 in medical support arrearages based on evidence submitted by Terri. The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>then found that the parties followed the CSED payment plan for a number of years even though it expired in one year. Based on these facts, the court held that Mike was not in contempt of court because he had regularly paid child support. In addition, of the $88 paid each month above $612, the court designated $50 towards child support arrearages for a total of $2,850 and $38 towards medical support arrearages for a total of $2,166.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">\u00b617 Further, based on Mike\u2019s representations that he could afford to pay more, the court increased Mike\u2019s monthly payment by $200 to $812 per month. The court designated $100 of that payment toward child support arrearages and $100 to medical support arrearages. The court waived interest on the child support arrearages, but allowed interest to accrue on the medical support arrearages as of the date of its order. The court also noted interest of $10,474.24 had accrued on the property settlement judgement from the date the bankruptcy court declared the nondischargeable amount was owed.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">\u00b618 The court also determined that a contempt proceeding was not the proper forum to enforce the judgment for the property settlement. At Mike\u2019s request, the court also ordered that one bank account would be exempt from execution for the property settlement judgment so that Mike could continue to conduct his roofing business. Regarding the $10,750, the court released the money to Mike with the requirement that Mike file regular accountings with the court to prove the money was being used for legitimate business expenses. Finally, the court held that Terri was not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees because she did not prevail on the contempt motion. Terri now appeals. Further facts are discussed in detail below.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">\u00b619 Did the District Court violate \u00a7 40-4-208, MCA, when it ordered a deferred payment plan for past due child support and past due medical support?</p>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">\u00b620 Before we address this issue, we first clarify that Terri disputes only how past due child support and past due medical support is to be paid. She does not contest the current amount of child support. Specifically, although Terri asked for modification of current child support when she filed her motion to amend the parenting plan, she does not appeal from the order setting $612 per month as child support. In addition, although the October 1996 order set the child support at $900 per month for five years, Terri does not dispute the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>pi\u2019esent determination that such child support be set at $612 per month. Finally, although the CSED can no longer modify monthly child support amounts without district court approval pursuant to our decision in <em>Seubert v. Seubert, </em>2000 MT 241, 301 Mont. 382, 13 P.3d 365, the 1997 CSED action setting Mike\u2019s payment at $612 per month was valid because our decision in <em>Seubert </em>was not retroactive. Therefore, we focus only on the District Court\u2019s determination that Mike may make periodic payments of $100 per month for past due child support and $100 per month for past due medical support, rather than paying all past due amounts immediately.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">\u00b621 Terri asserts the District Court\u2019s payment schedule violates \u00a7 40-4-208, MCA, because the $200 per month payment plan constitutes a retroactive modification of child support and medical support owed under a prior order which was due prior to her motion. She cites <em>Williams v. Budke </em>(1980), 186 Mont. 71, 606 P.2d 515, in support of her argument that a district court cannot make an exception to \u00a7 40-4-208, MCA, and set up a deferred payment plan for past due support, without first finding the payor in contempt of one of the court\u2019s previous orders. Terri notes the District Court did not find Mike in contempt here, so it did not have the power to restrict her right to execute for the past due amounts by setting up a payment plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">\u00b622 Terri also notes the court erroneously found Mike made 57 payments toward the past due amounts because the court assumed he continued to make such payments after the November 2002 hearing until the Court entered its February 2003 findings of fact and conclusions of law. In other words, Terri asserts the court improperly credited Mike for arrearages because he stopped making any arrearage payments after the November hearing. Finally, Terri requests this Court to order that a judgment be entered for the full past due amounts, as she requested in the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">\u00b623 Mike argues the District Court was allowed to set a payment plan for past due amounts even though it did not find him in contempt because the court essentially determined that he followed an agreement made by the parties for past due amounts. He asserts that under <em>In re Marriage of Cook </em>(1986), 223 Mont. 293, 725 P.2d 562, and <em>In re Marriage of Jensen </em>(1986), 223 Mont. 434, 727 P.2d 512, an oral agreement between the parties followed for a number of years constitutes estoppel, another exception to strict application of \u00a7 40-4-208, MCA. Mike asserts that estoppel exempts those past due amounts from execution. We also note that Mike does not argue the District Court should not have increased the monthly payments towards <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>arrearages even though the increase is not pursuant to any agreement between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">\u00b624  After reviewing the record, we hold the District Court properly set up a payment plan for the past due child support because of the prior agreement between the parties. However, we also hold the District Court improperly set up a payment plan for the past due medical support because the parties made no prior agreement regarding medical support. We first address the rules governing the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">\u00b625 The general rule is that each installment of support becomes a judgment debt when it becomes past due under a divorce decree. <em>In re Marriage of Hooper </em>(1991), 247 Mont. 322, 327, 806 P.2d 541, 544; <em>In re Marriage of Sabo </em>(1986), 224 Mont. 252, 254, 730 P.2d 1112, 1113; <em>Williams, </em>186 Mont. at 77, 606 P.2d at 518. The party to whom the support is owed can execute on this judgment. Section 40-4-208(1), MCA, codifies this rule in that a court may not retroactively modify support payments that are already past due. The statute reads: \u201ca decree may be modified by a court as to support only as to installments accruing subsequent to actual notice to the parties of the motion for modification.\u201d We have held \u00a7 40-4-208(1), MCA, prevents a court from cancelling past due amounts or providing the manner in which past due amounts may be paid, thereby preventing execution. <em>Dahl v. Dahl </em>(1978), 176 Mont. 307, 577 P.2d 1230 <em>overruled on other grounds by In re Marriage of Sabo </em>(1986), 224 Mont. 252, 730 P.2d 1112; <em>Williams, </em>186 Mont. at 75-78, 606 P.2d at 517-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">\u00b626 However, there are exceptions to this rule, two of which are relevant here. For example, we held in <em>Williams </em>that a court may set a payment plan for past due amounts if the court first finds the payor in contempt of a previous order of the court. <em>Williams, </em>186 Mont. at 78, 606 P.2d at 519. The contempt finding of the court gives it jurisdiction to enforce a support order by staying punishment for contempt if the defaulting party purges the contempt by making the designated payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">\u00b627 As another example, a court can order retroactive modification of child support payments if the principles of estoppel which this Court has adopted for support payments apply. This exception requires proof that the parties made a prior agreement in good faith to modify such payments and then followed that agreement for a significant period of time. <em>Marriage of Hooper, </em>247 Mont. at 324, 806 P.2d at 543. This exception applies only when there is also a substantial and continuing change in circumstances rendering the prior order inequitable. <em>See also </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number><em>Willoughby v. Loomis </em>(1994), 264 Mont. 44, 869 P.2d 271. Under either of these exceptions, the payee may be precluded from executing on past due amounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">\u00b628 We assess the District Court\u2019s actions in light of these rules. First, by ordering a payment plan for past due amounts, the District Court retroactively modified payments accruing previous to Terri\u2019s motion. Therefore, the court\u2019s action was only proper if it falls within an exception to the strict rule of \u00a7 40-4-208, MCA. As we discuss below, we hold the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it decided not to hold Mike in contempt of court. Accordingly, the exception allowing a court ordered payment plan for past due amounts based on a finding of contempt does not apply here.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">\u00b629 In contrast, the long established estoppel exception to \u00a7 40-4-208, MCA, applies in this instance because of the agreement Mike and Terri made and then followed. Terri initially argues Mike is not entitled to raise the estoppel argument because he did not argue estoppel in his brief in opposition to her motion or raise it at the hearing and the trial court <em>sua sponte </em>retroactively modified the past due support installments. However, because Mike and Terri presented undisputed facts regarding an agreement between the parties which served as the basis for the District Court\u2019s payment plan, because Terri asserted the existence an agreement in her motion for contempt, and because the District Court acted on the evidence before it, this Court will address the application of estoppel to the facts here.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">\u00b630  We have held estoppel as it relates to support payments occurs when there is (1) a substantial and continuing change in circumstances rendering enforcement of the original decree of child support inequitable; (2) mutual agreement between the parties made in good faith; and (3) conduct over a period of years consistent with the agreement. <em>Marriage of Hooper, </em>247 Mont. at 324, 806 P.2d at 543. When there is not mutual agreement between the parties, the generally applicable elements of estoppel might also apply to allow retroactive modification. <em>See, e.g., In re Marriage of Shorten, </em>1998 MT 267, \u00b6 18, 291 Mont. 317, \u00b6 18, 967 P.2d 797, \u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">\u00b631 In this case, both parties testified to making an express agreement with each other in July 1998. Therefore, we consider the elements of estoppel as set forth in <em>Hooper. </em>Terri asserts in her contempt motion that: \u201cthe parties agreed that Mike would pay Terri directly and since that time he has paid $700 each month.\u201d Mike testified that according to the agreement between the parties, of the $88 additional payment, $38 would go to past child support and $50 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>was to be designated however Terri wished. Terri testified they agreed the $88 was to go toward the child support arrearages. Therefore, the evidence is undisputed that the parties made and followed an agreement in good faith regarding past due child support for over three years. Even though Mike did not pay for the three months prior to Terri\u2019s contempt motion, by the time the hearing was conducted, Mike was current with the $700 per month payment. Because Terri does not dispute the propriety of change in current child support due from $1065 per month to $612 per month, the facts demonstrate substantial and continuing change rendering enforcement of the original order as inequitable. Therefore, their undisputed agreement satisfies all the elements of the estoppel exception to \u00a7 40-4-208, MCA, as set out in <em>Hooper, </em>and the District Court did not err in finding Mike was entitled to rely on Terri\u2019s conduct in making the agreement with him and then following it for a substantial period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">\u00b632 Although the court did not analyze the elements of estoppel in detail, it stated \u201c[w]hile the [CSED] financial hardship plan expired in a year, the parties have acted in accordance with the agreement.\u201d This finding essentially embodies the estoppel exception. Accordingly, the District Court had authority to retroactively modify past due child support payments under the estoppel exception by ordering a payment plan pursuant to the parties\u2019 agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">\u00b633 We need not address the issue that the court amended the parties\u2019 agreement by increasing Mike\u2019s payment towards child support arrearages to $100 per month because Mike does not dispute the court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">\u00b634 We affirm the court\u2019s order setting up a payment plan for Mike for past due child support in the amount of $100 per month. Thus, Mike\u2019s property is not subject to execution for past due child support as long as he follows the court order.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">\u00b635 The District Court did, however, err in ordering a deferred payment plan for past due medical support. There is no evidence of an agreement between the parties to which estoppel could apply. On the contrary, the court specifically acknowledged that it\u2019s payment plan for past due medical support was not due to the parties\u2019 agreement, but to Mike\u2019s request during the proceedings. The court stated: \u201cIn addition to the $50.00 arrearage payment each month [as set by the CSED], the respondent has paid an extra $38.00. The respondent has asked the Court to apply that to medical expenses, and it is reasonable to do so.\u201d Nowhere does Mike assert he and Terri agreed part of his payment would be credited to past due medical support. Further, Terri asserts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>Mike refused to pay the medical bills she did give him. As there was no agreement and performance thereof which would estop Terri from asserting her right to immediate payment, the court erred in setting up a payment plan for the medical support arrearages. We reverse the court\u2019s order setting up a payment plan for Mike for past due medical support in the amount of $100 per month. We remand to the District Court to issue a judgment for the amount of past due medical support. \u00b636 Finally, as to Terri\u2019s assertion that Mike did not pay any amounts toward either the child support or medical support arrearages between the court\u2019s November 2002 hearing and its February 2003 findings of fact, Mike does not contest her representations. Therefore, we remand to the District Court so that it may adjust its judgment based on paid past due child support and past due medical support to properly account for Mike\u2019s actual payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">ISSUE TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">\u00b637 Did the District Court err in declining to hold Mike in contempt of its past orders?</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">\u00b638 The District Court held that Mike was not in contempt because Terri did not meet her burden to establish that Mike had the ability to pay more. At the same time, the court held it was valid for Terri to bring the motion for contempt because Mike was \u201cless than forthcoming\u201d about his finances. Further, the court found that Mike had the ability to pay more than he was paying because the court increased Mike\u2019s monthly payments to an amount Mike indicated he could pay. Regarding child support, the court held Mike was not in contempt of its earlier orders because he had been paying child support since the parties\u2019 agreement in July 1998. The court also declined to hold Mike in contempt on the past due medical support because Terri failed to regularly supply Mike with copies of the bills. Finally, the court held that contempt was not a proper method for Terri to collect on the property settlement that survived the bankruptcy proceeding. \u00b639 Terri argues the District Court erred in failing to hold Mike in contempt because the court\u2019s conclusion that she failed to meet her burden to show Mike\u2019s increased ability to pay is inconsistent with the court\u2019s conclusion that Mike could pay a greater amount each month. Further, Terri asserts the court ignored clear and convincing evidence that demonstrated Mike\u2019s ability to pay. For example, Terri argues that because Mike is self employed as a specialized contractor and because he holds a United States patent on a heated valley for metal roofs, Mike is able to earn greater income. She asserts that because he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>did not provide her the necessary information to prove his income, Mike should not be allowed to benefit from this wrong. Terri points out that she was forced to look at the only information Mike provided, his general ledgers and tax returns, in order to show spending patterns that proved he conducted his business in cash and that he was able to pay more. Terri argues the evidence shows Mike spends far in excess of what he claims to earn as income and that his inconsistent testimony at the various hearings showed he lacked credibility regarding his income. Finally, as to the medical support payments, Terri asserts she stopped giving Mike bills after years of his refusal to pay. She also asserts Mike\u2019s position that he could not afford to pay lump sums when she submitted bills to him at the end of the year was disingenuous because his records show large year end payments for non-necessary items like raffle tickets.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">\u00b640 Mike asserts the District Court properly decided not to hold him in contempt because Terri failed to show he was not in compliance with the court\u2019s orders and failed to demonstrate he had an ability to pay more than he was paying.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">\u00b641  We agree with the District Court. The disobedience of any process of court can constitute contempt. Section 3-l-501(l)(e), MCA. Where there is compliance with the court\u2019s previous orders, a party will not be found in contempt. <em>Heath v. Heath </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 522, 901 P.2d 590. Because contempt is intended as a discretionary power necessary to enforce the dignity and authority of the court, we review the findings and decision in a family law matter not to hold a party in contempt for a blatant abuse of discretion. <em>In re Marriage of Baer, </em>1998 MT 29, \u00b6 45, 287 Mont. 322, \u00b6 45, 954 P.2d 1125, \u00b6 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">\u00b642 In this case, the crux of the contempt issue is not Mike\u2019s ability to pay, but rather whether he complied with previous court orders. As discussed above, Mike was essentially in compliance with the court\u2019s previous orders on child support because, pursuant to the parties\u2019 agreement, he paid an amount greater than required in the CSED payment plan. This payment plan was the last proceeding filed in the court on the issue of child support before Terri\u2019s most recent motion for contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">\u00b643  As to the court\u2019s previous orders regarding medical support, the District Court\u2019s decision not to hold Mike in contempt was not a blatant abuse of discretion because of the undisputed fact that Terri did not continue to give Mike copies of all the medical bills. As to the property settlement preserved by the bankruptcy court, Terri has had the power to execute on that judgment since it was issued. Therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>the District Court\u2019s decision not to hold Mike in contempt for failure to pay this amount was also not a blatant abuse of discretion. While Terri was free to bring a contempt motion regarding the judgment, her actions do not bind the District Court\u2019s decision on whether to hold Mike in contempt. We affirm the District Court\u2019s decision not to hold Mike in contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">ISSUE THREE</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">\u00b644 Did the District Court err in ordering Mike was not required to pay interest on the past due child support?</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">\u00b645 The District Court stated: \u201cThis Court is aware because of prior cases involving CSED agreements, that interest on the [child support] arrearage is waived as long as payments are made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">\u00b646 Terri asserts the District Court erred because interest must be paid pursuant to \u00a7 25-9-205, MCA, and <em>Williams, </em>186 Mont, at 79,606 P.2d at 519. She argues that even if interest was waived after the CSED plan was in effect, Mike still owes interest on the amounts not paid previous to June 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">\u00b647 Mike asserts the District Court properly waived interest because he is entitled to the same treatment as other payors under a CSED payment plan on equitable grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">\u00b648 On this point, we hold the District Court erred in not ordering that interest be paid on the past due child support. In <em>Williams, </em>186 Mont. at 78-80, 606 P.2d at 519-20, we held that when the marital dissolution decree is silent as to interest, such interest is automatically collectible by the judgment creditor spouse on past due payments for support or maintenance, the same as any other money judgment. We also held that denying interest on the past due support also amounted to a retroactive modification in violation of \u00a7 40-4-208, MCA. The question of whether the estoppel exception discussed above could also apply to accruing interest if the elements of estoppel were met by an agreement and the conduct of the parties is not presented by the situation here.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-10\">\u00b649  In this case, the District Court\u2019s decision to deny interest was based on its understanding of CSED policies. However, the record does not support the District Court\u2019s understanding because nothing in the CSED payment plan prevents interest from accruing on past due amounts as part of the license suspension action. Mike cites no administrative rule from CSED or text from his payment plan agreement in support of the District Court\u2019s decision. Therefore, the District Court erred when it failed to order that interest at the legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>rate of 10% per annum be paid on the past due child support amount pursuant to \u00a7 25-9-205, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">ISSUE FOUR</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">\u00b650 Did the District Court err in exempting one of Mike\u2019s business accounts from execution by Terri?</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">\u00b651 In order to prevent another situation in which the court would be asked to return an executed amount by one of Mike\u2019s customers, the District Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-8\">[Mike], to ensure that he can conduct his business and make sufficient monies to pay his obligations, shall be able to designate one business account that shall be free from execution. [Mike] shall provide the Court with a report concerning all activity within that account every four (4) months ... [until all amounts are paid].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">Because the court did not allow execution for the past due child support and past due medical support by virtue of its deferred payment plans, the court specifically applied the exemption for Mike\u2019s business account to be free from execution for the property settlement that survived the bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-10\">\u00b652 Terri asserts the court was without authority to exempt an account from execution. She cites <em>State v. Dawson </em>(1984), 207 Mont. 417, 674 P.2d 1091, in support of her argument that such a restriction also constitutes retroactive modification of a divorce decree in violation of \u00a7 40-4-208, MCA. She also asserts the court\u2019s actions violated the proceedings for execution codified at Title 25, Chapter 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-11\">\u00b653 Mike asserts that the exemptions for personal income provided for in Title 25, Chapter 13, do not apply to his situation because the exempt account is for business expenses that are not personal income to him. Mike argues the District Court had equitable power to address the situation between the parties and set up such an exempt account.</p>\n<p id=\"A9N\">\u00b654 We hold that the District Court did not have the authority to order a bank account exempt from execution. While the evidence introduced regarding the situation between the parties warrants constant monitoring by the District Court, the authority to exempt an account from execution is not provided for by our statutory scheme. Title 25, Chapter 13, Part 6, provides for general exemptions from execution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The relevant sections include \u00a7 25-13-609(3), MCA, and \u00a7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>25-13-614, MCA. Section 25-13-609(3), MCA, provides that up to $3,000 worth of the implements, professional books, and tools of the debtor\u2019s trade are exempt from execution. In contrast \u00a7 25-13-614, MCA, exempts a percentage of the judgment debtor\u2019s disposable earnings from garnishment. The garnishment limits are not defined so as to account for disposable income in a self employment situation, unlike in an analogous Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceeding<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">\u00b655  The account Mike uses for his business does not fit under either of these two statutes. The funds that pass through his account to cover general business expenses are neither tools of his trade or a percentage of his disposable earnings. Consequently, this type of account is neither addressed nor exempted from execution by Title 25. Therefore, the District Court\u2019s exemption improperly restricts Terri\u2019s ability to levy execution and is also a retroactive modification of the property settlement in violation of \u00a7 40-4-208, MCA. We must disagree with Mike that the District Court had equitable authority to exempt an entire bank account from execution as its order conflicts with the plain language of our execution statutes. We reverse the court\u2019s order exempting one of Mike\u2019s bank accounts from execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">ISSUE FIVE</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">\u00b656 Did the District Court err when it denied Terri\u2019s request for attorney fees and costs pursuant to their original settlement agreement?</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">\u00b657 The District Court determined neither party was entitled to attorney fees because Terri did not prove Mike had an increased ability to pay and because Mike was less than forthcoming about his finances. \u00b658 Terri asserts the District Court erred because it is undisputed Mike breached the settlement agreement incorporated into the divorce decree. She also argues she was the prevailing party because the court ordered Mike to pay past due child support and past due medical support. Tend cites the settlement agreement provision between the parties which reads: \u201cShould any action be commenced to enforce the provisions of this agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee and costs.\u201d Mike asserts that neither party prevailed so neither party is entitled to attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">\u00b659  We agree with the result reached by the District Court. In <em>In re Marriage of Pfennigs, </em>1999 MT 250, \u00b6 42, 296 Mont. 242, \u00b6 42, 989 P.2d 327, \u00b6 42, we held that a contractual provision awarding attorney fees to the prevailing party in a divorce action was not effective when each party prevailed on different issues. The same is true in this case in that Terri failed to prevail on her contempt motion and Mike failed to prevail on his motion to dismiss. Therefore, the District Court acted within its discretion when it denied fees to both parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">ISSUE SIX</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">\u00b660 Is Terri entitled to attorney fees and costs on appeal?</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">\u00b661 Terri also requests fees and costs on appeal pursuant to the settlement agreement provision. Again, because she only prevails on some of the above issues, she is not entitled to costs and fees on appeal. Each party shall pay their own costs and fees on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">\u00b662 Finally, Terri requests this Court set a date certain when Mike\u2019s monthly child support payments will be due. The District Court can address this issue on remand if an appropriate petition is filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b496-10\">\u00b663 Because the District Court properly ordered a deferred payment plan for past due child support based on the parties\u2019 agreement, we affirm. We also affirm the court\u2019s decision not to hold Mike in contempt. We reverse the court\u2019s order setting up a deferred payment plan for past due medical support and stopping interest from accruing on the past due child support. We reverse the court\u2019s order exempting one of Mike\u2019s bank accounts from execution. We affirm the court\u2019s decision not to award either party attorney fees. Thus, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b496-11\">JUSTICES COTTER, REGNIER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b494-12\"> There are other specific exemptions in other parts of the code, see Title 25, Chapter 13, Part 6, Cross References.

Mercill </em>(1986), 220 Mont. 146, 714 P.2d 132, we noted that by enacting \u00a7 31-2-106, MCA, Montana uses the same exemptions for execution as for bankruptcy and that Montana does not follow the federal list of bankruptcy exemptions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b496-12\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY,</author>\n<p id=\"Aqb\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-14\">\u00b664 I join in the Court\u2019s opinion on all issues except Issue 1.1 dissent from the opinion, analysis and result on the portion of Issue 1 which relates to whether the District Court violated \u00a7 40-4-208, MCA, when it ordered a deferred payment plan for past due child support. The bases for my dissent in this case are along the same lines as those set forth generally in my recent concurring and dissenting opinion in <em>In </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number><em>re Marriage of Mease, </em>2004 MT 59, \u00b6\u00b6 67-74, 320 Mont. 229,\u00b6\u00b6 67-74, 92 P.3d 1148, \u00b6\u00b6 67-74 (Gray, C.J., concurring and dissenting). My concerns there centered on the Court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>insertion of a rationale not advanced in the trial court or on appeal by the party in whose favor the Court acted, and how often and on what basis the Court intended to do so. I will not repeat my concerns here at length since they are readily available in another marital case opinion less than two weeks old. <em>See Mease, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 67-74 (Gray, C. J., concurring and dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">\u00b665 It is true that here, the Court \u201cmerely\u201d permits Mike to raise and prevail on the estoppel theory for the first time on appeal whereas, in <em>Mease, </em>the Court <em>sua sponte </em>inserted a statute argued by neither party in the district court,or on appeal. But while the Court\u2019s act here is not precisely the same, its willingness to decide a case on the basis of a theory never presented to the District Court is no less troubling. This is particularly true when one of our most basic operating principles is that we do not consider new issues or changes in theory on appeal. <em>See Dayberry v. City of East Helena, </em>2003 MT 321, \u00b6 24, 318 Mont. 301, \u00b6 24, 80 P.3d 1218, \u00b6 24; <em>In re Marriage of Oehlke, </em>2002 MT 79, \u00b6 30, 309 Mont. 254, \u00b6 30, 46 P.3d 49, \u00b6 30; <em>Renner v. Nemitz, </em>2001 MT 202, \u00b6 15, 306 Mont. 292, \u00b6 15, 33 P.3d 255, \u00b6 15; <em>Pearson v. Virginia City Ranches Ass\u2019n, </em>2000 MT 12, \u00b6 57, 298 Mont. 52, \u00b6 57, 993 P.2d 688, \u00b6 57; <em>Unified Industries, Inc. v. Easley, </em>1998 MT 145, \u00b6 15, 289 Mont. 255, \u00b6 15, 961 P.2d 100, \u00b6 15; <em>Clover Leaf Dairy v. State </em>(1997), 285 Mont. 380, 387, 948 P.2d 1164, 1168; <em>Sherrodd, Inc. v.

Law Firm of Graybill, Ostrem, Warner &amp; Crotty </em>(1990), 246 Mont. 175, 180, 803 P.2d 1089, 1092-93; <em>Chamberlain v. Evans </em>(1979), 180 Mont. 511, 517, 591 P.2d 237, 240; <em>Bower v. Tebbs </em>(1957), 132 Mont. 146, 160, 314 P.2d 731, 739.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">\u00b666 The Court begins its discussion of the estoppel theory regarding child support payments at \u00b6 27. Its general statements of the principles underlying that theory are correct. Its decision, in \u00b6 28, to assess the District Court\u2019s actions \u201cin light of these rales\u201d is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">\u00b667 The Court, Mike and I all agree that the District Court did not expressly apply estoppel. The reason, of course, is that Mike did not present it. Our case law on estoppel in these situations is clear. Indeed, we stated without equivocation in <em>In re Marriage of Cook </em>(1986), 223 Mont. 293, 300, 725 P.2d 562, 566, that \u201c[o]nly in cases where equitable estoppel is found <em>by the trial court </em>upon clear and compelling evidence may [equitable estoppel] override the provisions of \u00a7 40-4-208, MCA.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>(Emphasis added.) The trial court did not make an estoppel finding in this case, much less a finding based on clear and compelling evidence. Thus, the Court\u2019s statement in \u00b6 29 that the long established estoppel exception to \u00a7 40-4-208, MCA, applies here is simply incorrect, in addition to the fact that the doctrine is being raised for the first time on appeal. Neither <em>Hooper </em>nor Shorten-relied on by the Court for the principles of estoppel-supports action by this Court in applying equitable estoppel for the first time on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">\u00b668 The Court also does not take into account the fact that estoppel is an affirmative defense which must be pled pursuant to Rule 8(c), M.R.Civ.P. Mike did not plead it in his answer or even raise it in his posttrial proposed findings of fact, conclusions of law and order. The Court, however, content with its view that evidence of record would have supported the estoppel theory, merrily applies estoppel to Mike\u2019s advantage and Terri\u2019s clear disadvantage. I cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">\u00b669 Perhaps our long-standing and oft-repeated principle that we do not permit a party to raise new issues or change its theories on appeal is verging on extinction, along with our usual willingness to restrain ourselves from injecting new matters not presented by either party. <em>See Mease, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 67-74 (Gray, C.J., concurring and dissenting). Such matters concern me greatly.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">\u00b670 We have often been subjected to criticism by lawyers who should know better that our decisions in marital dissolution actions are \"all over the map\u201d and totally lacking in consistency. I have, over the years, attempted to explain to such lawyers that the reasons our opinions in this area <em>appear </em>to be in disarray are that (1) the cases are extraordinarily fact specific and, with regard to a trial court\u2019s findings, it takes very little to sustain them; and (2) trial courts have inordinately broad discretion in many aspects of dissolution cases and abuses of that discretion seldom are established. In other words, based on very specific facts-supported by the record-the court exercises its broad discretion. Affirming a trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion based on very specific facts in one case does not require a reversal of a different trial court\u2019s exercise of its broad discretion in a different-but somewhat similar-case.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">\u00b671 By the Court\u2019s actions here and in <em>Mease, </em>however, our marital cases do seem to be heading toward total disarray. How will parties ever know whether their case will be subjected to the usual rules or be changed significantly on appeal by this Court? Why would trial judges have any interest in continuing to do their work carefully and with dedication, knowing that this Court will remake the cases however it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>sees fit? How can we possibly meet our obligation to provide guidance for future cases to lawyers and trial courts when we act so irresponsibly?</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">\u00b672 It is my view that, absent the Court\u2019s consideration of the estoppel theory raised by Mike for the first time on appeal, Terri would prevail in the child support portion of Issue 1. In <em>Mease, </em>Robert would have prevailed on Issue 4 had the Court confined itself to the issues presented by the parties. Clearly, the Court has no bias in favor of or against wives or husbands. But equally clearly, the Court seems to have little concern for the due process rights of the party it chooses not to \u201cassist\u201d in prevailing on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">\u00b673 I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
