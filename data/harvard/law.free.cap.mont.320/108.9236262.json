The District Court denied MACo\u2019s motion, and MACo appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">\u00b62 We restate the sole issue on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err when it determined that MACo was not entitled to a collateral source reduction of the jury\u2019s award?</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">\u00b64 Robert Haman, a Cascade County Deputy Sheriff, was injured in the course and scope of his employment on July 23, 1998. Haman\u2019s injury occurred when his vehicle was struck by a vehicle driven by Kevin Kofod. At the time of the accident, Kofod was insured by State Farm Mutual Insurance Company. The vehicle operated by Haman was owned by Cascade County and insured by MACo. Haman was personally insured by Great Northwest Insurance Company, Inc. (Great Northwest).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-10\">\u00b65 On May 30,2001, Haman filed a complaint against Kofod, alleging that Kofod\u2019s negligence was the cause of his injuries. Haman\u2019s complaint also named MACo and Great Northwest as defendants, in their capacity as underinsured motorist carriers. Haman subsequently settled his claims against Kofod and Great Northwest on January 31, 2002, and April 19,2002, respectively. The case proceeded to jury trial on June 10, 2002. On June 12, 2002, the jury awarded Haman damages in the amount of $173,000. The jury\u2019s award was then reduced by $130,000, to reflect the settlements Haman reached with Kofod and Great Northwest, leaving a remaining judgment of $43,000 against MACo.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-11\">\u00b66 Following the accident, Haman also received medical benefits from Montana Association of Counties Joint Powers Insurance Authority Workers\u2019 Compensation Trust (Workers\u2019 Compensation Trust) in the amount of $31,054.70. MACo and Workers\u2019 Compensation Trust are separate and distinct insurance pools. As a result of Haman\u2019s receipt of benefits from Workers\u2019 Compensation Trust, MACo filed a motion requesting that the jury\u2019s award be reduced, pursuant to the collateral source reduction statute, on June 28, 2002. The District Court denied MACo\u2019s motion on September 19, 2002. MACo appealed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>on October 22, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">\u00b67 We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether the court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Brumit v. Lewis, </em>2002 MT 346, \u00b6 12, 313 Mont. 332, \u00b6 12, 61 P.3d 138, \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">\u00b68 Did the District Court err when it determined that MACo was not entitled to a collateral source reduction of the jury\u2019s award?</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">\u00b69 Section 27-1-308, MCA (1997), addresses collateral source reductions in actions arising from bodily injury or death. Section 27-1-308(1), MCA (1997), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-9\">In an action arising from bodily injury or death when the total award against all defendants is in excess of $50,000 and the plaintiff will be fully compensated for his damages, exclusive of court costs and attorney fees, a plaintiff\u2019s recovery must be reduced by any amount paid or payable from a collateral source that does not have a subrogation right. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-10\">MACo alleges that although Workers\u2019 Compensation Trust is a collateral source that paid medical benefits to Ha man, Workers\u2019 Compensation Trust does not have a subrogation right regarding such payments. Therefore, MACo asserts that it is entitled to a collateral source reduction of the jury\u2019s award, pursuant to \u00a7 27-1-308(1), MCA (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-11\">\u00b610 The right of subrogation is addressed in \u00a7 39-71-414(1), MCA (1997), of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Section 39-71-414(1), MCA (1997), provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-12\">If an action is prosecuted as provided for in 39-71-412 or 39-71-413 and except as otherwise provided in this section, the insurer is entitled to subrogation for all compensation and benefits paid or to be paid under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-13\">Thus, pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-414(1), MCA(1997), Workers\u2019 Compensation Trust has a right of subrogation if Haman\u2019s action was brought under \u00a7\u00a7 39-71-412 or 413, MCA (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-14\">\u00b611 The parties concede that \u00a7 39-71-413, MCA (1997), is inapplicable to the case at bar. Therefore, if Haman\u2019s complaint was not brought pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-412, MCA (1997), then Workers\u2019 Compensation Trust does not have a right of subrogation under \u00a7 39-71-414(1), MCA (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>\u00b612 Section 39-71-412, MCA (1997), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-4\">The right to compensation and medical benefits as provided by this chapter is not affected by the fact that the injury, occupational disease, or death is caused by the negligence of a third party other than the employer or the servants or employees of the employer. Whenever such event occurs to an employee while performing the duties of his employment and such event is caused by the act or omission of some persons or corporations other than his employer or the servants or employees of his employer, the employee ... shall, in addition to the right to receive compensation under this chapter, have a right to prosecute any cause of action he may have for damages against such persons or corporations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">\u00b613 Section 39-71-412, MCA (1997), authorizes an employee to pi\u2019osecute an action against a third party, other than his or her employer or fellow employee, whose negligence was the cause of his or her injury. See also <em>State Compensation Ins. Fund v. McMillan, </em>2001 MT 168, \u00b6 7, 306 Mont. 155, \u00b6 7, 31 P.3d 347, \u00b6 7. In the instant case, Haman filed a complaint against Kofod, in which he asserted that Kofod\u2019s negligence was the cause of his injuries. Such an action is clearly the type of action contemplated in \u00a7 39-71-412, MCA (1997). However, Haman\u2019s complaint also named MACo (Cascade County\u2019s underinsured motorist carrier) and Great Northwest (his personal underinsured motorist carrier) as defendants. This Court has previously concluded that underinsured motorist coverage is first-party coverage which is a carrier\u2019s direct promise to its insured to pay the insured for a loss. <em>Dill v. Thirteenth Judicial Dist. Court, </em>1999 MT 85, \u00b6 19, 294 Mont. 134, \u00b6 19, 979 P.2d 188, \u00b6 19. Accordingly, MACo contends that Haman\u2019s action against MACo is not a third-party action within the scope of \u00a7 39-71-412, MCA (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">\u00b614 While MACo correctly points out that underinsured motorist coverage is first-party coverage as between the insured and the insurer, this distinction is not dispositive of the instant issue. That is, when an underinsured motorist carrier accepts a premium from its insured for underinsured motorist coverage, it contractually establishes its own liability for the tort of another. <em>Dill, </em>\u00b6 19. Here, Cascade County provided underinsured motorist coverage to its employees through MACo. Great Northwest provided underinsured motorist coverage to Haman. Therefore, by accepting premiums from Cascade County and Haman for underinsured motorist coverage, MACo and Great Northwest contractually established their own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>liability for the torts of another.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">\u00b615 Haman filed his complaint against Kofod as the tort-feasor, and against MACo and Great Northwest as underinsured motorist carriers. While Kofod\u2019s negligence was the direct cause of Haman\u2019s injuries, MACo and Great Northwest were also liable for such injuries, because of their roles as underinsured motorist carriers. That is, MACo and Great Northwest \u201cstood in the shoes\u201d of Kofod, for the purpose of fulfilling their contractual obligations as underinsured motorist carriers. Consequently, Haman\u2019s action, brought against a third party tort-feasor, and those \u201cstanding in the shoes\u201d of the tort-feasor, was brought pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-412, MCA (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">\u00b616  In light of our above holding that Haman\u2019s action was brought pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-412, MCA (1997), Workers\u2019 Compensation Trust has a right of subrogation under \u00a7 39-71-414(1), MCA (1997). This holding is consistent with <em>Schuff v. A. T. Klemens &amp; Son, </em>2000 MT 357, \u00b6 109, 303 Mont. 274, \u00b6 109, 16 P.3d 1002, \u00b6 109, in which we stated that: \u201cUnder \u00a7 39-71-414, MCA, a workers\u2019 compensation insurer \u2018is entitled to subrogation for all compensation and benefits paid or to be paid under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.\u2019 \u201d Further, because Workers\u2019 Compensation Trust has a right of subrogation under \u00a7 39-71-414(1), MCA (1997), the benefits it paid to Haman cannot be deducted as a collateral source under \u00a7 27-1-308(1), MCA (1997). See also <em>Schuff, </em>\u00b6 109. Accordingly, the District Court did not err when it determined that MACo was not entitled to a collateral source reduction of the jury\u2019s award.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">\u00b617 For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b134-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES WARNER and COTTER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b134-8\">JUSTICE NELSON</author>\n<p id=\"Agh\">dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-9\">f 18 I dissent from the Court\u2019s decision that MACo is not entitled to a collateral source reduction of the jury\u2019s award in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-10\">\u00b619 Section 27-1-308, MCA, the collateral source reduction statute, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-11\">(1) In an action arising from bodily injury or death when the total award against all defendants is in excess of $50,000 and the plaintiff will be fully compensated for his damages, exclusive of court costs and attorney fees, a plaintiffs recovery must be reduced by any amount paid or payable from a collateral source that <em>does not have a subrogation right.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-12\">(3) The jury shall determine its award without consideration of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>any collateral sources. After the jury determines its award, reduction of the award must be made by the trial judge at a hearing and upon a separate submission of evidence relevant to the existence and amount of collateral sources. Evidence is admissible at the hearing to show that the plaintiff has been or may be reimbursed from a collateral source that <em>does not have a subrogation right. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">\u00b620 From this language, MACo concludes, correctly in my view, that only when a collateral source does not have a right of subrogation can a party properly reduce a separate damage award. Therefore, MACo is entitled to a reduction of the judgment if the MACo Workers\u2019 Compensation Trust has no subrogation right against Haman\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">\u00b621 Section 39-71-414, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-6\"><em>[i]fa,n action is prosecuted as provided for in 39-71-412 or 39-71-413 </em>and except as otherwise provided in this section, the insurer is entitled to subrogation for all compensation and benefits paid or to be paid under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">\u00b622 Under the plain and unambiguous language of this statute, i.e., the italicized portion, the MACo Workers\u2019 Compensation Trust has no right of subrogation because Haman\u2019s action against his underinsured motorist carrier was not an action brought under either \u00a7 39-71-412, MCA, or \u00a7 39-71-413, MCA. The latter section provides for an additional cause of action by an injured employee to determine liability of a fellow employee for intentional and malicious actions. Neither party argues that \u00a7 39-71-413, MCA, is applicable in this case as Haman\u2019s action was not against a fellow employee for intentional acts. \u00b623 Section 39-71-412, MCA, provides for an additional cause of action by an insured against a third party, other than an employer and fellow employee. Specifically, this section provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-8\">[t]he right to compensation and medical benefits as provided by this chapter is not affected by the fact that the injury, occupational disease, or death is caused by the negligence of a third party other than the employer or the servants or employees of the employer. Whenever such event occurs to an employee while performing the duties of his employment and such event is caused by the act or omission of some persons or corporations other than his employer or the servants or employees of his employer, the employee or in case of his death his heirs or personal representative shall, in addition to the right to receive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>compensation under this chapter, have a right to prosecute any cause of action he may have for damages against such persons or corporations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">\u00b624 Haman did, indeed, bring an additional cause of action against a third party other than his employer or fellow employee. He sued Kofod, the negligent tortfeasor. Kofod settled pretrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">\u00b625 Section 39-71-414, MCA, makes repeated reference to third party actions against which subrogation is allowed. Haman\u2019s cause of action at issue here, however, is against his employer and his employer\u2019s uninsured motorist carrier, i.e., MACo. Haman\u2019s action is not a third party tort action but, rather, is a first party contract action. Underinsured motorist coverage is first party coverage which is a carrier\u2019s direct promise to its insured to pay the insured for a loss. Our case law makes clear that such disputes are governed by contract law and not by tort law. <em>See, e.g., Dill v. Thirteenth Judicial Dist. Court, </em>1999 MT 85, 294 Mont. 134, 979 P.2d 188; <em>State Farm v. Estate of Braun </em>(1990), 243 Mont. 125, 793 P.2d 253.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">\u00b626 Haman\u2019s present action is not a third party action as provided for in either \u00a7 39-71-412, MCA, or \u00a7 39-71-413, MCA. Haman\u2019s action against MACo is a first party contract action and, as such, does not entitle MACo Workers\u2019 Compensation Trust to subrogation under the italicized language of \u00a7 39-71-414, MCA. MACo\u2019s conclusion in this regard is supported by case law of other jurisdictions. <em>See, e.g., Liberty Mut. v. Kinser </em>(Tex. App. 2002), 82 S.W.3d 71 (workers\u2019 compensation insurer not subrogated to the insured\u2019s right to collect from an underinsured motorist insurer because: (1) the underinsured motorist insurer\u2019s obligation is based on a contract; (2) the underinsured motorist insurer did not cause the injuries to the insured; and (3) the underinsured motorist insurer is not a third party); <em>Dodd v. Middlesex Mut. Assur. Co. </em>(Conn. 1997), 698 A.2d 859 (employee\u2019s insurer was \u201cnot the alter ego\u201d of the tortfeasor, and, as such, was not the third party because that position was held by the actual tortfeasor); <em>Allied Mutual Insurance Company v. Larriva </em>(Ariz. Ct. App. 1973), 507 P.2d 997 (employee\u2019s insurer cannot be deemed the \u201calter ego\u201d of the tortfeasor, for it insures the employee against risk of inadequate compensation and not against liability by the tortfeasor); <em>State Comp. Ins. Fund v. Gulf Ins. Co. </em>(Colo. App. 1981), 628 P.2d 182 (uninsured motorist insurer does not become the \u201calter ego\u201d of the tortfeasor by simply providing protection to its insured for injuries caused by the tortfeasor).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">\u00b627 As MACo stands in a first party relationship to Haman, the MACo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>Workers\u2019 Compensation Trust has no right of subrogation under \u00a7 39-71-414, MCA. As a result, the collateral source statute, \u00a7 27-1-308, MCA, applies for past medical benefits and future medical benefits, and MACo is entitled to a dollar-for-dollar reimbursement of the amount paid by the MACo Workers\u2019 Compensation Trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">\u00b628 Haman argues that his action to recover personal injury caused by the negligence of Kofod is a third party action under \u00a7 39-71-412, MCA. While that is in fact true, the lawsuit here is by Haman against his underinsured motorist carrier, which, as pointed out above, is not a third party action, but is a first party action. Thus, by reason of the italicized language in \u00a7 39-71-414, MCA, MACo Workers\u2019 Compensation Trust has no statutory right of subrogation and, therefore, is entitled to the collateral source offset.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">\u00b629 The Court contends that its holding is consistent with <em>Schuff v. </em>A.T. <em>Klemens &amp; Son, </em>2000 MT 357, \u00b6 109, 303 Mont. 274, \u00b6 109, 16 P.3d 1002, \u00b6 109. In my view, <em>Schuff </em>is inapposite because <em>Schuff </em>involved a third party action, not a first party action. <em>Schuff, </em>\u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">\u00b630 Of additional concern, is the Court\u2019s statement that \u201cMACo and Great Northwest \u2018stood in the shoes\u2019 of Kofod, for purposes of fulfilling their contractual obligations as underinsured motorist carriers. Consequently, Haman\u2019s action, brought against a third party tort-feasor, and those \u2018standing in the shoes\u2019 of the tort-feasor, was brought pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-412, MCA (1997).\u201d In this statement, the Court equates MACo and Great Northwest with the tortfeasor himself and by that artifice concluded that Haman\u2019s action against MACo is really a third party action and not what it actually is, a first party action. The Court cites no authority for the proposition that the injured person\u2019s underinsured motorist carrier \u201cstands in the shoes\u201d of the tortfeasor. In this statement, however, the Court has effectively blurred out of existence the distinction between first party and third party actions. Indeed, the majority has adopted the \u201cinsurer-is-the-alter-ego-of-the-tortfeasor\u201d rule that other jurisdictions have specifically rejected. <em>See supra </em>\u00b6 9.1 cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">\u00b631 I would hold that MACo is entitled to a collateral source reduction of the jury\u2019s award in this case, and I dissent from our failure to do so.</p>\n<judges id=\"b137-8\">JUSTICE LEAPHART and JUSTICE RICE join in the dissent of JUSTICE NELSON.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
