Kevin appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-13\">\u00b62 We restate the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b73-14\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err when it allowed Lieutenant Neuman to remain in the courtroom after the other witnesses had been excluded?</p>\n<p id=\"b73-15\">\u00b64 2.

Should Kevin be granted a new trial because of cumulative error?</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">\u00b68 6. Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it denied Kevin\u2019s motion for a directed verdict?</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">\u00b69 Kevin and Pamela Flowers were married in 1981. They have two teenage sons, Zachery and Caleb. In February of 2001, Pamela requested that Kevin move out of the family home, which was located in the Whispering Pines subdivision near Fortine, Montana (the Whispering Pines home). Pamela made this request because of problems she and Kevin were having with their marriage. Kevin moved out of the Whispering Pines home in March of 2001. Pamela filed for a divorce in July of2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">\u00b610 Sometime during the summer of2001, Pamela began dating Jerry Croskrey. At 8:00 a.m. on August 6, 2001, Pamela was at Croskrey\u2019s home when she received a telephone call from her son Zachery. While speaking to Zachery, Pamela heard Kevin\u2019s voice in the background. Specifically, Pamela testified that Kevin stated: \u201cZachery, is that your Mom? Is that your Mom? Tell her I\u2019m coming to get her and I\u2019m going to kill her. I\u2019m going to kill her.\u201d Upon hearing Kevin\u2019s statements, Pamela told Zachery to get away from Kevin. She then hung up the phone and informed Croskrey of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-9\">\u00b611 A few moments later the phone rang again. Croskrey picked up the phone and stated: \u201cThis is Jerry.\u201d Croskrey then heard Kevin\u2019s voice on the other end of the phone. Croskrey testified that Kevin threatened both him and Pamela, and used profanity. Croskrey further testified that after about two minutes, Kevin hung up the phone.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-10\">\u00b612 Pamela called the Lincoln County Sheriffs Office and advised them of the situation. Pamela also called a Justice of the Peace and attempted to get a restraining order against Kevin. Pamela and Croskrey remained at Croskrey\u2019s residence until approximately 11:40 a.m. when Croskrey left to go to the post office. Before he left, Croskrey and Pamela agreed that if Kevin were to arrive, Pamela would run to John Bower\u2019s home and request help. Bower was Croskrey\u2019s closest neighbor.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-11\">\u00b613 After Croskrey left, Pamela noticed Kevin\u2019s truck on the highway near Croskrey\u2019s residence. She responded by running to Bower\u2019s home and calling 911. A few minutes later, Pamela observed Kevin\u2019s truck <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>pull out of Crosbrey\u2019s driveway and back onto the highway. She then returned to Croskrey\u2019s residence. Croskrey arrived at approximately the same time. Croskrey and Pamela surveyed Croskrey\u2019s home and noted that the latch on the door was broken. They also noted that several items were missing, including Pamela\u2019s purse and a gold necklace.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">\u00b614 Shortly thereafter, Lieutenant Matthew Neuman of the Lincoln County Sheriffs Department located Kevin in the driveway of the Whispering Pines home. When questioned by Lieutenant Neuman, Kevin admitted that he had been at Croskrey\u2019s residence earlier that day. Kevin further admitted that he had taken Pamela\u2019s purse. Lieutenant Neuman retrieved Pamela\u2019s purse from Kevin\u2019s truck and took him into custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">\u00b615 After Kevin was taken into custody, Pamela and Croskrey traveled to the Whispering Pines home to check for damage. While there, they found the remaining items missing from Croskrey\u2019s home in Kevin\u2019s truck. Pamela and Croskrey also found a cardboard box top with the following phrase written on it: \u201cYour [sic] just a hore [sic] and you have betrayed everyone around you and now you will die.\u201d Pamela testified that she recognized the handwriting as Kevin\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">\u00b616 On August 17, 2001, the Respondent, State of Montana, filed an information charging Kevin with one count of burglary, in violation of \u00a7 45-6-204, MCA (1999), two counts of theft, in violation of \u00a7 45-6-301, MCA (1999), and two counts of violating privacy in communications, in violation of \u00a7 45-8-213, MCA (1999). Kevin pled not guilty to all five counts on August 20, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">\u00b617 In December of 2001, Kevin entered into a plea agreement with the State. The agreement was later withdrawn, however, and the case was set for trial. Prior to trial, Kevin filed several pre-trial motions, most of which were denied by the District Court. The case proceeded to jury trial on March 12, 2002. On March 13, 2002, the jury found Kevin guilty of one count of burglary, one count of theft, and two counts of violating privacy in communications. Kevin was sentenced on April 3, 2002. He appealed on April 5, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">\u00b618 This Court reviews a district court\u2019s application of Rule 615, M.R.Evid., which addresses the exclusion of witnesses, as we would a conclusion of law. <em>State v. Osborne, </em>1999 MT 149, \u00b6 28, 295 Mont. 54, \u00b6 28, 982 P.2d 1045, \u00b6 28. A district court\u2019s conclusions of law are reviewed for correctness. <em>Osborne, </em>\u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>\u00b619 We review a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings to determine whether the district court abused its discretion. <em>State v. Bingman, </em>2002 MT 350, \u00b6 31, 313 Mont. 376, \u00b6 31, 61 P.3d 153, \u00b6 31. A district court has broad discretion to determine whether evidence is relevant and admissible. Absent a showing of abuse of discretion, we will not overturn a court\u2019s evidentiary determination. <em>Bingman, </em>\u00b6 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">\u00b620  The standard of review of a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for a directed verdict is whether, after reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Johnson </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 447, 450, 918 P.2d 293, 294. The decision to direct a verdict at the close of the State\u2019s case lies within the sound discretion of the district court and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion. <em>State v. Romannose </em>(1997), 281 Mont. 84, 88, 931 P.2d 1304, 1307.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Aj\">ISSUE 1</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">\u00b621 Did the District Court err when it allowed Lieutenant Neuman to remain in the courtroom after the other witnesses had been excluded? \u00b622 Prior to trial in the instant case, Kevin requested that all of the witnesses be excluded from the courtroom. Kevin\u2019s request was made pursuant to Rule 615, M.R.Evid., which provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ax\">At the request of a party, the court shall order witnesses excluded so that they cannot hear the testimony of other witnesses, and it may make the order of its own motion. This rule does not authorize exclusion of</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-7\">(2) an officer or employee of a party which is not a natural person designated as its representative by its attorney[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">\u00b623 The District Court granted Kevin\u2019s request and excluded the witnesses from the courtroom. However, because the State had designated Lieutenant Neuman as its representative, the District Court determined that he was exempt from Rule 615, M.R.Evid. Thus, Lieutenant Neuman was allowed to remain in the courtroom for the duration of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-9\">\u00b624  This Court has previously concluded that law enforcement officers may be exempt from Rule 615, M.R.Evid., under subsection (2) of the rule. <em>State v. Claric </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 141, 147, 894 P.2d 946, 950. However, we have also previously advised courts that in situations where the trial judge grants a motion to exclude witnesses, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>in the spirit of fairness, all witnesses who are to testify are to be excluded from the courtroom. <em>State v. Radi </em>(1975), 168 Mont. 320,327, 542 P.2d 1206,1210; <em>Claric, </em>271 Mont, at 147, 894 P.2d at 950. In this case, Lieutenant Neuman testified as a witness for the State. Therefore, although Lieutenant Neuman was the State\u2019s designated representative, he was not exempt from Rule 615, M.R.Evid., because he testified as a witness for the State. Accordingly, the District Court erred when it allowed Lieutenant Neuman to remain in the courtroom after it excluded the other witnesses under Rule 615, M.R.Evid.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">\u00b625 In <em>State v. Van Kirk, </em>2001 MT 184, \u00b6 37, 306 Mont. 215, \u00b6 37, 32 P.3d 735, \u00b6 37, we set forth a test for determining whether an error prejudiced a defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial and is therefore reversible. The first part of the test requires us to assess whether the type of error at issue is structural error or trial error. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 37. Structural error is error \u201cthat affects the framework within which the trial proceeds, rather than simply an error in the trial process itself.\u201d <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 38. Structural error is typically of constitutional dimensions, precedes the trial, and undermines the fairness of the entire trial proceeding. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">\u00b626 In contrast, trial error is error that typically occurs during the presentation of a case to the jury. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 40. Further, trial error is \u201camenable to qualitative assessment by a reviewing court for prejudicial impact relative to the other evidence introduced at trial.\u201d <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">\u00b627 [3] We conclude that the type of error in the instant case is trial error. That is, although the District Court\u2019s failure to exclude Lieutenant Neuman occurred prior to trial, it was not an error of constitutional dimensions (the right to have witnesses excluded during trial is conferred in Rule 615, M.R.Evid.), nor was the error of such magnitude that it undermined the fairness of the entire trial proceeding. See generally <em>State v. Replow, </em>2001 MT 253, \u00b6 46, 307 Mont. 172, \u00b6 46, 36 P.3d 922, \u00b6 46. More importantly, the error in this case was \u201can error in the trial process\u201d which is amenable to being quantitatively weighed against the other evidence introduced at trial. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 38, 40. That is, this Court is able to weigh Lieutenant Neuman\u2019s testimony against the testimony of the other witnesses (which Lieutenant Neuman was erroneously allowed to overhear). Accordingly, the District Court\u2019s failure to exclude Lieutenant Neuman from the courtroom must be classified as trial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">\u00b628  Trial error is not presumptively prejudicial and therefore it is not automatically reversible. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 40. Once an error is classified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>as trial error, the second part of the <em>Van Kirk </em>test requires us to evaluate whether or not the error was harmless under the circumstances. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 41. To that end, we noted in <em>Van Kirk </em>that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4\">[OJnce a convicted person raises and establishes that the evidence in question was erroneously admitted and has alleged prejudice under the \u2018reasonable possibility\u2019 test<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, it then becomes incumbent on the State to demonstrate that the error at issue was not prejudicial. [Emphasis added].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-4\"><em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">\u00b629  In this case, however, Kevin neglected to allege that the District Court\u2019s failure to exclude Lieutenant Neuman from the courtroom caused him any prejudice. See also <em>Claric, </em>271 Mont. 141, 148, 894 P.2d 946, 950-51. In fact, Kevin devoted less than one page to this issue in his opening brief. As such, we cannot conclude that Kevin suffered prejudice as a result of the District Court\u2019s error. Therefore, we hold that the District Court\u2019s failure to exclude Lieutenant Neuman from the courtroom amounted to harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">ISSUE 2</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">\u00b630 Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it admitted evidence of Kevin\u2019s actions at Jerry Croskrey\u2019s residence?</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">\u00b631 Prior to trial, Kevin filed a motion requesting that the State be prohibited from admitting: (1) evidence that he had taken personal property, other than Pamela\u2019s purse and a gold necklace, from Croskrey\u2019s residence; and (2) evidence that he had caused damage to Croskrey\u2019s residence. The District Court denied Kevin\u2019s motion, and the State admitted the evidence at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">\u00b632 On appeal, Kevin contends that the District Court abused its discretion when it admitted evidence that he had taken additional personal property from Croskrey\u2019s residence on August 6, 2001. Specifically, Kevin maintains that because the State\u2019s information only charged him with the theft of the purse and necklace, any evidence that he had taken additional items from Croskrey\u2019s home was improperly admitted under Rule 404(b), M.R.Evid., as evidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-10\">\u00b633 Rule 404(b), M.R.Evid., provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-11\">Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">\u00b634 However, \u00a7 26-1-103, MCA(1999), states that in situations \u201cwhere the declaration, act, or omission forms part of a transaction which is itself the fact in dispute or evidence of that fact, such declaration, act, or omission is evidence as part of the transaction.\u201d See also <em>State v. Hansen, </em>1999 MT 253, \u00b6 77, 296 Mont. 282, \u00b6 77, 989 P.2d 338, \u00b6 77. It is well stated that admissibility under the transaction rule is predicated on the jury\u2019s right to hear what transgressed immediately prior and subsequent to the commission of the offense charged, so that they may evaluate the evidence in the context in which the criminal act occurred. <em>State v. Detonancour, </em>2001 MT 213, \u00b6 29, 306 Mont. 389, \u00b6 29, 34 P.3d 487, \u00b6 29. Moreover, the acts of a defendant subsequent to the alleged commission of the crime, and intertwined therewith, are highly probative. <em>Detonancour, </em>\u00b6 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">\u00b635  In the instant case, the additional items taken from Croskery\u2019s residence consisted of a set of hair clippers, a legal pad, and a day planner. These additional items were reported missing from Croskrey\u2019s home on August 6,2001, and were included in the investigative report prepared by Lieutenant Neuman. Pamela\u2019s purse and a gold necklace were also listed as missing in Lieutenant Neuman\u2019s investigative report. Therefore, while Kevin was not charged with the theft of the additional items, the theft of the additional items was clearly part of the same transaction as the theft of the purse and the necklace. See \u00a7 26-1-103, MCA (1999). Further, there is no evidence that Kevin was prejudiced by the District Court\u2019s admission of evidence regarding the additional items. Contrast with <em>State v. Howell </em>(1987), 226 Mont. 148, 151-52, 734 P.2d 214, 216-17. Accordingly, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it admitted evidence that Kevin had taken additional items from Croskrey\u2019s residence on August 6, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">\u00b636 Kevin also alleges that the District Court abused its discretion when it admitted evidence that he caused damage to Croskrey\u2019s residence on August 6, 2001. However, as we stated above, in situations where the declaration, act, or omission forms part of a transaction which is itself the fact in dispute or evidence of that fact, such declaration, act, or omission is evidence as part of the transaction. Section 26-1-103, MCA (1999). Here, Kevin was charged with both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>burglary and theft as a result of his actions at Croskrey\u2019s residence on August 6, 2001. Consequently, any damage he caused to Croskrey\u2019s residence in the course of committing such offenses was clearly part of the same transaction. Therefore, the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it admitted evidence that Kevin caused damage to Croskrey\u2019s residence on August 6, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">ISSUE 3</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">\u00b637 Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it admitted evidence of the handwritten phrase on the cardboard box top?</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">\u00b638 Kevin asserts that evidence that he had written the phrase \u201cYour [sic] just a hore [sic] and you have betrayed everyone around you and now you will die\u201d on a cardboard box top was improperly admitted under Rule 404(b), M.R.Evid., as evidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts. However, as we have already noted twice above, \u00a7 26-1-103, MCA (1999), states that in situations \u201cwhere the declaration, act, or omission forms part of a transaction which is itself the fact in dispute or evidence of that fact, such declaration, act, or omission is evidence as part of the transaction.\u201d Additionally, we noted above that the acts of a defendant subsequent to the alleged commission of the crime, and intertwined therewith, are highly probative. <em>Detonancour, </em>\u00b6 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">\u00b639 In this case, Lieutenant Neuman located Kevin in the driveway of the Whispering Pines home shortly after receiving information that Kevin had broken into Croskrey\u2019s residence. Kevin testified at trial that before Lieutenant Neuman arrived he had entered the Whispering Pines home, and among other things, written the disputed phrase on a cardboard box top. The box top was later discovered in Kevin\u2019s truck after Kevin was taken into custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">\u00b640  The above chronology of events indicates that Kevin wrote the phrase on the box top only moments after he had broken into Croskrey\u2019s residence. Thus, we conclude that pursuant to \u00a7 26-1-103, MCA (1999), the phrase was part of the same transaction as Kevin\u2019s illegal entry into Croskrey\u2019s home. We further note that Kevin failed to allege that the District Court\u2019s admission of the phrase caused him any prejudice. As such, we hold that the District Court properly exercised its discretion when it admitted evidence of the phrase at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">ISSUE 4</p>\n<p id=\"b80-10\">\u00b641 Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it admitted evidence that Pamela had a restraining order against Kevin prior to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>August 6, 2001?</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">\u00b642 During trial, the State questioned Kevin about his behavior at the Whispering Pines home on August 6,2001. The relevant portion of that testimony is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-5\">Q. Why did you go into the [Whispering Pines] home?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-6\">A. Why not? It\u2019s my house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-7\">Q. Okay. Now you\u2019ve been separated from Pam for about five</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-8\">months?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-9\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-10\">Q. And she had asked you not to go into the house[?]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-11\">A. No, she did not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-12\">\u00b643 The State then called Pamela as a rebuttal witness and questioned her about whether Kevin had permission to enter the Whispering Pines home on August 6, 2001. Pamela responded to the State\u2019s inquiry by stating that Kevin did not have permission to enter the Whispering Pines home, as she had obtained a restraining order against him in July of 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-13\">\u00b644 On appeal, Kevin maintains that the District Court abused its discretion when it admitted evidence of the restraining order because such evidence was: (1) irrelevant; (2) prejudicial; or (3) an improper impeachment of his testimony. However, Kevin failed to provide proper support for his claims. Rule 23(a)(4), M.R.App.P., requires that an appellant provide an argument that contains \u201cthe contentions of the appellant with respect to the issues presented, and the reasons therefor, with citations to the authorities, statutes and pages of the record relied on.\u201d Additionally, we have repeatedly held that we will not consider unsupported issues or arguments. <em>Cutler v. Jim, Gilman Excavating, Inc., </em>2003 MT 314, \u00b6 22, 318 Mont. 255, \u00b6 22, 80 P.3d 1203, \u00b6 22. It is \u201cnot this Court\u2019s obligation to locate authorities or formulate arguments for a party in support of positions taken on appeal.\u201d <em>Cutler, </em>\u00b6 22. In the instant case, Kevin failed to bolster his claims with argument and supporting authority which explained <em>why </em>evidence of the restraining order was irrelevant, prejudicial or an improper impeachment of his testimony. Accordingly, we decline to reach this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-14\">ISSUE 5</p>\n<p id=\"b81-15\">\u00b645 Should Kevin be granted a new trial because of cumulative error?</p>\n<p id=\"ARy\">\u00b646  The doctrine of cumulative error refers to a number of errors which, taken together, prejudice a defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial. <em>State v. Ottwell </em>(1989), 239 Mont. 150, 157, 779 P.2d 500, 504. Under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>this doctrine, once such accumulated errors are identified as having prejudiced a defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial, reversal is required. <em>State v. Enright, </em>2000 MT 372, \u00b6 34, 303 Mont. 457, \u00b6 34, 16 P.3d 366, \u00b6 34. However, the existence of prejudice must be proven by the defendant, as \u201cmere allegations of error without proof of prejudice are inadequate to satisfy the doctrine.\u201d <em>State v. Campbell </em>(1990), 241 Mont. 323, 329, 787 P.2d 329, 333.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">\u00b647  Kevin contends that because several errors occurred during his trial, he should be granted a new trial under the doctrine of cumulative error. In particular, Kevin claims that there were five instances where improper witness testimony was admitted at trial. However, while Kevin described these alleged errors with some detail in his opening brief, he offered no proof that the alleged errors caused him prejudice. As we noted above, mere allegations of error, without proof of prejudice, are inadequate to satisfy the doctrine of cumulative error. <em>Campbell, </em>241 Mont. at 329, 787 P.2d at 333. Moreover, when applying the doctrine of cumulative error, this Court has consistently refused to consider allegations of error which are devoid of argument or authority supporting the defendant\u2019s contentions. <em>Enright, </em>\u00b6 34. Thus, we find no grounds to apply the doctrine of cumulative error in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">ISSUE 6</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">\u00b648 Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it denied Kevin\u2019s motion for a directed verdict?</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">\u00b649 On August 6,2001, Pamela received a telephone call from her son Zachery. While speaking to Zachery, Pamela heard Kevin yelling in the background. Specifically, Pamela testified that Kevin stated: \u201cZachery, is that your Mom? Is that your Mom? Tell her I\u2019m coming to get her and I\u2019m going to kill her. I\u2019m going to kill her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">\u00b650 As a result of Kevin\u2019s statements to Pamela, the State charged Kevin with violating privacy in communications. The offense of violating privacy in communications is described in \u00a7 45-8-213(1), MCA (1999), which provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-9\">[A] person commits the offense of violating privacy in communications if the person knowingly or purposely:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-10\">(a) with the purpose to terrify, intimidate, threaten, harass, annoy, or offend, communicates with a person by telephone and uses obscene, lewd, or profane language, suggests a lewd or lascivious act, or threatens to inflict injury or physical harm to the person or property of the person. The use of obscene, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>lewd, or profane language or the making of a threat or lewd or lascivious suggestions is prima facie evidence of an intent to terrify, intimidate, threaten, harass, annoy, or offend.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">After the State presented its case at trial, Kevin moved for a directed verdict with regard to the offense of violating privacy in communications. The District Court denied Kevin\u2019s motion and allowed the issue to go to the jury. The jury found Kevin guilty of the offense<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">\u00b651 On appeal, Kevin asserts that the District Court abused its discretion when it denied his motion for a directed verdict because insufficient evidence existed to prove that he had committed the offense of violating privacy in communications. Specifically, Kevin claims that because he did not have a telephone conversation with Pamela on August 6, 2001, he could not have used the telephone to threaten her.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">\u00b652  While Kevin correctly contends that he did not have a direct telephone conversation with Pamela on August 6, 2001, we hold that sufficient evidence existed for the jury to have found Kevin guilty of the offense in question. That is, a person commits the offense of violating privacy in communications if that person \u201cwith the purpose to terrify, intimidate, threaten, harass, annoy, or offend, communicates with a person by telephone and ... threatens to inflict injury or physical harm to the person or property of the person.\u201d Section 45-8-213(l)(a), MCA (1999) (emphasis added). In this case, Kevin testified that he was present when Zachery called Pamela on August 6, 2001. Kevin further testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-7\">Q. You knew Zach was calling Pam?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-8\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-9\">Q. And you were in the same room listening on the phone?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-10\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-11\">Q. And you were ranting and raving, and yelling in the background?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-13\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-14\">Q. But you don\u2019t remember threatening to kill Pam?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-15\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-16\">Q. But you might have?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>A. It\u2019s possible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-4\">Q. And you weren\u2019t talking to Pam?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-5\">A. No, I was not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-6\">Q. You were talking loud enough that Pam could have heard you? A. I was ranting and raving, yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">\u00b653  Therefore, although Kevin maintains that he was not speaking directly <em>to </em>Pamela on August 6,2001, the evidence indicates that he communicated a message to Pamela over the telephone. The evidence further indicates that the content of such message was threatening in nature. Accordingly, sufficient evidence existed for the jury to have found Kevin guilty of the offense of violating privacy in communications.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">\u00b654 For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b84-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, LEAPHART and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b78-12\"> An error is prejudicial, and requires reversal, if a reasonable possibility exists that the inadmissible evidence might have contributed to the defendant\u2019s conviction. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 29, 47.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b83-17\"> Kevin was also charged with, and convicted of, violating privacy in communications as a result of his telephone conversation with Jerry Croskrey. However, Kevin does not challenge this conviction on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
