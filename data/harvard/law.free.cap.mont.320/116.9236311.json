The District Court entered judgment and May appeals. We reverse and remand. \u00b62 The dispositive issue is whether the District Court erred when it denied May\u2019s motion to suppress evidence and statements obtained as a result of an illegal arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-12\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b139-13\">\u00b63 At 10:30 p.m. on February 19, 2002, May drove a 1997 Ford Thunderbird into the parking lot of the Visitors Control Center (visitors center) atMalmstrom Air Force Base (Malmstrom) near Great Falls, Montana. She parked the car, got out and went into the visitors center, where airmen working as security and law enforcement officers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>process civilian requests to enter the base. As part of this process-which usually takes about 10 minutes-May gave her driver\u2019s license, <em>registration and </em>proof of insurance to the airmen.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">\u00b64 While May was in the visitors center, the airmen processing her request to enter the base smelled the odor of alcohol on her. Their understanding was that-because May was a civilian-they could detain, but not arrest, her. At 10:45 p.m., they took her to the base\u2019s \u201cgate shack\u201d to confer with other law enforcement airmen and then, after another 20 minutes, took her back to the visitors center to wait for a Montana Highway Patrol officer to arrive in response to their request at 10:55 p.m. that one be dispatched to Malmstrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">\u00b65 Highway Patrol Officer Lori Gasvoda was dispatched to Malmstrom at 11:12 p.m. and arrived at the base at 11:23 p.m. Gasvoda was advised the airmen could smell alcohol on May. After she, too, smelled alcohol on May, Gasvoda administered three field sobriety tests-the horizontal gaze nystagmus test, the one-leg stand and the walk-and-turn test-which indicated May was impaired. Gasvoda then administered a preliminary breath test which showed that May\u2019s blood alcohol concentration was .220, and arrested May for DUI. She read May an implied consent form and obtained a breath sample result of .193.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">\u00b66 May filed four pretrial motions in which she asked the District Court to suppress evidence resulting from her arrest. In the motion which is dispositive of this appeal, May argued that her detainment by the Air Force officers constituted an arrest which was illegal because it was not based on probable cause. On that basis, she moved to suppress all evidence seized-and statements she made-during and after her detainment.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">\u00b67 The District Court held a combined hearing on May\u2019s motions, at the end of which it denied all four motions to suppress evidence. May then pled guilty, reserving the right to appeal the orders on her motions to suppress. The court sentenced May, entered judgment and stayed her sentence pending appeal. May now appeals the order denying her motions to suppress evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">\u00b68 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion, to suppress evidence to determine whether the court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether they are correctly applied as a matter of law. <em>State v. Courville, </em>2002 MT 330, \u00b6 14, 313 Mont. 218, \u00b6 14, 61 P.3d 749, \u00b6 14 (citation omitted). Here, the District Court stated-and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>parties do not dispute-that the facts are \u201cgenerally agreed upon.\u201d Therefore, we review the District Court\u2019s denial of the motion to suppress to determine whether it was correct as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">\u00b69 Did the District Court err when it denied May\u2019s motion to suppress evidence and statements obtained as a result of an illegal arrest?</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">\u00b610 As a threshold matter, the State contends this appeal should be dismissed because May\u2019s notice of appeal is insufficient. The State quotes Rule 4(c), M.R.App.P., as providing that a notice of appeal must designate the judgment, order or part thereof from which the appeal is taken. May\u2019s notice of appeal states she is appealing from the judgment entered against her. The State maintains it was necessary that the notice of appeal specify that May appeals from the order denying her motions to suppress evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">\u00b611 We recently amended Rule 4(c), M.R.App.P., by deleting language not relevant here. We also added language stating \u201c[a]n appeal from a judgment draws into question all previous orders and rulings excepted or objected to and which led up to and produced the judgment.\u201d Under Rule 4(c) as amended, May\u2019s notice of appeal was clearly sufficient. In addition, Rule 2, M.R.App.P., provides that, on appeal from a judgment, we may review any intermediate order or decision of the trial court excepted or objected to and \u00a7 46-12-204(3), MCA, contemplates that an appeal from a criminal judgment after entry of a guilty plea will encompass review of adverse determinations of specified pretrial motions. Here, May\u2019s guilty plea significantly limited the issues she could raise in an appeal from the judgment; however, May expressly reserved her right to appeal the court\u2019s rulings on her pretrial motions. We reject the State\u2019s claim that the notice of appeal was insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">\u00b612 Turning to May\u2019s contentions, she argues that her detainment by the airmen constituted an arrest and the odor of alcohol which they smelled on her did not constitute probable cause to support the arrest. As a result, she contends all evidence and statements obtained as a result of her detention must be suppressed. May is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">\u00b613  May first argues her detention by the airmen constituted an arrest. In Montana, we apply a three-part test in determining whether an individual is under arrest: (1) authority to arrest; (2) assertion of that authority with intention to affect an arrest; and (3) restraint of the person arrested. <em>State v. Widenhofer </em>(1997), 286 Mont. 341, 347, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>950 P.2d 1383, 1386. When there is no physical restraint, the test is whether a reasonable person, innocent of any crime, would have felt free to walk away under the circumstances. <em>Widenhofer, </em>286 Mont. at 347, 950 P.2d at 1386 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">\u00b614 The State claims the airmen had authority under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 809(e) to hold May while they notified-and waited for-the Montana Highway Patrol. It points out that, pursuant to the federal statute, military security forces may apprehend offenders to secure their custody until proper authorities may be notified.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">\u00b615 This Court will not address a new legal theory advanced for the first time on appeal. <em>See State v. Martinez, </em>2003 MT 65, \u00b6 17, 314 Mont. 434, \u00b6 17, 67 P.3d 207, \u00b6 17 (citations omitted). In the present case, the prosecution did not raise the federal theory or authority in the District Court. For that reason, we decline to address this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">\u00b616 Here, as stated above, the airmen believed they lacked authority to arrest May in their capacities as law enforcement officers for Malmstrom. However, \u00a7 46-6-502, MCA, allows a private person, under certain circumstances, to arrest another and then immediately notify- and give custody of the person to-the nearest available law enforcement agency. That, in essence, is what the airmen believed they had authority to do, and what they did. We hold that the airmen\u2019s belief that they had such authority and their assertion of authority to make a private person arrest by detaining May satisfy the first two <em>Widenhofer </em>arrest factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">\u00b617  As to the third arrest factor, the State points out that the record does not suggest May sought to leave the visitors center. However, the record also supports a conclusion that, under all the facts and circumstances of May* s detainment, a reasonable person would not have felt free to walk away. It is undisputed that the Malmstrom visitors center is a law enforcement facility. Indeed, Highway Patrol Officer Gasvoda testified at the District Court hearing that the woven mat at the entrance to the visitors center displays a prominent shield insignia and block lettering reading \u201cLAW ENFORCEMENT.\u201d Further, during the time the airmen detained May, they retained possession of her driver\u2019s license, registration and proof of insurance. Without her driver\u2019s license, registration and proof of insurance, May could not legally have driven away. Under these facts and circumstances, we conclude the airmen\u2019s detention of May constituted an arrest by private citizens.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">\u00b618  We now trun to the question of whether there was adequate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>cause for the airmen to detain and arrest May. Pursuant to \u00a7 46-6-502, MCA, a private person may arrest another only if there is probable cause to believe that the person being arrested is committing or has committed an offense and the existing circumstances require the person\u2019s immediate arrest. The test applicable to a private citizen arrest is whether a reasonable person, under personally known facts and circumstances, is warranted in believing that someone is committing or has committed an offense. <em>State v. Williamson, </em>1998 MT 199, \u00b6 16, 290 Mont. 321, \u00b6 16, 965 P.2d 231, \u00b6 16 (citations omitted). In the present case, the offense at issue is DUI.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">\u00b619  Here, the record indicates the airmen\u2019s sole basis for detaining May was the smell of alcohol. The airmen reported no driving behavior or other indicators that May was even intoxicated, much less driving while impaired. The State does not claim that the odor of alcohol-standing alone-constituted probable cause for May\u2019s arrest. In <em>State v. Olson </em>(1979), 180 Mont. 151, 589 P.2d 663, we held that the odor of burning marijuana, standing alone, did not establish probable cause to issue a search warrant. We hold that the odor of alcohol emanating from May\u2019s person, standing alone, was insufficient to establish probable cause for her arrest by private citizens.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">\u00b620 [5] Because we have concluded the prosecution did not establish probable cause for the airmen\u2019s detention of May, which constituted an arrest, we hold that her arrest was illegal. As a result, all evidence obtained as a result of the arrest must be suppressed. <em>See State v. New </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 529, 535, 917 P.2d 919, 922-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">\u00b621 We reverse the District Court\u2019s denial of the motion to suppress and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b143-7\">JUSTICES COTTER, WARNER.
