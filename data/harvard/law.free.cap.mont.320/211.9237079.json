We affirm in part, reverse in part and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">\u00b62 Heath raises the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in denying Heath\u2019s challenges to two prospective jurors for cause?</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err in sentencing Heath on the conviction for sexual intercourse without consent?</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">\u00b65 The State of Montana charged Heath by information with committing the felony offense of sexual intercourse without consent and, in a later information ultimately consolidated with the first, with committing the felony offense of witness tampering. It alleged Heath raped his housemate, a woman with whom he had once been romantically involved, and wrote the woman letters from jail while the first charge was pending. The District Court scheduled a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">\u00b66 During voir dire, the District Court denied Heath\u2019s challenges for cause regarding two prospective jurors, and Heath used two of his six peremptory challenges to remove them. The case proceeded to trial and the jury convicted Heath of both charges. The District Court entered judgment and sentenced Heath. Heath appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b236-11\">\u00b67  In reviewing a trial court\u2019s denial of a challenge for cause, we</p>\n<p id=\"b236-12\">determine whether the trial court abused its discretion. <em>State v. Falls Down, </em>2003 MT 300, \u00b6 17, 318 Mont. 219, \u00b6 17, 79 P.3d 797, \u00b6 17 (citation omitted). In the context of challenges for cause, a court abuses its discretion if it fails to excuse a prospective juror whose actual bias is discovered during voir dire. <em>State v. Freshment, </em>2002 MT 61, \u00b6 12, 309 Mont. 154, \u00b6 12, 43 P.3d 968, \u00b6 12 (citations omitted). Structural error requiring automatic reversal occurs when a district court abuses its discretion in denying a defendant\u2019s challenge for cause, the defendant uses a peremptory challenge to remove the disputed prospective juror, and the defendant exhausts all peremptory challenges. <em>Freshment, </em>\u00b6 14 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-13\">\u00b68 We review a criminal sentence for legality only; that is, whether the sentence is within statutory parameters. A trial court\u2019s statutory interpretation is a question of law, which we review to determine whether it is correct. <em>State </em>v. <em>Kern, </em>2003 MT 77, \u00b6 46, 315 Mont. 22, \u00b6 46, 67 P.3d 272, \u00b6 46 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">\u00b69 1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in denying Heath\u2019s challenges to two prospective jurors for cause?</p>\n<p id=\"At8\">\u00b610  The bases for challenging potential jurors for cause in Montana are set forth in \u00a7 46-16-115(2), MCA. One specified basis is that a juror has \u201ca state of mind in reference to the case or to either of the parties that would prevent the juror from acting with entire impartiality and without prejudice to the substantial rights of either party.\u201d Section 46-16-115(2)(j), MCA. If voir dire examination raises a serious question about a prospective juror\u2019s ability to be fair and impartial, dismissal for cause is favored. <em>Freshment, </em>\u00b6 11 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">\u00b611 In a case concerning the right of the press and public to attend individual voir dire examinations, we stated generally:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-7\">It is only where [prospective jurors] form fixed opinions on the guilt or innocence of the defendant which they would not be able to lay aside and render a verdict based solely on the evidence presented in court that they become disqualified as jurors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-8\"><em>Great Falls Tribune v. District Court </em>(1980), 186 Mont. 433, 439-40, 608 P.2d 116, 120 (citations omitted). While <em>Great Falls Tribune </em>did not directly address challenges for cause, we have repeated this rule in numerous subsequent cases involving challenges for cause without clarifying how it meshes with the \u201cstate of mind\u201d basis for challenges for cause set forth in \u00a7 46-16-115(2)(j), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">\u00b612 In <em>State v. DeVore, </em>1998 MT 340, \u00b6\u00b6 14, 21, 292 Mont. 325, \u00b6\u00b6 14, 21, 972 P.2d 816, \u00b6\u00b6 14, 21, <em>overruled on other grounds, State v. Good, </em>2002 MT 59, \u00b6 63, 309 Mont. 113, \u00b6 63, 43 P.3d 948, \u00b6 63, we set forth both the statutory \u201cstate of mind\u201d rule and the \u201cfixed opinion\u201d rule. With regard to the latter, we rejected the State\u2019s argument that our review of rulings on challenges for cause \u201cis limited only to whether the juror has stated a specific belief that the defendant is guilty as charged.\u201d <em>DeVore, </em>\u00b6 22. We concluded the prospective jurors at issue demonstrated \u201canother form of bias\u201d by stating beliefs that people charged with criminal offenses must be \u201cguilty of something\u201d and by having difficulty understanding and applying the presumption of innocence. <em>DeVore, </em>\u00b6 24. We did not expressly state that the prospective jurors\u2019 bias met the statutory \u201cstate of mind\u201d criterion, but that was clearly the essence of our conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-10\">\u00b613 In <em>Good, </em>\u00b6 42, we applied only \u00a7 46-16-115(2)(j), MCA, which-as set forth above-focuses on whether prospective jurors have a \u201cstate of mind\u201d which would prevent them from acting with entire impartiality and without prejudice to either party\u2019s substantial rights. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>concluded the prospective jurors at issue did not state \u201can unequivocal opinion that [the defendant] was guilty as charged,\u201d but did express \u201ca form of bias based on their belief that a young sexual abuse victim would not lie.\u201d <em>Good, </em>\u00b6 53. We ultimately held that the denials of the challenges for cause required automatic reversal. <em>Good, </em>\u00b6 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">\u00b614 In <em>Freshment, </em>we quoted the statutory \u201cstate of mind\u201d basis for a challenge for cause and also reiterated the \u201cfixed opinion\u201d rule. <em>Freshment, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 11-12 (citations omitted). We did not apply the \u201cfixed opinion\u201d rule, however. Instead, we determined that prospective jurors \u201cstated an actual bias directly related to an issue critical to the outcome of the case\u2019-namely, whether the defendant could have a reasonable belief that an alleged victim of sexual intercourse without consent was 16 or older-and reversed. <em>Freshment, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 16, 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">\u00b615 <em>In Falls Down, </em>we set forth both the statutory \u201cstate of mind\u201d rule and the \u201cfixed opinion\u201d rule in the course of affirming a district court\u2019s denial of four challenges for cause. <em>Falls Down, </em>\u00b6 22-23. There, three prospective jurors expressed initial opinions of guilt based on what they had seen in the media, and one juror indicated he was not certain how he would feel if the defendant did not take the stand. <em>Falls Down, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 25-26, 28, 31, 33. After brief questioning by the trial court and counsel, the prospective jurors stated some variant of their ability to base their decision on the evidence, apply the presumption of innocence, and set aside any personal opinions. <em>Falls Down, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 25, 28, 31, 33. As to each juror, we concluded no fixed opinion had been established. <em>Falls Down, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 27, 30, 32, 35. We ultimately determined the prospective jurors demonstrated they could be fair and impartial. <em>Falls Down, </em>\u00b6 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">\u00b616  From this abbreviated review of our recent decisions addressing challenges for cause, it appears that the \u201cfixed opinion of guilt\u201d rule is oft-repeated but seldom applied, and clarification is necessary. As we observed in <em>DeVore, </em>our prior cases addressing juror impartiality did not necessarily involve jurors who had stated a fixed opinion regarding the defendant\u2019s guilt; rather, \u201ccircumstantial evidence of bias was apparent in relation to the particular circumstances of the defendant\u2019s case.\u201d <em>DeVore, </em>\u00b6 23 (citations omitted). Therefore, we conclude that the \u201cfixed opinion of guilt\u201d rule is but one argument which can be asserted under the statutory \u201cstate of mind\u201d basis for a challenge for cause. We further conclude that challenges for cause asserted under \u00a7 46-16-115(2)(j), MCA, must be determined pursuant to both the statutory language and the totality of the circumstances presented. With that clarification in mind, we turn to the District Court\u2019s denial of Heath\u2019s two challenges for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>Prospective Juror Carmen Caldwell</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">\u00b617 Prospective juror Carmen Caldwell stated she had volunteered as a rape survivor advocate in college and her ex-boyfriend had stalked her. Heath argues that direct and circumstantial evidence reveals Caldwell was biased.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">\u00b618 Heath first contends that Caldwell\u2019s statements constituted direct evidence of her bias. He correctly, but selectively, quotes portions of Caldwell\u2019s exchanges with counsel. We review the totality of her responses to determine whether they raised a serious question that she could not be fair and impartial. <em>See Freshment, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">\u00b619 Prosecutor John Parker asked if any panelists could not agree to afford Heath the presumption of innocence, and no panelist responded. He asked Caldwell what type of information she would examine to make an important decision, and she stated she would \u201clook at the facts first.\u201d Later, Pai\u2019ker asked the panelists whether they or their friends had been crime victims, and Caldwell responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-7\">Caldwell: Yes. Pve known someone. And I myself have been a victim, and I wouldn\u2019t have a problem with that. It wouldn\u2019t affect my judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-8\">Parker: You\u2019re willing and able to set it aside, in other words? Caldwell: Right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">Parker then inquired about what evidence Caldwell would expect in a sexual intercourse without consent trial, and she stated, \u201c[wjell, hopefully you\u2019ve gotten enough physical evidence with the rape kit and things like that. But you would also look at the credibility of the witnesses involved.\u201d Parker ended his initial questioning by asking the panelists if they would commit to giving a fair trial, and no one indicated he or she would not.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-10\">\u00b620 Defense counsel Steven Hudspeth followed up on Caldwell\u2019s statement that she had been a crime victim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-11\">Hudspeth: I just need to know if \u2014 for example, Miss Caldwell, was that a property crime?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-12\">Caldwell: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-13\">Hudspeth: Okay. So that isn\u2019t going to make a difference on this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-14\">Caldwell: No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-15\">\u00b621 Hudspeth then asked if any prospective juror had worked in a program similar to a victim witness assistance program, and Caldwell responded that she had volunteered as a rape survivor advocate in college and described her functions as a volunteer. Heath highlights the following subsequent exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-16\">Hudspeth: Do you think you should be on this case as a potential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>juror? I mean, let me phrase it a different way. I\u2019m not trying to confuse you. But if you were the one charged with what he\u2019s charged with sitting there, and the objective is to get 12 people that have no biases one way or the other, would you want somebody with your prior experience sitting in potential judgment of you on this particular type charge?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-4\">Caldwell: I feel that I could be-I could put my prejudices aside. But if I were in that situation, I probably wouldn\u2019t want somebody on the jury that had my experience.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-5\">Hudspeth: So how do you reconcile the two that you could put-you personally can put your prejudices aside-not saying you have any-but you would feel uncomfortable if you had somebody, you could see-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Az8\">Caldwell: I can see his point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-6\">Hudspeth: You and I have a meeting of the minds why I\u2019m asking these questions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-7\">Caldwell: I do. I would think you would make that decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">\u00b622 Hudspeth\u2019s voir dire continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-9\">Hudspeth: I don\u2019t get to make that decision. [The judge] gets to make the decision. So you can help me out or not if you want. Anything else that the court should know?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-10\">Caldwell: I should probably also clarify the property crime that we discussed was a stalking incident that became a property crime. So that might be helpful in your-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Adl\">Hudspeth: Somebody was stalking you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-11\">Caldwell: Correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-12\">Heath points to later statements during the same colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-13\">Hudspeth: And there may be some testimony come up in this case that something like that may or may not have gone on in the same situation. Do you feel that you should be on this particular case? I\u2019m not saying you\u2019re a bad person, you\u2019re a bad juror. You can see why I\u2019m-Caldwell: I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-14\">Hudspeth: Only you can make that decision as to whether you feel you can be fair and impartial to my client.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-15\">Caldwell: I feel I probably shouldn\u2019t be on this particular case. Hudspeth: Why is that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-16\">Caldwell: Just because of the previous experience that I\u2019ve had and also the experience with rape survivors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-17\">\u00b623 At this point, Hudspeth challenged Caldwell for cause, and the State asked follow-up questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-18\">Parker: ... Miss Caldwell, in your experience do you find that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>many people know someone who has been the victim of a sexual offense?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-4\">Caldwell: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-5\">Parker: But just because one of us may know people that have been victimized, that doesn\u2019t mean that Mr. Heath is guilty, does it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-6\">Caldwell: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-7\">Parker: Does that mean he doesn\u2019t have a right to a fair trial? Caldwell: Not at all. He has a right to that trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-8\">Parker: Suppose that you were-and I think I\u2019ve asked you this already, but I\u2019ll ask you again. Suppose that you were charged with a crime. Would you want to be entitled to have a trial of your own?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-9\">Caldwell: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-10\">Parker: Would you want the State of Montana to be required to prove that offense beyond a reasonable doubt?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-11\">Caldwell: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-12\">Parker: Don\u2019t you agree that Mr. Heath deserves that right? Caldwell: Yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-13\">Parker: Because he is innocent until proven guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-14\">Caldwell: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-15\">\u00b624 Hudspeth then continued his questioning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-16\">Hudspeth: Isn\u2019t part of my client\u2019s right to a fair trial a fair and impartial jury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-17\">Caldwell: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-18\">Hudspeth: And I take it you\u2019re of the opinion that it\u2019s probably better if somebody else was sitting in your place being on the jury that might not have the same life experiences and may have a chance to be more fair and impartial because they don\u2019t have your background and experience?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-19\">Caldwell: Possibly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-20\">Hudspeth: As far as you know, [other prospective jurors] might have backgrounds and experiences that don\u2019t include the [advocacy work] you did at the university and somebody stalking you; isn\u2019t that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-21\">Caldwell: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-22\">Hudspeth: That\u2019s why you feel you agree with me that maybe you\u2019re not the best juror for this particular case because of the charges and because of who you are; is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-23\">Caldwell: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>Hudspeth: Even though you want to be fair and impartial, you\u2019ve volunteered to me and to this court that there is a possibility, maybe even a likelihood, that it\u2019s difficult to get those things out of your head, so to speak; is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-4\">Caldwell: I think those life experiences stay with you even when you try and set things aside.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-5\">Hudspeth: Very difficult then, wouldn\u2019t it be? And we can\u2019t predict if you\u2019re on this jury what you\u2019re going to be thinking about during this trial or if you go into the jury room to deliberate what you might be thinking about as opposed to just the facts of this case; isn\u2019t that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-6\">Caldwell: Well, I would just look at the facts of the case. But I also would like you to be aware of my previous experience.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">At this point, Hudspeth renewed the challenge for cause. The District Court briefly questioned Caldwell, as set forth below, and ultimately denied the challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">\u00b625 We recently held a district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied four challenges for cause, in part because \u201conly after ... manipulation of the potential jurors\u2019 initial responses did their responses become unclear and seemingly biased.\u201d <em>Falls Down, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 20-21. Such is the case here. Caldwell initially stated she would \u201clook at the facts,\u201d her familiarity with crime victims and experience as a crime victim \u201cwouldn\u2019t affect [her] judgment,\u201d and she could set aside her experiences. In response to Hudspeth\u2019s questions, Caldwell characterized the crime to which she referred as a property crime and affirmed that her experience would not make a difference in Heath\u2019s trial. She expressed reservations about sitting on the jury only after Hudspeth asked Caldwell to place herself in Heath\u2019s position, informed her that her stalking experience could be similar to Heath\u2019s case, and told her that she could \u201chelp [him] out or not.\u201d She agreed that another juror \u201cpossibly\u201d could be \u201cmore fair and impartial,\u201d that if she were Heath she might not want herself as a juror, and that \u201cmaybe\u201d she was not the \u201cbest juror\u201d for this case. At no time did she state she was unwilling or unable to consider the case objectively and fairly. Heath also fails to cite any authority for his implicit argument that a prospective juror\u2019s statement that a defendant might not want her or him on the jury constitutes actual bias or an inappropriate state of mind under \u00a7 46-16-115(2)(j), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">\u00b626  Relying on <em>Freshment, </em>Heath also argues the prosecution improperly rehabilitated Caldwell with follow-up questions. \u201cCoaxed recantations in which jurors state they will merely follow the law, whether prompted by the trial court, the prosecution, or the defense, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>do not cure or erase a clearly stated bias which demonstrates actual prejudice against the substantial rights of a party.\u201d <em>Freshment, </em>\u00b6 18. We have frequently observed that most people will agree to follow the law in the face of repeated questioning in a courtroom, and we have advised judges and lawyers to refrain from engaging in such repeated questioning. <em>See, e.g., Freshment, </em>\u00b6 17; <em>Good, </em>\u00b6 54. In determining whether improper rehabilitation has occurred, we focus on whether a juror\u2019s \u201cspontaneous, and thus most reliable and honest, responses\u201d raised a serious question about his or her ability to be fair and impartial. <em>See, e.g., DeVore, </em>\u00b6 28; <em>Good, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 54-55.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">\u00b627  As discussed above, Caldwell\u2019s initial and spontaneous statements did not raise a serious question of bias; in addition, any arguable bias appeared only after defense counsel manipulated Caldwell\u2019s statements. Moreover, Caldwell\u2019s responses to the prosecutor\u2019s follow-up questions simply revealed her familiarity with sex crime victims was not unique and affirmed her belief in the core principles necessary to an impartial jury and a fair trial. We conclude the State\u2019s follow-up questions did not constitute improper rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">\u00b628 Heath also contends the District Court \u201ctook over\u201d the alleged rehabilitation, advancing <em>De Vore </em>and <em>Good </em>as authority. In <em>DeVore, </em>we concluded a district court \u201cshifted the focus\u201d from prospective jurors\u2019 expressed inability to presume innocence, and coaxed recantations by asking whether they could follow the law and court instructions. <em>DeVore, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 20, 27-28. In <em>Good, </em>we determined a district court improperly rehabilitated a prospective juror by asking whether she \u201cquarrel[ed] with [hisj little civics speech,\u201d after she consistently stated she would have trouble believing a teenager lied about sexual abuse. <em>Good, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 48, 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">\u00b629 Again, Caldwell\u2019s statements did not appear biased until defense counsel manipulated them. Moreover, the court focused on discerning whether Caldwell\u2019s responses to Hudspeth were from her own perspective or Heath\u2019s:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-7\">The Court: Miss Caldwell, when you answer the questions, are you answering them from Mr. Hudspeth\u2019s position or from your position as a prospective juror? In other words, are you agreeing with him that if you were Mr. Hudspeth, you would probably like to have someone else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-8\">Caldwell: Correct. I do not feel I would be prejudiced in this particular case. But I can understand his reasoning for wanting somebody else that doesn\u2019t have those experiences on the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>The Court: What do you mean by that? Do you mean that because of your rape counseling experience that you\u2019re automatically prejudiced?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-4\">Caldwell: No. But I would assume that-I have worked mostly with survivors and victims of rape. So I would feel he would probably not want me on this particular jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-5\">The Court: Can you put aside everything that you know, that you have learned from your education and from your volunteer work, can you put that aside and base your judgment solely on the testimony and evidence presented in this courtroom?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-6\">Caldwell: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-7\">The Court: And follow the law as given to you by the court?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aso\">Caldwell: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">This questioning was not an attempt by the District Court to shift the focus from Caldwell\u2019s beliefs or to cause her to recant her initial statements. The District Court merely attempted to clarify-after Hudspeth\u2019s questions-whether Caldwell was actually biased or simply agreeing that Heath may have preferred not to have her on the jury. <em>Cf. Good, </em>\u00b6 48, <em>DeVore, </em>\u00b6 20. We conclude the District Court did not improperly rehabilitate Caldwell.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">\u00b630 Heath next argues that circumstantial evidence-Caldwell\u2019s experiences as a rape survivor advocate and stalking victim-\u201csupported\u201d or \u201cconfirmed\u201d her alleged statements of bias. He relies on the following language from <em>United States v. Allsup </em>(9th Cir. 1977), 566 F.2d 68, 71, which this Court quoted in <em>State v. Chastain </em>(1997), 285 Mont. 61, 64, 947 P.2d 57, 59-60, <em>overruled on other grounds by State v. Herrman, </em>2003 MT 149, \u00b6 33, 316 Mont. 198, \u00b6 33, 70 P.3d 738, \u00b6 33:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-10\">Bias can be revealed by a juror\u2019s express admission of that fact, but, more frequently, jurors are reluctant to admit actual bias, and the reality of their biased attitudes must be revealed by circumstantial evidence. We agree with the observation in <em>Kiernan v. Van Schaik </em>(3d Cir. 1965), 347 F.2d 775, 781: \u201cThat men will be prone to favor that side of a cause with which they identify themselves either economically, socially, or emotionally is a fundamental fact of human character.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-11\">\u00b631  Heath argues the District Court should have dismissed Caldwell because she \u201cwould have developed substantial emotional involvement\u201d ini her advocacy work and \u201cit would only be natural\u201d for her to identify with an alleged rape victim. On the record before us, these arguments are purely speculative. Moreover, Caldwell\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>observation that \u201clife experiences stay with you\u201d is true of every prospective juror. We conclude Heath\u2019s unsupported speculation about Caldwell\u2019s emotional involvement falls far short of establishing bias via circumstantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">\u00b632 Noting Caldwell\u2019s reference to a rape kit, Heath contends Caldwell was biased because her past experience gave her \u201cmore specific knowledge about rape cases than the average juror.\u201d In derogation of the requirement of Rule 23(a)(4), M.R.App.P., Heath offers no authority in support of his argument that superior knowledge about the subject matter of a case renders a potential juror biased. Absent such authority, we will not consider the issue. <em>See, e.g., State v. Strauss, </em>2003 MT 195, \u00b6 51, 317 Mont. 1, \u00b6 51, 74 P.3d 1052, \u00b6 51.</p>\n<p id=\"Ahd\">\u00b633 Finally, Heath contends Caldwell should have been dismissed because her stalking experience resembled the allegations in Heath\u2019s case, in that Caldwell\u2019s ex-boyfriend committed a felony after their relationship ended. Heath correctly observes that two other prospective jurors were dismissed for cause after <em>in camera </em>questioning revealed one prospective juror and his girlfriend had been kidnaped by men who subsequently raped the girlfriend, and another prospective juror had been sexually assaulted. He argues \u201c[bjeing a crime victim was reason enough to dismiss\u201d these jurors, so Caldwell should have been dismissed as well. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">\u00b634  Both dismissed jurors were emotionally distressed and stated they could have difficulty weighing the evidence objectively. Unlike the dismissed jurors, Caldwell did not state she would have any such difficulty. Indeed, she repeatedly stated that she would focus solely on the facts of the case and set her prior experiences aside. Moreover, both dismissed jurors were involved in sex offenses similar to the charge Heath faced, and Caldwell\u2019s stalking experience was a property offense. We conclude Caldwell\u2019s stalking experience did not constitute circumstantial evidence establishing she could not act with impartiality and without prejudice to Heath\u2019s substantial rights. <em>See </em>\u00a7 46-18-115(2)(j), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">\u00b635  To summarize, we conclude that direct evidence, in the form of Caldwell\u2019s statements, did not raise a serious question about her ability to be fair and impartial, and neither the prosecutor nor the District Court improperly rehabilitated her. We also conclude that the circumstantial evidence-Caldwell\u2019s stalking incident and rape advocacy experience-did not establish that she had an improper state of mind or that she was biased.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">\u00b636 We hold the District Court did not abuse its discretion in failing to dismiss Caldwell for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>Prospective Juror Mary Rice</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">\u00b637 Heath contends the District Court abused its discretion in failing to dismiss prospective juror Mary Rice for cause because circumstantial evidence established her bias. Rice was a former juvenile detention center employee who held a bachelor\u2019s degree in psychology and had completed 56 hours of continuing education on sex offenses. She stated she did not plan to counsel rape victims, but wished to work \u201cfor the predator side, like a court evaluation or corrections evaluations.\u201d The following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-5\">Hudspeth: It\u2019s fair for me to say that you have probably got more experience than the average layperson when it comes to alleged sex crimes, is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-6\">Rice: I would say so, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-7\">Hudspeth: And is that-that\u2019s probably going to have an impact in this case, wouldn\u2019t it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-8\">Rice: I have the knowledge, but I can certainly stay biased [sic], and I wouldn\u2019t be prejudiced.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-9\">Hudspeth: Okay. How can you say that? I\u2019m not trying to sound prejudiced, but I have to ask the question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-10\">Rice: That\u2019s a fair question. Just because I-even in the training and even in the education I\u2019ve seen, there is always both sides to each story. And there has been false accusations. There has been true accusations. I mean, until you see the evidence and hear the circumstances, you can\u2019t make that judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-11\">Hudspeth: Fair enough. Thank you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-12\">Hudspeth then questioned other prospective jurors, including Caldwell. Later, Hudspeth asked Rice if she felt she could be fair and impartial after listening to Caldwell\u2019s statements. Rice responded, \u201cI do.\u201d Hudspeth challenged Rice for cause, basing his challenge on her education and plans to work as a sex offender evaluator. The District Court denied the challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-13\">\u00b638 Heath argues that Rice\u2019s training predisposed her to finding him guilty, and she could have become a non-testifying expert in jury deliberations. Nothing of record supports Heath\u2019s speculation. In addition, as discussed above, Heath offers no authority for the proposition that superior knowledge about the subject matter of a case renders a potential juror biased. Therefore, we decline to address this argument. See Strauss, \u00b6 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-14\">\u00b639 Heath further argues that Rice\u2019s use of the term \u201cpredator\u201d indicated she was more likely to believe an alleged victim than a defendant. Hudspeth did not base his challenge on this statement, but on Rice\u2019s education and plans to work with sex offenders. A party may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>not raise new arguments or change his legal theory on appeal. <em>See State v. Martinez, </em>2003 MT 65, \u00b6\u00b6 17-18, 314 Mont. 434, \u00b6\u00b6 17-18, 67 P.3d 207, \u00b6\u00b6 17-18 (citation omitted). Therefore, we decline to address this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">\u00b640 Finally, Heath advances <em>United States v. Armstrong </em>(C.A.A.F. 2000), 54 M.J. 51, as an analogous case. There, the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces affirmed a ruling that a military judge erred in failing to dismiss a court-martial panelist for cause, when the panelist worked in the same law enforcement office as the investigating agent and heard \u201cdisparaging comments\u201d about the defendant. <em>Armstrong, </em>54 M.J. at 52,55. The panelist stated he could disregard the comments and be impartial, but <em>the Armstrong </em>court affirmed the ruling that the panelist\u2019s disclaimer did not dispel the implied bias which arose from the panelist\u2019s working relationship with the investigator. <em>Armstrong, </em>54 M.J. at 53, 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">\u00b641  Unlike the <em>Armstrong </em>panelist\u2019s working relationship with an investigator directly involved in the defendant\u2019s case, Rice\u2019s education and wish to become a sex offender evaluator had no relationship whatsoever to Heath or his case. Moreover, Rice did not simply state she would disregard her past experiences and follow the law; she stated that she was aware of both true and false accusations and would need to weigh the evidence before making a judgment. We conclude Rice\u2019s training and experience did not establish a state of mind which would prevent her from acting with entire impartiality and without prejudice to Heath\u2019s substantial rights. <em>See </em>\u00a7 46-16-115(2)(j), MCA. \u00b642 We hold the District Court did not abuse its discretion in failing to dismiss Rice for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">\u00b643 2. Did the District Court err in sentencing Heath on the conviction for sexual intercourse without consent?</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">\u00b644 Sexual intercourse without consent is generally punishable by life imprisonment or imprisonment for 2 to 100 years, and a fine up to $50,000. Section 45-5-503(2), MCA (1999). A sentencing court has numerous options, including imprisonment at the Montana State Prison (MSP) and commitment to the Department of Corrections (DOC) with all but five years suspended. Sections 46-18-201(3)(c) - (d), MCA (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">\u00b645 Before trial, Heath had executed a plea agreement, under which the sentence recommended by the State would be a 10-year DOC commitment, with 7 years suspended. A pre-sentence investigation report (PSI) performed at that time supported this recommendation. Heath pled guilty but later withdrew his plea, and no new PSI was prepared after his trial and conviction. At sentencing, the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>Court asked about the earlier plea agreement terms and repeatedly stated it was not sure it would have accepted the recommendation. Defense counsel argued that nothing justified an increase over the plea agreement recommendation. The State recommended a 40-year sentence at the MSP, with no time suspended, for the sexual intercourse without consent charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">\u00b646 The District Court committed Heath to the DOC for 25 years, with 5 years suspended, for sexual intercourse without consent. The reasons for the sentence were \u201cthe Defendant\u2019s prior criminal history, the nature of the offense, and the Defendant\u2019s lack of remorse,\u201d as well as \u201cthe protection of society.\u201d As conditions of his sentence, Heath was required to complete phase 1 of the sex offender program and a criminal thinking course at the MSP.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">\u00b647 Heath argues, and the State concedes, that the District Court erred in failing to suspend all but the first five years of Heath\u2019s DOC commitment. The parties also agree that Heath\u2019s failure to object to the sentence contemporaneously is not a bar to raising the issue on appeal, because we review any allegedly illegal sentence timely presented on appeal. <em>See State v. Brister, </em>2002 MT 13, \u00b6 16, 308 Mont. 154, \u00b6 16, 41 P.3d 314, \u00b6 16 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">\u00b648 The parties diverge on the question of how the illegal sentence should be remedied. Heath argues the illegal portion of his sentence should be stricken, so his DOC commitment would be 25 years, with all but 5 years suspended. In support, he correctly cites to cases in which we vacated illegal portions of sentences or remanded with instructions to strike the illegal portions. <em>See, e.g., State v. Parker, </em>2002 MT 162, \u00b6 14, 310 Mont. 418, \u00b6 14, 51 P.3d 484, \u00b6 14; <em>State v. Shockley, </em>2001 MT 180, \u00b6 11, 306 Mont. 196, \u00b6 11, 31 P.3d 350, \u00b6 11; <em>State v. Aguilar, </em>1999 MT 159, \u00b6 10, 295 Mont. 133, \u00b6 10, 983 P.2d 345, \u00b6 10. The State, on the other hand, urges us to remand for resentencing, relying on <em>Kern, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 55-57, a case in which we affirmed a district court\u2019s correction of an illegal DOC commitment. In other cases, we have remanded for resentencing after determining a portion of a sentence was illegal. <em>See State v. Williams, </em>2003 MT 136, \u00b6 15, 316 Mont. 140, \u00b6 15, 69 P.3d 222, \u00b6 15; <em>Brister, </em>\u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">\u00b649 This Court has not adopted clear-cut rules concerning the appropriate remedy for a partially illegal sentence. In general, we have vacated or remanded with instructions to strike when the illegal portion of a sentence was a condition of a suspended sentence or a sentence enhancement. <em>See, e.g., Shockley, </em>\u00b6 11. We generally have remanded for resentencing when the illegal portion \u201caffect[ed] the entire sentence\u201d or when we were unable to discern what sentence the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>trial court would have imposed had it correctly applied the law. <em>See, e.g., Williams, </em>\u00b6 15; <em>Blister, </em>\u00b6 28. Having set forth these two relatively distinct categories of cases involving partially illegal sentences, we conclude it is not practicable to articulate a \u201cone size fits all\u201d rule. Therefore, we examine the sentence and record to determine the appropriate remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">\u00b650 The District Court followed neither the State\u2019s recommendation for a 40-year MSP sentence, with no time suspended, nor defense counsel\u2019s recommendation for a 10-year DOC commitment, with 7 years suspended. Instead, it committed Heath to the DOC for 25 years, with 5 years suspended. As set forth above, \u00a7 46-18-203(d), MCA (1999), requires that all but 5 years of the commitment be suspended. Striking the illegal portion would result in a commitment to the DOC of 25 years, with 20 suspended, rather than the 25-year commitment, with 5 suspended, that the sentencing court imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">\u00b651 In addition to the lengthy-but illegal-commitment to the DOC, the District Court required Heath to complete a sex offender program and criminal thinking course at the MSP. The court stated the reasons for the sentence as Heath\u2019s prior criminal history, his lack of remorse, the nature of the offense, and the protection of society. On this record, we conclude the illegal unsuspended portion of Heath\u2019s sentence \u201caffects the entire sentence,\u201d and we cannot discern what the District Court would have done if it had properly applied the law. <em>See Williams, </em>\u00b6 15; <em>Brister, </em>\u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">\u00b652  Heath asserts, however, that resentencing \u201ccould impermissibly expose [him] to an increased sentence.\u201d He relies on <em>North Carolina v. Pearce </em>(1969), 395 U.S. 711, 725, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 2080, 23 L.Ed.2d 656, 669, for the proposition that \u201c[d]ue process of law ... requires that vindictiveness against a defendant for having successfully attacked his first conviction must play no part in the sentence he receives after a new trial.\u201d Although the present case does not involve a retrial, there can be no dispute that the District Court, on remand for resentencing, cannot allow vindictiveness to play a part in imposing a new sentence on Heath. However, the <em>Pearce </em>presumption against vindictiveness was \u201cnot designed to prevent the imposition of an increased sentence on retrial for some valid reason associated with the need for flexibility and discretion in the sentencing pi\u2019ocess.\u201d <em>State v. Hubbel, </em>2001 MT 31, \u00b6 27, 304 Mont. 184, \u00b6 27, 20 P.3d 111, \u00b6 27 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">\u00b653  We hold the District Court erred in committing Heath to the DOC for 25 years, with 5 years suspended, and we remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>\u00b654 Affirmed in part, reversed in part and remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b250-4\">JUSTICES WARNER, COTTER, REGNIER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b250-5\">JUSTICE LEAPHART</author>\n<p id=\"AJ2\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">\u00b655 I dissent as to juror Caldwell. During the course of voir dire, Caldwell stated that she was the victim of a stalking incident which resulted in a property crime. She had also volunteered as a rape survivor advocate and stated, on two different occasions during voir dire that, if she were in the shoes of the defendant in a rape (sexual intercourse without consent) case, she \u201cprobably wouldn\u2019t want somebody on the jury that had my experience.\u201d These straightforward statements from a prospective juror are sufficient to raise a serious question about her ability to be fair and impartial. <em>State v. DeVore, </em>1998 MT 340, \u00b6 24, 292 Mont. 325, \u00b6 24, 972 P.2d 816, \u00b6 24 (belief that defendant was guilty of something demonstrated a serious question about ability to be impartial and honor the presumption of innocence). \u00b656 Section 46-16-115(2)(j), MCA, provides that a prospective juror can be challenged if it is apparent that the juror has \u201ca state of mind in reference to the case or to either of the parties that would prevent the juror from acting with entire impartiality and without prejudice to the substantial rights of either party.\u201d Obviously, no one is in a better position than Caldwell herself to explain her \u201cstate of mind.\u201d When Caldwell, a victim of a sex-related crime and a rape survivor volunteer, states that \u201cI feel I probably shouldn\u2019t be on this particular case,\u201d neither the trial court nor this Court should be second guessing her truthful acknowledgment that another juror could be \u201cmore fair and impartial.\u201d Fairness does not come in degrees. Either a juror feels she can be fair and impartial or not. The defendant has a constitutional right to a fair and impartial jury, and he should not have to exercise a peremptory challenge to excuse someone with Caldwell\u2019s admittedly skeptical state of mind.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b250-7\">JUSTICE NELSON</author>\n<p id=\"ASq\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">I concur in the dissent of JUSTICE LEAPHART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
