During the trial, it was discovered that one of the jurors had a mid-trial conversation with a Billings police detective who was slated to be called as a State\u2019s witness. As a result, Kennedy moved for a mistrial. The District Court denied Kennedy\u2019s motion, and the trial proceeded. Kennedy appeals. We affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">\u00b62 Kennedy raises two issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court violate Kennedy\u2019s constitutional right to be present at the critical stages of his trial when it excluded him from its conversation with juror Mike Clark?</p>\n<p id=\"b185-10\">\u00b64 2. Did Mike Clark\u2019s conversation with Detective Helderop constitute juror misconduct?</p>\n<p id=\"b185-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b185-12\">\u00b65 On February 22, 2001, the State filed an information charging Kennedy with one count of sexual intercourse without consent, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-503, MCA (1999), one count of aggravated kidnapping by accountability, in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 45-2-301 and 45-5-303, MCA (1999), and two counts of sexual intercourse without consent by accountability, in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 45-2-301 and 45-5-503, MCA (1999). Kennedy pled not guilty to all four counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-13\">\u00b66 The case proceeded to jury trial on July 16, 2001. One of the witnesses slated to testify for the State was Detective Trevor Helderop from the Billings Police Department. As such, the prosecutor questioned the prospective jurors during <em>voir dire </em>about whether or not they were acquainted with Helderop. The relevant portion of the prosecutor\u2019s inquiry is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-14\">Prosecutor: How about Detective Trevor Helderop with the Billings Police Department?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>Prosecutor: Okay. Good morning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-4\">Prospective Juror: Hi.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-5\">Prosecutor: What is your name, sir[?]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-6\">Prospective Juror: Mike Clark.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-7\">Prosecutor: Do you know - are you friends with Detective Helderop?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-8\">Clark: Yes, he is my friend.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-9\">Prosecutor: I think I knew that. Will you be able to sit and listen to his testimony? Are you comfortable with that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-10\">Clark: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-11\">Prosecutor: Will you be prone to give it any more weight because you know him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-12\">Clark: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-13\">Prosecutor: All right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-14\">Clark was ultimately selected as a member of the jury panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-15\">\u00b67 Before testimony commenced on the first day of trial, the District Court gave the jury the following admonition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-16\">It is important as jurors and officers of the court [that] you obey the following instructions at any time you leave the jury box, whether it be for recesses of the court during the day, or when you leave the courtroom to go home at night. First, done [sic] talk about this case among yourselves or with anyone else during the course of the trial.... You may only enter into discussion about this case with the other members of the jury after it is submitted to you for your decision. All such discussion will take place in the jury room.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-17\">Second, do not let any person talk about this case in your presence. If anyone does talk about it, tell them you are a juror on the case. If they want [sic] stop talking, report that to me as soon as you are able to do so....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-18\">Third, although it is normal human tendency to talk and visit with people, both at home and in public, you may not during the time you serve on this jury talk with any of the parties or their attorneys or any witnesses. By this I mean not only do not talk about the case, but do not talk at all, even to pass the time of day. In no other way can the parties be assured of the fairness they are entitled to expect from you as jurors. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-19\">The District Court repeated a similar admonition, warning the jurors not to discuss the case amongst themselves or with anyone else, each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>time the court broke for a recess.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">\u00b68 Before testimony began on July 18, 2001, the third day of trial, the District Court met with counsel in chambers to discuss a situation involving one of the jurors. The prosecutor explained the situation as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-5\">We had information last night that Trevor Helderop has had communication with one of the jurors, Mr. Clark, Mike Clark ... Here is how that communication began and what the substance was ... Yesterday, Trevor Helderop called [victim/witness assistant Sandy Harris] to check in about when he was to testify and asked her, How is it going? [Sandy\u2019s] response to him was, It is going fine, with the exception ... that there is one juror who won\u2019t look at [the victim] while she\u2019s testifying. Sandy said, I think that [that juror] is your friend.... That was the extent of their conversation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-6\">Unbeknownst I think to any of us, Mr. Helderop\u2019s friendship with Mr. Clark is more significant than I think we knew, although Mr. Clark did disclose during jury selection he was friends with Mr. Helderop, apparently they are [the] best of friends and are in daily communication.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-7\">Mr. Clark contacted Mr. Helderop yesterday at noon, as it is their custom to talk everyday. When they were having the conversation, Mr. Helderop initiated the statement, I understand you won\u2019t look at the victim. [Clark] responded by saying, She has been through enough, she didn\u2019t need one more person staring at her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-8\">Yesterday, late afternoon, after court was over ... another officer ... called Sandy Harris and said, I think Helderop has had contact with a juror.... Sandy Harris hung up and immediately reported that to us.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">\u00b69 Defense counsel responded to this information by moving for both a mistrial and a dismissal with prejudice. The prosecutor requested that the District Court remove Clark from the jury and replace him with the alternate juror. The prosecutor further offered to exclude Helderop as a witness. Defense counsel objected to the prosecutor\u2019s suggestion, stating that because the other jurors were aware of Clark\u2019s friendship with Helderop, Clark\u2019s sudden removal could contaminate the rest of the jury panel. Defense counsel further reminded the District Court that the misconduct had been initiated by Helderop. After some discussion, the District Court excused counsel from chambers, stating that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUs\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>I need the statute [on juror replacement]. I need to look at that... I need to determine, first of all, from this Mike Clark, you know, his view of the situation. And if I - I\u2019ll do that in chambers on the record with [the court reporter] and advise you accordingly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">\u00b610 With the court reporter present, the District Court then met with Clark in chambers. Neither Kennedy nor any member of counsel was present during this meeting. When questioned about his conversation with Helderop, Clark stated that he had misunderstood the District Court\u2019s admonition that the jurors were not to have contact with the witnesses. Clark further stated that while he and Helderop had discussed his lack of eye contact with the victim, they did not discuss any aspect of the case itself. Finally, Clark stated that he did not mention his conversation with Helderop to the other jurors. The District Court reacted by excusing Clark from jury service and warning him not to speak to the other members of the jury panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">\u00b611 Following its meeting with Clark, the District Court again met with counsel in chambers. The prosecutor moved to replace Clark with the alternate juror. Defense counsel objected, and renewed his motion for a mistrial. The District Court denied defense counsel\u2019s motion and replaced Clark with the alternate juror. The District Court made no statement to the jury panel regarding Clark\u2019s removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">\u00b612 The prosecution excluded Helderop as a witness and the trial proceeded to conclusion. On July 20, 2001, the jury found Kennedy guilty of sexual intercourse without consent. Kennedy was sentenced on February 13, 2002. He filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">\u00b613 Whether a criminal defendant\u2019s right to be present at the critical stages of his or her trial has been violated is a question of constitutional law. Our review of questions of constitutional law is plenary. <em>Schmill v. Liberty Northwest Ins. Corp., </em>2003 MT 80, \u00b6 9, 315 Mont. 51, \u00b6 9, 67 P.3d 290, \u00b6 9. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether its interpretation of the law is correct. <em>State v. Ray, </em>2003 MT 171, \u00b6 12, 316 Mont. 354, \u00b6 12, 71 P.3d 1247, \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">\u00b614  A district court\u2019s determination of whether to grant a motion for a mistrial must be based on whether the defendant has been denied a fair and impartial trial. <em>State v. Herrman, </em>2003 MT 149, \u00b6 36, 316 Mont. 198, \u00b6 36, 70 P.3d 738, \u00b6 36. This Court\u2019s standard of review of a grant or denial of a motion for a mistrial is whether the district court abused its discretion. <em>Herrman, </em>\u00b6 36. Similarly, the decision of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>district court as to the impartiality of a jury should not be set aside unless there is a clear abuse of discretion. <em>State v. McMahon </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 75, 78, 894 P.2d 313, 315.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Afq\">ISSUE 1</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">\u00b6 15 Did the District Court violate Kennedy\u2019s constitutional right to be present at the critical stages of his trial when it excluded him from its conversation with juror Mike Clark?</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">\u00b616  The federal constitutional right to be present at all criminal proceedings is one of the most basic rights contained in the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment. <em>State v. Tapson, </em>2001 MT 292, \u00b6 14, 307 Mont. 428, \u00b6 14, 41 P.3d 305, \u00b6 14 (citing <em>Illinois v. Allen </em>(1970), 397 U. S. 337, 338, 90 S. Ct. 1057, 1058, 25 L. Ed. 2d 353). The right to be present stems in part from the fact that by his or her physical presence, a defendant can hear and see the proceedings, and can participate in the preservation of his or her rights. <em>Sturgis v. Goldsmith </em>(9th Cir. 1986), 796 F.2d 1103, 1108. However, the right also rests upon society\u2019s interest in due process. That is, a defendant\u2019s right to be present at all proceedings which may take his or her life or liberty is designed to safeguard the public\u2019s interest in a fair and orderly judicial system. <em>Sturgis, </em>796 F.2d at 1108-09.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">\u00b617  In Montana, the right of a criminal defendant to be present at his or her trial is expressly guaranteed by Article II, Section 24, of the Montana Constitution, which provides, in pertinent part: \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions the accused shall have the right to appear and defend in person and by counsel.\u201d Moreover, because the right to appear and defend is found within Montana\u2019s Declaration of Rights, it is a fundamental right under the Montana Constitution. <em>Tapson, </em>\u00b6 15; <em>State v. Bird, </em>2001 MT 2, \u00b6 25, 308 Mont. 75, \u00b6 25, 43 P.3d 266, \u00b6 25. \u00b618 In 1922<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, this Court interpreted the right to appear and defend to mean that: \u201c[TJhe defendant must be present throughout the entire trial.\u201d <em>State v. Reed </em>(1922), 65 Mont. 51, 56, 210 P. 756, 757 (emphasis added). The <em>Reed </em>Court further noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-8\">No principle of law, relating to criminal procedure, is better settled than that, in felony cases, nothing should be done in the absence of the prisoner. It is his unquestioned right \u2018to be confronted with his accusers and witnesses.\u2019 He has the legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>right to be present when the jury are hearing his case, and at all times during the proceeding of the trial, when anything is done which in any manner affects his right....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-4\"><em>Reed, </em>65 Mont. at 58, 210 P. at 758 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">\u00b619 In this case, the District Court questioned <em>juror Mike </em>Clark after learning that Clark had a telephone conversation with witness Trevor Helderop on the second day of trial. Neither Kennedy nor his counsel were present during the District Court\u2019s questioning of Clark. As we noted above, a defendant has a constitutional right to be present at all stages of his or her trial. <em>Reed, </em>65 Mont. at 58, 210 P. at 758; <em>State v. Musgrove </em>(1978), 178 Mont. 162, 170, 582 P.2d 1246, 1251. Accordingly, Kennedy asserts that the District Court violated his constitutional right to be present when it excluded him from its conversation with Clark.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">\u00b620 This Court addressed situations involving a defendant\u2019s absence during proceedings between the court and members of the jury <em>inState v. Tapson </em>and <em>State v. Bird. </em>In <em>Tapson, </em>Floyd Tapson was charged with sexual intercourse without consent, <em>aggravated </em>kidnapping and attempted deliberate homicide. <em>Tapson, </em>\u00b6 6. At the conclusion of Tapson\u2019s trial, the District Court Judge entered the jury room during deliberations in order to deliver substitute verdict forms to the jury. Neither counsel nor Tapson were present during the Judge\u2019s conversation with the jury, and no record was made of the conversation. <em>Tapson, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 10-11. After eleven minutes, the District Court Judge returned to the courtroom and the jury resumed their deliberations. <em>Tapson, </em>\u00b6 11. Tapson was ultimately convicted of attempted deliberate homicide. <em>Tapson, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">\u00b621 Tapson appealed his conviction, alleging that the District Court\u2019s actions violated his constitutional right to be present during the critical stages of his trial. <em>Tapson, </em>\u00b6 4. We examined Tapson\u2019s claim, and noted that: \u201cTapson\u2019s counsel was not present in the jury room with the judge and no cotut reporter attended the meeting to record what occurred.\u201d <em>Tapson, </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">\u00b622 We also noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-9\">No one informed Tapson that the Judge\u2019s intrusion into the jury room implicated two of Tapson\u2019s fundamental rights - the right to personally appear at all criminal proceedings and the right to a public trial. While Tapson\u2019s counsel professed to waive these rights, there is nothing in the record to indicate that Tapson himself was appraised of these rights, nor is there anything in the record indicating that he personally made a knowing, intelligent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>and voluntary waiver of these rights. On the contrary, the judge explained that he was going to personally enter the jury room with the new verdict forms and instruct the jury because it was the easiest way to handle this process. Tapson could not have been fully informed when the option to proceed in private or in open court was only presented as a matter of convenience.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AWk\"><em>Tapson, </em>\u00b6 27. Therefore, we concluded that the District Court violated Tapson\u2019s constitutional rights to a public trial and to be present at all critical stages of his trial when it excluded Tapson, his counsel, and a court reporter from its conversation with the jury panel. <em>Tapson, </em>\u00b6 33. \u00b623 In <em>Bird, </em>Paul Bird was charged with partner or family member assault. <em>Bird, </em>\u00b6 10. Prior to trial, the District Court granted the State\u2019s motion to conduct individual <em>voir dire </em>of any prospective juror who had a personal experience with domestic violence. <em>Bird, </em>\u00b6 12. The District Court then proceeded to conduct individual <em>voir dire </em>sessions with several of the prospective jurors in chambers. Bird was not present for these individual <em>voir dire </em>sessions. <em>Bird, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 12-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">\u00b624 At least one of the prospective jurors questioned by the District Coui\u2019t remained on the final jury panel, and Bird was convicted of partner or family member assault. <em>Bird, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 14, 16, 21. Bird appealed his conviction, alleging that the District Court violated his constitutional right to appear when it excluded him from its in-chambers <em>voir dire </em>sessions. <em>Bird, </em>\u00b6 5. We analyzed Bird\u2019s claim and noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-5\">[T]he in-chambers <em>voir dire </em>was conducted specifically to elicit prospective jurors\u2019 personal feelings and experiences regarding domestic violence. Since [Bird] was excluded from the in-chambers <em>voir dire, </em>he never heard those prospective jurors [sic] responses. In particular, he did not have the opportunity to hear [a prospective juror] explain her biases in seeing repeat incidences of domestic violence. This prevented [Bird] from knowing about her prejudices and from insisting that defense counsel strike her with a peremptory challenge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-6\"><em>Bird, </em>\u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">\u00b625 We further noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-8\">[NJeither the trial court, the prosecutor, or defense counsel informed [Bird] that he had a constitutional right to be present during the individual questioning of the jurors. Nor did the court give [Bird] the opportunity to choose to participate in the individual <em>voir dire. </em>Therefore, not only did [Bird] not voluntarily, intelligently, and knowingly waive his right to be present, he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>never afforded the opportunity to waive that right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-4\"><em>Bird, </em>\u00b6 37. Accordingly, we concluded that the District Court violated Bird\u2019s constitutional right to be present at the critical stages of his trial when it excluded him from its in-chambers <em>voir dire </em>sessions. <em>Bird, </em>\u00b6 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">\u00b626 While the instant case differs factually from <em>Bird </em>and <em>Tapson, </em>we note that, like the defendants in <em>Bird </em>and <em>Tapson, </em>Kennedy was excluded from a critical stage of his trial. Here, the State informed the court and the parties that a juror had been in telephone contact with one of the detectives who was scheduled to testify at trial. Thus, there was no question that a detective had crossed the line, and that a juror-had ignored the court\u2019s admonishment to refrain from outside contact with any other persons or witnesses. Nor was the contact innocuous, as the conversation between Helderop and Clark related directly to the trial proceedings. In short, the District Court was faced with the clear possibility that juror misconduct had occurred, which threatened to compromise the fairness of the entire proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">\u00b627  Because an impartial jury is so fundamental to a defendant\u2019s right to receive a fair trial, the District Court\u2019s questioning of Clark was a critical stage of Kennedy\u2019s trial. See <em>State v. Eagan </em>(1978), 178 Mont. 67, 75, 582 P.2d 1195, 1200 (the right to a trial by an impartial jury is sacred in our system of jurisprudence); and <em>State v. LaMere, </em>2000 MT 45, \u00b6 50, 298 Mont. 358, \u00b6 50, 2 P.3d 204, \u00b6 50 (the impartiality of the jury goes to the very integrity of our justice system). Moreover, Kennedy\u2019s absence from the District Court\u2019s dialogue with Clark precluded Kennedy from questioning Clark about his conversation with Helderop, and from listening to and gauging Clark\u2019s responses. Therefore, we hold that the District Court violated Kennedy\u2019s constitutional right to be present at the critical stages of his trial when it excluded him from its conversation with juror Mike Clark.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">\u00b628 On appeal, the State contends that even if the District Court\u2019s questioning of Clark was a critical stage of Kennedy\u2019s trial, defense counsel waived Kennedy\u2019s presence at such questioning because he failed to object to the questioning before it occurred. The State relies upon <em>State v. LaDue, </em>2001 MT 47, \u00b6 28, 304 Mont. 288, \u00b6 28, 20 P.3d 775, \u00b6 28, in which we stated that: \u201c[A]n objection concerning jurisdictional or constitutional matters must be raised before the trial court... and if the objection is not made it will not be heard on appeal.\u201d \u00b629 We noted in <em>Bird, </em>however, that before a defendant can waive a fundamental right, \u201csuch waiver, to be recognized by the courts, must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>be informed and intelligent for there can be no waiver by one who does not know his rights or what he is waiving.\u201d <em>Bird, </em>\u00b6 36 (citation omitted). To that end, we concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-4\">[A] trial court must explain to the defendant, on the record, the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to be present at all critical stages of the trial... and that if a defendant chooses to waive that right, the court must obtain an on-the-record personal waiver by the defendant acknowledging that the defendant voluntarily, intelligently and knowingly waives that right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-5\"><em>Bird, </em>\u00b6 38, see also <em>Tapson, </em>\u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">\u00b630  In the instant case, the District Court failed to inform Kennedy that he had a constitutional right to be present during its questioning of juror Mike Clark. The District Court also neglected to inform Kennedy that such questioning was about to occur. Therefore, not only did Kennedy not voluntarily, intelligently and knowingly waive his right to be present, he was never told that his right existed and was about to be compromised by the District Court\u2019s plan to question Clark outside of his presence. See also <em>Bird, </em>\u00b6 37. Accordingly, any \u201cwaiver\u201d made by defense counsel on behalf of Kennedy was ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">\u00b631 We also note that while the State correctly points out that <em>Bird. </em>and <em>Tapson </em>were decided after Kennedy\u2019s tidal, this fact is immaterial to our resolution of this issue. That is, <em>Bird </em>and <em>Tapson </em>were not cases of first impression in Montana. Our decisions in <em>Bird </em>and <em>Tapson </em>were premised upon settled Montana law and a criminal defendant\u2019s firmly established constitutional right to be present at all critical stages of his or her trial. Our decisions in <em>Bird </em>and <em>Tapson </em>did not change the law, they simply reaffirmed it. Thus, there is no retroactive application of a newly announced principle of law at work in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">\u00b632 Significantly, the State argues that even if the District Court violated Kennedy\u2019s constitutional right to be present at the critical stages of his trial, such violation was harmless, because Kennedy did not suffer any prejudice. In <em>Tapson, </em>we analyzed a similar argument made by the State and noted that: \u201cAlthough the most important factor here is the actual intrusion of the Judge into the jury room during deliberations, the lack of a record \u2018makes it impossible to say that, beyond a reasonable doubt, there was no prejudice to the defendant, and therefore harmless error.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tapson, </em>\u00b6 31. Consequently, we determined that because a deficit in the record made it impossible to conclude that the defendant did not suffer prejudice, the District Court\u2019s entry into the jury room constituted reversible error. <em>Tapson,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b194-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>\u00b6\u00b6 30-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">\u00b633 In this case, however, the record is not ambiguous as to the District Court\u2019s conversation with Mike Clark. Moreover, the corrective actions taken by the District Court-immediate removal of Clark from the jury panel, his replacement with the alternate juror, and the exclusion of Helderop as a witness-are a matter of record as well. Thus, unlike the situation in <em>Tapson, </em>the District Court\u2019s actions arising out of the Clark/Helderop situation can be readily assessed for prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">\u00b634  That said, we conclude that Kennedy was not prejudiced by his exclusion from the District Court\u2019s conversation with Clark. That is, following its conversation with Clark, the District Court immediately excused Clark from jury service. Clark subsequently left the courtroom, without speaking to any of the other jurors, and was replaced, pursuant to \u00a7 46-16-118, MCA (1999), by the alternate juror. Moreover, Trevor Helderop, the witness with whom Clark had spoken, did not testify at Kennedy\u2019s trial. Therefore, while Kennedy\u2019s exclusion from the District Court\u2019s conversation with Clark violated his constitutional right to be present at the critical stages of his trial, such exclusion did not cause Kennedy prejudice because any opportunity Kennedy missed to question Clark about his conversation with Helderop was mooted when Clark was removed from the jury panel and Helderop was excluded as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">\u00b635  As we noted above, when reviewing a district court\u2019s determination of whether to grant a motion for a mistrial, we look to whether the defendant has been denied a fair and impartial trial. <em>Herrman, </em>\u00b6 36. We conclude that the District Court erred in excluding Kennedy from its conversation with Clark. However, in light of the ensuing corrective actions taken by the court, we hold that the error did not ultimately deprive Kennedy of a fair and impartial trial. Accordingly, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Kennedy\u2019s motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">ISSUE 2</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">\u00b636 Did Mike Clark\u2019s conversation with Detective Helderop constitute juror misconduct?</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">\u00b637 On appeal, Kennedy alleges that Mike Clark\u2019s conversation with Detective Helderop constituted juror misconduct. In light of the fact that Clark ignored the District Court\u2019s repeated admonitions and called Helderop on the phone mid-trial, the answer to this question seems self-evident. However, as we have already concluded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>Kennedy was not deprived of a fair trial as a result of the District Court\u2019s handling of the Clark/Helderop situation, we need not spend time debating and deciding this question. As such, we decline to reach this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">\u00b638 For the forgoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b195-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES REGNIER, NELSON, LEAPHART, RICE and WARNER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b189-9\"> The constitutional provision interpreted by the <em>Reed </em>Court is identical to Article II, Section 24, of the current Montana Constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
