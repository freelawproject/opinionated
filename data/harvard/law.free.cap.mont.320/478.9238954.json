(Collection Bureau), filed a complaint on February 23,2001, in Justice Court against Ruth Morrow (Morrow) to collect the face value, service charges, and statutory damages for eight checks she issued with insufficient funds in June of 2000. Morrow countered that Collection Bureau waived its right to seek $800 in statutory damages under \u00a7 27-1-717(3), MCA, and in pursuing such damages, it had violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692. After the Justice Court entered judgment in favor of Morrow, Collection Bureau appealed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>the District Court. The District Court also granted summary judgment in favor of Morrow and, after a trial on damages, awarded actual damages, statutory damages, costs of suit and attorney fees to Morrow. Collection Bureau now appeals those two orders of the District Court. For the reasons stated below, we affirm the orders of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">\u00b62 In June of 2000, Ruth Morrow issued eight bad checks for a total face value of $148.96. The checks ranged in value from $10.20 to $25.00. Three of the checks were to the Golden Spur, three to Pizza Hut, and one each to 4B\u2019s and Holiday. Those businesses engaged Collection Bureau to collect the unpaid value of the checks. In July 2000, Collection Bureau sent Morrow eight letters, one for each check demanding the face value plus a thirty dollar service charge. Adding the thirty dollar service charge to each of eight checks increased the amount Morrow owed by $240.00, more than doubling the amount from $148.96 to $388.96. On November 22, 2000, Collection Bureau sent Morrow another letter, which demanded payment of the entire balance of $388.96 and also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-6\">YOU MAY EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTY WRITING CHECKS DUE TO THE UNPAID ITEMS. MT. CODE ANNOTATED 27-1-717 PROVIDES SPECIFIC LEGAL REMEDIES. CALL US TO RESOLVE THIS.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">On December 4, 2000, Morrow responded by sending a check for $25.00. She also included a note which stated: \u201cI must have missed your bill in the mail. I will send 50.00 or more every two weeks until this is taken care of.\u201d Morrow next sent Collection Bureau a money order for $10.00 on January 4,2001. That same day, Collection Bureau returned the money order with a letter which indicated the agreement was to pay $50.00 every two weeks. On January 16, 2001, Morrow made another $50.00 payment which Collection Bureau accepted, leaving a new balance of $313.96.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">\u00b63 Morrow missed the next two promised payments, and on February 23, 2001, Collection Bureau filed suit in Justice Court. Collection Bureau\u2019s complaint prayed for a total of $1,113.96, reflecting the $313.96 balance owing for the face amount of the checks and service charges as well as the \u00a7 27-1-717(3), MCA, statutory damages of $100 for each of the eight checks for an additional $800.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">\u00b64 On February 27, 2001, Morrow sent a payment of $150.00. On March 1,2001, Morrow was served with Collection Bureau\u2019s complaint. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>The next day, she called Collection Bureau and spoke with Collection Bureau\u2019s employee Cody Kruger. Morrow asked whether or not they had received her payment and inquired into the reason for the suit. Kruger said they filed suit because of Morrow\u2019s failure to make the agreed-on payments. Morrow felt that because she had sent the money before being served, it should have been applied to reduce the $313.96 to $163.96. Kruger, however, was only willing to apply the $150.00 to reduce the total prayed for relief of $1,113.96. Kruger also indicated it might be possible to \u201cknock off\u2019 a couple hundred dollars if Morrow paid in one lump sum, or in the alternative, Collection Bureau would accept regular payments of $50.00 on the amount prayed for in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-3\">\u00b65 Throughout these proceedings, Morrow has only contested the statutory damages. She does not challenge the validity of the face value of the checks plus the service charges. The Justice Court ruled in favor of Morrow, reasoning that, by accepting partial payments instead of payment in full, Collection Bureau had waived its right to statutory damages and subsequently violated the FDCPA by pursuing such damages. On appeal, the District Court granted Morrow\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment, holding that Collection Bureau, in accepting partial payment, waived its right to the statutory damages and then violated the FDCPA by pursuing these damages. After a trial on Morrow\u2019s damages, the District Court awarded $40.00 actual damages, $1,000 statutory damages, costs of$183.75 and attorney fees in the amount of $17,000. Collection Bureau now appeals, claiming that the District Court erred in interpreting \u00a7 27-1-717, MCA, and that if it violated the FDCPA the bona fide error defense applies. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692k(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">\u00b66 Our standard of review on appeals from summary judgment is <em>de novo.

We conclude, as did the District Court, that Collection Bureau waived its right to statutory damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">\u00b68 Montana provides various statutory remedies for the payee or the payee\u2019s assignee ofadishonored draft. Section27-1-717, MCA. Apayee may collect both the face value of the check and a service charge in a reasonable amount not to exceed $30. Furthermore, when a written demand is made for payment in full, but payment in full is not made, then the payee or its assignee may pursue statutory damages in an amount which is \u201cequal to the service charge plus the greater of $100 or three times the amount for which the check, draft, or order was issued. However, damages may not exceed the value of the check, draft, or order by more than $500.\u201d Section 27-1-717(3), MCA. Before a payee on a dishonored check may seek statutory damages in court, it must demand payment in full and wait at least ten days. Section 27-l-717(4)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">\u00b69 The District Court held that Collection Bureau had waived its right to seek statutory damages. A waiver is the intentional and voluntary relinquishment of a known right, claim or privilege. <em>Reiter v. Yellowstone County </em>(1981), 192 Mont. 194, 202, 627 P.2d 845, 850. Statutorily-created rights may be waived.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-8\">Waiver of a benefit of a law. Anyone may waive the advantage of a law intended solely for his benefit. But a law established for a public reason cannot be contravened by a private agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQC\">Section 1-3-204, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-11\">\u00b610  Although statutes creating rights for a public benefit are not subject to waiver, <em>Rothwell v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>1999 MT 50, \u00b6 16, 293 Mont. 393, \u00b6 16, 976 P.2d 512, \u00b6 16 (employee indemnification statute, \u00a7 39-2-701(1), MCA, not subject to waiver) and <em>State ex rel. Neiss v. Dist. Ct. </em>(1973), 162 Mont. 324, 328, 511 P.2d 979, 981 (minimum wage is public benefit not subject to waiver), rights created for private benefits can be waived. In <em>Matter of Gaither </em>(1990), 244 Mont. 383, 389, 797 P.2d 208, 212, we held that the surviving widow\u2019s right to benefits under the workers\u2019 compensation laws was personal to her and thus she could waive or abandon those rights. In the present case, the right of a payee on a dishonored check to pursue statutory damages is a right created solely for the benefit of the payee and is thus subject to waiver under \u00a7 1-3-204, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-12\">\u00b611 Waiver may be proven by express declarations or by a course of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>acts and conduct so as to induce the belief that the intention and purpose was to waive. <em>Kelly v. Lovejoy </em>(1977), 172 Mont. 516, 520, 565 P.2d 321, 324. We have held that waiver may be established by conduct which manifests the intention to forego the benefit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-3\">It may be proved by express declarations, or by acts and declarations manifesting an intent and purpose not to claim the supposed advantage, or by a course of acts and conduct, or by so neglecting and failing to act, as to induce the belief that it was his intention and purpose to waive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-4\"><em>Northwestern F. &amp; M. Ins. Co. v. Pollard </em>(1925), 74 Mont. 142, 149, 238 P. 594, 596.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">\u00b612 In <em>VanDyke Const. Co., v. Stillwater Mining Co., </em>2003 MT 279, \u00b6 16, 317 Mont. 519, \u00b6 16, 78 P.3d 844, \u00b6 16, VanDyke\u2019s letters requesting arbitration were deemed a waiver of its right to subsequently object to the contract provisions requiring arbitration. The express conduct of the sellers in a real estate contract established waiver in <em>Thiel v. Johnson </em>(1985), 219 Mont. 271, 711 P.2d 829. Thiels, the sellers of a motel, expressly waived their right to receive certain monthly contract payments on time when the buyers communicated that, because of low winter months\u2019 revenue and an increase in utility rates, they were unable to make their monthly installment payments. Thiels said this was \u201cfine\u201d and that they were willing to work with the buyers as long as the interest payments were made on the underlying contract with the previous owner and \u201cthey would be glad to extend their payments to be made until the summer season started rolling again.\u201d <em>Thiel, </em>219 Mont. at 275, 711 P.2d at 832.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">\u00b613 In the present case, after having already sent demand letters for each of the eight checks in July of2000, Collection Bureau sent a letter in November 2000, demanding the full amount of $388.96. Instead of paying the full amount, Morrow began making installment payments. She paid $25 in December, and included a note indicating she would make installment payments. Morrow next sent $10 in January, which Collection Bureau sent back. Shortly thereafter, Morrow sent a $50 payment which Collection Bureau accepted and applied to the balance of $363.96 leaving a balance of $313.96. Before Collection Bureau received Morrow\u2019s next payment of $150 on February 27, it had already filed suit for $1,113.96, including $800 statutory damages under \u00a7 27-1-717(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">\u00b614 Collection Bureau contends that there was no intentional waiver of a known right and that, although it accepted partial payments, it repeatedly told Morrow that if she did not make the agreed upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>payments, it could invoke its legal remedies under the law. It further contends that it complied with the statute by giving notice in July and November and that nothing would be accomplished by requiring it to give yet another notice. Finally, it contends that it would be contrary to public policy to penalize payees for attempting to settle claims through acceptance of partial payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">\u00b615 Morrow responds that the District Court\u2019s ruling does not discourage settlement or put debt collectors at a disadvantage. The collector is in control; it can choose whether or not to accept partial payments. If it accepts partial payments, it has not permanently waived its rights to statutory damages. It can reinstate that right with the giving of a new notice. Morrow also points out that, even after accepting partial payments, the collector can, without giving any further notice, pursue a claim for the amount of the debt plus the $30 service fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">\u00b616 The District Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-6\">After making the written demand for payment in full for the dishonored checks and service charges, CBS accepted partial payments. By accepting just one partial payment, CBS effectively waived its ability to sue for the $800.00 in statutory damages pursuant to the November 22, 2000 notice. Having waived its right to sue for the statutory damages under the November demand, in order to comply with the Montana Code Annotated \u00a7 27-1-717, CBS had to reinstate its statutory rights by issuing another written demand for payment of the remaining balance after deducting all partial payments and waiting ten days. If full payment was not tendered pursuant to the new written demand, CBS could then demand the statutory damages in addition to the remaining balance of dishonored checks and service charges in a lawsuit filed pursuant to CBS\u2019s rights under \u00a727-1-717.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">\u00b617 We agree with the reasoning of the District Court. The statutory scheme is designed to give the debtor a ten-day opportunity to pay the debt and service charges before being faced with civil liability for statutory damages. Where, as here, the collector engages in a course of conduct wherein it demands full payment but accepts partial payment, the debtor is led to believe that the collector has foregone its demand and that partial payments are acceptable. Contrary to Collection Bureau\u2019s assertion that another demand would serve no purpose, another demand (after having accepted a partial payment) puts the debtor on notice that partial payments are no longer acceptable; that payment in full of the new balance (prior demand less <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>credit for partial payments) must be paid within ten days or the collector may invoke its remedies for statutory damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-3\">\u00b618  We hold that acceptance of a partial payment after having made a demand for full payment waives the collector\u2019s right to statutory damages under \u00a7 27-1-717, MCA. In order to reinstate its right to such damages, the collector must make further demand for payment of the new balance and then wait the requisite ten days before filing suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">Part II: Violations of the FDCPA</p>\n<p id=\"AY0\">\u00b619 The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-5\">A debt collector may not use unfair or unconscionable means to collect or attempt to collect any debt. Without limiting the general application of the foregoing, the following conduct is a violation of this section:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-6\">(1) The collection of any amount (including any interest, fee, charge, or expense incidental to the principal obligation) unless such amount is expressly authorized by the agreement creating the debt <em>or permitted by law.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692f(l) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">\u00b620 The District Court held that, since Collection Bureau sought statutory damages under \u00a7 27-1-717, MCA, without having given the requisite demand, it had attempted to collect an amount which was not \u201cpermitted by law\u201d and thus had violated 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692f(l). In particular, the District Court concluded that Collection Bureau violated the FDCPA when it sued for statutory damages without having first complied with the notice requirements of Montana law and then, instead of crediting Morrow\u2019s $150 partial payment against the amount owed on the checks ($313.96), it credited it against the statutory damages prayed for in the complaint ($1,113.96).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">\u00b621 The District Court correctly interpreted the federal law. The FDCPA clearly prohibits a debt collector from using unfair or unconscionable means to \u201ccollect or attempt to collect any debt.\u201d <em>Transamerica Financial </em>Services, <em>Inc. v. Sykes </em>(7th Cir. 1999), 171 F.3d 553, 555 (\u00a7 1692f applies to circumstances where debt collectors attempt to collect fee not authorized by law); <em>Newman v. Checkrite Calif., Inc. </em>(E.D. Cal. 1995), 912 F.Supp. 1354, 1377 (attempt to recover amounts not authorized by law is violation of \u00a7 1692f(l)). It further provides that it is unfair or unconscionable for a debt collector to collect any amount which is not expressly authorized by contract or which is not permitted by law. In the present case, Collection Bureau, in suing for statutory damages of $800 without giving a renewed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>demand was attempting to collect a sum not \u201cpermitted by law.\u201d Furthermore, in applying Morrow\u2019s $150 partial payment towards the claimed balance of $1,113.96, it actually collected a sum not \u201cpermitted by law.\u201d Failure to comply with state statutory requirements prior to attempting to collect sums in excess of the amount of the dishonored check violates \u00a7 1692f of the Act. <em>Ozkaya v. Telecheck Services, Inc. </em>(N.D. Ill. 1997), 982 F.Supp. 578, <em>586; Ditty v. CheckRite Ltd. (D. </em>Utah 1997), 973 F.Supp 1320, 1324-25. In <em>CheckRite, </em>the collector attempted to settle for the amount of the check, plus a service charge and a further sum listed as consideration for a covenant not to sue. State law, however, provided that, unless a civil action had been filed, a debtor could not be liable for a sum greater than the amount of the check, plus a service charge. Accordingly, the court concluded that CheckRite\u2019s attempt to collect the excess amount prior to filing suit violated the FDCPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">\u00b622  We conclude that when Collection Bureau accepted partial payments and then, without giving a new demand as required by \u00a7 27-1-717, MCA, sued for statutory damages and applied a subsequent partial payment of $150 towards the statutory damages, it attempted to collect and actually did collect sums which were not permitted by law. This constitutes a violation of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692f(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">\u00b623 Collection Bureau contends that, even assuming that it did violate \u00a7 27-1-717, MCA, it cannot be held liable since its violation was unintentional. Collection Bureau relies on the bona fide error defense in 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692k(c), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-6\">Intent (c) A debt collector may not be held liable in any action brought under this subchapter if the debt collector shows by a preponderance of the evidence that the violation was not intentional and resulted from a bona fide error notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such error.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">\u00b624 Collection Bureau argues that, since there was no prior case law interpreting \u00a7 27-1-</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">717, MCA, as requiring a renewed demand after accepting partial payment, it had no forewarning that it was violating Montana law and thus it cannot be said that the resulting violation of FDCPA was \u201cintentional.\u201d Rather, it contends any mistake was a bona fide error. \u00b625 This raises a question as to whether a mistake of law qualifies as a bona fide error defense under \u00a7 1692k(c). There is a split of authority among the circuit courts on this issue. The minority view holds that mistakes of law can be considered bona fide errors. <em>Johnson v. Riddle </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>(10th Cir. 2002), 305 F.3d 1107, 1121. The majority view is that the defense is only available for clerical and factual errors. See, <em>e.g., Piclit v. Jon R. Hawks, Ltd. </em>(8th Cir. 2001), 236 F.3d 446, 451-52; <em>Hulshizer v. Global Credit Services, Inc. </em>(8th Cir. 1984), 728 F.2d 1037, 1038 (no bona fide error defense where the debt collector relied on advice of a Fair Trade Commission (FTC) staff attorney); <em>Pipiles v. Credit Bureau of Lockport, Inc. </em>(2nd Cir.1989), 886 F.2d 22, 27; and <em>Baker v. G.C. Services Corp. </em>(9th Cir. 1982), 677 F.2d 775. In the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Baker, </em>the issue was whether a demand letter sent by G.C. Services was misleading in that it threatened legal action when, in fact, G.C. Services had no intention of instituting legal proceedings. Relying on the \u201cbona fide error\u201d defense of \u00a7 1692k(c), G.C. Services contended that it had obtained the advice of legal counsel on the correctness of the contents of the letter and that counsel had met with the staff of the FTC to discuss compliance with the Act. The Circuit Court rejected this defense holding: \u201cReliance on advice of counsel or a mistake about the law is insufficient by itself to raise the bona fide error defense.\u201d <em>G.C. Services, </em>677 F.2d at 779.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-3\">\u00b626  We note that the Act references \u201cprocedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such error.\u201d \u201cProcedures\u201d are generally adopted to avoid clerical errors as opposed to mistakes of law. In accord with the majority view, we hold that the fact that Collection Bureau did not anticipate a decision that \u00a7 27-1-717, MCA, requires a new demand after acceptance of partial payments does not rise to the level of a \u201cbona fide error\u201d defense under \u00a7 1692k(c). That Collection Bureau mistook the law does not make its action any less intentional.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">\u00b627 For the above-stated reasons, the orders of the District Court are affirmed. The FDCPA provides for reasonable attorney fees and costs of suit for those who are successful in establishing liability under the FDCPA. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692k(a)(3). Since Morrow has prevailed, she is entitled to reasonable attorney fees and costs on appeal. We remand to the District Court for a hearing to determine Morrow\u2019s reasonable attorney fees and costs on appeal.</p>\n<judges id=\"b509-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES WARNER and REGNIER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b509-7\">JUSTICE COTTER</author>\n<p id=\"AoiV\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">\u00b628 I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">\u00b629 The Court concludes at \u00b618 that acceptance of a partial payment after having made a demand for full payment waives the collector\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>right to statutory damages under \u00a7 27-1-717, MCA. The problem is that the statute suggests no such thing.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">\u00b630 Given that CBS did not violate the statute as written, and that this Court\u2019s interpretation of the statute is a matter of first impression, I find our application of the provisions of the FDCPA, and the imposition of over $ 17,000.00 in attorney fees and costs under that Act, unconscionable. We have effectively, and in violation of \u00a7 1-2-101, MCA, inserted into \u00a7 27-1-717, MCA, what has been omitted, and then faulted CBS for not construing the law as we-for the first time-have interpreted it. Even if we conclude that CBS was wrong, it is patently unfair to punish it so excessively for taking a position that is entirely defensible under the statute as written. I therefore dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b510-5\">JUSTICE NELSON and JUSTICE RICE join in the dissent of JUSTICE COTTER.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b510-6\">JUSTICE RICE</author>\n<p id=\"AETd\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">\u00b631 I join in Justice Cotter\u2019s dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">\u00b632 Section 1-3-204, MCA, the waiver provision relied upon by the Court, is one of the \u201cMaxims of Jurisprudence.\u201d Section 1-3-101, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-9\">Purpose of maxims. The maxims of jurisprudence set forth in part 2 of this chapter are intended not to qualify any of the other provisions of this code but to aid in their just application.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AGn\">Pursuant thereto, we have held that \u00a7 1-3-204, MCA, cannot be used to \u201cqualify other substantive statutory provisions.\u201d <em>Campbell v. Mahoney, </em>2001 MT 146, \u00b6 17, 306 Mont. 45, \u00b6 17, 29 P.3d 1034, \u00b6 17. Here, the Court has used the waiver provision not only to qualify substantive law, but to re-write it.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-10\">\u00b633 In \u00b6 16, the Court cites approvingly from the District Court decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-11\">[I]n order to comply with the Montana Code Annotated \u00a7 27-1-717, CBS had to reinstate its statutory rights by issuing another written demand for payment of the remaining balance after deducting all partial payments and waiting ten days. If full payment was not tendered pursuant to the new written demand, CBS could then demand the statutory damages in addition to the remaining balance of dishonored checks and service charges in a lawsuit filed pursuant to CBS\u2019s rights under \u00a7 27-1-717.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-12\">This language, which sets forth a new \u201creinstatement\u201d requirement, established by \u201canother written demand,\u201d which must reflect \u201call partial payments,\u201d and undergo another \u201cwaiting\u201d period, is pure legislating. It is entirely inaccurate to say that these new procedures <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>are necessary \u201cto comply with\u201d \u00a7 27-1-717, MCA. Collection Bureau fully complied with the statute, and it is incredulous to hold that its full compliance with the statute somehow transformed into a waiver of its rights thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-3\">\u00b634 In order to clarify matters, the Court should announce that its new legislative requirements shall henceforth be known as new subparagraph (8) of the statute. Of course, the only problem with attaching a subparagraph number to the Court\u2019s new requirements is that the number would directly conflict with the subparagraph (8) which has been placed in the statute by the real Legislature:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-4\">(8) Making partial payments of amounts owed under this section or entering into an agreement for paying in whole or in part amounts owed under this section <em>does not waive </em>any right that the payee or the payee\u2019s assignee may have under this section. Once a demand required under this section is made, <em>the demand is not required to be repeated </em>upon partial payment of amounts owed under this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Section 27-1-717(8), MCA (2003) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">\u00b635 The courts should stay out of the legislating business. I would reverse.</p>\n<judges id=\"b511-7\">JUSTICE NELSON joins in the dissent of JUSTICE RICE.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
