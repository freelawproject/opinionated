Did the canine sniff around the exterior of Hart\u2019s vehicle constitute a search?</p>\n<p id=\"b177-13\">\u00b64 2. Was the search warrant issued for searching Hart\u2019s vehicle supported by probable cause?</p>\n<p id=\"b177-14\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b177-15\">\u00b65 On February 7, 2001, Deputy Shane Skillen (Skillen) and K-9 Officer, Sergeant Vince Wallis (Wallis) separately approached Hart\u2019s residence. The officers had an arrest warrant for Hart for felony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>criminal sale of dangerous drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">\u00b66 As they approached Hart\u2019s residence in an attempt to serve the arrest warrant on Hart, they observed Hart driving in the opposite direction. Skillen initiated a traffic stop and Wallis pulled his patrol car alongside of Hart\u2019s van.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">\u00b67 At this point, both officers observed Hart make furtive movements, namely Hart turned his body quickly, dropping his body toward the floorboard of the van. The officers and the District Court characterized this movement as a \u201cdive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">\u00b68 The officers feared that Hart was attempting to retrieve a weapon or to hide or throw something into the back of the van, so Skillen ordered that Hart place his hands on the vehicle. Hart did so and Skillen then removed Hart from the van, advised him of the arrest warrant, and placed him under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">\u00b69 The officers then asked Hart for his consent to search the van. Hart refused consent. Wallis then walked his drug-detecting canine, Trooper, around Hart\u2019s van. Trooper alerted, indicating the presence of the odor of dangerous drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">\u00b610 The officers requested a telephonic search warrant, which District Court Judge Diane Barz issued. The subsequent search of Hart\u2019s van resulted in confiscation of a digital scale box, a baggy of methamphetamine, and two \u201cbricks\u201d of marijuana weighing approximately two pounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">\u00b611 Hart moved to suppress the evidence seized from the van. After a hearing, Hart\u2019s motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-10\">\u00b612 Subsequently, Hart pled guilty to the charges contained in the information, reserving his right to appeal the denial of his motion to suppress. Hart was sentenced to a five-year suspended sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-11\">\u00b613 Hart now appeals the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-12\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b178-13\">\u00b614 We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. <em>State v. Logan, </em>2002 MT 206, \u00b6 12, 311 Mont. 239, \u00b6 12, 53 P.3d 1285, \u00b6 12. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law for correctness. <em>Logan, </em>\u00b6 12. Because the facts here are undisputed, our review is limited to whether the District Court\u2019s application and interpretation of the law was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-14\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b178-15\">\u00b615 1. Did. the canine sniff around the exterior of Hart\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>vehicle constitute a search?</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">\u00b616 Hart argues that the canine sniff around the exterior of his private vehicle, without his consent and before a search warrant was issued, constituted an unlawful search. In support of his argument, Hart contends that as this Court held in <em>State v. Elison, </em>2000 MT 288, 302 Mont. 228, 14 P.3d 456, it is reasonable for him to expect the contents of his vehicle to remain private, especially under Montana\u2019s constitutional right to privacy provision. Hart likens the canine sniff to the invasion this Court struck down in <em>State v. Siegal </em>(1977), 281 Mont. 250, 934 P.2d 176, <em>overruled on other grounds by State v. Kuneff, </em>1998 MT 287, \u00b6 19, 291 Mont. 474, \u00b6 19, 970 P.2d 556, \u00b6 19, regarding the use of thermal imaging. He argues that there exists no distinction between \u201cmolecules in the air surrounding an enclosure [such as his van] and collecting infrared radiation emitted from a building [the issue presented in <em>Siegal].\u201d </em>Hart also insists that the canine sniff of his van is not similar to the canine sniff of luggage, insofar as the contents of his van are not as knowingly exposed to the public as a person\u2019s luggage is.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">\u00b617 The State of Montana (the State) contends that Hart does not have the same degree of privacy in the contents of his van as he does in the contents of his home because the odors emanating from his van are knowingly exposed to the public, much as they were from the luggage in <em>State v. Scheetz </em>(1997), 286 Mont. 41, 950 P.2d 722. In addition, the State contends that Hart\u2019s reliance on <em>Siegal </em>is inapposite, as this Court in <em>Siegal </em>distinguished between the use of thermal imaging devices and the use of drag-detecting canines. Specifically, the State argues that because thermal imagers provide both legal and illegal information, whereas canine sniffs only provide information regarding the presence of illegal substances, the canine sniff of Hart\u2019s van was \u201cmuch less intrusive and more limited than a typical search.\u201d Further, the State contends that Hart cites no authority for his proposition that furtive movements do not provide sufficient particularized suspicion for additional investigation, including a canine sniff.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">\u00b618 We recently addressed an issue similar to the one presented here in <em>State v. Tackitt, </em>2003 MT 81, 315 Mont. 59, 67 P.3d 295. Specifically, in <em>Tackitt, </em>we were asked to decide whether \u201cthe use of a drug-detecting canine to sniff for drags in a vehicle parked in an area accessible to the public\u201d was a search. <em>Tackitt, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">\u00b619 The defendant\u2019s car in <em>Tackitt </em>was parked at his residence. Acting on an anonymous tip, an officer used a drug-detecting canine to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>conduct a sniff survey of the defendant\u2019s car while it was parked at his residence. The canine alerted, indicating the presence of the odor of dangerous drugs. The subsequent search of the defendant\u2019s vehicle did not reveal any evidence, although the search of his home did. This evidence was used in charging the defendant with criminal possession of dangerous drugs, a chai\u2019ge to which the defendant pled guilty after the district court denied his motion to suppress the evidence seized. <em>Tackitt, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 5-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">\u00b620  As we discussed in <em>Tackitt, </em>substantial case law exists on the legality of canine sniffs with regard to search and seizure law. <em>See Tackitt, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 26-28. However, upon review of these cases, we determined that \u201cthe better reasoned cases allow for a carefully drawn exception to the warrant requirement, but still require particularized suspicion when the area or object subject to the canine sniff is already exposed to the public.\u201d <em>Tackitt, </em>\u00b6 29. We held that \u201cgiven the greater protection afforded individual privacy under Montana\u2019s Constitution, the balance between governmental interests [in discouraging illegal drug trafficking] and individual [privacy] interests ... can best be struck by requiring particularized suspicion as a prerequisite for the use of a drug-detecting canine.\u201d <em>Tackitt, </em>\u00b6 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">\u00b621  Here, the officers initially approached Hart\u2019s residence in order to serve an arrest warrant on him for felony criminal sale of dangerous drugs. After seeing Hart driving in the opposite direction, Skillen initiated a traffic stop. At that point, both officers saw furtive movements from Hart, namely Hart moving his body quickly towards the floorboard of the van. The officers believed that Hart was either attempting to retrieve a weapon or to hide or throw something into the back of the van. Under the circumstances and given the fact that the officers were attempting to execute an arrest warrant for felony drug charges, it was reasonable for the officers to infer that Hart was in possession of illegal drugs contained in the van. We conclude that on these objective facts, the officers had particularized suspicion to perform the canine sniff around Hart\u2019s vehicle for the presence of illegal drugs. Therefore we hold that while the exterior canine sniff of Hart\u2019s vehicle did constitute a search, <em>Tackitt </em>f 22, the search was appropriately based on reasonable or particularized suspicion. <em>Tackitt, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 23-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">\u00b622 2. Was the search warrant issued for searching Hart\u2019s vehicle supported by probable cause?</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">\u00b623 Hart also argues that the search warrant obtained by the officers was not supported by probable cause. Specifically, he argues that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>odors emanating from his vehicle cannot alone establish probable cause under this Court\u2019s holding in <em>State v. Schoendaller </em>(1978), 176 Mont. 376, 578 P.2d 730 (smell of marijuana smoke emanating from vehicle was an insufficient basis to establish probable cause).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">\u00b624 The State contends that Hart\u2019s argument is raised for the first time now on appeal, and therefore this Court should decline to address it. In the alternative, the State contends that <em>Schoendaller </em>is distinguishable here because <em>Schoendaller </em>did not \u201caddress or discuss the significance of an alert by a trained drug-detecting dog in the context of a probable cause determination.\u201d We decline to address Hart\u2019s <em>Schoendaller </em>argument because it is raised for the first time on appeal. <em>State v. Weaselboy, </em>1999 MT 274, \u00b6 16, 296 Mont. 503, \u00b6 16, 989 P.2d 836, \u00b6 16. We still must determine, however, whether the issuance of the search warrant was supported by probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">\u00b625 Both the United States and Montana Constitutions protect individuals from unreasonable searches and seizures. Amend. IV, U.S. Const.; Art. II, Sec. 11, Mont. Const. For a search warrant to issuej the application must state facts sufficient to show probable cause. <em>State v. Olson, </em>2003 MT 61, \u00b6 24, 314 Mont. 402, \u00b6 24, 66 P.3d 297, \u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">\u00b626  Probable cause to search exists \u201cif the facts and circumstances within the officer\u2019s personal knowledge ... are sufficient to warrant a reasonable person to believe that the suspect has committed an offense.\u201d <em>State v. Saxton, </em>2003 MT 105, \u00b6 26, 315 Mont. 315, \u00b6 26, 68 P.3d 721, \u00b6 26. Probable cause is evaluated in light of an officer\u2019s knowledge and all relevant circumstances. <em>State v. Van Dort, </em>2003 MT 104, \u00b6 19, 315 Mont. 303, \u00b6 19, 68 P.3d 728, \u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">\u00b627  As discussed above, the officers had particularized suspicion to perform the canine search around Hart\u2019s vehicle. In so doing, Trooper alerted, indicating the presence of the odor of dangerous drugs. Wallis was a trained K-9 officer with experience in using drug-detecting canines. Given Wallis\u2019s experience, Trooper\u2019s alert, the fact that the officers were attempting to execute an arrest warrant charging Hart with felony criminal sale of dangerous drugs, and Hart\u2019s furtive movements at the time of the stop, we conclude that Wallis had facts that a reasonable person would find sufficient to believe Hart had committed an offense. Therefore, we hold that probable cause existed to support the issuance of the search warrant used in searching Hart\u2019s van.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">\u00b628 We affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of Hart\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence obtained from the officers\u2019 search of his van.</p>\n<judges id=\"b181-9\">JUSTICES COTTER, LEAPHART, WARNER and REGNIER <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b182-4\">JUSTICE RICE</author>\n<p id=\"AZq\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">\u00b629 I concur in the Court\u2019s holding, but on the basis set forth in my concurring opinion in <em>State v. Tackitt, </em>2003 MT 81, 315 Mont. 59, 67 P.3d 295. I do not believe there is an expectation of privacy which society finds as objectively reasonable in contraband odors which are allowed to emanate into public places. Neither do I believe there were other privacy interests at issue under the facts of this case which would have prohibited police employment of a canine sniff without a warrant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
