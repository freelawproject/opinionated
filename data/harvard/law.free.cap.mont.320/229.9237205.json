Did the District Court err in awarding Brenda attorney fees?</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">\u00b68 Robert and Brenda married in 1968. They had two daughters. During the majority of their marriage, Brenda worked in the home. By 1996, the parties lived in a house in Great Falls and retained ownership of another residence in Connecticut.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">\u00b69 In February 1996, Robert petitioned to dissolve the marriage. At the time of his petition, one of the daughters had already reached the age of majority. During the pending dissolution proceedings, the parties stipulated to temporary maintenance and child support to provide for Brenda and the minor daughter. This agreement provided that Robert pay $3,000 per month to Brenda for maintenance and child support through entry of a final decree. The stipulation was adopted as an order by the court effective as of the date of signing by the parties in May 1996. Brenda made the mortgage payments on both the Great Falls residence and the Connecticut residence out of this payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">\u00b610 While the dissolution proceedings were still pending, Robert ceased making the temporary payments. In March 1997, Brenda brought a motion to hold Robert in contempt for failure to make the temporary payments. In June, the court denied the motion for contempt but ordered Robert to make the payments. Robert then brought his payments current. However, in July he ceased making the payments again. Brenda did not make another motion to enforce the temporary payments. During this same time period, the parties agreed to put the Connecticut residence up for sale. Towards that goal, Robert gave Brenda $12,000 to pay for repairs needed to make the property marketable. However, in September he informed Brenda that he would consider that money as fulfilling his temporary maintenance obligation because she had not given him receipts for the repairs and he believed she did not make any repairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">\u00b611 In October 1997, the parties entered into a settlement agreement regarding maintenance, child support, and the division of their debts and assets. This agreement provided among other things that Robert would pay $825 monthly child support until their youngest daughter reached majority. It also provided Robert would pay maintenance to Brenda until she turned 62 or remarried, calculated as a percentage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>of his income minus any income Brenda earned. The settlement agreement also released each party from past and current claims and provided for attorney fees. The agreement was incorporated into the dissolution decree entered by the court later that month.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">\u00b612 After the decree was entered, Robert paid the first maintenance payment but then failed to make any additional maintenance payments. Robert continued to make child support payments until their youngest daughter graduated from high school in June 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"Amdj\">\u00b613 In 2001, Brenda filed a motion to force Robert to comply with his maintenance obligations. Brenda sought the temporary maintenance due from before the settlement agreement was signed, the regular monthly maintenance payments due under the settlement agreement, and attorney fees. Robert asserted that he was not obligated to pay the temporary maintenance because he was released from such claims by the settlement agreement and because he had already paid Brenda. He also asserted that he did not pay the regular maintenance payments because Brenda did not give him proof of her wages to subtract from his payment and because of expenses he incurred due to her actions. Finally, he disputed how the maintenance obligation was to be calculated under the wording of the settlement agreement. While Brenda believed the amount was to be 15% of before tax income, Robert argued the amount was to be 15% of after tax income. In support of her position, Brenda introduced expert testimony by a certified public accountant regarding the meaning of certain terms in the settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">\u00b614 After receiving testimony and evidence from the parties, the court found in Brenda\u2019s favor on all points and awarded her all the maintenance she sought. Although the court did not enter a judgment for the appropriate amounts, its order indicated Brenda was entitled to the temporary maintenance and the maintenance due through July 2002 and all attorney fees and costs. The court also held that due to his repeated resistance to fulfilling his maintenance responsibility, Robert\u2019s wages were to be subject to wage withholding starting in August 2002. Robert now appeals. Further details are discussed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">\u00b615 Robert asserts that the District Court erred in adopting Brenda\u2019s proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law verbatim. However, we have often noted such an action is not error in and of itself. <em>In re Marriage of Stufft </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 454, 457, 916 P.2d 767, 769. Rather, the party disputing the order on appeal must show that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>court\u2019s findings were not supported by substantial evidence or that the court made a conclusion of law that was incorrect. <em>Stufft, </em>276 Mont. at 457, 916 P.2d at 769. Therefore, Robert\u2019s argument must be considered in relation to his specific disputes with those findings and conclusions. Accordingly, we turn to the specific arguments Robert makes on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">\u00b616 Did the District Court err in holding Brenda was entitled to pre-dissolution, temporary maintenance and child support payments given the later settlement agreement between the parties?</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">\u00b617 Robert asserts the District Court erred in awarding Brenda $9,000 in temporary maintenance payments for July, August, and September 1997 because the parties released each other from such claims in the settlement agreement. He also argues he already paid her through the $12,000 check.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">\u00b618 Brenda asserts the plain language of the release did not apply to the temporary maintenance payments. She cites <em>In re Marriage of Halverson </em>(1988), 230 Mont. 226, 749 P.2d 518, in support of her argument that the settlement agreement must mention the stipulation previously entered regarding temporary maintenance in order for the temporary maintenance to be waived. She also argues that atrial court has discretion to award retroactive temporary maintenance payments under <em>In re Marriage of Spence </em>(1993), 257 Mont. 188, 849 P.2d 161. In addition, Brenda asserts she made $12,000 in repairs to the Connecticut house and that she cannot prove these repairs because she and Robert agreed to make cash payments to contractors without receipts \u201cunder the table.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">\u00b619 In its final order, the District Court held that the release language in the settlement agreement did not excuse Robert from liability for the temporary maintenance payments because the agreement did not mention the stipulation or that it required payments until a final decree was entered. The court simply held that the stipulation provided that Robert was to pay temporary maintenance, that the order entered pursuant to the stipulation had never been vacated, and that Robert had not paid the required maintenance.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">\u00b620  After reviewing the language of the release, we agree with Robert. Whether the settlement agreement released Robert from his obligation to make up unpaid temporary maintenance payments is a matter of interpretation of the language of the contract. <em>Heath v. Heath </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 522, 527, 901 P.2d 590, 593; \u00a7 40-4-201(5), MCA. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>Such agreements are interpreted the same as any other contract in that plain language controls. <em>Heath, </em>272 Mont. at 527,901 P.2d at 593. If the release language bars Brenda\u2019s claim to the unpaid temporary maintenance, we do not need to consider the disputed factual issue of whether Robert already paid the temporary maintenance by virtue of the $12,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">\u00b621  The settlement agreement between the parties states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-5\">MUTUAL RELEASE. Subject to the provisions of this agreement, each party has released and discharged, and by this agreement does for himself or herself, ... release and discharge the other of and from all causes of action, claims, rights, or demands whatsoever, in law or in equity, which either of the parties ever had or now has against the other, except any or all cause or causes of action for dissolution of marriage and except for periodic child support payments as provided for herein.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">This language clearly released Robert from any claims for prior, unpaid temporary payments. Contrary to the District Court\u2019s emphasis on the fact that the stipulation was not mentioned or vacated, the words \u201call causes of action, claims, rights, or demands <em>whatsoever </em>[emphasis added], in law or in equity, which either of the parties ever had or now has\u201d by definition includes Brenda\u2019s claims for temporary maintenance. Robert specifically gave Brenda notice of this dispute when he sent her a letter in September telling her he would consider his temporary obligations fulfilled by the $ 12,000 check he gave her for repairs. If Brenda still intended to claim unpaid temporary maintenance, she had an obligation to except it from the \u201call causes of action\u201d language of the settlement agreement. The District Court incorrectly interpreted the language of the release to require that it specifically mention the earlier stipulation. Consequently, the court erred in awarding $9,000 to Brenda on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">\u00b622 Contrary to Brenda\u2019s assertions, <em>Halverson </em>does not require a different result here. In that case, the temporary stipulation provided \u201csaid [temporary] payments [were] to continue,during the pendency of [the] <em>action.\u201dHalverson, </em>230 Mont, at 231, 749 P.2d at 521. The parties then entered a farm partnership agreement dividing their assets, but, unlike this case, the agreement did not include a release regarding disputed claims. The husband stopped making the stipulated maintenance payments after the partnership agreement was entered. The wife then disputed whether or not the maintenance payments were still due after the partnership agreement was entered but before the final decree was entered. The final decree was entered over a year</p>\n<p id=\"b258-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>after the partnership agreement was made. The District Court awarded the disputed temporary maintenance payments to the wife. \u00b623 This Court affirmed holding that the temporary maintenance payments were still owed because the husband disputed payments that were due before the final decree was entered, payments that were due while the action was still pending under the plain language of the stipulation. <em>Halverson, </em>230 Mont. at 231, 749 P.2d at 521. As mentioned, unlike this case, <em>Halverson </em>did not involve a settlement agreement releasing the respective parties from disputed claims. Therefore, in that case the stipulation controlled our interpretation. Here, Robert does not owe Brenda the temporary maintenance payments under the stipulation because she released him from this obligation by virtue of the later settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">\u00b624 <em>Spence </em>is also distinguishable. In that case we dealt with whether or not a court can modify temporary maintenance payments effective retroactively before the court enters a final decree and while the action is still pending. <em>Spence, </em>257 Mont, at 194, 849 P.2d at 165. We did not have to address a settlement agreement incorporated into the final decree that released the parties from prior claims, as in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">\u00b625 Finally, Brenda asserts Robert owes her the pro-rata portion of temporary maintenance due for October 1997 because he does not dispute this month. However, after the decree was entered Robert paid Brenda for the entire month of October pursuant to the final decree rather than pursuant to the stipulation. Therefore, Robert does not owe Brenda temporary maintenance for the months of July, August, September or October 1997. The District Court\u2019s decision awarding Brenda $9,000 in temporary maintenance is reversed and vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">ISSUE TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">\u00b626 Did the District Court err in holding Robert\u2019s maintenance obligation was based on his before tax income instead of his after tax income?</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">\u00b627 Robert asserts the District Court erred in concluding the language of the settlement agreement required his maintenance obligation to be based on before tax income rather than after tax income because he believes the plain language used in the agreement means after tax income. He also argues the District Court erred in admitting testimony of Brenda\u2019s accounting expert on the intent of the parties because the expert admitted he had no actual knowledge of what the parties intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">\u00b628 Brenda asserts the District Court properly interpreted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>settlement agreement language to mean before tax income and properly considered the testimony of her expert. Brenda also argues that using disposable income to figure maintenance is unconscionable under <em>In re Marriage of Rowen </em>(1982), 199 Mont. 315, 649 P.2d 1259. \u00b629 The District Court held that the settlement agreement language \u201cgross disposable income\u201d meant before tax income based on evidence of how Robert calculated his first and only regular maintenance payment and on the testimony of Brenda\u2019s expert. On this matter of contract interpretation, we agree with the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">\u00b630  An ambiguity exists when the contract wording is reasonably subject to two different interpretations. <em>Wray v. State Compensation Ins. Fund </em>(1994), 266 Mont. 219, 223, 879 P.2d 725, 727. Whether an ambiguity exists is a question of law. <em>SAS Partnership v. Schafer </em>(1982), 200 Mont. 478, 482, 653 P.2d 834, 836. When a contract term is ambiguous, its interpretation requires a determination of a question of fact: the real intention of the parties at the time of contracting. <em>SAS, </em>200 Mont. at 482, 653 P.2d at 836; <em>Klawitter v. Dettmann </em>(1994), 268 Mont. 275, 281, 886 P.2d 416, 420-21; <em>Gray v. City of Billings </em>(1984), 213 Mont. 6, 10, 689 P.2d 268, 270; <em>Pooling v. Casey </em>(1968), 152 Mont. 267, 275, 448 P.2d 749, 754. We do not disturb a trial court\u2019s finding of fact unless it is clearly erroneous. <em>Stufft, </em>276 Mont. at 459, 916 P.2d at 770. Therefore, we must first determine if the settlement agreement language here is ambiguous. If it is we address the District Court\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">\u00b631  The clause at issue here reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-6\">MAINTENANCE. Husband agrees to pay maintenance to Wife until she attains the age of 62, dies, or remarries, whichever occurs first. Husband shall pay maintenance on a monthly basis in an amount equal to 15% of Husband\u2019s <em>gross disposable income </em>from his primary employment. Gross income consists of base salary and any cash bonuses. Husband shall be entitled to an offset against his maintenance obligation any amounts earned by Wife in any year in the form of wages, salary or commissions. (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">We hold that, on its face, the term \u201cgross disposable income\u201d is ambiguous because gross income usually means before tax income, <em>see </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 61 (gross income is \u201call income from whatever source derived\u201d), and disposable income usually means income left after payment of taxes and other deductions, <em>see In re Marriage of Bross </em>(1993), 256 Mont. 174, 176, 845 P.2d 728, 729 (disposable income arrived at after payment of taxes and business expenses). Therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>the District Court properly considered evidence of the parties\u2019 intent in order define \u201cgross disposable income.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">\u00b632  We cannot hold that the District Court was clearly erroneous in finding the parties intended Brenda\u2019s maintenance to be based on Robert\u2019s before tax income because of the evidence of Robert\u2019s first payment that he himself calculated. Robert\u2019s income for the month of October 1997 was $7,000. Fifteen percent of $7,000 is $1,050, the amount he paid Brenda for that month. Robert\u2019s conduct is the best evidence of his intent, even though it is contrary to his testimony of intent at trial. Further, it is the only direct evidence of the parties\u2019 intent other than their individual self-serving testimony. Therefore, the court\u2019s determination that Robert\u2019s maintenance payment was calculated on gross before tax income rather than disposable after tax income is based on substantial evidence and is not clearly erroneous. \u00b633 Despite this evidence, Robert argues this interpretation makes the use of the word \u201cdisposable\u201d meaningless in the agreement and that we should give effect to every word to hold that \u201cgross disposable income\u201d is analogous to \u201ctake-home pay.\u201d However, because the clause is ambiguous in that \u201cgross\u201d and \u201cdisposable\u201d income as used in this context have mutually exclusive meanings, the District Court properly looked beyond the language of the agreement to the parties\u2019 conduct. Indeed, under \u00a7 28-3-306, MCA, it was proper for the District Court to interpret the ambiguity in Brenda\u2019s favor. Section 28-3-306, MCA, reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-5\">Interpretation of terms that are ambiguous or were intended in a different sense by different parties. (1) If the terms of a promise are in any respect ambiguous or uncertain, it must be interpreted in the sense in which the promisor believed, at the time of making it, that the promisee understood it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-6\">(2) When the terms of an agreement have been intended in a different sense by different parties to it, that sense is to prevail against either party in which he supposed the other understood it; and when different constructions of a provision are otherwise equally proper, that is to be taken which is most favorable to the party in whose favor the provision was made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">In this case, the parties\u2019 proposed interpretations of before tax and after tax income are \u201cequally proper.\u201d Thus, under \u00a7 28-3-306(2), MCA, the District Court\u2019s decision that a before tax interpretation was intended is in accord with the statute because the maintenance provision was made in Brenda\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">\u00b634 Finally, Robert asserts the District Court could not consider the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>accountant expert\u2019s testimony introduced on Brenda\u2019s behalf to determine intent of the parties. However, to the extent the court considered the expert testimony to understand the technical accounting meanings of \u201cgross\u201d and \u201cdisposable,\u201d the court acted within its discretion. Indeed, Robert himself introduced Barron\u2019s accounting dictionary definition of \u201cdisposable income\u201d in support of his argument of their intent. Brenda was entitled to do the same through an expert rather than a dictionary. Further, just as the evidence of Robert\u2019s conduct is evidence indicating intent through course of performance, <em>see </em>\u00a7 28-3-402, MCA; <em>cf. </em>\u00a7 30-2-208, MCA, evidence of the technical accounting definitions of gross and disposable was admissible to show the parties\u2019 intent as those words are to be interpreted as usually understood by professionals in the course of trade usage, <em>see </em>Rule 702, M.R.Evid.; \u00a7 28-3-502, MCA; <em>cf </em>\u00a7 30-1-205, MCA. Therefore, the District Court properly admitted the accountant\u2019s testimony as evidence of intent. The District Court\u2019s decision awarding Brenda maintenance based on 15% of Robert\u2019s before tax income from November 1997 until the present is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">\u00b635 Because Brenda prevails on this issue based on the evidence presented at trial, we need not address her argument that using disposable income is unconscionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">ISSUE THREE</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">\u00b636 Did the District Court err when it failed to credit Robert\u2019s maintenance obligation with expenses he incurred?</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">\u00b637 Robert asserts that he should be credited for the additional $11,000 he spent on repairing the Connecticut house in order to get it sold, money he expended after the final decree was entered and after he had given Brenda $12,000 to complete the work. Because the parties agreed in the settlement agreement to split the net proceeds on the sale of the Connecticut house, he argues he is entitled to credit for this expense. He also argues he is entitled to credit for additional interest he was charged on loans unrelated to their marriage because Brenda defaulted on the mortgage on the Great Falls house after the final decree was entered and thereby hurt his credit rating.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">\u00b638 Brenda asserts Robert is not entitled to credit for either of these expenses. She points out that she defaulted on the mortgage because Robert stopped paying maintenance and that she in fact spent the $12,000 Robert gave her on repairs to the Connecticut house.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">\u00b639 The District Court concluded that Robert was entitled to credit for the October maintenance payment he made and for attorney fees and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>costs for an earlier motion that Brenda lost. Neither party disputes these credits. However, the court also apparently determined Robert was not entitled to any additional credits because Brenda paid some of the mortgage payments on the Connecticut house until it was sold. \u00b640 After reviewing the record, we agree with the result reached by the District Court. Regarding Robert\u2019s expenditures on the Connecticut house, the settlement agreement clearly reads the parties were to split the \u201cnet proceeds.\u201d Therefore as a matter of contract interpretation, both parties are entitled to expenses incurred on the sale of the Connecticut house before the division of proceeds from the sale. The determination of relative expenditures by the parties to enable the sale was a finding of fact by the District Court which we do not disturb unless it is clearly erroneous. <em>Stufft, </em>276 Mont. at 459, 916 P.2d at 770. The court in effect determined that Brenda and Robert made approximately equal expenditures when it found that Brenda did spend some of the $12,000 on repairing the house and by Brenda\u2019s continued payments on both mortgages during the pending divorce proceedings. The District Court\u2019s finding was not clearly erroneous and Robert is not entitled to a credit for this amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">\u00b641 Regarding Robert\u2019s loss of good credit due to the default on the Great Falls house mortgage, again, the language of the settlement agreement is controlling. <em>Heath, </em>272 Mont, at 527, 901 P.2d at 593. On this issue the <em>agreement </em>reads: \u201c[this property] shall be solely owned by Wife, who shall be responsible for all indebtedness thereon. Wife shall take whatever steps are necessary to have Husband removed as an obligor on the home debt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">\u00b642 [6] However, even if Brenda breached this settlement agreement term, the proof of damages to his credit that Robert submitted at trial is insufficient to serve as basis for an award in his favor. This Court has held that a judgment for damages must be supported by substantial evidence that is not mere guess or speculation, although mathematical precision is not required. <em>Cremer v. Cremer Rodeo Land &amp; Livestock Co. </em>(1981), 192 Mont. 208, 214, 627 P.2d 1199, 1202. Proof of damages must consist of a reasonable basis for computation and the best evidence obtainable under the circumstances which will enable a judge to arrive at a reasonably close estimate of the loss. <em>Smith v. Zepp </em>(1996), 173 Mont. 358, 370, 567 P.2d 923, 930 (citation omitted). In this case, Robert simply testified that he suffered approximately $1,700 in damage to his credit when he took out two car loans. He did not submit documentation to prove the damages and he himself stated the amount was approximate. Therefore, there was insufficient documentation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>the loss to Robert\u2019s credit, documentation that would have been simple to produce. The District Court properly denied Robert\u2019s request for damages to his credit because Robert failed to provide the court with proper proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">ISSUE FOUR</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">\u00b643 Did the District Court err in subjecting Robert\u2019s salary to automatic wage withholding in order to satisfy his maintenance obligation?</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">\u00b644 Regarding the continued maintenance payments that would come due in the future, the District Court found that Robert \u201chas a history of ignoring his maintenance obligation until the Court orders him to pay it.\u201d Therefore, the court ordered that \u201c[a]ll present maintenance obligations should be paid via wage withholding order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">\u00b645 Robert asserts the District Court erred in subjecting his income to automatic wage withholding because, unlike child support, this mechanism is not allowed for maintenance until there is a judgment for a past due amount, execution, and garnishment. Robert further asserts that Brenda failed to produce credible evidence that she has had no income in the intervening years and that he is entitled to deduct her income from his maintenance payments under the language of the settlement agreement. He argues that what evidence she did produce is not credible because she was able to live on no maintenance from him and no income from wages while still increasing her savings. He also asserts the District Court erred in finding that she is disabled because she introduced no medical evidence to support her position. \u00b646 Brenda asserts that because the District Court could eventually order wage withholding as a garnishment if she were to execute a judgment against Robert, the court\u2019s action was not in err given Robert\u2019s undisputed history of failure to make payments. She also argues the court\u2019s findings of fact regarding her lack of income and inability to work were supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">\u00b647 Although the District Court did not cite the statute giving it authority to subject Robert\u2019s income to wage withholding, we hold that the court had such authority. Under \u00a7 40-4-207, MCA, a trial court may order a person paying maintenance to assign part of his or her periodic earnings. Section 40-4-207, MCA, reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-9\">Assignments. The court may order the person obligated to pay support or maintenance to make an assignment of a part of his periodic earnings or trust income to the person entitled to receive the payments. The assignment is binding on the employer, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>trustee, or other payor of the funds 2 weeks after service upon him of notice that it has been made. The payor shall withhold from the earnings or trust income payable to the person obligated to support the amount specified in the assignment and shall transmit the payments to the person specified in the order. The payor may deduct from each payment a sum not exceeding $1 as reimbursement for costs. An employer shall not discharge or otherwise discipline an employee as a result of a wage or salary assignment authorized by this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">The Commissioners\u2019 Note to this section states that the statute \u201cprovides an additional method of assuring that obligations for support and maintenance will be met when due.\u201d The Commissioners\u2019 Note also indicates that the statute\u2019s mechanism is analogous to garnishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">\u00b648 Section 40-4-207, MCA, addresses maintenance and permits a trial court to ensure its orders are followed. Further, Robert\u2019s repeated failure to pay maintenance in the past is proper grounds for an order requiring him to assign wages under \u00a7 40-4-207, MCA. Therefore, in aid of its order regarding Brenda\u2019s future maintenance payments, the District Court had the power to require Robert to assign part of his wages and in effect subject his income to automatic wage withholding. The District Court\u2019s order subjecting Robert\u2019s income to automatic wage withholding is affirmed in that Robert is required to assign 15% of his gross income, as defined above, when periodically earned to Brenda through notice to his employer. The District Court shall so order on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">\u00b649 In arguing his wages should not be subject to withholding, Robert also asserts he is entitled to an offset for Brenda\u2019s income under the terms of the settlement agreement. We agree he is entitled to an offset under the terms of the agreement for Brenda\u2019s \u201cwages, salary, or commissions.\u201d However, in order to address this argument, Robert\u2019s past maintenance and future maintenance obligations must be considered separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">\u00b650 Regarding the past obligations, Robert asserts that given the evidence submitted at trial, Brenda\u2019s proof of lack of past income is not credible because she was able to live on no income and no maintenance from him. Robert therefore argues he does not have to pay maintenance. We defer to the District Court\u2019s finding of fact unless the finding is clearly erroneous. Stufft, 276 Mont. at 459, 916 P.2d at 770. Further, the district court is in the best position to observe and judge witness credibility, therefore, \u201c[w]e will not second guess the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>court\u2019s determination regarding the strength and weight of conflicting testimony.\u201d <em>Double AA Corp. v. Newland &amp; Co. </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 486, 494, 905 P.2d 138, 142. The court found that Brenda had no past income. This finding is based on testimony from Brenda which serves as substantial evidence for the court\u2019s decision. Therefore, as to past maintenance due, the District Court has already determined that the offset to Robert\u2019s payments for Brenda\u2019s income is zero and we affirm. \u00b651 Regarding future maintenance, the District Court did not address how the offset was to be calculated in light of Robert\u2019s wage assignment. Instead, the court simply found that Brenda was unable to work. Robert asserts this finding is not credible because Brenda did not submit sufficient evidence of medical disability. We disagree. This finding is based on testimony from Brenda which serves as substantial evidence for the court\u2019s decision. Again, we do not reverse a trial court\u2019s finding of fact unless it is clearly erroneous. <em>Stufft, </em>276 Mont, at 459, 916 P.2d at 770.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">\u00b652 The language of the settlement agreement applies to Brenda\u2019s \u201cwages, salary, or commissions,\u201d in other words, income earned from working. This arrangement, for an offset against maintenance, was entered into by agreement of the parties. While it may be cumbersome, it is not unconscionable, it was ordered by the District Court pursuant to the original settlement agreement, and it will be enforced. Robert shall make the required payments by wage assignment as previously discussed. Then, annually, or if Robert chooses to petition the court to arrange some other interval, Brenda shall advise him of all wages, salaries, and commissions she earned and the appropriate offset can be made. If necessary, the enforcement procedures provided by law are applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">\u00b653 Finally, we note that the District Court did not enter a specific final judgment amount regarding past due maintenance. Rather, the court stated that it would issue a later judgment after Robert had furnished necessary income information. Thus we remand for entry of an appropriate judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">\u00b654  Although Brenda asserts that immediate wage withholding may take place for these past due amounts under the garnishment statute codified at \u00a7 25-13-614, MCA, rather than first executing on a judgment, her interpretation of the import of this statute is in error. While she is correct that this statute allows garnishment from wages for maintenance obligations, it does not excuse the need to execute on either a judgment or an order before garnishment is allowed. <em>White v. White </em>(1981), 195 Mont. 470, 636 P.2d 844 (judgment for past due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>maintenance the same as any other judgment). Therefore, Brenda needs to take the next step and execute before Robert\u2019s salary can be subject to garnishment for past due amounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">ISSUE FIVE</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">\u00b655 Did the District Court err in awarding Brenda attorney fees?</p>\n<p id=\"AZV\">\u00b656 The District Court simply awarded Brenda \u201call of her attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d There is no amount mentioned and there is no further discussion or proof of fees incurred. Robert asserts the District Court erred in awarding Brenda attorney fees because such an award must be based on a showing of necessity under \u00a7 40-4-110, MCA. Brenda asserts that the findings of the court regarding her income demonstrate necessity and that therefore, the court did not err in awarding her attorney fees. \u00b657 We review a district court\u2019s award of attorney fees to determine whether the court abused its discretion. <em>Mortgage Source, Inc. v. Strong, </em>2003 MT 205, \u00b6 8, 317 Mont. 37, \u00b6 8, 75 P.3d 304, \u00b6 8. Here, neither the parties nor the court address the fact that the settlement agreement incorporated into the final decree contains a provision regarding attorney fees. This clause reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-6\">FUTURE ATTORNEY\u2019S FEES. Should any action be commenced to enforce, modify, or interpret any provisions contained herein, the court, as a cost of suit, shall award a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee to the successful party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">This provision controls over \u00a7 40-4-110, MCA, because we enforce settlement agreements like any other contract. <em>Heath, </em>272 Mont. at 527, 901 P.2d at 593; \u00a7 40-4-201(5), MCA. Because Brenda prevailed in the District Court, she would normally be entitled to fees under this contract term.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">\u00b658  The general rule is that an award of attorney fees in a contract action requires introduction of proof from which a reasonable fee may be determined even though the contract terms provide for payment of afee. <em>Crncevich v. Georgetown Recreation Corp. </em>(1975), 168 Mont. 113, 119-20, 541 P.2d <em>56, 59. </em>In <em>order to </em>determine the reasonableness of the fees, a trial court reviews: (1) the amount and character of the services rendered; (2) the labor, time, and trouble involved; (3) the character and importance of the litigation in which the services were rendered; (4) the amount of money or the value of the property to be affected; (5) the professional skill and experience called for; (6) the attorneys\u2019 character and standing in their profession; and (7) the results secured by the services of the attorneys. <em>Swenson v. Janke </em>(1995), 274 Mont. 354, 361, 908 P.2d 678, 682-83. In sum, for attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>fees to be awarded by a trial court, there must be some type of proof of amount and reasonableness introduced into the record by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"Aui\">\u00b659 The record contains no proof of the amount of a reasonable fee. Therefore, the District Court abused its discretion when it failed to assess the reasonableness of Brenda\u2019s attorney fees before awarding \u201call\u201d her fees. As we held in <em>First Sec. Bank v. Tholkes </em>(1976), 169 Mont. 422, 429-30, 547 P.2d 1328, 1332-33, without evidence of any of the above factors introduced in the district court, the award of attorney fees was improper. We remand the issue to the trial court for a proper determination of fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">\u00b660 Because the District Court incorrectly interpreted the release language in the settlement agreement, we reverse that portion of the order awarding Brenda $9,000 in temporary maintenance. We affirm that part of the order directing Robert to base his maintenance payments on 15% of his before tax income because the court properly found the parties\u2019 intent. We affirm that part of the order denying Robert credit for repairs he paid for on the Connecticut residence because the court\u2019s findings on this issue were based on substantial evidence. We affirm the denial of credit to Robert for the increased cost of two loans he secured due to Brenda\u2019s failure to remove him from the mortgage on the Great Falls residence because he failed to introduce proper proof. We affirm the order subjecting Robert\u2019s income to wage withholding and remand to the court to require Robert to assign 15% of his before tax periodic earnings to Brenda. Finally, in this instance we remand that part of the order awarding Brenda attorney fees for a proper determination of fees. Both parties are to pay their own fees and costs on appeal. We remand for entry of judgment consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b267-6\">JUSTICES REGNIER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b267-7\">JUSTICE COTTER</author>\n<p id=\"AQq\">concurring and dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">\u00b661 I concur in the Court\u2019s disposition of Issues 2, 3, 4, and 5. I respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s disposition of Issue 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">\u00b662 In reversing the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Brenda was entitled to receive the sum of $9,000 in temporary support and maintenance, this Court appears to relegate a binding Order of the issuing court requiring Robert to pay Brenda $3,000 per month \u201cpending disposition of this proceeding, through the entry of a final decree ...\u201d to secondary status. The Court applies the law governing interpretation of a contract to conclude that the property settlement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>agreement entered between the parties had the effect of wiping out an obligation previously imposed upon Robert pursuant to court order. I find this conclusion wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">\u00b663 According to \u00a7 40-4-121(9)(b), MCA, a temporary order of maintenance or support \u201cterminates upon order of the court or when the petition is voluntarily dismissed and, in the case of a temporary ... support order, upon entry of the decree of dissolution ....\u201d The District Court entered an order of temporary maintenance and support, and specifically stated that the order would remain in effect until the entry of a final decree. Under the statute noted above, such an order continues in effect until further order of the court by decree or otherwise, unless the petition is first voluntarily dismissed, which did not occur here.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">\u00b664 It is important to note that the property settlement agreement incorporated into the court\u2019s Final Decree did not specify that, by virtue of the general release language, the delinquent support and maintenance obligations would be eliminated. When it approved the final property settlement agreement, the District Court found that the provisions of the document were \u201cfair and equitable.\u201d It is clear from the court\u2019s Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law at issue here that the court did not contemplate in finding the document \u201cfair and equitable\u201d that its Order of temporary support would be wiped out by the general release language contained in that document. When it became apparent that Robert gave an interpretation to the Decree that the court did not intend, the court interpreted the Decree so as to reinforce its earlier Order of support and maintenance. This the court is clearly permitted to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">\u00b665 In <em>In re Marriage of Cannon </em>(1985), 215 Mont. 272, 697 P.2d 901, we held that a district court has the authority to amend its judgment to reflect what was actually decided, and to grant the relief originally intended. The court cannot correct judicial errors in this fashion, or alter the substantive rights of the parties; it can exercise such authority only to express what the court actually decided. <em>Cannon, </em>215 Mont, at 274, 697 P.2d at 902. Although not framed in terms of an amended judgment, the court\u2019s Order on appeal clarifies the intent of the court in approving the settlement agreement of the parties: the court did not intend to release Robert from its earlier Order requiring him to pay support and maintenance until the entry of the Final Decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">\u00b666 I believe the Court has applied an erroneous standard of review to this issue. The question should not be one of interpretation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>contract, but rather of whether the District Court abused its discretion in interpreting its own Order and Decree as intended. I would conclude there was no abuse of discretion, and would affirm the District Court\u2019s decision that Brenda was entitled to receive the support and maintenance payments that were the subject of a pre-dissolution court Order. I therefore dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b269-4\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY,</author>\n<p id=\"AZm\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">\u00b667 I concur in the Court\u2019s opinion except as to issue 4, which is correctly stated as whether the District Court erred in subjecting Robert\u2019s salary to automatic wage withholding in order to satisfy his maintenance obligation. I dissent from the Court\u2019s opinion on that issue in its entirety, and would reverse the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">\u00b668 The Court\u2019s quote from the Disti\u2019ict Court\u2019s order on this issue is correct; the trial court ordered that Robert\u2019s \u201cpresent maintenance obligations should be paid via wage withholding order.\u201d Sadly, very little of the Court\u2019s subsequent discussion of the wage withholding issue bears any relationship to the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">\u00b669 In \u00b6 47, the Court properly notes that the trial court did not cite specific authority for its wage withholding decision. While correct, the Court\u2019s statement is irrelevant because no requirement exists that a trial court do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">\u00b670 The remainder of \u00b6 47 and subsequent paragraphs-upon which the Court bases its decision that the District Court did not err in this regard-are laced with error. Rather than address the issue as presented to us by both parties to this appeal, the Court at \u00b6 47 \u201cdiscovers\u201d \u00a7 40-4-207, MCA, and holds-on that basis-that the District Court did not err. The problem with this approach is that the Court has done extra work on Brenda\u2019s behalf by locating this statute and premising its decision thereon. Neither party raises this statute for the Court\u2019s consideration; nor did Brenda raise it in the trial court. Indeed, the District Court did not require Robert to assign his income under \u00a7 40-4-207, MCA. The trial court required wage withholding and, under any rational reading of the statute related thereto, the trial court clearly erred in doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-10\">\u00b671 The Court never addresses the arguments and authorities Robert presents. Instead, it <em>sua sponte </em>introduces \u00a7 40-4-207, MCA, into this appeal, apparently because it does not like the result which would be necessary if it relied on the parties\u2019 arguments. In taking this approach, I submit that the Court has become an advocate for Brenda, and has violated Robert\u2019s due process rights. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>\u00b672 The Court makes additional objectionable statements in \u00b6 48. It states that Robert\u2019s repeated failure to pay maintenance \u201cis proper grounds for an order requiring him to assign wages under \u00a7 40-4-207, MCA.\u201d This may be true, but the District Court clearly did not require the \u201cassignment\u201d of Robert\u2019s wages pursuant to the statute; it clearly did subject Robert\u2019s income to \u201cwage withholding.\u201d The two are not the same, and the effect of the Court\u2019s decision here is to retry the case, reformulate the District Court\u2019s decision-notwithstanding its correct statement of the issue as relating to \u201cwage withholding\u201d-and decide on its own that \u00a7 40-4-207, MCA, applies in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">\u00b673 The Court also states that the trial court \u201chad the power\u201d to require a wage assignment by Robert. True again; but the trial court did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">\u00b674 I dissent from the Court\u2019s decision, which permits Brenda to prevail without ever addressing the actual basis of Robert\u2019s appeal on this issue. If this is to be this Court\u2019s practice on a \u201cwhen we feel like it,\u201d \u201chit or miss,\u201d \u201cbecause we can\u201d basis, it does an enormous disservice to particular parties in certain-but only a few-cases. If this is to be the Court\u2019s general practice in deciding cases on appeal, we will be taking cases from parties and trial courts generally and doing our own research-whether or not the theory is presented on appeal-to reach results which are more to the Court\u2019s liking. I will not be part of it.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
