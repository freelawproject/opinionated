Dale, JoAnn M. Dale and Little Bear Mining and Exploration, Inc. (the Dales) filed a Complaint in Montana\u2019s Fifth Judicial District Court, Madison County, against Defendant Three Rivers Telephone Cooperative, Inc. (Three Rivers) alleging negligence as a result of a fire which destroyed the Dales\u2019 property near Twin Bridges, Montana. The jury found no negligence on the part of Three Rivers. The Dales appeal. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-10\">\u00b62 The Dales raise four issues on appeal which we restate as follows: \u00b63 1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it denied the Dales\u2019 motion for a new trial based on their contention that the District Court erred when it refused their Proposed Jury Instructions 8 and 13? \u00b64 2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it denied the Dales\u2019 motion for a new trial based on their contention that the District Court erred when it refused their Proposed Jury Instruction 7?</p>\n<p id=\"b424-11\">\u00b65 3. Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it denied the Dales\u2019 motion for a new trial based on their contention that Three Rivers unfairly took advantage of an order <em>in </em>limine?</p>\n<p id=\"b424-12\">\u00b66 4. Did the District Court err when it refused to grant a new trial because as a matter of law there was insufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict?</p>\n<p id=\"b424-13\">\u00b67 Because of our disposition of the first and third issues, we do not reach the fourth issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b425-3\">\u00b68 On September 1, 1998, Three Rivers was plowing underground telephone lines on a public right-of-way near Twin Bridges, Montana. The metal tracks of their trenching equipment created a spark which ignited dry grass near the roadway, resulting in a fire which destroyed almost 90 acres of the Dales\u2019 property. That day fire danger in the area was rated as \u201cvery high.\u201d The temperature was in the 90s and winds of up to 20-30 miles per hour were blowing. Three Rivers\u2019 crew working at the site was unable to suppress the fire with their fire extinguishers and other equipment on hand. The fire had to be suppressed by local, state and federal authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">\u00b69 The Dales brought an action against Three Rivers for negligence as a result of the fire. The jury found that the Defendant was not negligent. The Dales appeal, alleging the District Court erred by refusing certain jury instructions, allowing Three Rivers to take advantage of an order <em>in limine, </em>and refusing to grant a new trial when the evidence was insufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">\u00b6 10 \u201cIt is within the district courts\u2019 discretion to decide how to instruct the jury, taking into account theories of contending parties, and this Court will not overturn the district courts except for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Hall v. Big Sky Lumber, Inc. </em>(1993), 261 Mont. 328, 332, 863 P.2d 389, 392.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">\u00b611 \u201cThe standard of review of a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for a new trial is manifest abuse of discretion. The decision to grant or deny a new trial is within the sound discretion of the trial judge and will not be disturbed absent a showing of manifest abuse of that discretion.\u201d <em>Satterfield v. Medlin, </em>2002 MT 260, \u00b6 14, 312 Mont. 234, \u00b6 14, 59 P.3d 33, \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AcCH\">ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">\u00b612 Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it denied the Dales\u2019 motion for a new trial based on their contention that the District Court erred when it refused their Proposed Jury Instructions 8 and 13? \u00b6 13 The Dales contend the District Court erred when it refused to give Plaintiffs\u2019 Proposed Jury Instructions numbered 8 and 13. The Dales\u2019 Proposed Instructions would have informed the jury of a higher degree of care required when engaging in hazardous or potentially hazardous activity and explained that Three Rivers was engaged in a dangerous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>activity the day of the fire. Proposed Instruction No. 8 stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-4\">A person, firm, or corporation which engages in hazardous activities, or activities which potentially could become hazardous, has a heightened obligation to be extraordinarily careful and prudent, and take appropriate precautionary measures, to prevent the hazard from occurring, or suppressing it once it occurs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Proposed Instruction No. 13 stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-6\">Because of the great danger involved in the use of construction equipment operating in remote, dry and timbered areas of land during the fire season, a person of ordinary prudence will exercise extreme caution when engaged in such an activity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">\u00b614 The Dales rely on our holding in <em>Schuff v. Jackson, </em>2002 MT 215, 311 Mont. 312, 55 P.3d 387, to support their argument. In <em>Schuff, </em>the plaintiff's were injured when their friend failed to successfully navigate his ski boat through a narrow channel located between a hidden sandbar and underwater rock outcroppings in the Missouri River. <em>Schuff, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 6-9. The driver of the boat knew of the rock formation and understood that it was dangerous to boaters. <em>Schuff, </em>\u00b6 6. The District Court in <em>Schuff </em>instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-8\">Every person is responsible for injury to the person of another, caused by his negligence. Negligence is the failure to use reasonable- care. Negligence may consist of action or inaction. A person is negligent if he fails to act as an ordinarily prudent person would act under the circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-9\"><em>Schuff, </em>\u00b6 36. Schuffs proposed instruction regarding the standard of care stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-10\">The care required of the defendant is always reasonable care. This standard never varies but the care which it is reasonable to require of the defendant varies with the danger involved in his act, and is proportionate to it. The greater the danger, the greater the care which must be exercised.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-11\"><em>Schuff, </em>\u00b6 35. This Proposed Instruction was patterned after \u00a7 298 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, cmt. b (1965), which was adopted by this Court in <em>Estate of Strever v. Cline </em>(1996), 278 Mont. 165, 174, 924 P.2d 666, 671. <em>Schuff, </em>\u00b6 35. Schuff argued on appeal, and we agreed, that the District Court should have granted a new trial based on its failure to give the above proposed instruction. We held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-12\">While the given instruction expresses the general duty of care required of individuals in negligence actions, it fails to inform the jury of a possible greater duty of care in situations where danger <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>is greater, as was the case here. Jackson\u2019s knowledge of the rock formation\u2019s existence and its potential danger increased the duty of care imposed on him, and the jury should have been informed of that as a matter of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-4\"><em>Schuff, </em>\u00b6 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">\u00b6 15 In the present case, there is sufficient evidence to show that Three Rivers was aware of the danger involved in their activity. However, Three Rivers argues that the Proposed Instruction in <em>Schuff </em>is distinguishable from the Dales\u2019 Proposed Instructions. The <em>Schuff </em>instruction stated that the reasonable care exercised should be proportionate to the danger involved; the Dales\u2019 Proposed Instructions stated that a \u201cheightened obligation to be extraordinarily careful and prudent\u201d exists when engaged in certain activities and that \u201cextreme caution\u201d should be exercised. Three Rivers contends the Dales\u2019 Proposed Instructions 8 and 13 are misstatements of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">\u00b616  We agree that the Dales\u2019 Proposed Instructions 8 and 13 ai\u2019e not accurate statements of the law; however, neither is the instruction given by the District Court. We note that <em>Schuff </em>was not decided until several months after the present case was tried, so neither the parties nor the District Court had the opportunity to rely on <em>Schuff. </em>On remand, we instruct the District Court to instruct the jury in accordance with <em>Schuff </em>and our holding herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">ISSUE TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">\u00b617 Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it denied the Dales\u2019 motion for a new trial based on their contention that the District Court erred when it refused their Proposed Jury Instruction 7?</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">\u00b618 At trial, Three Rivers\u2019 defense was based, at least in part, on the fact that no governmental restrictions were in place which would have prohibited or restricted its construction activity the day the fire ignited, and therefore no additional precautions were warranted. On appeal the Dales argue Three Rivers was allowed to unfairly lead the jury to believe that Three Rivers had no obligation to take precautions against fire because there were no governmental restrictions against their activity. The Dales assign error to the District Court for rejecting their Proposed Instruction numbered 7, which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-10\">A person, firm, or corporation which engages in hazardous activities, or activities which potentially could become hazardous, may not delegate away its legal obligation to use reasonable care in the mode and matter of its operations, nor may it avoid liability arising from a dangerous activity over which it has sole and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>exclusive control, by its reliance upon a third party to warn it of the hazardous conditions which its activities pose to the public.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AgI\">The Dales argue this instruction would have properly informed the jury that Three Rivers still had an obligation to use reasonable care, regardless of whether the government imposed restrictions due to the fire danger.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">\u00b619 The Dales cited to several sources for Proposed Instruction 7: <em>McMillan v. United States </em>(9th Cir. 1997), 112 F.3d 1040; <em>McCall v. United States v. Dept, of Energy </em>(9th Cir. 1990), 914 F.2d <em>191; Kemp v. Big Horn County Elec. Co-op </em>(1990), 244 Mont. 437, 798 P,2d 999. The cases cited, however, do not support the Dales\u2019 contention that Proposed Instruction 7 should have been given. In none of the cases did the parties try to rid themselves of obligations or negligence by stating that it was a third party\u2019s duty to warn of the hazards involved. As such, we agree with the District Court that Proposed Instruction 7 was not warranted and hold that the District Court did not err when it refused to grant a new trial on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">ISSUE THREE</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">\u00b620 Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it denied the Dales\u2019 motion for a new trial based on their contention that Three Rivers unfairly took advantage of an order <em>in </em>limine?</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">\u00b621 Prior to trial, the District Court granted Three Rivers\u2019 motion <em>in limine </em>precluding the Dales from referring to the fact that Three Rivers received a demand for payment by any federal or state agency or other third person for the costs and expenses of fire suppression and property damage. Three Rivers did indeed receive such a demand letter from the Department of Natural Resources (DNRC) and local fire suppression agencies, which Three Rivers paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">\u00b622 The Dales contend that Three Rivers unfairly took advantage of this order <em>in limine </em>when counsel for Three Rivers asked Three Rivers\u2019 safety officer, Shannon Ostlie, whether Three Rivers received any citations from local, state or federal agencies as a result of the fire. Following that, on redirect examination the Dales\u2019 attorney asked Ostlie whether Three Rivers was required to pay the government for the costs of the fire suppression. Counsel for Three Rivers objected and after discussing the matter in chambers, the District Court did permit the Dales\u2019 counsel to ask whether Three Rivers was billed by DNRC for the costs of fire suppression.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">\u00b623 The Dales argue on appeal that this created an unfair situation that was misleading to the jury and that they should have also been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>allowed to ask whether Three Rivers had paid the fire suppression bill. We agree. We addressed a similar situation in <em>Griffith v. Montana Power Company </em>(1990), 243 Mont. 246, 794 P.2d 692. In <em>Griffith, </em>an order <em>in limine </em>precluded the plaintiffs from showing evidence of Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) violations. The plaintiffs honored the order <em>in limine, </em>but the defendant, Montana Power Company (MPC), asked a witness whether there were any OSHA violations and subsequently referred to the lack of OSHA violations a number of times. The District Court granted a new trial because MPC had unfairly taken advantage of the order <em>in limine. </em>We affirmed the District Court\u2019s decision, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-3\">We agree that the District Court properly granted a new trial and conclude there was no abuse of discretion. The effect of the court\u2019s rulings, including instructions, was to deny the plaintiffs an opportunity to present any evidence of OSHA violations by MPC or by Williams for which MPC could be held vicariously liable. On the other hand, the effect was to allow MPC to present its theory of compliance with OSHA... regulations, to their obvious benefit. We hold that the District Court did not err in granting plaintiffs a new trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-4\"><em>Griffith, </em>243 Mont. at 251, 794 P.2d at 696.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">\u00b624  Here, Three Rivers opened the door by asking Ostlie whether Three Rivers received any citations from local, state or federal agencies as a result of the fire. Three Rivers unfairly took advantage of the order <em>in limine. </em>Under the circumstances, the District Court should have allowed the Dales to pursue a line of questioning that would have revealed that Three Rivers paid the fire suppression costs in response to the demand letter from DNRC. The District Court erred when it denied the Dales\u2019 motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">\u00b625 Affirmed in part, reversed in part and remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b429-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, LEAPHART, NELSON and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b429-8\">JUSTICE WARNER</author>\n<p id=\"A3v\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">\u00b626 I dissent. I would affirm the District Court, as I dissent on Issues One and Three and would reach and affirm Issue Four.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-10\">\u00b627 Regarding Issue One, the question before the Court is whether the District Court erred in refusing the Dales\u2019 proposed instructions on duty of care. As the Opinion itself points out in \u00b6 16, the Dales\u2019 instructions are simply not accurate statements of the law. Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 298, cmt. b (1965), reads as set out by the <em>Schuff </em>proposed instruction quoted in the Opinion at \u00b6 14, i.e., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>\u201cThe greater the danger, the greater the care which must be exercised\u201d and is applicable to situations where heightened care should be exercised. <em>Schuff, </em>\u00b6 35. By use of words and phrases such as \u201cextraordinarily,\u201d \u201cextreme caution,\u201d and \u201cprevent,\u201d the Dales\u2019 proposed instructions 8 and 13 use language which goes far, far beyond the Restatement \u00a7 298 language adopted by this Court. <em>See also Estate of Strever, </em>278 Mont, at 174, 924 P.2d at 671.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">\u00b628 As the District Court stated during the argument settling the instructions, \u201cthat\u2019s the problem the Court has [with the Dales\u2019 proposed instructions], the use of... \u2018extreme.\u2019 \u201d Therefore, the District Court\u2019s refusal of the Dales\u2019 instructions is not error. Indeed, if the court had accepted the instructions proposed by the Dales, the words \u201cextreme\u201d and \u201cextraordinarily\u201d would be close to a directed verdict for the Dales. Such a result is not required by \u201cthe greater the danger, the greater the care which must be exercised\u201d language of \u00a7 298.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">\u00b629 Given that the court did not err in denying the Dales\u2019 proposed instructions, the question then becomes whether or not the court\u2019s subsequent actions were error. Under Rule 51, M.R.Civ.P., \u201cNo party may assign as error the failure to instruct on any point of law unless that party offers an instruction thereon.\u201d <em>Starkenburg v. State </em>(1997), 282 Mont. 1, 25, 934 P.2d 1018, 1032. In <em>Schuff, </em>proper \u00a7 298 language was offered by the plaintiff. Therefore, the decision in <em>Schuff </em>contrasted the heightened duty of care instruction with the standard instruction in light of the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">\u00b630 In this case, although \u00a7 298 could be applicable to the facts here, a correct instruction was simply not offered. As a result, the court gave the jury standard duty of care language as offered by both parties. The instructions given read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-7\">Instruction No. 16 (Defendant\u2019s Proposed Instruction No. 13) Every person is responsible for the negligent injury to the person or property of another.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-8\">Negligence is the failure to use reasonable care. Negligence may consist of action or inaction. A person is negligent if that person fails to act as an ordinarily careful person would act under the circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-9\">Instruction No. 18 (Plaintiffs Proposed Instruction No. 12)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-10\">The amount of caution required of a person in the exercise of ordinary care depends upon the conditions apparent to him or that should be apparent to a reasonably prudent person under circumstances similar to those shown by the evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-11\">I would hold that because the basic standard of care instructions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>represent a theory applicable to the case, the District Court did not err in instructing the jury as it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-3\">\u00b631 Further, although a trial court can offer instructions on its own motion under Rule 51, M.R.Civ.P., the court\u2019s only duty is to give instructions that, in their entirety, state the law applicable to the case. <em>Fillinger v. Northwestern Agency, Inc. </em>(1997), 283 Mont. 71, 76, 938 P.2d 1347, 1350-51. Here, the standard negligence instruction still permitted the Dales to argue the circumstances required a heightened standard of care. <em>Hanson v. Edwards, </em>2000 MT 221, \u00b6 31, 301 Mont. 185, \u00b6 31, 7 P.3d 419, \u00b6 31. Therefore, the instructions that were given were adequate, the District Court did not err in instructing the jury, and a reversal is not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">\u00b632 Regarding Issue Three, again, I would hold the District Court did not abuse its discretion. The evidentiary order of the court, granted upon Three Rivers\u2019 motion in limine, was intended to prevent the inference that Three Rivers admitted liability when its insurer paid claims from fire suppression agencies. I agree that Three Rivers violated that order when it elicited testimony that it received no citations as a result of the fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">\u00b633 However, when Three Rivers\u2019 violation of the order was raised by the parties, the District Court had to decide how best to remedy the damage. The court chose a middle ground suggested in part by the Dales. It allowed the Dales to question the Three Rivers\u2019 representative to prove Three Rivers was billed for fire suppression costs. At the same time, the court refused to allow in a letter from DNRC that, by its language, may have constituted an admission of liability by Three Rivers. Further, the Dales specifically asked to introduce evidence that Three Rivers was billed, but stated they did not want to introduce evidence of payment of the bills. Therefore, the court did not admit evidence that Three Rivers paid DNRC. This ruling also prevented inadmissible evidence of payment by a liability insurer. The court stated that it believed evidence of billing by government agencies would balance the impression left by Three Rivers that no violations had occurred, but that evidence of payment would go too far.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">\u00b634 Upon the Dales\u2019 motion for a new trial, it was up to the District Court to decide whether Three Rivers\u2019 violation was grounds for a new trial. And, in light of its earlier ruling, the court in effect decided there were insufficient grounds for a new trial. Its earlier ruling counterbalanced the advantage Three Rivers had taken, by allowing the Dales to elicit relevant testimony. At the same time, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>prevented the Dales from introducing evidence that could effectively amount to an admission of liability. By considering and balancing the evidence presented to the jury from both parties in reference to the original order regarding the motion in limine, the court avoided the situation that occurred in <em>Griffith. </em>In that case, we upheld the district court\u2019s grant of a new trial because one party was allowed to introduce one-sided evidence of compliance, while the other party was barred from countering that evidence in any way. Because the court addressed the violation in this case by properly ruling on the examination requested by the Dales, I would hold it did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">\u00b635 As to Issue Four, I would hold the District Court properly determined there was sufficient evidence as a matter of law to support the jury\u2019s verdict and, therefore, the court properly denied the Dales\u2019 motion for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
