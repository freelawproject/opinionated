We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">\u00b62 The issue on appeal, as framed by the State, is: Whether Ellenburg\u2019s petition for postconviction relief was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-10\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b338-11\">\u00b63 On October 14,1997, Ellenburg, a licensed insurance agent, was charged by Information with three counts of felony theft, two counts of misdemeanor elder abuse and one count of felony forgery, all stemming from Ellenburg\u2019s misuse of an elderly client\u2019s funds. The facts surrounding the charges are set forth in <em>State v. Ellenburg, 2000 </em>MT 232, 301 Mont. 289, 8 P.3d 801.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-12\">\u00b64 At his arraignment on October 31, 1997, Ellenburg pleaded not guilty to the charges. On November 17,1998, Ellenburg filed a motion to dismiss the charges under <em>Brady v. Maryland </em>(1963), 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215, based on a search of his residence in June 1997, resulting in the seizure of his business records, and for an alleged violation of his right to a speedy trial. After an evidentiary hearing on January 28, 1999, the District Court denied Ellenburg\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-13\">\u00b65 Thereafter, Ellenburg moved to withdraw his not-guilty pleas and, pursuant to a plea agreement, Ellenburg pleaded guilty to two counts of felony theft and one count of felony forgery, reserving the right to appeal the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss. In addition, Ellenburg waived the preparation of a pre-sentence investigative report and agreed to pay restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-14\">\u00b66 The District Court sentenced Ellenburg to ten years at Montana State Prison on each of the felony theft charges and twenty years on the charge of felony forgery. The District Court ordered that the sentences run consecutively, but the court suspended the sentences for felony theft and five years of the sentence for felony forgery with conditions. The court also ordered that Ellenburg pay restitution in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>amount of $136,635.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">\u00b67 Ellenburg appealed the denial of his motion to dismiss the charges, but we affirmed the judgment of the District Court in August 2000. <em>Ellenburg, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 44, 57.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">\u00b68 On July 25, 2001, Ellenburg filed a petition for postconviction relief in the District Court along with a supporting brief. The court denied the petition on March 4, 2002, concluding that the only claim raised by Ellenburg that was not precluded by a procedural bar or his guilty plea was Ellenburg\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel for counsel\u2019s failure to introduce Ellenburg\u2019s medical and psychological records to mitigate his sentence. As to that claim, the court concluded that Ellenburg received exactly the sentence he bargained for, therefore, Ellenburg was not prejudiced by counsel\u2019s failure to introduce his records.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">\u00b69 Ellenburg now appeals the District Court\u2019s denial of his petition for postconviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">\u00b610 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a petition for postconviction relief to determine whether its findings are clearly erroneous and whether it correctly interpreted the law. <em>Dawson v. State, </em>2000 MT 219, \u00b6 18, 301 Mont. 135, \u00b6 18, 10 P.3d 49, \u00b6 18, <em>cert. denied, </em>532 U.S. 928, 121 S.Ct. 1372, 149 L.Ed.2d 299 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b339-10\">\u00b611 Relying on Rule 12(b)(6), M.R.Civ.P., and various cases interpreting that Rule, Ellenburg asserts on appeal that the standard for dismissing a postconviction petition without a hearing is identical to the standard for dismissing a civil complaint based on the pleadings alone. Thus, he asserts that in considering his motion to dismiss, we must construe his petition in the light most favorable to him and that all allegations of fact contained in the petition must be taken as true. However, in its brief on appeal, the State points out that Ellenburg\u2019s assertions are incorrect because Rule 12(b)(6) is inconsistent with the specific pleading and proof provisions of the postconviction petition statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-11\">\u00b612 The Rules of Civil Procedure apply to postconviction relief petitions only if they are consistent with the specific provisions of the postconviction statutes. Section 46-21-201(l)(c), MCA. Unlike civil complaints, the postconviction statutes are demanding in their pleading requirements. Section 46-21-104, MCA, sets forth what a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>postconviction petition must contain:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-4\">(1) The petition for postconviction relief must:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-5\">(a) identify the proceeding in which the petitioner was convicted, give the date of the rendition of the final judgment complained of, and <em>clearly set forth the alleged violation or violations',</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-6\">(c) <em>identify all facts supporting the grounds for relief set forth in the petition and have attached affidavits, records, or other evidence establishing the existence of those facts. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">And, \u00a7 46-21-104(2), MCA, provides that a petition must be accompanied by a supporting memorandum, including appropriate arguments and citations and discussion of authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">Additionally, a postconviction petitioner has the burden of proving by a preponderance of</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">the evidence that he or she is entitled to relief. <em>State v. Peck </em>(1993), 263 Mont. 1, 3-4, 865 P.2d 304, 305. Thus, contrary to Ellenburg\u2019s assertions, because the testing of the sufficiency of postconviction claims is directed by the more specific provisions of the postconviction statutes, the traditional civil law standards for testing the sufficiency of claims is unavailable to postconviction petitioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-10\">\u00b613 <em>Whether Ellenburg\u2019s petition for postconviction relief was properly denied.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b340-11\">\u00b6 14 Ellenburg raises several issues on appeal, some of which he raised in his petition for postconviction relief in the District Court and some of which he did not. This Court has stated on numerous occasions that it will not review issues that were not preserved for appeal in the district court. <em>State v. Schmalz, 1998 </em>MT 210, \u00b6\u00b6 11-13,290 Mont. 420, \u00b6\u00b6 11-13, 964 P.2d 763, \u00b6\u00b6 11-13; <em>State v. Spotted Blanket, </em>1998 MT 59, \u00b6 13, 288 Mont. 126, \u00b6 13, 955 P.2d 1347, \u00b6 13. As the State notes in its brief on appeal, the rule is the same in the civil context. Rule 2(a), M.R.App.P., provides that, in a civil case, the Court may review on appeal any decision of a district court that has been objected to within the meaning of Rule 46, M.R.Civ.P. (a party must make known to the trial court, at the time the ruling is made or sought, the party\u2019s objection to the action and the grounds therefor).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-12\">\u00b615 Ellenburg claims that counsel failed to advise him about his right to appeal and failed to take the necessary steps to perfect the appeal. Because Ellenburg did not raise this issue in the District Court, he is barred from raising it on appeal. <em>Schmalz, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 11-13; <em>Spotted Blanket,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b341-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>\u00b6 13. Nevertheless, Ellenburg was not prejudiced by counsel\u2019s alleged failure in this regard because Ellenburg did, in fact, appeal his conviction. <em>See State v. Ellenburg, </em>2000 MT 232, 301 Mont. 289, 8 P.3d 801.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">\u00b616 Ellenburg also claims that the State misrepresented evidence and introduced false and misleading evidence at sentencing. Once again, because Ellenburg failed to raise this issue in the District Court, he is barred from raising it on appeal. <em>Schmalz, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 11-13; <em>Spotted Blanket,</em></p>\n<p id=\"Aki\">\u00b6 13. Even so, a petition for postconviction relief must be based on more than mere conclusory allegations. It must \"identify all facts supporting the grounds for relief set forth in the petition and have attached affidavits, records, or other evidence establishing the existence of those facts.\u201d <em>State v. Wright, </em>2001 MT 282, \u00b6 9, 307 Mont. 349, \u00b6 9, 42 P.3d 753, \u00b6 9 (quoting \u00a7 46-21-104(1)(c), MCA). Here, Ellenburg fails to state what evidence was misrepresented or what the alleged false and misleading evidence was. Hence, even if Ellenburg had raised this issue in the District Court, he has waived his right to have this Court consider the issue because he failed to provide any evidentiary support for his allegations. <em>Wright, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">\u00b617 Ellenburg further claims that the State breached the plea agreement, however, Ellenburg fails to indicate in what manner the plea agreement was breached. Once again, Ellenburg did not raise this issue in the District Court, but even if he had, he waived his right to have this Court consider the issue because he failed to provide any evidentiary support for his allegations. <em>Wright, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">\u00b618 In addition, Ellenburg claims that trial counsel provided ineffective assistance because counsel failed to investigate and failed to present mitigating evidence. This claim is different than the ineffective assistance of counsel claim Ellenburg presented in the District Court. There, Ellenburg contended that counsel failed to introduce Ellenburg\u2019s medical and psychological records in mitigation. Here, Ellenburg contends that trial counsel failed \u201cto adequately investigate and present mitigation evidence on his behalf\u2019 implying that some other mitigating evidence would have come to light had counsel adequately investigated. This Court has repeatedly held that a party may not change its theory on appeal from the one advanced in the district court. <em>State v. Kober, </em>1999 MT 264, \u00b6 11, 296 Mont. 425, \u00b6 11, 989 P.2d 399, \u00b6 11. Thus, we decline to review this argument further.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">\u00b619 Even though several of the issues that Ellenburg now raises on appeal were raised in his postconviction petition in the District Court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>those issues are also procedurally barred because Ellenburg either raised them on direct appeal or reasonably could have raised them on direct appeal.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-4\">(2) When a petitioner has been afforded the opportunity for a direct appeal of the petitioner\u2019s conviction, grounds for relief that were or could reasonably have been raised on direct appeal may not be raised, considered, or decided in a proceeding brought under this chapter....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-5\">(3) For purposes of this section, \u201cgrounds for relief\u2019 includes all legal and factual issues that were or could have been raised in support of the petitioner\u2019s claim for relief.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">Section 46-21-105(2) and (3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">\u00b620 One such issue is Ellenburg\u2019s claim that his federal and state constitutional rights were violated when \u201cthousands\u201d of his records and files were seized without his consent or an inventory. When Ellenburg pleaded guilty, he reserved the right to appeal the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss the charges against him on the grounds that the search of his business records was illegal and that allegedly exculpatory evidence was seized. On direct appeal, Ellenburg limited his claim to certain seized documents, thus we addressed the loss of only those documents. <em>Ellenburg, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 53-57. Consequently, Ellenburg\u2019s claim that his rights were violated as to those documents is procedurally barred under \u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA, because that claim was raised on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">\u00b621 Additionally, Ellenburg\u2019s claims as to any records or files other than those mentioned above, are procedurally barred because those claims were not preserved for appeal under \u00a7 46-12-204(3), MCA. A guilty plea that is voluntary and intelligent constitutes a waiver of nonjurisdictional defects and defenses. <em>State v. Niederklopfer, </em>2000 MT 187, \u00b6 13, 300 Mont. 397, \u00b6 13, 6 P.3d 448, \u00b6 13 (citations omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aik\">When a criminal defendant has solemnly admitted in open court that he is in fact guilty of the offense with which he is charged, he may not thereafter raise independent claims relating to the deprivation of constitutional rights that occurred prior to the entry of the guilty plea. He may only attack the voluntary and intelligent character of the guilty plea.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-9\"><em>Niederklopfer, </em>\u00b6 13 (quoting <em>Tollett v. Henderson </em>(1973), 411 U.S. 258, 267, 93 S.Ct. 1602, 1608, 36 L.Ed.2d 235).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-10\">\u00b622 Ellenburg also claims that his right to a speedy trial was violated because 616 days elapsed from the date of his arrest on June 13,1997, to the date of his conviction on March 2, 1999. On direct appeal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>Ellenburg argued that his right to a speedy trial was violated because 493 days elapsed between the date the Information was filed and the date of his trial. Because, this Court has already addressed Ellenburg\u2019s speedy trial claim, <em>Ellenburg, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 13-44, this claim is procedurally barred under \u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">\u00b623 Similarly, all of Ellenburg\u2019s other claims regarding violations of his rights under the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Article II, sections 12,17,24 and 25 of the Montana Constitution, are procedurally barred under either \u00a7 46-12-204(3), MCA, because they were not preserved for appeal, or \u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA, because they were not raised on appeal when they reasonably could have been.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">\u00b624 In addition, Ellenburg claims that he was unlawfully sentenced to pay restitution in the amount of $136,635 because his financial resources and future ability to pay restitution were not addressed or documented in a pre-sentence investigative report or at sentencing in violation of \u00a7 46-18-242(l)(a), MCA. Ellenburg is procedurally barred under \u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA, from raising this claim in a postconviction proceeding because he reasonably could have raised it on direct appeal, but failed to do so. Moreover, Ellenburg cannot show that he was prejudiced by the order to pay restitution because in his plea agreement, Ellenburg agreed to waive the pre-sentence investigative report and to pay the full amount of restitution. After receiving the benefit of the plea bargain, Ellenburg cannot now claim error. <em>State v. Harris, </em>1999 MT 115, \u00b6 32, 294 Mont. 397, \u00b6 32, 983 P.2d 881, \u00b6 32 (\u201cWe will not put a district court in error for an action in which the appealing party acquiesced or actively participated.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">\u00b625 Ellenburg also claims ineffective assistance of counsel for counsel\u2019s failure to object when the District Court attributed 98 days of delay to Ellenburg thereby depriving Ellenburg of the opportunity to demonstrate a violation of his right to a speedy trial. The District Court held a trial-scheduling conference on November 12, 1998. At that time, defense counsel informed the court that there would be several defense pretrial motions. Defense counsel proposed a briefing schedule and an evidentiary hearing. Based on that information, the District Court set the date of trial as February 19,1999, and attributed the 98 days of delay to Ellenburg.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">\u00b626 Before reaching the merits of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim in a postconviction relief proceeding, we must determine whether such a claim is properly before this Court or whether the claim is procedurally barred. Such a claim could be barred by \u00a7 46-21-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>105(2), MCA, if it reasonably could have been raised on direct appeal. <em>Wright, </em>\u00b6 12. In deciding whether an ineffective assistance of counsel claim could have been raised on direct appeal, we must determine whether the allegation is based on facts of record. \u201cIn distinguishing on-record and off-record actions of counsel, the definitive question is \u2018why\u2019 counsel acted or failed to act.\u201d <em>State v. Fields, </em>2002 MT 84, \u00b6 32, 309 Mont. 300, \u00b6 32, 46 P.3d 612, \u00b6 32. In the instant case, why Ellenburg\u2019s counsel acted or failed to act is fully explained in the record. Counsel requested the 98-day delay so that he could prepare pretrial motions and so that he could prepare for an evidentiary hearing on Ellenburg\u2019s behalf. Because this claim is based on facts of record, it could reasonably have been raised on direct appeal, but, because it was not, it is procedurally barred in this postconviction proceeding. <em>See Hagen v. State, </em>1999 MT 8, \u00b6 18, 293 Mont. 60, \u00b6 18, 973 P.2d 233, \u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">\u00b627  Ellenburg further claims ineffective assistance of counsel for counsel\u2019s failure to introduce Ellenburg\u2019s medical and psychological records. However, this claim too must fail because Ellenburg cannot demonstrate that counsel\u2019s assistance was ineffective or that he was prejudiced by the alleged ineffective assistance. A petition for postconviction relief must identify all facts supporting the grounds for relief set forth in the petition and all affidavits, records, or other evidence establishing the existence of those facts must be attached to the petition. Section 46-21-104(l)(c), MCA; <em>Wright, </em>\u00b6 9. Ellenburg failed to produce his medical and psychological records or even specify what is contained in those records that might have mitigated his sentence. Moreover, Ellenburg was sentenced to exactly the same sentence he bargained for. By agreeing to the sentence he received, Ellenburg has waived any right to contest that sentence in a postconviction proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">\u00b628 Accordingly, we hold that the District Court did not err in denying Ellenburg\u2019s petition for postconviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">\u00b629 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b344-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES RICE, COTTER and REGNIER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
