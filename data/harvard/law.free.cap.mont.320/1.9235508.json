We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-9\">\u00b62 Deschon raises the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b24-10\">\u00b63 1. Was the evidentiary hearing held for the purpose of reconstructing the unrecorded voir dire portions of Deschon\u2019s trial sufficient to preserve his right to due process?</p>\n<p id=\"b24-12\">\u00b64 2. Did Deschon\u2019s trial counsel provide ineffective assistance of counsel during voir dire?</p>\n<p id=\"b24-13\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b24-14\">\u00b65 On November 19, 1999, the State of Montana charged Deschon with deliberate homicide, a felony, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-102, MCA, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>the stabbing death of his nephew; and assault with bodily fluid, a misdemeanor, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-214, MCA, for spitting on the arresting officers. Deschon pled guilty to the assault charge, and on January 20, 2000, following a three-day trial, the jury returned a verdict finding Deschon guilty of deliberate homicide. On March 16, 2000, the District Court sentenced Deschon to the Montana State Prison for fifty years with ten years suspended for the offense of deliberate homicide, an additional five years for the use of a weapon, and one year for the offense of assault with bodily fluids.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-4\">\u00b66 On April 6, 2000, Deschon appealed his conviction of deliberate homicide arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that his right to due process was violated because no transcript of the voir dire portion of the trial existed, thus depriving him of the right to a meaningful appeal. The voir dire was not recorded because of the then common, and now discarded, practice of waiving the recording of voir dire when the parties agreed it was likely there would be no issues during the jury selection process. On January 30, 2002, this Court remanded for an evidentiary hearing for the purpose of reconstructing the unrecorded voir dire portions of Deschon\u2019s trial. <em>See State v. </em>Deschon,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 2002 MT 16, \u00b6 32, 308 Mont. 175, \u00b6 32, 40 P.3d 391, \u00b6 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">\u00b67 On April 9, 2002, the District Court conducted the evidentiary hearing and received testimony from two trial jurors, the four attorneys involved in the voir dire process, and Deschon. Additionally, a number of exhibits were entered, including trial notes taken by the attorneys and Deschon during voir dire. The District Court ordered that a transcript of the hearing be prepared and that the file be returned to the Montana Supreme Court. Deschon appeals from the judgment, conviction and sentence, and from the evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"A8\">Issue 1</p>\n<p id=\"b25-7\">\u00b68 Was the evidentiary hearing held for the purpose of reconstructing the unrecorded voir dire portions of Deschon\u2019s trial sufficient to preserve his right to due process?</p>\n<p id=\"b25-8\">\u00b69 In his first appellate brief, Deschon challenged his conviction for deliberate homicide in part on the denial of a meaningful appellate review caused by the lack of any record of the voir dire proceedings. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number><em>Deschon I, </em>\u00b6 23. According to Deschon, this violated his right to due process under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 17 of the Montana Constitution. Deschon contended that adverse media publicity existed prior to his trial, and, since the record was silent as to whether any jurors were prejudiced by the publicity, his fundamental right to an impartial jury was therefore implicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-4\">\u00b6 10 In <em>Deschon I, </em>this Court applied the two-part test for determining whether Deschon\u2019s right to due process had been violated established by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Britt v. North Carolina </em>(1971), 404 U.S. 226, 92 S.Ct. 431, 30 L.Ed.2d 400, and subsequently followed by the Ninth Circuit in <em>Madera v. Risley </em>(9th Cir. 1989), 885 F.2d 646, 648; <em>Deschon I, </em>\u00b6 26. The two criteria for this determination are: (1) the value of the transcript to the defendant in connection with the appeal or trial for which it is sought, and (2) the availability of alternative devices that would fulfill the same functions as a transcript.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">\u00b6 11 This Court concluded that Deschon had identified a tenable theory as to possible error, specifically, that the jurors were not impartial as a result of adverse pretrial publicity, thus satisfying the first part of the <em>Britt </em>test. <em>Deschon I, </em>\u00b6 28. This Court further concluded that an evidentiary hearing would serve as an alternative to a verbatim transcript, thus satisfying the second part of the <em>Britt </em>test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-6\">We conclude that an evidentiary hearing similar to the one relied on in <em>Madera </em>is necessary in this case. Witnesses, such as the prosecutor, defense attorney, court reporter and clerk of court, may testify as to their memory of the voir dire proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AT\"><em>Deschon I, </em>\u00b6 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-7\">\u00b612 After the evidentiary hearing was conducted on remand to reconstruct the voir dire record, Deschon continued his appeal from the judgment, and now asserts in his second appellate brief that the hearing was insufficient to provide the needed information to determine whether any of the jurors were biased. In addition to his prior contention that a verbatim transcript was needed to determine whether jurors were biased because of pretrial publicity, Deschon now raises several additional theories of potential juror bias, namely, bias as a result of Deschon\u2019s failure to testify, prior knowledge of Deschon, and Deschon\u2019s race. Deschon argues that without a verbatim transcript, none of these potential biases can be verified, and, therefore, this Court should reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-8\">\u00b613  Though we have admonished trial courts to order the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>recording of voir dire examinations, it is well established that the lack of a verbatim transcript is not a constitutional defect when a suitable alternative is provided. <em>See Mayer v. City of Chicago </em>(1971), 404 U.S. 189, 194, 92 S.Ct. 410, 414-15, 30 L.Ed.2d 372 (a \u201crecord of sufficient completeness\u201d does not translate automatically into a complete verbatim transcript; the state may find other means of affording adequate and effective appellate review); <em>see also Harris v. Estelle </em>(5th Cir. 1978), 583 F.2d 775, 777. \u201cA reconstructed record, as opposed to a verbatim transcript, can afford effective appellate review, particularly where appellate rules have established a procedure for reconstruction of the trial record.\u201d <em>U.S. v. Cashwell </em>(11th Cir. 1992), 950 F.2d 699, 703; <em>see also Morgan v. Massey </em>(5th Cir. 1976), 526 F.2d 347, 348. Rule 10(e), F.R.App.P., has provided such a procedure in a number of instances where reconstruction of the trial record was necessary. <em>See e.g. </em>Cashwell, 950 F.2d at 704; <em>U. S. v. Preciado-Cordobas </em>(11th Cir. 1993), 981 F.2d 1206, 1210; <em>U.S. v. Novaton </em>(11th Cir. 2001), 271 F.3d 968, 993.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\">\u00b614 In <em>Cashwell, </em>the defendant argued that his conviction must be vacated due to the unavailability of a transcript of the voir dire and the inability of the court to adequately reconstruct those proceedings. He asserted that, as a result of this void, he was denied a meaningful appeal and thus deprived of his right to due process. However, the appellate court held that \u201cthe district court\u2019s failure to require the recording of the voir dire proceedings will mandate a reversal only if the absence of this proceeding is a substantial and significant omission from the record which cannot be adequately reconstructed.\u201d <em>Cashwell, </em>950 F.2d at 704. After a reconstruction hearing was held pursuant to Rule 10(e), F.R.App.P., the appellate court determined that, taken together, \u201cthe testimony, recollections, and relevant jury selection records ... presented] a fair and accurate picture of what transpired during that phase of the trial.\u201d <em>Cashwell, </em>950 F.2d at 704. The court concluded that the reconstructed record was adequate for the defendant to challenge the venire on appeal. <em>Cashwell, </em>950 F.2d at 704.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">\u00b615 Similarly, in U.S. <em>v. Preciado-Cordobas I </em>(11th Cir. 1991), 923 F.2d 159, the defendants moved for a new trial on grounds they could not effectively appeal their convictions due to the unavailability of a transcript of counsels\u2019 closing arguments. The appellate court remanded the case pursuant to Rule 10(e), F.R.App.P., directing the district court to attempt to reconstruct the closing arguments. The appellate court advised the district court judge that in attempting to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>reconstruct the record, he may use \u201chis notes, the [court] reporter\u2019s notes, and, of course, the testimony of witnesses, including the appellants\u2019] trial attorney[s].\u201d <em>Preciado-Cordobas I, </em>923 F.2d at 160-61. Subsequently, upon review of the trial court\u2019s reconstruction of the closing arguments, the appellate court concluded that the reconstruction was sufficient, noting that \u201c[w]hile there may have been flaws in the trial, it strains the imagination to conceive reversible error from all that we know of the trial from the actual transcript of the evidence and the reconstructed arguments before the jury.\u201d <em>Preciado-Cordobas, </em>981 F.2d at 1214.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">\u00b616 Rule 9(f), M.R.App.P., modeled after Rule 10(e), F.R.App.P., provides the same procedure under Montana law for reconstruction of the trial record:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-5\">(f) Correction or modification of the record. If any difference arises as to whether the record truly discloses what occurred in the district court, the difference shall be submitted to and settled by that court and the record made to conform to the truth. If anything material to either party is omitted from the record by error or accident or is misstated therein, the parties by stipulation, or the district court, either before or after the record is transmitted to the supreme court, on proper suggestion or of its own initiative, may direct that the omission or misstatement be corrected, and if necessary that a supplemental record be certified and transmitted. All other questions as to the form and content of the record shall be presented to the supreme court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">Thus, omissions from the verbatim transcript do not mandate a reversal if a suitable alternative method of reporting trial proceedings is provided, or the record can be adequately reconstructed to accord effective appellate review. Whether a reconstructed record is of sufficient completeness to accord effective appellate review is a question which may be determined by this Court. Rule 9(f), M.R.App.P. Thus, we now analyze the sufficiency of the reconstruction hearing to review Deschon\u2019s issues on appeal. Testimony at the hearing was received from Brian Gustafson (Gustafson) and Henry Elbrecht (Elbrecht), two jurors who served on Deschon\u2019s jury panel; Mike McGrath (McGrath), and Mike Menahan (Menahan), county attorney and deputy county attorney with the Lewis and Clark County Attorney\u2019s Office; Randi Hood (Hood) and Jeremy Gersovitz (Gersovitz), Deschon\u2019s public defenders; and Deschon.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">\u00b617 First, regarding pretrial publicity, Deschon contends that a number of the jurors who served on the panel had seen or heard media <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>accounts of the case, but that Hood did not conduct individual voir dire in chambers to explore the extent of the jurors\u2019 prior knowledge. As Deschon correctly asserts, trial notes which Gersovitz took during voir dire indicate that ten prospective jurors had read newspaper accounts or heard news reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\">\u00b618 At the hearing, Hood opined that, although there had been some publicity surrounding the homicide, it was neither \u201cexcessive\u201d nor \u201cinflammatory,\u201d and it certainly did not warrant a change in venue. McGrath testified that the prospective jury panel responded that they did not remember anything specific about the case from the publicity, and that \u201cno juror had significant prior information.\u201d Further hearing testimony reveals that not only did McGrath and Hood both question the panelists as to whether they had any recollection about the case from pretrial publicity, and to what extent, but both attorneys additionally offered a \u201ccatchall\u201d question at the end of their voir dire questioning asking the panel if they were biased or prejudiced in any way. No one responded affirmatively.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">\u00b619 Hood also explained that she had filed a motion to conduct individual voir dire if necessary because Deschon was charged with homicide, and his charge had received some media attention. Although Deschon asserts that Hood\u2019s failure to question any juror in chambers raises the possibility of bias which can only be addressed by a verbatim transcript, hearing testimony reveals the attorneys had an understanding that if any of the jurors indicated that they had knowledge about the case, then individual voir dire would be conducted with that juror. McGrath, Menahan, and Hood all testified that no limits had been imposed as to when Hood could ask for in-chamber voir dire. However, both Hood and McGrath testified that their recollection of the voir dire responses was that individual voir dire was not necessary for any of the jurors. Hood testified that no one made a statement that raised enough concern for her to believe that \u201cthey might pollute the jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">\u00b620  Although the reconstruction proceeding did not create a verbatim account of the voir dire proceedings, we conclude that the hearing testimony established a fair and accurate picture of what transpired which was sufficiently complete to accord review of Deschon\u2019s issues on appeal. As this Court stated in <em>Great Falls Tribune v. District Court </em>(1980), 186 Mont. 433, 608 P.2d 116:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-7\">[i]n the modern world it is impossible to create an artificial, antiseptic environment from which prospective jurors may be drawn who have heard nothing of a serious crime committed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>their midst. People read newspapers. They listen to radio and television newscasts. It is only where they form fixed opinions on the guilt or innocence of the defendant which they would not be able to lay aside and render a verdict based solely on the evidence presented in court that they become disqualified as jurors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b30-4\"><em>Great Falls Tribune, </em>186 Mont. at 439, 608 P.2d at 120. The reconstruction of the voir dire in Deschon\u2019s trial was sufficiently complete to allow a determination of whether pretrial publicity had created a bias among jurors which would interfere with their ability to act solely on the evidence. Nonetheless, Deschon has failed to demonstrate that any juror bias existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">\u00b621 As noted above, Deschon has also raised additional claims of potential juror bias in his second appellate brief. The State urges us to decline further consideration of these issues, noting that Deschon\u2019s initial demand for a transcript was premised solely on his claim of pretrial publicity, and that his new claims are beyond the scope of our remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">\u00b622 It cannot be denied that Deschon\u2019s appeal efforts were, at a minimum, inconvenienced by the lack of a voir dire transcript, a problem we have sought to remedy by ordering a reconstruction hearing. Further, Deschon\u2019s appellate counsel did not participate in the trial, and thus, did not have independent recollection about voir dire upon which to draw when initially framing Deschon\u2019s issues for appeal. There is no apparent authority, and the State cites none, regarding issues which may be permissibly raised within this unique situation. We note that Deschon\u2019s new claims are tangentially related to his initial claim: all address the existence of potential juror bias. Therefore, we deem it appropriate to address Deschon\u2019s other jury bias claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">\u00b623 Deschon asserts that several negative responses from prospective jurors on the issue of his right to remain silent necessitate reversal for lack of a verbatim transcript. According to Deschon, Hood had a duty not only to \u201ceducate\u201d the jury on a defendant\u2019s right to remain silent, but also to identify and eliminate those jurors who would impose upon Deschon a requirement to tell his side of the story.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-8\">\u00b624 In particular, Deschon contends Juror Gustafson should have been eliminated from the panel because of his bias against Deschon\u2019s failure to testify. During the reconstruction hearing, Mr. Gustafson testified that during voir dire, when he was initially asked whether he would perceive the defendant to be guilty if he did not take the stand in defense of himself, he had spontaneously responded \u201cyes.\u201d Hood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>testified, however, that after spending some time with the entire jury educating them about the reasons why a defendant may choose not to testify, she recalled the following exchange with Mr. Gustafson:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-4\">\u201cSo do you think that there might be some good reasons why a defendant wouldn\u2019t testify?\u201d ... And he said yes ... and I said, \u201cEven if you were innocent?\u201d And he said, \u201cYes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">Menahan testified that Hood had followed up on this line of questioning, going one juror to the next, and that she ultimately received the assurances of all the jurors who initially had expressed difficulty with a defendant\u2019s silence, specifically, that they would abide by an instruction that they not hold a failure to testify against the defendant. As to Gustafson in particular, Hood testified that \u201c[w]hen I was done with him on that issue, I thought that he was still somebody who could be a good juror.\u201d During the hearing, Deschon\u2019s appellate counsel proposed a hypothetical to Hood that if Mr. Gustafson, instead of acknowledging that there were legitimate reasons for a defendant not to testify, had responded, \u201cI would convict,\u201d would she have let it pass. Hood replied, \u201cabsolutely not.\u201d Gersovitz testified he had no recollection that Mr. Gustafson had said that he would convict if Deschon did not take the witness stand. The notes taken by Deschon during voir dire listed the names of several jurors he did not want to serve on the jury, but Gustafson\u2019s name was not among them.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">\u00b625 Deschon also challenges the impartiality of Juror Elbrecht because he had heard of Joe Deschon\u2019s name prior to trial, and argues that the reconstruction hearing did not clarify what follow-up, if any, Hood conducted with him. Elbrecht testified that although he had heard Deschon\u2019s name, he did not know Deschon or his reputation. \u00b626 Elbrecht testified that his brother-in-law was Curt McAlpin, the animal control officer. Deschon testified that he went to school with McAlpin and had a school yard physical altercation with him that resulted in Deschon kicking McAlpin in the groin and hitting him several times on the head. Although Deschon argues that \u201cno competent attorney would keep a juror whose brother had a violent altercation with the attorney\u2019s own client,\u201d a review of the record reveals that it was Deschon, not Elbrecht, who was aware of the altercation and revealed it, not during the trial, but during the reconstruction hearing. Moreover, Deschon did not testify that he told his trial counsel about the altercation with McAlpin. When questioned on this point, Deschon stated he did not know if Elbrecht would have known about a school yard fight he had with Elbrecht\u2019s brother-in-law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>many years before. Hearing testimony revealed that when the attorneys questioned Elbrecht during voir dire, Elbrecht expressed a belief that he could be a fair and impartial juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">\u00b627 Deschon also argues that the reconstruction hearing confirms that the memories of the attorneys involved in the voir dire process were \u201cincomplete, conflicting, and flat out wrong.\u201d In support of this assertion he recounts numerous responses by the attorneys to questions regarding who actually challenged certain jurors on the panel for cause. While it is true that McGrath, Menahan, Hood, and Gersovitz either did not agree, or could not specifically recollect, who challenged certain jurors for cause, the record reveals that all of the attorneys recollected that Jurors Zelenka, Price, Montanye, and O\u2019Toole were challenged for cause, and the specific reason for each challenge. Both McGrath and Hood also recalled that there were no objections to any of these challenges for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">\u00b628 Finally, Deschon notes that although he was a Native American defendant facing charges in a predominantly white community, Hood did not ask any questions regarding the jurors\u2019 attitudes about Native Americans, which requires reversal of his conviction by this Court because of the absence of a verbatim transcript. However, Hood testified that she intentionally did not question prospective jurors about racial prejudices because Deschon did not look Native American. As the State correctly notes, a verbatim transcript would only reflect what Hood had already established: the Native American issue was one she had strategically avoided during voir dire.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">\u00b629  Consequently, on the additional juror bias issues raised by Deschon, we conclude that, while the reconstruction proceeding did not result in a verbatim account of the voir dire proceedings, the testimony nonetheless presents a \u201cfair and accurate picture of what transpired during that phase of the trial.\u201d <em>Cashwell, </em>950 F.2d at 704. As in <em>Cashwell </em>and Preciado-Cordobas, we determine that, taken as a whole, the combined testimony from the jurors, attorneys, and Deschon, together with the trial notes in exhibit, create a record of sufficient completeness to assure that Deschon\u2019s right to due process was not violated. Deschon was presented with the full opportunity to develop and prove his claims of bias as a result of pretrial publicity, the right to remain silent, prior knowledge of Deschon, and Deschon\u2019s race, but he wholly failed to do so. The attorneys presented consistent testimony on all of the critical contentions raised in Deschon\u2019s first and second appellate briefs. We conclude, therefore, that in this instance, the reconstruction hearing comprised an adequate alternative to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>verbatim voir dire transcript, thus satisfying the second part of the <em>Britt </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">Issue 2</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">\u00b630 Did Deschon\u2019s trial counsel provide ineffective assistance of counsel during voir dire?</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">\u00b631 In considering ineffective assistance of counsel claims on direct appeal, we apply the two-pronged test set forth by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674; <em>State v. St. John, </em>2001 MT 1, \u00b6 37, 304 Mont. 47, \u00b6 37, 15 P.3d 970, \u00b6 37 (overruled on other grounds). Under the first prong, the defendant bears the burden of showing that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient or fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. <em>St. John, </em>\u00b6 37. In so doing, the defendant must overcome a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s defense strategies and trial tactics fall within a wide range of reasonable and sound professional decisions. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 688-89, 104 S.Ct. at 2064-65, 80 L.Ed.2d at 693; <em>State v Harris, </em>2001 MT 231, \u00b6 18, 306 Mont. 525, \u00b6 18, 36 P.3d 372, \u00b6 18. The second prong requires the defendant to establish prejudice by demonstrating that there was a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. <em>Harris, </em>\u00b6 19. A defendant claiming ineffective assistance of counsel must ground his or her proof on facts within the record and not on conclusory allegations. <em>St. John, </em>\u00b6 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">\u00b632 This Court may review an ineffective assistance of counsel claim on direct appeal \u201cwhen the record ... fully explain[s] why counsel took, or failed to take, action in providing a defense for the accused....\u201c <em>State v. Turnsplenty, </em>2003 MT 159, \u00b6 17, 316 Mont. 275, \u00b6 17, 70 P.3d 1234, \u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b33-10\">\u00b633 Deschon argues that during the voir dire portion of his trial, Hood wasted two of the six peremptory challenges on jurors who should have been challenged for cause, and therefore, his right to a fair trial was infringed. According to Deschon, one peremptory challenge was wasted on Juror Ann Kokoruda, and another was wasted on Juror Daniel Skuletich.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-11\">\u00b634 Deschon contends that Hood should have challenged Juror <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>Kokoruda for cause pursuant to \u00a7 46-16-115(2)(e), MCA, because Kokoruda indicated that she had previously served on a jury that convicted a man for homicide-the same charge that Deschon was facing. Section 46-16-115(2)(e), MCA, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-4\">46-16-115. Challenges for cause. (2) A challenge for cause may be taken for all or any of the following reasons ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-5\">(e) having served on a trial jury that tried another person for the offense charged or a related offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">Deschon argues that since Kokoruda previously served on a jury that considered a deliberate homicide charge, albeit completely unrelated to Deschon\u2019s charge, and because Deschon was also charged with deliberate homicide, Hood had a duty to challenge Kokoruda for cause under \u00a7 46-16-115(2)(e), MCA. He asserts that no tactical reason exists, other than inexcusable oversight, for Hood\u2019s failure to ask follow-up questions when Kokoruda made statements revealing this statutory bias, and failing to challenge her for cause, thus constituting ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">\u00b635 However, Deschon\u2019s interpretation of the statute is incorrect. In <em>State v. Russell </em>(1925), 73 Mont. 240, 235 P. 712, the defendant, relying on the statutory predecessor to \u00a7 46-16-115(2)(e),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> argued that the court erred in denying his challenges for cause under the same circumstances as in the instant case: prospective jurors had served as jurors in a case where <em>another </em>defendant had been convicted of a <em>like </em>offense, there, the offense of rape. This Court affirmed the lower court\u2019s denial of his challenges for cause, adopting the general rule that a \u201cjuror is not incompetent because he has previously served upon the trial of another defendant charged with a separate and distinct offense, although of the same character ....\u201d <em>Russell, </em>73 Mont. at 245, 235 P. at 713 (quoting 35 C.J. 325, \u00a7 345). In explaining this rule, the Court also stated the opposite, corollary principle: \u201cAs a general rule, however, where the two cases arise out of the same transaction and involve the same issues or are determined by the same evidence, the juror is incompetent.\u201d <em>Russell, </em>73 Mont. at 246, 235 P. at 714.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">\u00b636 At the reconstruction hearing, when Deschon\u2019s appellate counsel asked Hood why she did not challenge Kokoruda under \u00a7 46-16-115(2)(e), MCA, Hood correctly explained that she could not utilize this statute as a basis for challenging Kokoruda for cause because the prior deliberate homicide case for which Kokoruda was a juror occurred in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>another county and was wholly unrelated to Deschon\u2019s charges. For Hood to have been able to challenge Kokoruda for cause under this statute, Kokoruda would have had to have served on a jury trying <em>the offense </em>Deschon was charged with, or, in accordance with the post-<em>Russell </em>revision to the statute, a related offense to <em>the offense </em>Deschon was charged with. Hood testified that because she was still concerned about Kokoruda\u2019s propensity to find defendants guilty, and \u00a7 46-16-115(2)(e), MCA, was unavailable as a means of challenging her for cause, she exercised a peremptory challenge to remove her from the panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\">\u00b637 Deschon also faults Hood\u2019s failure to challenge Juror Skuletich for cause under \u00a7 46-16-115(2)(j), MCA, because of his involvement in law enforcement. Section 46-16-115(2)(j), MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-5\">46-16-115. Challenges for cause. (2) A challenge for cause may be taken for all or any of the following reasons ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-6\">(j) having a state of mind in reference to the case or to either of the parties that would prevent the juror from acting with entire impartiality and without prejudice to the substantial rights of either party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">Deschon lists several factors tending to indicate Juror Skuletich may not have been able to act impartially. First, Skuletich had a long career in law enforcement as an investigator in the Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB). Also, Hood was married to the attorney responsible for overseeing the CIB, and, through her husband, knew people who worked for the CIB. Skuletich worked with and knew socially one of the State\u2019s witnesses, and Skuletich knew four of the police officers who would testify in Deschon\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">\u00b638 Hood testified that she specifically questioned Skuletich with the hope of challenging him for cause. Hearing testimony reveals that although McGrath and Hood questioned Skuletich extensively about his background as a criminal investigator and his knowledge of some of the State\u2019s witnesses, Skuletich consistently responded that he did not work day- to-day with the law enforcement officers involved in Deschon\u2019s case, that he did not have close, personal relationships with any of the witnesses, and the fact that a witness was a law enforcement officer would not cause him to place more weight on that person\u2019s testimony. Although Deschon suggests that Hood should have conducted individual voir dire with Skuletich, Hood testified she did not know what further questions she could have asked Skuletich to establish a record necessary to challenge him for cause. Hood testified that because she was not personally convinced by Skul\u00e9tich\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>seemingly-convincing answers and consistent assurances that he could be impartial, she used a peremptory challenge to remove him from the panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">\u00b639 Evidence revealed in the reconstruction hearing fully explains why Hood took the actions she did regarding Jurors Kokoruda and Skuletich. Thus, Deschon\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claims may be reviewed on direct appeal. <em>Turnsplenty, </em>\u00b6 17. As set forth in <em>Strickland, </em>it then becomes defendant\u2019s burden to overcome the strong presumption that counsel\u2019s performance falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 688-89, 104 S.Ct. at 2064-65, 80 L.Ed.2d at 693.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">\u00b640 As discussed above, Hood correctly concluded that \u00a7 46-16-115(2)(e), MCA, as applied by <em>Russell, </em>prohibited her from challenging Juror Kokoruda for cause. Therefore, Deschon has failed to meet his burden of overcoming the presumption that Hood\u2019s performance constituted reasonable professional assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">\u00b641  Deschon also failed to meet this burden in his challenge to Hood\u2019s actions in regard to Juror Skuletich. This Court has held that \u00a7 46-16-115(2)(j), MCA, \u201cdoes not specifically exclude law enforcement officers from serving as jurors in a criminal case.... The bare fact that [a juror] is connected with law enforcement does not, without more, necessitate a finding that he would not be an impartial juror.\u201d <em>State v. Thompson </em>(1976), 169 Mont. 158, 163, 545 P.2d 1070, 1072-73. In light of the juror\u2019s consistent responses that he could remain impartial, a challenge for cause could not be sustained, and a peremptory challenge, based upon Hood\u2019s subjective feelings, was the only available method of removing Skuletich from the panel. Thus, Hood\u2019s conduct did not fall below an objective standard of reasonableness, and Deschon has again failed to establish the first prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test. It is unnecessary, then, for this Court to consider the second prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test to review Hood\u2019s actions in regard to either Juror Kokoruda or Juror Skuletich.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">\u00b642 We thus conclude, as to issue number 1, that the reconstruction of the voir dire portion of Deschon\u2019s trial was sufficient to preserve his due process rights. As to issue number 2, Deschon has not met his burden under <em>Strickland </em>and <em>St. John </em>to prove his ineffective assistance of counsel claims. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 688-89, 104 S.Ct. at 2064-65, 80 L.Ed.2d at 693; <em>St. John, </em>\u00b6 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">\u00b643 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b36-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, LEAPHART, COTTER and REGNIER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b25-9\"> <em>State v.
