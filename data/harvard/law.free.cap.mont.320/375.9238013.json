Jacobsen filed a complaint against Respondent Farmers Union Mutual Insurance Company (Farmers Union) in the Eighth Judicial District Court, Cascade County. Jacobsen subsequently filed a motion for summary judgment on his complaint. The District Court denied Jacobsen\u2019s motion, and granted summary judgment in favor of Farmers Union. Jacobsen appeals. We affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">\u00b62 We restate the sole issue on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b398-10\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err when it denied Jacobsen\u2019s motion for summary judgment and granted summary judgment in favor of Farmers Union?</p>\n<p id=\"b398-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b398-12\">\u00b64 On July 5, 2000, Jacobsen was driving his vehicle near Vaughn, Montana, when he encountered a vehicle driven by Kenneth Keyser. Jacobsen watched as Keyser\u2019s vehicle crossed the center median and eventually came to rest in a wheat field. Fearing that Keyser was injured, Jacobsen pulled his vehicle to a stop and ran to investigate.</p>\n<p id=\"A6A\">\u00b65 Jacobsen found Keyser lying unconscious in his vehicle, with blood flowing from a wound in his head. Jacobsen attempted to control the bleeding by applying pressure to the wound. After several minutes, a team of paramedics arrived at the accident scene. As the paramedics <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>removed Keyser from his vehicle, Jacobsen noticed a handgun underneath Keyser\u2019s body. Keyser was transported to a hospital, where he died several days later. The cause of his death was determined to be suicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-3\">\u00b66 In September of 2001, Jacobsen began seeking treatment from counselor Steven Gliko for the emotional distress he suffered as a result of his incident with Keyser. At the time of the incident, Jacobsen was insured by Farmers Union. Keyser was not insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">\u00b67 On February 21,2002, Jacobsen filed a complaint against Farmers Union, alleging that he was entitled to recover uninsured motorist benefits and medical pay benefits under his insurance policy. Jacobsen filed a motion for summary judgment on his complaint on October 2, 2002. On April 22, 2003, the District Court issued an order, denying Jacobsen\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and granting summary judgment in favor of Farmers Union. Jacobsen filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">\u00b68 Our review of a district court\u2019s grant or denial of a motion for summary judgment is <em>de novo. Casiano v. Greenway Enterprises, Inc., </em>2002 MT 93, \u00b6 13, 309 Mont. 358, \u00b6 13, 47 P.3d 432, \u00b6 13. Therefore, we apply the same Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P., criteria as applied by the district court. <em>Casiano, </em>\u00b6 13. Pursuant to Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-7\">The movant must demonstrate that no genuine issues of material fact exist. Once this has been accomplished, the burden then shifts to the non-moving party to prove, by more than mere denial and speculation, that a genuine issue does exist. Having determined that genuine issues of fact do not exist, the court must then determine whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. We review the legal determinations made by a district court as to whether the court erred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-8\"><em>Casiano, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">\u00b69 In this case, the issue before this Court is whether, under the terms of Jacobsen\u2019s insurance policy, Farmers Union was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The interpretation of an insurance policy presents a question of law. <em>Wendell v. State Farm Mutual Ins. Co., </em>1999 MT 17, \u00b6 10, 293 Mont. 140, \u00b6 10, 974 P.2d 623, \u00b6 10. Consequently, we review whether the District Court correctly interpreted the provisions of Jacobsen\u2019s insurance policy. <em>Wendell, </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">\u00b610 Did the District Court err when it denied Jacobsen\u2019s motion for summary judgment and granted summary judgment in favor of Farmers Union?</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">\u00b6 11 The relevant language in Jacobsen\u2019s policy for Uninsured Motorist (UM) coverage provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-6\">We will pay all sums the \u201cinsured\u201d is legally entitled to recover as compensatory damages from the owner or driver of an \u201cuninsured motor vehicle.\u201d The damages must result from \u201cbodily injury\u201d sustained by the \u201cinsured\u201d caused by an \u201caccident.\u201d The owner\u2019s or driver\u2019s liability for these damages must result from the ownership, maintenance or use of the \u201cuninsured motor vehicle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A61\">Consistent with the statutory language in \u00a7 33-23-201, MCA, the policy defines \u201cbodily injury\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-7\">\u201cBodily injury\u201d means bodily injury, sickness or disease sustained by a person including death resulting from any of these.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">\u00b612 In its summary judgment order, the District Court determined that the emotional injury suffered by Jacobsen, including his physical manifestations, did not constitute \u201cbodily injury\u201d as that term appears in \u00a7 33-23-201, MCA, nor as that term appears under the UM policy agreement. The District Court further concluded that, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Jacobsen suffered \u201cbodily injury,\u201d such injury did not result from Keyser\u2019s use of an uninsured motor vehicle as required under the Farmers Union policy, but that Jacobsen\u2019s emotional distress resulted from Mr. Keyser\u2019s use of a gun as opposed to Keyser\u2019s use of an uninsured motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">\u00b613 On appeal, Jacobsen argues that the District Court erred in finding that Jacobsen did not suffer \u201cbodily injury\u201d as defined under the Farmers Union UM policy. Citing <em>Treichel v. State Farm Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1996), 280 Mont. 443, 930 P.2d 661, Jacobsen argues that this Court has long recognized that mental or emotional injuries are compensable even absent a physical injury or physical contact to the injured person and, therefore, that this Court should likewise recognize that Jacobsen\u2019s injury, even absent physical contact, is compensable under Jacobsen\u2019s UM policy with Farmers Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-10\">\u00b614 In <em>Treichel, </em>the plaintiff and her spouse were riding bicycles when the plaintiff witnessed the insured\u2019s vehicle strike her spouse from behind, resulting in injuries from which he subsequently died. <em>Treichel, </em>280 Mont. at 444-45, 930 P.2d at 662-63. The plaintiff subsequently filed a claim against State Farm for negligent infliction of emotion distress, arguing that, under the insured\u2019s policy, her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>emotional distress was an independent, non-derivative cause of action compensable under the insured\u2019s policy, notwithstanding that she herself suffered no direct physical contact with the insured\u2019s motor vehicle. <em>Treichel, </em>280 Mont. at 445,930 P.2d at 663. The District Court agreed and granted summary judgment in favor of plaintiff and against State Farm. <em>Treichel, </em>280 Mont. at 445, 930 P.2d at 663.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-3\">\u00b615 On appeal, this Court agreed that plaintiffs severe emotional distress was an \u201cindependent and direct\u201d injury of the type compensable under this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Sacco v. High Country Independent Press </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 209, 896 P.2d 411, and that such serious and severe emotional distress was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the insured\u2019s negligence. <em>Treichel, </em>280 Mont. at 449, 930 P.2d at 665.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">\u00b616 However, while it is true that in <em>Sacco </em>this Court recognized that emotional injuries are compensable without a physical component if the emotional distress is sufficiently severe, we did not, as Jacobsen contends, explicitly or implicitly hold in <em>Treichel </em>that such emotional or psychological injuries generally constitute a compensable injury under the rubric of \u201cbodily injury.\u201d Rather, in <em>Treichel </em>this Court recognized plaintiffs emotional injury to be an injury \u201cindependent\u201d of bodily injury, determining it to be compensable under the insured\u2019s policy, not as a bodily injury - which was undefined in the policy - but as a separate emotional injury. <em>Treichel, </em>280 Mont, at 449, 930 P.2d at 665.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-5\">We note that while the State Farm policy does not define bodily injury, per se, it does allow recovery for various injuries including loss of consortium which is not a physical injury. Moreover, State Farm is willing to provide coverage for emotional injuries resulting from the decedent\u2019s physical injury, but only subject to the one person limitation. Under the circumstances, State Farm is estopped from arguing that there is not coverage for emotional or mental injuries. Clearly, State Farm is willing to provide coverage for those types of injuries.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-6\"><em>Treichel, </em>280 Mont. at 449, 930 P.2d at 665.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">\u00b617 Thus, unlike the Farmers Union policy in the instant case, State Farm\u2019s policy in <em>Treichel </em>did not define the term \u201cbodily injury.\u201d State Farm did, however, demonstrate in its policy a willingness to provide coverage for emotional injuries which resulted from physical injuries. There is no such demonstrable similarity in the Farmers Union policy in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">\u00b618 Jacobsen contends, however, that the definition of \u201cbodily injury\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>in the Farmers Union policy is ambiguous by virtue of the fact that the term itself-bodily injury-is utilized to define or describe the term. Jacobsen contends that, given the alleged ambiguity, construing the language in favor of Jacobsen and against the insurer, Farmers Union, the definition of \u201cbodily injury,\u201d as it includes the term \u201csickness,\u201d should cover \u201call types of suffering inflicted on the body.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">\u00b619  An ambiguity exists when a contract taken as a whole in its wording or phraseology is reasonably subject to two different interpretations. <em>Wendell </em>at \u00b6 14 (citation omitted). We examine the question of ambiguity in insurance contract language from the viewpoint of a consumer with average intelligence but not trained in the law or insurance business. <em>Wendell, </em>\u00b6 14 (citation omitted). Any ambiguities in the language of a policy will be construed against the insurer. <em>Wendell, </em>\u00b6 14 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">\u00b620 Construing a similar policy definition of \u201cbodily injury\u201d in <em>Bain v. Gleason </em>(1986), 223 Mont. 442, 726 P.2d 1153, this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-6\">Bain contends that defining a term by repeating the same term, such as \u201cbodily injury means bodily injury\u201d is itself ambiguous.... If we define an apple as an apple, the definition may be ridiculous, but it is not ambiguous. Bodily injury does not become ambiguous simply because it is defined as bodily injury, especially since the term can be plainly understood as meaning physical injury to a person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-7\"><em>Bain, </em>223 Mont, at 452, 726 P.2d at 1159. Given this Court\u2019s conclusion in <em>Bain, </em>we disagree with Jacobsen that the mere repetition of the term in its definition creates an ambiguity in the meaning of the term \u201cbodily injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">\u00b621 Recognizing that this Court has not specifically addressed whether or not emotional or psychological injuries are in fact \u201cbodily injury\u201d as defined in the instant case, Jacobsen next draws from Workers\u2019 Compensation law, relying on the cases of <em>Stratemeyer v. Lincoln County </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 67, 915 P.2d 175, and <em>Kleinhesselink v. Chevron </em>(1996), 277 Mont. 158, 920 P.2d 108, noting that Montana law has recognized that emotional or psychological injuries can be the basis for valid tort claims outside of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, as the Act has a restrictive definition of \u201cbodily injury\u201d that clearly excludes emotional injury. Jacobsen contends that, as the definition of \u201cbodily injury\u201d in the Farmers Union policy is less restrictive and less limiting than the definition of the same under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, that Farmers Union did not intend to limit its UM coverage only to physical injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"AJZ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>\u00b622 While we agree with Jacobsen that emotional injuries are not covered under the limited definition of \u201cbodily injury\u201d in the Workers\u2019 Compensation statutes, we agree with Farmers Union that this Court\u2019s holdings in <em>Stratemeyer </em>or <em>Kleinliesselink </em>have no bearing on the present case. Whether emotional or psychological distress is outside the <em>quid pro quo </em>foundation of Workers\u2019 Compensation law or is otherwise compensable in a tort action under Montana law is neither in dispute nor relevant in this case. Rather, the issue in this case is purely contractual in nature. As noted by Farmers Union, \u201c[t]here is no dispute that Montana tort law allows for recovery of purely emotional damages. However, this case involves the interpretation of contract, and tort law is wholly irrelevant to that interpretation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">\u00b623 Farmers Union responds that, although this Court has not directly addressed whether emotional or psychological injuries are in fact \u201cbodily injury\u201d as defined in the instant case, such issue has been discussed in myriad other cases, including United States District Courts for the District of Montana. While federal court decisions applying Montana law are not binding on this Court, the rationale therein is often compelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">\u00b624 In <em>Aetna Cas. and Sur. Co. v. First Sec. Bank of Bozeman </em>(D.Mont. 1987), 662 F.Supp. 1126, Aetna brought an action seeking a declaratory judgment that the liability insurance policy it issued to the bank did not provide coverage for damages sought against the bank and one of its employees in a separate suit pending in state district court. <em>Aetna, </em>662 F.Supp. at 1127. Aetna moved the United States District Court for summary judgment, arguing that the damages and injuries alleged by the bank\u2019s former employee did not fall within the policy definitions of \u201cbodily injury,\u201d among other policy definitions. <em>Aetna, </em>662 F.Supp. at 1127.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">\u00b625 Aetna\u2019s policy defined \u201cbodily injury\u201d as \u201cbodily injury, sickness or disease,\u201d language parallel to the definition of \u201cbodily injury\u201d in the Farmers Union policy in the instant case. Aetna argued that the term \u201cbodily injury\u201d \u201crequires that the underlying action against its insured include some allegation of physical injury, as opposed to emotional injury.\u201d <em>Aetna, </em>662 F.Supp. at 1127. The bank countered by urging the Coui\u2019t to determine that the term \u201cbodily injury\u201d also included emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">\u00b626 Noting that Montana law contained no authority on point, the United States District Court looked to how numerous other courts have construed the term \u201cbodily injury\u201d as it is used in comprehensive general liability insurance policies. <em>Aetna, </em>662 F.Supp. at 1128. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>Looking at numerous cases, the District Court determined that \u201cthe courts that have interpreted such language have determined that it limits coverage 'to physical injury to the body.\u201d <em>Aetna, </em>662 F.Supp. at 1127 (citing <em>American and Foreign Insurance Co. v. Church Schools, Diocese of Virginia </em>(E.D.Va. 1986), 645 F.Supp. 628, 632-33 (applying Virginia law to hold that \u201cbodily injury\u201d coverage does not extend to purely nonphysical or emotional harm); <em>St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Co. v. Campbell County School District No. 1 </em>(D.Wyo. 1985), 612 F.Supp. 285, 287 (applying Wyoming law in holding that allegations of emotional suffering do not constitute \u201cbodily injury\u201d); and <em>Rolette County v. Western Casualty &amp; Surety Co. </em>(D.N.D. 1978), 452 F.Supp. 125, 129-30 (applying North Dakota law to hold that \u201cbodily injury,\u201d defined in the policy in question as including \u201csickness and disease,\u201d did not extend coverage to damages for embarrassment, humiliation and emotional distress)).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">\u00b627 Applying relevant Montana law, the United States District Court noted that, in tort actions alleging mental and emotional injuries, this Court has distinguished such injuries from physical injuries. <em>Aetna, </em>662 F.Supp. at 1128 (citing <em>Johnson v. SuperSave Markets, Inc., </em>(1984), 211 Mont. 465, 471, 686 P.2d 209, 212 (allowing recovery for mental distress absent a showing of physical injury)). The Court thus concluded that \u201c[i]n light of the Montana court\u2019s recognition that \u2018there is a difference between (physical) injury and (mental) distress,\u2019 it is likely the Montana Supreme Court would follow the lead of the above-cited decisions and hold that the term \u2018bodily injury,\u2019 as used in the liability insurance policy at issue, limits coverage to <em>physical </em>injury, sickness or disease.\u201d <em>Aetna, </em>662 F.Supp. at 1128-29. (Citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">\u00b628 Such conclusion comports with this Court\u2019s more recent aforementioned cases concluding that emotional and psychological injuries are independent of physical injury and independently compensable in tort law if the emotional injury is sufficiently severe. <em>See generally Sacco, </em>271 Mont. 209, 896 P.2d 411, and <em>Treichel, </em>280 Mont. 443, 930 P.2d 661. It also comports with this Court\u2019s conclusion in <em>Bain </em>that the term \u201cbodily injury,\u201d plainly understood, means physical injury to a person. <em>Bain, </em>223 Mont. at 452, 726 P.2d at 1159.</p>\n<p id=\"AYT\">\u00b629  We agree with the rationale of the Court in <em>Aetna </em>and conclude that the term \u201cbodily injury,\u201d as defined in Farmers Union UM policy, is limited to physical injury to a person caused by an accident and does not include emotional and psychological injuries stemming therefrom. We thus hold that the District Court correctly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>concluded that the emotional injury suffered by J acobsen, including his physical manifestations resulting therefrom, do not constitute \u201cbodily injury\u201d as that term is defined in the contract of insurance between Farmers Union and Jacobsen, and that Jacobsen\u2019s injuries are thus not compensable under the Farmers Union UM policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">\u00b630 Given our conclusion that Jacobsen\u2019s injuries are not covered under his UM policy with Farmers Union, it is unnecessary for this Court to rule on whether the District Court correctly concluded that, under this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Wendell, </em>there existed an insufficient nexus between Jacobsen\u2019s injury andKeyser\u2019s ownership, maintenance or use of the uninsured motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">\u00b631 The decision of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b405-6\">JUSTICES NELSON, WARNER, LEAPHART and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
