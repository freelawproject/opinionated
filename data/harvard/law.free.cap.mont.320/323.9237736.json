We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">\u00b62 The issue is whether the District Court violated Megard\u2019s due process rights by admitting telephonic testimony at a hearing on a petition to revoke his suspended sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b347-12\">\u00b63 Megard was incarcerated on three separate felony convictions and sentences, two for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) and one for carrying a concealed weapon. Each sentence contained a suspended sentence with numerous conditions. The conditions included, in pertinent part, requirements that Megard (1) refrain from violating state or federal laws; (2) undergo a chemical dependency evaluation and comply with the evaluator\u2019s recommendations, if his probation officer so required; (3) refrain from the use or possession of any intoxicants or drugs, except legal nonprescription drugs or those prescribed by a physician; and (4) submit to random chemical tests of blood, breath, hair or urine, upon his probation officer\u2019s request. The suspended portions of the DUI sentences also required Megard to pay fines, fees and surcharges. Megard completed the unsuspended portions of his sentences and began serving his suspended sentences in January of 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-13\">\u00b64 On March 8, 2003, Lincoln County Sheriffs Deputy Terry L. Watson responded to a report of a disturbance and took Megard into custody. The State of Montana subsequently petitioned to revoke all three suspended sentences, attaching an affidavit of Megard\u2019s probation officer in support. The petitions alleged Megard possessed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>beer and vodka, had a blood alcohol content of .069, assaulted another inmate at the Lincoln County Detention Center (LCDC), refused to provide a urine sample requested by his probation officer, failed to attend chemical dependency counseling as required by his probation officer, and failed to pay fines, fees and surcharges.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">\u00b65 Megard responded by admitting he violated the condition prohibiting use and possession of intoxicants and waiving his right to a hearing on that violation. He denied the rest of the alleged violations. The State later amended its petitions to include allegations that Megard violated both the prohibition against violating federal and state laws and the prohibition against possessing unauthorized intoxicants or drugs by consuming methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">\u00b66 On April 10, 2003, the District Court scheduled an evidentiary hearing for April 30. On April 15, the State moved to reschedule the evidentiary hearing based on the prosecutor\u2019s unavailability, and advised the court that defense counsel objected to continuing the hearing to a date later than April 30 due to Megard\u2019s incarceration. The District Court rescheduled the hearing for April 24, 2003, to accommodate both counsels\u2019 needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">\u00b67 Three days before the hearing, the State moved the District Court to allow telephonic testimony from Watson and LCDC Officer Roy Allen Rowberry because both were attending courses at the Montana Law Enforcement Academy and were not available to appear in person. Megard objected, relying on Rule 611(e), M.R.Evid., and <em>Bonamarte v. Bonamarte </em>(1994), 263 Mont. 170, 866 P.2d 1132. The District Court granted the State\u2019s motion, reasoning that Rule 611(e), M.R.Evid., and <em>Bonamarte </em>were inapplicable and that Megard\u2019s fundamental rights would be adequately protected.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">\u00b68 At the beginning of the evidentiary hearing, Megard admitted he possessed and consumed methamphetamine, thus admitting the two additional violations set forth in the amended petitions. The State presented testimony from eight witnesses, including Megard\u2019s probation officer, Megard\u2019s employer, inmates from Megard\u2019s former cellblock at LCDC, Watson and Rowberry by telephone, and other law enforcement personnel. Megard and his girlfriend testified on his behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">\u00b69 The District Court found-with regard to the alleged violations not admitted by Megard-that Megard committed the assault and refused to submit to a urine test, thereby violating the related conditions of his suspended sentences. It determined the State had not proven by a preponderance of the evidence that Megard failed to comply with his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>probation officer\u2019s direction regarding the chemical dependency-evaluation or failed to pay his fines, fees and surcharges while having the capacity to do so. The District Court revoked Megard\u2019s suspended sentences. Megard appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">\u00b610 Asserted violations of the constitutional right of due process present questions of law, and our review is plenary. <em>State v. Finley, </em>2003 MT 239, \u00b6 10, 317 Mont. 268, \u00b6 10, 77 P.3d 193, \u00b6 10 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">\u00b611 Did the District Court violate Megard\u2019s due process rights by admitting telephonic testimony at a hearing on a petition to revoke his suspended sentences?</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">\u00b612  When the State files a petition showing probable cause that an offender has violated a condition of a suspended sentence, a district court may issue an order for a hearing on revocation and an arrest warrant. Section 46-18-203(1), MCA. At the offender\u2019s initial appearance, the court must advise the offender of the petition\u2019s allegations, the opportunity to appear and present evidence, the opportunity to question adverse witnesses and the right to counsel. Section 46-18-203(4), MCA. If, after a hearing on the petition, the court determines the State has proven by a preponderance of the evidence that the offender violated a condition of a suspended sentence, the court may revoke the suspension. Section 46-18-203(6), (7)(iii), MCA. \u00b613 Here, the District Court determined Megard violated the three drag and alcohol conditions he admitted and, in addition, failed to submit a urine sample upon request and assaulted another inmate at LCDC. On appeal, Megard does not challenge the in-court testimony establishing his failure to provide a urine sample. He challenges only the telephonic testimony supporting the allegation that he assaulted another inmate at LCDC.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">\u00b614 Megard contends that in the absence of exigent circumstances or consent, the telephonic testimony was inadmissible under Bonamarte. He also asserts that Rule 611(e), M.R.Evid., precluded the use of telephonic testimony at his revocation hearing. Finally, he argues that the admission of telephonic testimony violated his right to confront adverse witnesses. We address each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-10\">\u00b615 Megard first argues the telephonic testimony was inadmissible under <em>Bonamarte. </em>Absent special circumstances or the parties\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>consent, telephonic testimony generally is not allowed in trials. <em>Bonamarte, </em>263 Mont. at 177, 866 P.2d at 1136 (citation omitted). Requiring an individual to testify in person serves six important policies and purposes: (1) assisting the factfinder in evaluating witness credibility; (2) establishing the identity of the witness; (3) impressing upon the witness the seriousness of the occasion; (4) assuring the witness is not coached or influenced during the testimony; (5) preventing the witness from improperly referring to documents; and (6) providing a right of confrontation when required. <em>Bonamarte, </em>263 Mont. at 174, 866 P.2d at 1134 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">\u00b616 In <em>Bonamarte, </em>we held that a district court abused its discretion in allowing a woman to testify telephonically in her dissolution proceeding. We reasoned that the telephonic testimony impaired cross-examination efforts because the woman did not possess pertinent documents, precluded the court from determining the parties\u2019 relative credibility vis-a-vis conflicting evidence, and infringed on her spouse\u2019s right of confrontation in civil cases pursuant to Rule 611(e), M.R.Evid. <em>Bonamarte, </em>263 Mont. at 175-76, 866 P.2d at 1135.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">\u00b617 <em>Bonamarte </em>is readily distinguishable from the present case. Unlike the witness in <em>Bonamarte </em>who did not possess pertinent documents and could not testify about them on cross-examination, both Watson and Rowberry indicated they had their reports and were able to refer to them. <em>See Bonamarte, </em>263 Mont. at 176, 866 P.2d at 1135. Rowberry did not have in his possession a photograph of Megard\u2019s injury after the jailhouse altercation, but Megard did not object to the admission of the photograph after another witness identified it.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">\u00b618 Highlighting Rowberrys statement that he had not previously testified in district court, Megard argues that the District Court was unable to evaluate Rowberry\u2019s credibility. In granting the State\u2019s motion to allow telephonic testimony, however, the District Court observed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-7\">[t]he officers in question are not strangers to any of the participants in the hearing, including the Court. Personal observation of the witnesses testifying under oath is not as crucial in this instance as it would be for a jury, new to the job of judging credibility and unfamiliar with the witnesses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">Megard asserts that the District Court\u2019s familiarity with Rowberry outside the courtroom was not \u201cgood cause\u201d to allow telephonic testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">\u00b619  The issue under <em>Bonamarte </em>is not whether the District Court\u2019s familiarity with Rowberry established good cause for permitting his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>telephonic testimony, but whether the District Court could judge Rowberry\u2019s credibility in relation to that of other witnesses. Knowledge of a witness\u2019s identity and credentials may constitute a special circumstance under which telephonic testimony is allowed. <em>Bonamarte, </em>263 Mont, at 177, 866 P.2d at 1136 (citations omitted). Moreover, although Megard presented conflicting testimony, other witnesses corroborated Rowberry\u2019s testimony. We conclude the admission of telephonic testimony did not impede the court\u2019s ability to judge Rowberry\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">\u00b620 Megard also asserts that, like the spouse in <em>Bonamarte, </em>he had a right of confrontation under Rule 611(e), M.R.Evid., which provides the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-5\">Confrontation. Except as otherwise provided by constitution, statute, these rules, or other rules applicable to the courts of this state, at the trial of an action, a witness can be heard only in the presence and subject to the examination of all the parties to the action, if they choose to attend and examine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">His contention ignores the exceptions set forth in Rule 611(e), M.R.Evid.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">\u00b621  Rule 611(e), M.R.Evid., applies except-among other things-as otherwise provided in the evidentiary rules themselves. Rule 101(c)(3), M.R.Evid., expressly provides that the Rules do not apply to proceedings \u201cgranting or revoking probation or parole.\u201d <em>See also State v. Pedersen, </em>2003 MT 315, \u00b6 20, 318 Mont. 262, \u00b6 20, 80 P.3d 79, \u00b6 20; State <em>v. Nelson </em>(1987), 225 Mont. 215, 218, 731 P.2d 1299, 1301. Therefore, the District Court did not err in concluding that Rule 611(e), M.R.Evid., was inapplicable to Megard\u2019s revocation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"AOT\">\u00b622  Notwithstanding the inapplicability of Rule 611(e), M.R.Evid., Megard asserts the admission of telephonic testimony nevertheless violated his constitutional right to confront witnesses. A revocation hearing is not a criminal trial. <em>Pedersen, </em>\u00b6 20 (citation omitted). Therefore, contrary to Megard\u2019s assertion, Article II, \u00a7 24, of the Montana Constitution-which secures the right to confront \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions\u201d-does not afford him a constitutional right to confront witnesses at his revocation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">\u00b623 Megard also contends the District Court improperly applied what he calls \u201ccommon law\u201d minimum due process standards in analyzing his right of confrontation. It is undisputed that a revocation hearing must be fundamentally fair and must meet minimum due process requirements. <em>See, e.g.,Pedersen, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 20-21 (citations omitted). One of the minimum due process requirements is \u201cthe right to confront and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>cross-examine adverse witnesses.\u201d <em>See, e.g.,Finley, </em>\u00b6 31 (citing <em>Gagnon v. Scarpelli </em>(1973), 411 U.S. 778, 786, 93 S.Ct. 1756, 1761-62, 36 L.Ed.2d 656). This right applies \u201cunless the hearing officer specifically finds good cause for not allowing confrontation.\u201d <em>Gagnon, </em>411 U.S. at 786, 93 S.Ct. at 1761-62, 36 L.Ed.2d 656; <em>see also State v. Kingery </em>(1989), 239 Mont. 160, 165, 779 P.2d 495,498 (citations omitted); <em>State v. Friedman </em>(1987), 225 Mont. 373, 377, 732 P.2d 1322, 1325 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">\u00b624 Megard asserts he was entitled to application of \u00a7 46-18-203(4), MCA, rather than the right to cross-examine and confront, absent good cause. In other words, he contends, the statutory right is broader than that set forth in both Montana and federal case law. He is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"AHo\">\u00b625  Section 46-18-203(4), MCA, requires that an offender be advised of \u201cthe opportunity to question adverse witnesses.\u201d Because Megard\u2019s counsel actually cross-examined Watson and Rowberry, he clearly received the statutorily required \u201copportunity to question.\u201d The minimum due process requirement affording the right to confront-absent good cause-and cross-examine witnesses is broader than merely having the opportunity to question adverse witnesses. We conclude the District Court did not err in applying the minimum due process requirements instead of \u00a7 46-18-203(4), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">\u00b626 Alternatively, Megard argues no good cause existed for the limitation on his right to confront adverse witnesses and, therefore, the District Court erred in admitting the telephonic testimony. We agree with Megard\u2019s implicit suggestion that good cause to limit the right to confront adverse witnesses is a difficult test to meet. Under the relatively unique circumstances of this case, however, we conclude the good cause test was met.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">\u00b627  Upon receiving the State\u2019s April 15 motion to reschedule the revocation hearing, together with defense counsel\u2019s agreement to reschedule only to a date prior to April 30, the District Court rescheduled the hearing for April 24 to accommodate both counsel. As later became evident, two of the State\u2019s witnesses could not testify in person on the rescheduled date because they were attending scheduled law enforcement academy courses. Given the confluence of scheduling problems presented here, we conclude that good cause existed for the District Court to admit the witnesses\u2019 testimony by telephone.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">\u00b628  Finally, we recently determined that actual error in admitting evidence at a revocation hearing can be harmless when abundant evidence admitted without error demonstrates violations of conditions which are sufficient to support a revocation. <em>See Pedersen, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 21-22. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>Stated differently, prejudice must result from the improper admission of evidence in revocation hearings. In <em>Pedersen, </em>evidence relating to certain alleged violations of probation conditions was improperly admitted but not relied on by the trial court in revoking a suspended sentence. <em>Pedersen, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 21-22. The probationer had admitted at least two violations and uncontroverted evidence of two other violations was presented. We concluded that, under such circumstances, no abuse of discretion occurred when the trial court revoked the suspended sentence. <em>Pedersen, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 19, 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">\u00b629  Here, even assuming error had occurred, Megard has not established-and could not establish-prejudice under <em>Pedersen. </em>As set forth above, Megard admitted three violations and the District Court determined the State had proven two more: the assault and the failure to provide a urine sample. The telephonic testimony Megard challenges relates only to the assault violation and he asserts no error regarding the other four violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">\u00b630 We hold the District Court did not violate Megard\u2019s due process rights by admitting telephonic testimony at his revocation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"AWn\">\u00b631 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b353-6\">JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b353-7\">JUSTICE LEAPHART</author>\n<p id=\"AA\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">\u00b632 I concur in the result reached by the Court. I would not, however, reach the question of whether the telephonic testimony concerning the assault violations constitutes error. The unchallenged evidence of four other violations is sufficient to sustain the revocation of his suspended sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
