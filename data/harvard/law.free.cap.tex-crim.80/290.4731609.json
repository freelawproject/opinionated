On August 14th, by request of the State and relator, the ease was postponed until October 4th, being in term time. On that day the cause was submitted, no additional testimony being heard. From an inspection of the record and the evidence on file we are of the opinion that bail should be granted. It is therefore ordered that bail be granted relator in the sum heretofore fixed, towit: $10,000, and upon his giving bond in that sum, conditioned as required by law, he will be released by the sheriff.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-17\">Bail granted.</p>\n<p id=\"AJH\">\n<em>Bail granted.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
