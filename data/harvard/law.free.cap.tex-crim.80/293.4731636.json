This was more than twenty days after the adjournment of court, which, makes it too late for' consideration. There were exceptions taken to the court\u2019s charge as well as exceptions to other rulings of the court in admitting testimony. In the absence of the evidence this court is unable intelligently to revise the charge of the court. The charge may have been in accord with the facts and properly submitted the questions. There seems to have been no special charges asked, and this is a misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-17\">The judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"A7e\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
