State, 55 Texas Crim. Rep., 601. The rule is thus again stated: A charge on alibi is not required if defendant\u2019s theory is not inconsistent with the State\u2019s theorjr that he was present at the commission of the offense. Underwood v. State, 55 Texas Crim. Rep., 601; Parker v. State, 40 Texas Crim. Rep., 119; and see Hernandes v. State, 64 Texas Crim. Rep., 73; Myers v. State, 65 Texas Crim. Rep., 448.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-3\">The State\u2019s theory and testimony was that appellant committed an assault and battery upon his paramour, Mattie Lee Williamson, at her room over the garage on the Ferguson place at 12:30 o\u2019clock at night. The State did not claim that the offense was committed at any other time or place. The testimony of the officer was that he saw the assault and battery committed at this time and place and that immediately after he saw it he went up into this woman\u2019s room and found only appellant and her therein, and no one had left there from the time he saw the assault and battery until he reached the room. Both appellant and the woman testified that he was there at that time, but both denied that he then, or at any other time or place, committed any assault or battery upon her. She further testified that some unknown \u201cchuffy or heavy built\u201d negro man assaulted her at 10:40 that night, not in her room at all, but elsewhere in the back yard of the Ferguson premises. She and appellant both further testified that appellant was not there at that time\u201410:40\u2014but he shows that he was elsewhere at that particular time. They both further swear that appellant came to her room about one hour later and remained there continuously until the assault and battery testified to by the other State\u2019s witness occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">The court in his charge, after properly defining the offense as alleged, required the juryto find and believe from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt, that appellant, being an adult male, then and there committed an aggravated assault and battery upon said woman. In addition, he gave the usual charge that the defendant is presumed to be innocent until his guilt is established by legal and competent evidence beyond a reasonable doubt, and if they had such doubt, to acquit him.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">Under the facts of this case and the law, the court committed no reversible error in refusing to charge an alibi.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
