The evidence for the State, there being none for the defendant on this question, shows that the offense was committed on the 29th of the same month, or five days after the filing of the complaint. The information, of course, follows the allegations of the complaint. A citizen can not he convicted of an offense until the evidence shows that that offense was committed as charged. It would not do to hold that an offense committed five days after the complaint is filed could be sustained. Under our law a citizen can not be convicted for future but for past offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-13\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-14\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
