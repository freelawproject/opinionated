Mrs. Lacey Whitcomb, in the County Court of Anderson County, Texas, and now on appeal in the Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas, do hereby certify that the appeal bond filed was never recorded in the minutes of the court; said bond is dated April <em>21, </em>1916, and is signed by Mrs. Lacy Whitcomb as principal and C. M. Kay, F. E. Dublin, and B. Y. Snaer as sureties; that this said appeal bond is the only bond ever filed by the said Mrs. Lacy Whitcomb and is the bond that the case was appealed on, and is the bond that was filed in my office and placed with the papers and copied into the transcript; that said bond was never recorded on the minutes of this court, and no bond in her case was ever recorded on \u2022the minutes of this court, and no recognizance in her case was ever copied on the minutes of this court; and the above appeal bond dated April <em>21, </em>1916, was the only bond or recognizance tendered me, and the only bond of any description filed in this court after her conviction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b473-12\">An appeal in a misdemeanor case, tried in the County Court, can only be perfected by entering into a recognizance in open court. Art. 920, Code of Criminal Procedure; Maxey v. State, 41 Texas Crim. Rep., 556; Quarles v. State, 37 Texas Crim. Rep., 362; Koritz v. State, 27 Texas Crim. App., 53. An appeal bond will not answer the purpose of a recognizance, nor confer jurisdiction on the Court of Criminal Appeals. Palmer v. State, 63 Texas Crim. Rep., 614; Herron v.

State, 1 Texas Crim. App., 485, an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>instrument of the character and kind shown by this record to have been executed by appellant is held to be an appeal bond and conferred no jurisdiction- on this court. For other decisions so holding see Bennett v. State, decided at the last sitting of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">\n<em>Dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b474-7\">ON REHEARING.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">December 20, 1916.</p>\n<author id=\"b474-9\">HABPEB, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"ASzJ\">Appellant has filed a motion asking that the order dismissing this case be set aside, and attached to said motion is the certificate of the county judge of Anderson County in which he certifies that he in fact took a recognizance, but that it was not entered in the minutes of the court for the term. The term of court at which appellant was tried adjourned the first day of last July, and after this court had dismissed this appeal, copying therein the certificate of the county clerk of date November 4, 1916, appellant or her counsel goes to the clerk, and - without any order of the court, so far as the record discloses, has the clerk to copy the instrument filed, and so certify on the 14tli day of November, 1916. The clerk, after the adjournment of court, without permission, had no authority to add to or take from the minutes as approved by the court, but had the court ordered the bond entered nunc pro tune, he would have no authority to do so, as has been frequently decided by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-10\">The questions here presented have heretofore been passed on by this \u25a0 court, and we do not deem it necessary to discuss them again. In Maxey v. State, 41 Texas Crim. Rep., 556, this court held:</p>\n<p id=\"b474-11\">\u201cThe Assistant Attorney General has filed a motion to dismiss the appeal, because there is no recognizance in the record, nor a certificate that appellant is confined in jail. In reply to this, appellant has filed an affidavit of the county judge to the effect that a recognizance was actually, taken in open court. This is -not sufficient. The recognizance should have been entered of record in the final minutes of the court. A recognizance is an undertaking entered into before a court of record in session by a defendant in a criminal action'and his sureties, by which they bind themselves, etc. The requisites are prescribed by our statutes. Articles 303, 308, 886-888, Code Grim. Proc. From an inspection of these articles it is evident that, whatever the court may have done in the way of taking recognizance, it is not perfected until this recognizance is entered of record in the final minutes of the case. 20 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, 1 ed., 471. In Quarrels v. State, 37 Texas Crim. Rep., 362, it was held that the entry of this recognizance could \"not be made nunc pro tunc, so as to give this court jurisdiction. In Thompson v. State, 35 Texas Crim. Rep., 505, it was held it was the duty of appellant to see - that this recognizance was entered of record before the adjournment of the court, and that such recognizance could not afterwards be amended. And see Dement v. State, 39 Texas Crim. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>Rep., 271. We accordingly hold that, in order to give this court jurisdiction, it is necessary not only that the recognizance be taken, but-that such recognizance be entered of record during the term at which the appeal was taken.\u201d For list of authorities of recent date see Knowlton v. State, 75 Texas Crim. Rep., 8, 169 S. W. Rep., 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-3\">The motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
