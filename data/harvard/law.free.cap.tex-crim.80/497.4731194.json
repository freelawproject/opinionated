The State introduced two witnesses, one of whom testified positively that appellant did have and carry a pistol. He was strongly corroborated hy the party he was with in some particulars. Appellant denied positively that she had the pistol at the time and place testified to hy the State\u2019s witness, and her frieud who was .with her testified substantially t\u00f3 the same thing. So that it is seen that the State\u2019s testimony, if believed, unquestionably was sufficient to show the commission of the of\u00edense and authorized the verdict, while that of the accused would have authorized the jury to have acquitted her. The jury believed the State\u2019s witnesses, and we can not disturb the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">The judgment is, therefore, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
