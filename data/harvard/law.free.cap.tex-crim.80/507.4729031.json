What have I done?\u201d to which the deceased replied, \u201cHo,\u201d and started off around the west wing of the house pretty fast, his back to the defendant, when defendant came out a little piece, threw up his gun and fired, and then following deceased fired another shot, of which shots the deceased died the next morning.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b534-5\">The defendant\u2019s testimony was, first with reference to the quarrel between him and the deceased which grew out of the weighing of cotton, during which defendant claimed he was struck by the deceased over the head, and also with reference to threats by the deceased, all occurring some days before the homicide, and then related the facts immediately before the killing to the effect that when he reached his house with some other neighbors, all negroes, whom defendant said had been hunting rabbits with him, the deceased walked up and said to the defendant: \u201c\u2018Say, old pimp, I w'ant my lantern.\u2019 I said, \u2018All right,\u2019 and walked in the house and brought it out, and he said, \u2018If I did right, I ought to break it over your head\u2019; I do not know how come him to speak such words; I asked him if I had mistreated him, because if I had, I was willing to apologize, and he said, \u2018Ho, a negro like you can\u2019t mistreat anybody; I don\u2019t want any talking back from you\u2019; I said, \u2018All right.\u2019 He understood I had let him have my' lantern for several nights and that he was taking this one back; I told him he must be drunk and he said he was not; he said any man that would go and tell the white folks what I had about the weighing would stay with his mother; with that he stepped back; I said, \u2018What in the world do you mean? I have not mistreated you\u2019; he said, \u2018A little of you goes a long ways with me\u2019; I said, \u2018All right\u2019; he said, \u2018Don\u2019t you curse me in front of my family,\u2019 and I said, \u2018Mister, I haven\u2019t cursed in front of your family\u2019; he said, \u2018Will you respect my family?\u2019 and I said, T would respect his family and him, too\u2019; he said, \u2018You son of a bitch, I will kill you\u2019; I told him I would go and get Mr. Orr (who was their landlord) and bring him down there, and let him settle the trouble; as I was about to climb over the fence he (deceased) put his hand here like this (indicating his waistband of his pants) and I said, \u2018Mr. Walker, don\u2019t you shoot me,\u2019 and he said, \u2018You son of a bitch, I will kill you\u2019; I was excited and did not know what to do; I do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>know whether I hit him when I shot first or not. He was at about the far corner of the house, and said, \u2018Bring me my shotgun, this damned thing is no good\u2019; that is the words I heard him speak. I started to the gap to get over the fence, and as I did so he showed up at the corner of the house and I saw about this much of the stock of the gun (indicating about a half foot or a foot), and I do not know whether he was putting a load in it or unbreaching it, but when he brought himself about like this with the gun, I shot again, and then broke and run, etc.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b535-5\">These are the salient facts in the case, although the testimony is quite voluminous.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b535-6\"><em>L.

State, 72 Texas Crim. Rep., 501; Burton v. State, 77 Texas Crim. Rep., 314.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b535-8\"><em>B. B.

The testimony by the State, and as a whole, clearly raised the issue of murder, which the court submitted and the jury found him guilty of. Self-defense was his defense. His testimony raised that issue, which was fully submitted by the court to the jury in a correct charge. His testimony, if believed, would probably have made self-defense. However, that of the State disproved that the killing by appellant was in self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-11\">Appellant complains that the court erred in not submitting manslaughter. We have carefully considered all the testimony with reference to this issue and have concluded that the testimony did not raise manslaughter, and that, therefore, the court did not err in not submitting that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-12\">Our statutes on the subject of manslaughter are clearly and distinctly to the effect that, in order to constitute manslaughter, there must be adequate cause, and that that cause must' have produced such degree of passion as to render the mind incapable of cool reflection in order to reduce an unlawful killing from murder to manslaughter. Our decisions are to the same effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-13\">In Davis v. State, 70 Texas Crim. Rep., 37, this court, through Judge Davidson, said: \u201cIt may be laid down as an uncontroverted proposition that two things are requisite to constitute manslaughter: First, adequate cause; second, existing passion. If these co-exist, the homicide is manslaughter. If they do not combine or co-exist, it may be murder in one of the degrees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-15\">This court, through Presiding Judge White, in McKinney v. State, 8 Texas Grim. App., 626, said: \u201cA killing upon such sudden passion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>as is mentioned may be murder in the second degree, even though the passion was anger, rage, sudden resentment, or terror, rendering the mind incapable of cool reflection. To make such killing manslaughter, there must actually have existed not only such state or emotion of the mind, but the <em>adequate cause </em>which produced them must also exist. Penal Code, art. 1137. Insulting words or gestures, or an assault and battery so slight as to show no intention to inflict pain or injury, may be sufficient to cause the emotions of the mind known as anger, rage, sudden resentment, or terror, to the extent even of rendering it incapable of cool reflection, and yet a killing under such circumstances would not be manslaughter. Why ? Because such insulting words or gestures, or such assault and battery, <em>are not adequate causes </em>(Penal Code, art. 1131), and manslaughter can not be predicated upon any voluntary homicide upon sudden passion not arising from an <em>adequate cause. </em>Penal Code, art. 1128.\u201d Wilson v. State, 71 Texas Crim. Rep., 399; Redman v. State, 67 Texas Crim. Rep., 374; Kelly v. State, 68 Texas Crim. Rep., 317, 151 S. W. Rep., 304; Clore v. State, 26 Texas Crim. App., 624; Hill v. State, 11 Texas Crim. App., 456; Neyland v. State, 13 Texas Crim. App., 536; Blackwell v. State, 29 Texas Crim. App., 194; Miller v. State, 31 Texas Crim. Rep., 609; Ex parte Jones, 31 Texas Crim. Rep., 422. A great many other decisions to the same effect could be collated, but we deem it unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-3\">A careful study of the testimony has convinced us that there was no adequate cause in this case, even if the testimony would justify a conclusion of any sudden passion, which is doubtful, in order to raise the issue of manslaughter and require the court to submit such an issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">In a great many decisions this court has uniformly held that if the case is either murder or perfect self-defense, it is not error to fail to charge on manslaughter. (2 Branch\u2019s Ann. P. C., sec. 2014, where he collates a large number of decisions.) We think the testimony in this case presented those two issues alone\u2014murder on the State\u2019s side, and perfect self-defense for the appellant according to his testimony alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">Appellant has two bills which show that he objected to the testimony of two witnesses wherein they testified to dying declarations of the deceased. His objections along this score were that no sufficient predicate had been laid to make such declarations dying declarations; that it was not shown that he was sane, conscious of approaching death and had no hope of recovery; and that the declarations were in reply to questions propounded to him. These were his objections, not verified by the court as facts. Hpon a consideration of the testimony, we think the proper predicate was laid and that the court could, without submitting the question to the jury, properly have so held, but it seems the court, instead of deciding the question himself, submitted it to the jury and in effect instructed them of all the requisites, that the State had to prove to make the testimony admissible as dying declarations and that they could not consider the said proposed testimony along <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>that line unless the jury believed beyond a reasonable doubt all of the said requisites had been shown by the testimony. This practice has been approved by this court. 2 Branch\u2019s Ann. P. C., sec. 1870; Taylor v. State, 38 Texas Crim. Rep., 552; Brown v. State, 54 Texas Crim Rep., 121; Jackson v. State, 55 Texas Crim. Rep., 79; Hunter v. State, 59 Texas Crim. Rep., 439; Ward v. State, 70 Texas Crim. Rep., 393, 159 S. W. Rep., 272.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-3\">The court correctly submitted every issue raised in a proper and apt charge. There is no necessity for further discussion of any of appellant\u2019s claimed errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">The judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">MOBBOW, Judge, absent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
