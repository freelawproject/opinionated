Appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial was overruled, he was duly sentenced, and he gave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>notice of appeal on October <em>7, </em>1916, all of which was then and there entered in the minutes of the court. In the order overruling his motion for a new trial the judgment, among other things, is that appellant \u201casked for and was granted sixty (60) days from and after this day, October <em>7, </em>1916, in which to have approved and filed his bills of exception.-\u201d This is the only order in the record pertaining to when the bills of exception were authorized to be filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-3\">The statute allows only thirty days after these proceedings when the court under the law can continue longer than eight weeks to file bills of exception without an order. But authorizes the court by order duly entered to grant a longer time. In this instance, as only sixty days were allowed, and the bills were not filed until long after the expiration of that time, the Assistant Attorney General\u2019s motion to strike out the bills, and for this court not to consider them, must be, and is, therefore, sustained. The statute, as stated, and the many decisions of this court thereunder have been uniform to the effect that when the bills are not filed within the thirty daj-s allowed by law, or within the additional time allowed by the judgment of the court, they must be struck out, and can not be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">Among other grounds in his motion -for a new trial appellant alleged misconduct of the jury. The State duly contested this. The record shows that the court heard testimony on it and found against him. The record in no way shows what this evidence was which the court heard and acted upon on this issue. Therefore we must conclude, and do, that the evidence was amply suEcient to sustain the action of the court. This has also all the time been held by this court. See Guerra v. State, 80 Texas Crim. Rep., 328, 189 S. W. Rep., 952, where some of the cases are collated.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">There is no other question we can review in the absence of bills of exception. The judgment must, therefore, be and is, aErmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
