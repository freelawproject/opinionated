Appellant being a man, the complaint against him charged aggravated assault. His wife and the assaulted party both being women, the complaint against her charged simple assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-16\">Both complaints were pending in the County Court at law at the time of this trial. When appellant\u2019s case was called he did not ask that his wife be first tried, but announced ready. When the State rested he tendered his wife as a witness in his behalf; the district attorney objected, she being charged in a separate complaint with being a principal in the offense for which the appellant was then being tried. The court sustained the objection, and all the hills of exception in the record relate to the correctness of the court in so ruling. Appellant contends that article 91 of the Penal Code, and article 791 of the Code of Criminal Procedure only disqualifies those who may be <em>indicted </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>as principals, and does not disqualify those who are only prosecuted by complaint and information. He contends that the word \u201cindictment\u201d has a well defined legal meaning, and does not embrace prosecutions by complaint and information. It is true that the term \u201cindictment\u201d has a technical legal definition which only embraces \u201ca written accusation against one or more persons presented by a grand jury legally convened.\u201d (Bouvier\u2019s Law Die. and cases therein cited.) But our Penal Code provides (article 10) that words not defined in the Code \u201care to be taken and construed in the sense in which they are understood in common language.\u201d In common everyday language any person legally charged and held for trial is understood to be indicted, and when we say one is \u201cheld under indictment\u201d charged with an offense, all that is meant is that there is a legal accusation pending against him in the courts of his country. In the Century Dictionary the word is there defined: \u201cThe act of indicting; accusation; formal charge or statement of grievances; formal complaint before a tribunal.\u201d This is the generally and commonly accepted meaning of the word, and not the technical legal definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">These articles of our Code are of long standing, and it has been the universal rule, so far as we are informed, when two or more persons are charged by complaint and information with being principals in the commission of an offense, they are incompetent as witnesses for each other. Jordan v. State, 89 Texas Crim. App., 595; Davis v. State, 45 Texas Crim. Rep., 183; Sparkman v. State, 61 Texas Crim. Rep., 429; Baldwin v. State, 39 Texas Crim. Rep., 245; Robertson v. State, 63 Texas Crim. Rep., 268; Oliver v. State, 65 Texas Crim. Rep., 150.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-10\">As both complaints were pending in the County Court at Law wtien the objection was made, the court had judicial knowledge of the pend-ency of the complaint against the wife, and there was no error in refusing to permit her to testify in behalf of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-11\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"AoP\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
