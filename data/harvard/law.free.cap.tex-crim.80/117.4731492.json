There is set up in the motion for a new trial the statement that there was newly discovered evidence. There is nothing to support this statement in the way of an affidavit. It is,- therefore, not discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">The only other matter pertains to the sufficiency of the evidence. That for the State is clear and positive that appellant shot .and killed deceased, another Mexican. Appellant\u2019s contention was that deceased was shot by another party. To sustain this he introduced evidence. The jury believed the State\u2019s witnesses, and we would not feel authorized to disturb the finding of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">The 'judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
