Both actions were directed against Buena Vista Cinema,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a motion picture theater situated in the City of Duarte, where, according to the allegations of the complaint, obscene motion pictures were continuously exhibited.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">Case No. C107347 was based upon provisions of a Duarte City Ordinance and a resolution of the City Council adopted pursuant thereto. Case No. Cl07771 was based upon the California Red Tight <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>Abatement Act (Pen. Code, \u00a7 11225 et seq.) and the general public nuisance statutes (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 3479, 3480). In both actions the plaintiff moved for a temporary injunction pending trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">The two cases were duly consolidated. The trial court sustained a demurrer without leave to amend and dismissed case No. C107771. In case No. C107347, the court sustained a demurrer <em>with </em>leave to amend and denied the motion for a preliminary injunction. No order of dismissal was entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Plaintiff noticed an appeal from the judgment of dismissal in case No. Cl07771 and from the order sustaining the demurrer and denying the motion for a preliminary injunction in case No. C107347.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">The judgment of dismissal entered in case No. C107771 is appealable. The order sustaining the demurrer with leave to amend is not appealable, (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 904.1) and although an order denying a preliminary injunction is appealable, such an appeal would not be entertained where as here the underlying cause lacked viability.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">Where actions are consolidated, however, the allegations of the complaints can be treated as one pleading. <em>(Staub </em>v. <em>Muller, </em>7 Cal.2d 221 [60 P.2d 283]; <em>Simpson </em>v. <em>Bergmann, </em>125 Cal.App. 1 [13 P.2d 531].) We consider that plaintiff\u2019s filing of a notice of appeal in case No. C107347 constituted a refusal to amend. Further, in our opinion, as we shall point out, plaintiff was incapable of amending the complaint to plead a cause of action based on the city ordinance. The appropriate procedure would have been to enter a dismissal as to all counts. In order to avoid unnecessary delay we on our own motion amend the judgment of dismissal in case No. C107771 to include a dismissal of case No. C107347. <em>(Mather </em>v. <em>Mather, </em>5 Cal.2d 617 [55 P.2d 1174]; 6 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed.) Appeal, \u00a7 49, pp. 4064, 4065.) We treat this as an appeal from a dismissal as to both cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">The disposition of this case insofar as the causes of action based on the public nuisance statutes and the Red Light Abatement Act are concerned is controlled by <em>People </em>ex rel. <em>Busch </em>v. <em>Projection Room Theater </em><footnotemark>*</footnotemark>(Cal.), filed March 4, 1976. In that case it was held that the exhibition of obscene material could be restrained as a public nuisance under the general public nuisance statutes but that the Red Light Abatement Act did not apply to obscene books or films.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>Thus the trial court here erred in sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend to that cause of action which seeks relief under the public nuisance statutes. (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 3479, 3480.) As to the cause of action seeking to apply the Red Light Abatement Act the demurrer was properly sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">We now turn to the effect of the Duarte city ordinance and city council resolution which were pleaded as another theory of relief in case No. C107347.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Duarte city ordinance No. 369, which was adopted November 12, 1974, (see appendix) purports to declare that the public exhibition of obscene films is a nuisance and creates a procedure whereby the city council can declare the existence of such a nuisance (which perforce includes a determination of the obscene character of the films) and direct the city attorney to undertake abatement proceedings. Resolution No. 74-32 adopted November 26, 1974, specifically found the Buena Vista Theater to be a public nuisance. The city attorney by that resolution was directed \u201cto take all steps necessary to abate such nuisances by the judicial proceedings specified [in the Ordinance].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">As will be discerned from a reading of city ordinance No. 369, it attempts to designate various individuals who shall be deemed liable for the maintenance of the nuisance and it also purports- to specify various forms of relief to be obtained in the abatement proceedings. It appears, although in somewhat different terminology, to restate prevailing law in defining obscenity.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">Plaintiff relies on Government Code section 38771 as authority for its enactment. That statute provides: \u201cBy ordinance the city legislative body may declare what constitutes a nuisance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">Further, Government Code section 38773 provides: \u201cThe legislative body may provide for the summary abatement of any nuisance at the expense of the persons creating, causing, committing, or maintaining it and by ordinance may make the expense of abatement of nuisances a lien against the property on which it is maintained and a personal obligation against the property owner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>Government Code section 38773.5 provides: \u201cThe legislative body may by ordinance establish a procedure for the abatement of a nuisance and make the cost of abatement of a nuisance upon a parcel of land a special assessment against that parcel. The assessment may be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary municipal taxes are collected, and shall be subject to the same penalties and the same procedure and sale in case of delinquency as provided for ordinary municipal taxes. All laws applicable to the levy, collection and enforcement of municipal taxes shall be applicable to such special assessment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">. Of course, the exercise of the powers granted by the foregoing statutes is limited by the constitutional requirement of due process of law. <em>(Leppo </em>v. <em>City of Petaluma, </em>20 Cal.App.3d 711 [97 Cal.Rptr. 840].) The elements of due process in the application of abatement proceedings to restrain the exhibition of films, an activity which presumptively enjoys First Amendment protection, are suggested by language in <em>People </em>ex rel. <em>Busch </em>v. <em>Projection Room Theater, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">The first and foremost requirement is a judicial determination, prior to abatement, of the obscene character of the films under prevailing law. Patently the City Council could not, by ordinance, adopt its own definition of obscenity and even the most formal administrative proceeding to determine the issue of obscenity, under prevailing law, could not suffice as a substitute for a judicial determination. Further, the Council\u2019s Resolution that particular films were obscene would not be binding on the court in any abatement proceedings instituted thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">Neither summary abatement nor temporary injunction is constitutionally permissible as a remedy in this type of abatement proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">\u201c[N]o injunctive relief, whether temporary or permanent in nature, may be afforded until defendant has been given a full and fair judicial hearing on the issue of obscenity, and an opportunity to obtain prompt judicial review of that issue by the state appellate courts.\u201d <em>(People </em>ex rel. <em>Busch </em>v. <em>Projection Room Theater, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em>) </em>Here the trial court quite properly denied plaintiff\u2019s motion for a temporary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">The Supreme Court in <em>Busch </em>did not undertake to detail the specific form of relief which might be available following a court\u2019s determination that the exhibition constituted a nuisance. That decision, however, makes it clear that the <em>court </em>shall fashion the relief that is \u201cproper and suitable\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>for each case. Thus a municipality may not, by ordinance, fashion that relief in advance.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">In sum, a municipality under the authority of Government Code sections 38771, 38773 and 38773.5, may not arrogate unto itself any greater power to abate as a nuisance the exhibition of films and books than is afforded by the state nuisance statutes as interpreted and applied in <em>Busch.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">It was observed in <em>Busch, </em>at page 55, that \u201cOnce a community through its public officials has determined that a particular display of obscene materials amounts to a public nuisance which is injurious to the safety and morals of that community, no valid reason exists why, adequate constitutional procedural safeguards being met, the remedy of civil abatement proceedings must be denied such community.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">The procedure adopted by the City of Duarte in ordinance No. 369 thus may operate as, and only as, a local internal mechanism for determining when the city will institute judicial proceedings to abate a public nuisance. The ordinance, however, does not and cannot itself create a cause of action for the city nor establish the liability of any particular individual nor prescribe any particular form of relief. The cause of action is created and the remedy is prescribed by Civil Code sections 3479, 3480 and 3491.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">The judgment of dismissal as amended in case No. C107347 is affirmed. The judgment of dismissal in case No. C107771 as to the cause of action based on the Red Light Abatement Act (Pen. Code, \u00a7 11225 et seq.) is also affirmed. The judgment of dismissal in case No. C107771 as to the cause of action based o\u00f1 the public nuisance statutes (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 3479, 3480) is reversed and the trial court is directed to enter its order overruling the demurrer to that cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">Roth, P.
