The deceased went <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>into a coma while undergoing surgery on September 27, 1973, and died on October 3, 1973. Dr. Wu was the anesthesiologist. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Dr. Wu, on the ground that Dr. Wu was a county employee and that plaintiffs had failed to comply with \u201cthe Claims Statute.\u201d Plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">Dr. Wu\u2019s declaration in support of the motion for summary judgment established that at the time of his alleged negligent conduct he was a full-time county employee acting in the course and scope of his employment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Plaintiffs presented no evidence in opposition that Dr. Wu was not a full-time county employee or was not acting within the scope of his employment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Dr. Wu\u2019s status as an employee of a public entity having been established by his uncontroverted declaration, plaintiffs were required to show compliance with Government Code section 911.2, requiring that a claim be filed with the county within 100 days.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Otherwise their suit is barred by Government Code sections 950.2<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and 945.4.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>The dispositive issue therefore is whether plaintiffs\u2019 affidavits in opposition to the motion for summaxy judgment created a triable issue of fact (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c) as to plaintiffs\u2019 claim to fall within the exception provided by Government Code section 950.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Government Code section 950.4 provides: \u201cA cause of action against a public employee or former public employee is not barred by Section 950.2 if the plaintiff pleads and proves that he did not know or have reason to know, within the period for the presentation of a claim to the employing public entity as a condition to maintaining an action for such injury against the employing public entity, as that period is prescribed by Section 911.2 or by such other claims procedure as may be applicable, that the injury was caused by an act or omission of the public entity or by an act or omission of an employee of the public entity in the scope of his employment as a public employee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Under this code section, plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action was not barred if plaintiffs did not know or have reason to know, within the 100-day period specified in section 911.2, that Dr. Wu was an employee of a public entity, acting in the scope of his employment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">The factual background as to this issue is as follows: The operation was on September 27, 1973, and decedent died on October 3, 1973. Plaintiffs filed their complaint for damages in the superior court within three weeks, on October 24, 1973. Named as defendants in the complaint were Dr. Wu, another doctor, various Does, and Los Angeles County General Hospital. Despite the fact that Los Angeles County General Hospital was named as a defendant, no claim was ever presented to the county.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">The complaint did not allege that Dr. Wu was a county employee. Dr. Wu was not served with process until July 2, 1974. Dr. Wu answered the complaint on August 7, 1974. His answer stated: \u201cDefendant Louis Wu, M.D., an employee of the County of Los Angeles . . . answers the complaint as follows: [\u00b6]. .. <em>admits </em>[sic] that defendants [sic]... were, at the times mentioned in the complaint, physicians and surgeons licensed to practice and practicing their professions in the County of Los Angeles, State of California, as employees of the County of Los Angeles;...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>Dr. Wu\u2019s motion for summary judgment was filed on May 8, 1975. In opposition to Dr. Wu\u2019s motion, plaintiffs submitted the following declarations: The guardian ad litem declared that he was a retired house painter with an eighth grade education, age 70, who was formerly married to decedent. He declared: \u201cI didn\u2019t know that [Dr. Wu] claimed to be a County employee until he filed his answer about August 7, 1974, and didn\u2019t know that he claimed to be a \u2018full-time County employee\u2019 until after my attorney received his declaration with that statement on or about May 9, 1975, in support of motion. [\u00b6] My attorney had attempted to learn of Dr. Wu\u2019s medical experience and association by serving and filing Interrogatories on him on March 3, 1975. At his request the time for answer thereto was extended to April 24, 1975. No answers were ever filed. Instead, on May 9, 1975 this motion was received.\u201d In a supplemental declaration he declared that \u201c[p]rior [to] filing this action, based upon my experience with doctors I had always understood that they were licensed professionals, not controlled in their work by others, and were independent contractors, often performing medical services at more than one hospital.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">The declaration of plaintiffs\u2019 attorney stated \u201c[t]hat the first time that I became aware that defendant Wu claimed to be a County employee was when Dr. Wu on August 7, 1974, filed an answer to the complaint. He did so by \u2018admitting\u2019 such status, which was not \u00e1lleged in the complaint because until that time I had always understood that, as a licensed physician and surgeon and especially as an anesthesiologist, he was an independent contractor, practicing his profession without the control involved in the \u2018employee\u2019 relationship. It was and is my understanding that the community so regards doctors, even those on hospital staffs. [\u00b6] It has been my experience in many cases involving surgery (including but not limited to myself and wife) that anesthesiologists, (such as Dr. Wu) have submitted bills for their services in their professional capacity, separate from those received from the surgeon and the hospital, hence I did not know or have reason to know that Dr. Wu the anesthesiologist in this case was an employee of the County, and not an independent contractor, practicing his profession.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">The trial court first instructed plaintiffs to file a petition for relief from late filing of claim, pursuant to Government Code section 946.6, in another department of the superior court.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The trial court then denied the motion for summary judgment, but upon reconsideration, granted it.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">We hold that the trial court properly granted summary judgment in favor of Dr. Wu. In order to establish an excuse from compliance with sections 911.2 and 950.2, plaintiffs were required to show that within the 100-day period they \u201cdid not know <em>or have reason to </em>know\u201d that Dr. Wu was a county employee. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 950.4; italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\"><em>Government </em>Code section 950.4, like section 946.6, is a remedial statute intended to provide relief from technical rules which could provide \u201c \u2018a trap for the unwary and ignorant claimant.\u2019 \u201d (See <em>Viles v. State of California, 66 </em>Cal.2d 24, 30-31 [56 Cal.Rptr. 666, 423 P.2d 818].) In providing relief only for the plaintiff who did not know or <em>have reason to know </em>within 100 days that the defendant was an employee of a public entity, section 950.4 requires the exercise of due diligence within that time period by plaintiffs and their attorneys. As stated of section 946.6, \u201cIt is not the purpose of remedial statutes to grant relief from defaults which are the result of inexcusable neglect of parties or their attorneys in the performance of the latter\u2019s obligation to their clients.\u201d <em>(Tammen v. County of San Diego, 66 </em>Cal.2d 468, 478 [58 Cal.Rptr. 249, 426 P.2d 753]; <em>Shaddox v. Melcher, </em>270 Cal.App.2d 598, 601 [76 Cal.Rptr. 80]; <em>Black v. County of Los Angeles, </em>12 Cal.App.3d 670, 675 [91 Cal.Rptr. 104].) In <em>Tammen, Shaddox, </em>and <em>Black, supra, </em>relief under section 946.6 was held properly denied where the lateness of the claim was attributable to the failure of the parties\u2019 attorneys to conduct a reasonably prudent investigation of the circumstances of the accidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">In this case the guardian ad litem properly and diligently placed the matter in the hands of an attorney within three weeks of the mother\u2019s death. Unfortunately, whatever possible claims plaintiffs might have had against the county and the doctors were thereafter lost by the inexcusable neglect of their attorney. Despite the fact that the county hospital was named as a defendant, no claim was ever filed with the county, and it appears that the county was never even served with summons and the complaint. The attorney apparently conducted no investigation, such as simple inquiry to the hospital, to determine whether the doctors might have been county employees. Instead, the attorney chose to rely solely on his understanding or personal experience that a doctor is an independent contractor. The attorney\u2019s failure to make even a minimal inquiry into the matter was not the conduct of a reasonably prudent person nor the type of mistake or neglect for which the statutes afford relief. <em>(Tammen v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number><em>County of San Diego, supra; Shaddox </em>v. <em>Melcher, supra; Black </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles, supra, </em>at pp. 675-677.) Reasonable diligence during the 100 days would have given plaintiffs reason to know of Dr. Wu\u2019s status, and therefore section 950.4 is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Kaus, P. J., and Stephens, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b583-13\">Misspelled \u201cWoo\u201d in the complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b584-5\">Dr. Wu\u2019s declaration stated in part that at all relevant times \u201cI was a full-time County employee. [H] That all professional services rendered by me were done in the course and scope of my employment by the County of Los Angeles as a physician and surgeon. [\u00b6] That I have never seen, met or treated the decedent herein, except in the course and scope of my employment by the County of Los Angeles.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b584-6\">Plaintiffs did argue that Dr. Wu\u2019s declaration was defective in that his allegations of employment and acting within the scope of employment were mere conclusions. This contention was erroneous. (See <em>Vesely </em>v. <em>Sager, 5 </em>Cal.3d 153, 169 [95 Cal.Rptr. 623, 486 P.2d 151].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b584-7\">Government Code section 911.2 provides: \u201cA claim relating to a cause of action for death or for injury to person or to personal property or growing crops shall be presented as provided in Article 2 (commencing with Section 915) of this chapter not later than the 100th day after the accrual of the cause of action.
