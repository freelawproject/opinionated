Code, \u00a7 32) to the murder. Apparently by agreement, the minor was adjudged free from the custody and control of her mother, and the action continued against her father. Following an appropriate trial the superior court adjudged that: \u201cMichele ... a minor person, is hereby declared and adjudged to be free from the parental custody and control of her father,...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">The father (hereafter \u201cappellant\u201d) alone has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">Uncontroverted evidence established the facts which we shall now relate.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">The mother of Michele had two children of a prior marriage, Kenneth, aged five, and Kelly, aged two and a half. Following her marriage to appellant he had \u201cengaged in unreasonably and unnecessarily cruel and brutal treatment of Kelly . . . and Kenneth ... in that [he] severely beat these children with his belt and with his hands and fists so as to raise severe bruises and welts on the bodies of these children; on numerous occasions he caused each of these children to stand in a comer for long periods of time, sometimes several hours in duration; on occasion he caused each of these children to sleep without bedding on the bare floor, in some instances for periods in excess of one night; and he subjected these children to showers under cold tap water, sometimes lasting as long as 20 or 30 minutes in duration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">In his briefs on this appeal appellant\u2019s attorney describes appellant\u2019s and Michele\u2019s mother\u2019s conduct during that period in this manner. \u201cThere were regular beatings which resulted in much braising, standing in the corner for excessive periods and sleeping on the floor without bedding. ... These two people were uncontrollably embarked on a tragic course of conduct which is known as the \u2018battered child syndrome.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b728-9\">There came a time, after about eight months of the marriage, when Kelly threw some food at the dinner table. We continue with appellant\u2019s description of the events which followed. \u201cI reached over and I smacked Kelly right in the face. I mean, just like that. . . . Then about, I guess <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>about 10:00 o\u2019clock ... I went in the bedroom where the children sleep and found that Kelly had wet the bed. Well, I became angry with Kelly, literally grabbed her out of the bed, stood her on her feet and more or less pushed her towards going to the bathroom and after that she went to the bathroom and I was right behind her. I told [her mother] to come in there, and she did. She took her off her diaper and I told her, I said, \u2018Put her in the shower.\u2019 She did, and both of us left the room, left Kelly in the shower. . . . [Her mother] went back in the kitchen. Then a short a [j/c] while I went back in to check on Kelly and found that when I went in there Kelly had defecated in the shower. Well, this made me even angrier with her, so angiy, in fact, that I commenced spanking her with my bare hands pretty hard. . . . [T]his went over a period of about\u2014I don\u2019t know, two to four minutes perhaps. I just completely lost control of myself. I was furious with her, just furious. I yelled out to [her mother]... to come in there. ... I took her out of the shower myself. I lifted her up out of the tub and laid her on this shag carpeting in the bathroom there .... She was crying when I took her out of the tub, crying when [her mother] was in there diying her off. Well, then she started screaming.... Evidently Kelly had continued to defecate on the floor while [her mother] was trying to diy her off and put a clean diaper on her.. .. And just as I started to say, just as I got to the entrance to the bathroom after this screaming was started and [her mother] was yelling at Kelly also, but I don\u2019t remember exactly what the words were, she had ahold of her by the shoulders, both hands on her shoulders and was shaking her vigorously like this, up, you know, and she was doing this, Kelly\u2019s head was hitting the back of\u2014was hitting back down on the rug. . . . Already the bruises had appeared on her where I had struck her and, well, where [her mother] had struck her too. . . . [Sometime later as] I walked by I noticed Kelly here on the floor with [her mother] in the bathroom there. I looked down at Kelly and I said, \u2018. . . what\u2019s the matter with Kelly?\u2019 because I immediately took note of the fact that she was laying there in a state that appeared to be comatose and not breathing and her eyes were open and not moving and around.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">Kelly was dead. Her death \u201coccurred as a result of injuries sustained by her in a beating or beatings .. . which resulted in left basilar (petrous bone) skull fracture with sub-dural hemorrhage, sub-arachnoid hemorrhage and softening of left cerebral hemisphere white matter and further resulted in multi-body bruises and retroperitoneal hemorrhages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">Continuing appellant\u2019s narrative: \u201cHere\u2019s Kelly all bruised up, obviously dead, and I was quite panicky. We talked about\u2014we can\u2019t call <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>anybody. We can\u2019t call the fire department. We can\u2019t call the police, can\u2019t call anybody because obviously one or both of us would be arrested for this and charged.\u201d The couple then placed Kelly\u2019s body under a bridge where it was found a few days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">Twenty-two days after Kelly\u2019s death her half sister and appellant\u2019s daughter, Michele, was bom.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">The judgment declaring Michele to be free from the custody and control of appellant was based upon Civil Code section 232, subdivision (a)(4), which provides, as relevant to the appeal, as follows: \u201c(a) An action may be brought for the purpose of having any person under the age of 18 years declared free from the custody and control of either or both of his parents when such person comes within any of the following descriptions:... (4) Whose parent or parents are convicted of a felony, if the felony of which such parent or parents were convicted is of such nature as to prove the unfitness of such parent or parents to have the future custody and control of the child,...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">No complaint is made that the trial\u2019s evidence, or the trial court\u2019s findings of fact, were insufficient to support the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">Instead, appellant contends that the judgment must fall because Civil Code section 232, subdivision (a)(4), is unconstitutional. His supporting argument is stated as: \u201cSection 232 (a)(4) permits the state to terminate a parent\u2019s legal relationship with his child solely because of a criminal conviction. The sole criteria for such a determination is the prior felony conviction and its nature. There is no requirement that the court concern itself with the current parent-child relationship or the <em>present </em>fitness of the parent. Such a conclusive, statutory presumption is unconstitutional. 99</p>\n<p id=\"b730-9\">Civil Code section 232, subdivision (a)(4), must be read and harmonized with another section of the Civil Code. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Zankich, </em>20 Cal.App.3d 971, 980 [98 Cal.Rptr. 387]; <em>Channel v. Superior Court, </em>226 Cal.App.2d 246, 252 [38 Cal.Rptr. 13].) The other section is numbered 4600, and it states: \u201cIn any proceeding where there is at issue the custody of a minor child, the court may, during the pendency of the proceeding or at any time thereafter, make such order for the custody of such child during his minority as may seem necessaiy or proper. ...(c)... Before the court makes any order awarding custody to a person or persons other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>than a parent, without the consent of the parents, it shall make a finding that an award of custody to a parent would be detrimental to the child and the award to a nonparent is required to serve the best interests of the child... .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">Read together the two statutes require that the trial court find, not only the commission of such a felony as is described in Civil Code section 232, subdivision (a)(4), but also that an award of custody to the felonious parent \u201cwould be detrimental to the child and the award to a nonparent is required to serve the best interests of the child.\u201d  It thus appears that, contrary to appellant\u2019s contention, the relevant statutes do concern themselves with \u201cthe current parent-child relationship or the <em>present </em>fitness of the parent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">Further, we note that the superior court made conclusions of law, which we treat as findings of fact (see 4 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1971) Trial, \u00a7 323(a)(1), p. 3127), as follows: \u201cMichele is a person whose father is convicted of a felony which is of such a nature as to prove his unfitness to have the future custody and control of Michele.... [\u00b6] It is in the best interest and welfare of Michele that she be declared free from the custody and control of [her father]. ... [\u00b6] It would be detrimental to Michele to be placed in the custody of [her father] now or in the future.\u201d These findings, in faithful compliance with Civil Code sections 232, subdivision (a)(4), and 4600, were, as pointed out, well supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">The remaining contention of appellant is also found to be invalid. He argues that, contrary to <em>Boykin </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>395 U.S. 238 [23 L.Ed.2d 274, 89 S.Ct. 1709], and <em>In re </em>Tahl, 1 Cal.3d 122 [81 Cal.Rptr. 577, 460 P.2d 449] (cert.den., 398 U.S. 911 [26 L.Ed.2d 72, 90 S.Ct. 1708]), another judge of the superior court had failed to advise him that upon his plea of guilty to Kelly\u2019s murder, he would necessarily lose the right to Michele\u2019s custody. As we have pointed out, the loss of Michele\u2019s custody did not necessarily follow from Kelly\u2019s murder; it depended upon future judicial determination. And further: \u201cThe law is clear that [under <em>Boykin </em>v. Alabama] a valid plea of guilty requires that the defendant be made aware of all \u2018the direct consequences of his plea.\u2019... By the same token, it is equally well settled that, before pleading, the defendant need not be advised of all collateral consequences of his plea, or, as one Court has phrased it, of all \u2018possible ancillary or consequential results which are peculiar to the individual and which may flow from a conviction of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>plea of guilty, <em>(Cuthrell </em>v. <em>Director, Patuxent Institution </em>(4th Cir. 1973) 475 F.2d 1364, 1365-1366 [cert.den., 414 U.S. 1005 (38 L.Ed.2d 241, 94 S.Ct. 362)]; see also <em>Wade </em>v. <em>Coiner </em>(4th Cir. 1972) 468 F.2d 1059, 1060; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sambro </em>(1971) 454 F.2d 918, 920 [147 App.D.C. 75]; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ready </em>(4th Cir. 1972) 460 F.2d 1238, 1239; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>United States </em>(9th Cir. 1972) 460 F.2d 1203, 1204 [cert. den., 409 U.S. 873 (34 L.Ed.2d 125, 93 S.Ct. 206)]; <em>Tindall </em>v. <em>United States </em>(5th Cir. 1972) 469 F.2d 92.) Appellant\u2019s loss of Michele\u2019s custody was but a \u201cpossible ancillary or consequential\u201d result of his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">Molinari, P. J., and Sims, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">A petition for a rehearing was denied January 11, 1977, and appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied February 11, 1977.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
