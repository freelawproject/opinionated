J.</author>\n<p id=\"ALg\">Plaintiffs appeal from an order dismissing their second amended complaint (hereinafter complaint) after an order sustaining a demurrer without leave to amend that complaint. For the reasons set forth, we affirm the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-9\">The complaint alleges, so far as is here pertinent, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-10\">\u201cXIII</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-11\">\u201cOn or about August 31, 1973, plaintiffs and defendants entered into a written agreement wherein plaintiffs were to purchase and defendants were to sell, all those certain assets of a men\u2019s clothing store known as Big &amp; Tall Men\u2019s Fashions, Inc. A copy of said agreement is attached hereto, marked Exhibit \u2018A\u2019 and incorporated herein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-12\">\u201cXIV</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-13\">\u201cAs part of the consideration for the transfer of said assets from defendants to plaintiffs, plaintiffs executed a purported note in favor of defendants in the principal amount of $227,513.00. A copy of said purported note is attached hereto marked Exhibit \u2018B\u2019 and incorporated herein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-14\">\u201cXV</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-15\">\u201cUnder the provisions of said note, plaintiffs were to pay monthly installments of $1,896.00 on principal plus interest at the rate of twenty (20%) per cent per annum.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b756-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>The complaint then alleges payments (including interest at the 20 percent rate) and seeks recovery (by credit on the principal) of those payments with treble damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">From the record it appears that defendants were, and are, duly licensed as personal property brokers under the provisions of the Personal Property Brokers Law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The ruling on the demurrer necessarily took into account that fact appearing in plaintiffs\u2019 complaint. We consider the issues raised in this appeal from the same standpoint.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">In spite of plaintiffs\u2019 attempt to characterize the transaction as a \u201cloan\u201d within the meaning of article XX, section 22, of the California Constitution, it was, as plaintiffs\u2019 complaint shows, a sale and not a loan. The distinction between the two kinds of transaction was described by the Supreme Court in <em>Milana </em>v. <em>Credit Discount Co. </em>(1945) 27 Cal.2d 335, at page 339 [163 P.2d 869, 165 A.L.R. 621], as follows: \u201cA sale is the transfer of the property in a thing for a price in money. The transfer of the property in the thing sold for a price is the essence of the transaction. The transfer is that of the general or absolute interest in property as distinguished from a special property interest. A loan, on the other hand, is the deliveiy of a sum of money to another under a contract to return at some future time an equivalent amount with or without an additional sum agreed upon for its use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">That language is here appropriate. Defendants owned a men\u2019s clothing store; they sold it to plaintiffs for a total price of $333,885 plus 50 percent of the net profits of the business for four months. Part of the purchase price was paid in cash, part was paid by the assumption of certain unpaid obligations of the business, and part by the promissory note herein involved.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Nothing in the complaint indicates that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>transaction was anything other than a legitimate sale of a going business. As such, the usury laws do not apply. <em>(Verbeck </em>v. <em>Clymer </em>(1927) 202 Cal. 557, 563 [261 P. 1017]; 1 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (8th ed. 1973) Contracts, \u00a7 388, pp. 324-325.)</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">Even assuming, as defendants do, for the purpose of argument that the giving and receiving of the promissory note was a loan, the transaction was exempt under the express terms of section 22 of article XX of the California Constitution<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and section 22053 of the California <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>Financial Code.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The face amount of the note exceeded the $10,000 minimum set forth in section 22053. Even prior to the 1970 amendment of section 22053, that section required only that the amount of the loan be \u201cbona fide\u201d; <em>(West Pico Furniture Co. </em>v. <em>Pacific Finance Loans </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 594 [86 Cal.Rptr. 793, 469 P.2d 665]). It is nowhere here contended that the face of the note in question had been inflated by any device to make that amount appear to be greater than the actual unpaid purchase price. Under those circumstances, the constitutional and statutoiy exemption from the usuiy laws applied to the transaction hereinbefore us.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">Since plaintiffs do not suggest the possibility of any amendment that could cure the defects in its case above set forth, we do not, and need <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>not, reach the question of whether the stipulation for judgment upon which the order of dismissal was based bars them from seeking from us leave to amend further.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">The judgment (order of dismissal) is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">Dunn, J., and Jefferson (Bernard), J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b756-8\">Sections 22000 through 22010 of the Financial Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b756-9\">We set forth the terms of sale:</p>\n<p id=\"b756-10\">\u201cB.
