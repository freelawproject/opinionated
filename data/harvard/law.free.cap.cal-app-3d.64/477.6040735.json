J.</author>\n<p id=\"A2g\">Plaintiff Michael Heniy Forde appeals from a summaiy judgment in favor of defendant County of Los Angeles and 11 individual defendants\u2014physicians and a nurse employed by the County.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-10\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b422-11\">The undisputed facts are based on the statement appearing in plaintiff\u2019s opening brief. Plaintiff was admitted to Los Angeles County Hospital on August 29, 1971, suffering an acute psychotic reaction. The admitting doctor, a defendant, decided that plaintiff was a danger to himself and others and that he was gravely disabled and possibly suicidal. Plaintiff was examined the next morning by a staff psychiatrist, another defendant, who noted defendant\u2019s psychotic reaction. This psychiatrist later transferred plaintiff from the closed ward to which he was first admitted to an open ward where doors were usually kept unlocked. At this point, plaintiff\u2019s commitment, originally involuntary, became voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>On September 6, 1971, plaintiff was still a patient at county hospital. That day, Labor Day, plaintiff was permitted to go to a dance for the patients. At 11:40 a.m., it was noted that plaintiff had disappeared from the dance. A nurse, another defendant, reported to the nursing office that a patient had \u201celoped,\" called the security guard and described plaintiff. She notified a psychiatric resident, another defendant, who gave instructions that plaintiff was to be given an extended pass until the next morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">Within a few hours after \u201celoping,\" plaintiff jumped off the Macy Street bridge, suffering the injuries which gave rise to this lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">Discussion<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">The trial court properly concluded that defendant county and the individual defendants were immune under Government Code, section 856.2, subdivision (a), which provides as relevant: \u201cNeither a public entity nor a public employee is liable for: ... (2) An injury to, or the wrongful death of an escaping or escaped person who has been confined for mental illness or addiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">Plaintiff\u2019s contentions that this section does not apply are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">First, plaintiff contends that section 856.2 does not apply because he was a voluntary patient and therefore could not \u201cescape.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">Section 856.2, as originally enacted, was \u201ccarefully drafted to confine the immunity within narrow boundaries,\u201d and applied only to persons who were involuntarily confined. (Van Alstyne, Cal. Government Tort Liability (Cont. Ed. Bar 1964) \u00a7 7.49, p. 334.) In 1970, the statute was amended, inter alia, to substitute the word \u201cconfined,\u201d for the word, \u201ccommitted.\" \u201cThe substitution of \u2018confined\u2019 for \u2018committed\u2019 makes clear that the immunity covers all persons who are confined for mental illness or addiction, whether or not they are \u2018committed.\u2019 \u201d (Law Rev. Com. comment\u20141970 amendment.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, contrary to plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>tiff\u2019s contention, the immunity conferred by section 856.2 applies whether the mental patient is voluntarily or involuntarily confined.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">Plaintiff makes much of the fact that hospital personnel described plaintiff\u2019s conduct as an \u201celopement.\u201d Defendants\u2019 euphemism does not alter or affect what plaintiff indisputably did. He left the hospital without authorization or without officially signing himself out as a patient. (See Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 6005.)</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Plaintiff also points out that after his absence was noted, a resident ordered that he be given extended leave. That plaintiff\u2019s departure was ratified or covered up does not change the undisputed fact that when he left, he was not authorized to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">Second, plaintiff contends that reliance on the \u201cescape immunity here would be absurd,\u201d because if plaintiff had attempted suicide by slashing his wrist while at the hospital, there would be no immunity: hence there should be none if he decided to throw himself off a bridge, a method which necessitated a preceding escape.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">Leaving aside the question whether there would be liability in plaintiff\u2019s hypothetical case, any \u201cabsurdity\u201d is a matter for the Legislature which obviously considered a patient within the confines of a hospital more controllable than one who had left it.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">Third, plaintiff contends that, at least as to defendant county, he could establish liability under section 855 relating to the failure of the hospital to provide such equipment, personnel or facilities as are mandated by applicable statutes or regulations. Plaintiff, however, does not explain how a theory of liability based on section 855 would avoid the specific immunity of section 856.2. (See <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>State of California, </em>11 Cal.3d 469, 471 [113 Cal.Rptr. 599, 521 P.2d 855]; <em>County of Sacramento </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>8 Cal.3d 479, 485 [105 Cal.Rptr. 374, 503 P.2d 1382].) That the immunity of section 856.2 prevails over the liability created by section 855 was noted in Van Alstyne, California Government Tort Liability (Cont.Ed.Bar 1964) page 649.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">Fourth, plaintiff\u2019s contention that he falls within the exception to immunity under section 856.2, subdivision (b), is without merit. Subdivision (b) provides that nothing in subdivision (a) \u201cexonerates\u201d a public employee from liability for \u201cinjuries inflicted as a result of his own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>negligent or wrongful act or omission on an escaping or escaped mental patient in recapturing him.\u201d There is no evidence that defendants recaptured plaintiff. His suggestion that section 856.2, subdivision (b)(2), applies to negligence in failing to try to recapture an escaped patient \u2014rather than to negligence resulting in injuries inflicted in the process of recapturing the patient\u2014would, of course, negate the immunity conferred in subdivision (a). (See <em>Bettencourt </em>v. <em>State of California, </em>51 Cal.App.3d 892, 894-895 [124 Cal.Rptr. 542].)</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">Finally, plaintiff points to trial counsel\u2019s opposition to the motion for summary judgment, which was, in the main, a collage, of parts of depositions showing quite persuasively that it was professional malpractice which resulted in lack of such restraints as would have made his escape impossible; further, plaintiff assures us that further discovery would generate even more evidence of malpractice. That approach, however, merely obscures the issue. Before discussing any immunity, one assumes as a matter of course that there is a basis for liability to which the immunity is relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment was properly granted. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Ashby, J., and Hastings, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">A petition for a rehearing was denied December 20, 1976, and appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied January 27, 1977.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b423-10\"> Plaintiff raises several procedural fringe issues, relating to the timing of defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, the adequacy of the supporting declaration, the propriety of the court\u2019s reconsideration of an initial denial of the motion and defendants\u2019 failure to plead immunity. These matters are more than adequately refuted in defendants\u2019 brief and do not justify detailed discussion in an opinion certified for publication.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b423-11\">Concurrently, the Legislature added section 854.5 which defined the word \u201cconfine\u201d to include \u201cadmit, commit, place, detain, or hold in custody.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
