From Pitts these shares came by various sales to the plaintiff. After the sale to Pitts, and before the defendants\u2019 or their treasurer had any notice of that sale, the shares were attached on mesne process against Odiorne as his property, and sold on execution issued on the judgment obtained in that action to Henry Cormerais, the defendants\u2019 president, and a new certificate delivered to Cormerais. After this the plaintiff, claiming under the sale to Pitts, for the first time notified the defendants of his claim, and offered to surrender the original certificate, and demanded a new certificate in his own name, which the defendants refused to issue, insisting that Cormerais was the owner of the shares.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b222-5\">The defendants\u2019 by-laws provide that \u201c stock may be transferred by an assignment on the back of the certificate and notice of the same to the treasurer, and the party to whom it is transferred shall be entitled to a new certificate for the same number of shares by surrendering the old certificate to the treasurer.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b222-6\"><em>J.

The twelfth section of the Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>38, as modified by <em>St. </em>1846, <em>c. </em>45, provides that \u201c any shares in manufacturing corporations may be transferred by the proprietor thereof, by an instrument in writing, under his hand, recorded by the clerk of the corporation in a book to be kept for that purpose; and the purchaser named in such instrument so recorded shall, on producing the same to the treasurer, and delivering to him the former certificate, be entitled to a new certificate.\u201d But the facts agreed in this case show that the plaintiff and those under whom he claims never gave the corporation any notice of the transfer to them, nor made any request to have it recorded, nor asked for a new certificate, until after the shares had been taken and sold on execution as the property of Odi\u00f3me, in whose name they stood on the books of the corporation. At the time of the seizure and sale the assignment and transfer had not been completed so as to be effectual against the creditors of the assignor. <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>Essex Bank, </em>5 Gray, 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendants.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
