This is the effect of charging it with the payment of legacies and annuities, there being no words limiting the estate to him for life. 2 Jarman on Wills, (3d Amer. ed.) 171, 172. <em>Parker </em>v.

The directions that he should be exempted from giving bond for the performance of his trusts, \u201c and without being accountable in any way or manner to any person or persons whomsoever for any thing or matter belonging to or concerning the premises, other than paying the annuities and legacies aforesaid; \u201d and that on his death, \u201c whatever should be left of the estate \u201d should go to the nieces and their children; show an intention to give him the absolute beneficial interest in the property. And the Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>62, \u00a7 4, declare that a devise shall convey all the testator\u2019s estate in the land unless it clearly appears that he intended to give a less estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b15-5\">The gift over to the nieces is void, as inconsistent with the absolute estate given to Joseph Rowe. 1 Jarman on Wills, 793. <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>Fitzg. 314. <em>Bull </em>v. <em>Kingston, </em>1 Meriv. 314. <em>Ide </em>v. <em>Ide, </em>5 Mass. 500. <em>Burbank </em>v. <em>Whitney, </em>24 Pick. 155. <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Knapp, </em>21 Pick. 412. <em>Ramsdell </em>v. <em>Ramsdell, </em>21 Maine, 288. <em>Pickering </em>v. <em>Langdon, </em>22 Maine, 413. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Bull, </em>10 Johns. 19. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Delaney, </em>13 Johns. 537. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Robins, </em>15 Johns. 169, and 16 Johns. 537. On ais death the property vested, in equal shares, in his three nieces, as his heirs and next of kin, subject to the legacies and annuities, which have all been paid.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b15-6\">Joseph Rowe\u2019s will, being in similar words, must be construed in the same manner; and as a fee in the land and an absolute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>estate in the personal property given to Mary Rowe are inconsistent with the subsequent limitation in favor of the nieces and their children, the three nieces must take the property as his heirs and next of kin, the bequest to his sister having lapsed by her death. The case of <em>Burbank </em>v. Whitney, 34 Pick. .146, which may appear to conflict with this view, was decided according to what was supposed to be the testator\u2019s intention, that certain charitable institutions should have his property. But here the testator did not wish the nieces and children to take at all events, but gave his sister power to meet any requirements of changes in the family, and gave them only what she might not choose to dispose of. The cases on this subject do not turn merely on the absolute power of disposition given to the first legatee, but on the uncertainty of the gift intended by the limitation over. <em>Wynne </em>v. <em>Hawkins, 1 </em>Bro. C. C. 179. <em>Sprange </em>v. <em>Barnard, 2 </em>Bro. C. C. 585. <em>Bull </em>v. <em>Kingston, </em>1 Meriv. 314. <em>Eade </em>v. <em>Eade, </em>5 Madd. 118.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b16-5\">If however the limitation over in Joseph\u2019s will, to the nieces and their children, took effect, in consequence of Mary\u2019s dying before him, the property which passed under it was only the share of real estate in Boston, which he had at the date of the will, and did not include what he acquired under his sister\u2019s will at her death. And the gift of personal property is a specific legacy, evidently based on the condition of the testator\u2019s property at the time of making the will. 1 Roper on Leg. (3d ed.) 179. <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>1 Keen, 97. <em>Cockran </em>v. <em>Cockran, </em>14 Sim. 248. <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Little, 2 </em>Beav. 259. The case may be referred to a master to ascertain how much of the stock, notes and mortgages held by him at that date belonged to him at thl date of the will. If any stock owned at the date of the will was sold, or any mortgage debt paid off, the legacy, being specific, to that extent was adeemed. 1 Roper on Leg. 287-300. <em>Richards </em>v. <em>Humphreys, </em>15 Pick. 135. <em>Ballard </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>5 Pick. 112. <em>Pattison </em>v. <em>Pattison, </em>1 Myl. &amp; K. 12. <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>Hatton, </em>6 Sim. 93. <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>1 Keen, 97. <em>A fortiori, </em>the language of Joseph\u2019s bequest does not extend to personal property of Mary Rowe still standing in the name of her estate and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>attachable as a part thereof. 2 Williams on Executors, (4th Amer. ed.) 1175 <em>Sf seq. Churchill </em>v. <em>Bank of England, </em>11 M. &amp; W. 323. Nor could he, in making his sister principal legatee, have in view property which might come to him on her death.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQ\">The effect of Joseph\u2019s will was to divide the real and personal property intended to be given by it into three shares, corresponding with the number of nieces, but the third part of each niece having a child or children living at the death of Mary Rowe, to be equally divided between her and her children. This is the most natural division. To make the nieces and their children all share equally in the first instance, would give Mrs. White only one sixth, Mrs. Pay son and her child one third, and Mrs. Webster and her two children one half, or three times as much as Mrs. White; if the children had all died under age and unmarried, the still more unjust result would have followed of giving Mrs. White one sixth, Mrs. Payson one third, and Mrs. Webster one half; and if more children had been born and died under age and unmarried, the disproportion might have been much greater. The will provides that \u201c each child is to have a part equal with the mother,\u201d not equal with the nieces, or equal with a niece ; and that \u201c the children of each of my said nieces shall in. all cases share alike with their respective mothers,\u201d not with all the nieces, not with all the mothers, but each child equally with its own mother, showing that one mother may have more than another, in consequence of having fewer children to share with her. On the death of any child under ago and unmarried, the share is to be divided between the child\u2019s mother and her remaining children; a fair provision if the child had a share of the mother\u2019s third, but most unequal if all the children take equal shares with the nieces; for, to maintain such a plan of division, all the surviving nieces and all the children ought to take together when any one of the children or nieces dies. <em>Rowland </em>v. <em>Gorsuch, 2 </em>Cox Ch. 187. <em>Collier </em>v. <em>Collier, </em>3 Rich. Eq. 555.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b17-6\">Mrs. White\u2019s interest is a fee simple in the real estate, and an absolute interest in the personal estate, liable in no contingency to be reduced to a life estate. It is only the estates of the chil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>dren who die under age and unmarried, and of the mothers who die childless in consequence of their children having all so died, that are reduced to life interests by the executory bequests over. But Mrs. White is not a mother, and cannot die childless within the meaning of the will; that is, by having a child born before Mary Rowe\u2019s death, and that child dying before her. Joseph R. Webster having become of age, his mother cannot die childess within the meaning of the will; and the provision that \u201c upon the decease of all my nieces and their respective children within age and unmarried, their proportions will then go to their legal representatives entitled to the same,\u201d becomes inoperative, because Joseph R. Webster being of age, the contingency can never arrive. If the contingency could take place, it would be equally nugatory, for it merely declares that property will descend to collateral heirs according to law; which would only show a fee in the nieces; and the collateral heirs would not take by purchase, but by descent. <em>Whitney </em>v. <em>Whitney, </em>14 Mass. 88, <em>Whittell </em>v. <em>Dudin, 2 </em>Jac. &amp; Walk. 279.

Webster.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ax\">The will of Mary Rowe gave Joseph an estate for life only, and the subsequent devise to the nieces and their children takes effect as a strict remainder in respect to the real estate and a <em>quasi </em>remainder in respect to the personal estate. The devise to Joseph contains no words of limitation. None of the trusts on which the property was given to him were to continue beyond his life. The beneficial devise to him, subject to the trusts, was only of the use, income and profits during his life, and gave him no right to the capital. Lord Coke in <em>Blamford </em>v. <em>Blamford, </em>3 Bulstr. 101. Co. Lit. 4 <em>b. Paramour </em>v. <em>Yardley, </em>Plow. 541 <em>b. Parker </em>v. <em>Plummer, </em>Cro.

This is not like an absolute gift of property, real or personal, in trust to pay the income and profits to some other person. Nor are the words \u201c income and profits \u201d used as representing the capital from which they are to be derived, as in cases of gifts of dividends of stocks in the English funds, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>are held to pass an absolute interest, upon the ground that such stocks consist merely of perpetual annuities. <em>Rawlings </em>v. <em>Jennings, </em>13 Ves. 39. <em>Stretch </em>v. <em>Watkins, </em>1 Madd. 253. <em>Page </em>v. <em>Leapingwell, </em>18 Ves. 463. <em>Haig </em>v. <em>Swiney, 1 </em>Sim. &amp; Stu. 487, <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Maddison, </em>2 Y. &amp; Col. Ch. 372.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b19-5\">The powers subsequently conferred upon Joseph Rowe do not in any respect increase his interest. The words \u201c and for this ample and beneficial end,\u201d clearly show that the sole object of the testatrix was to give full effect to the preceding provisions ; and the powers themselves are simply of sale, exchange and partition, in respect to the real estate, and of changing, altering or varying the securities, in respect to the personal estate; such as are constantly conferred upon tenants for life and trustees in all wills and settlements ; and the words \u201c at any time and at all times he may see fit, and for any and all purposes he may choose,\u201d were inserted to show that the powers conferred were to be absolute and unconditional. 2 Sugd. Pow. 480, 497. Chance on Powers, <em>\u00a7 </em>2417. Hill on Trustees, (3d Amer. ed.) 471, 482. <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>6 Sim. 136. <em>Sampayo </em>v. <em>Gould, </em>12 Sim. 426. All the powers conferred are special , and limited, and not general; and all point to a conveyance <em>inter vivas </em>for a valuable consideration. A power to dispose by will or by gift <em>inter vivas </em>is not included. The words \u201c or otherwise dispose \u201d immediately follow the words \u201c sell, exchange, alter,\u201d and are to be construed as <em>ejusdem generis. Hoe </em>v. <em>Glover, </em>1 C. B. 459, 460. The power to make partition of real estate, which the testatrix owned in common with her brother alone, would be absurd if he were to become sole owner of the estate in question upon her death. The words \u201c all and singular the trusts before mentioned,\u201d in the clause directing that no bond or obligation should be required of her brother, show that the trust for the payment of legacies and annuities was not the only one intended to be created ; and indicate that he is to exercise others for those entitled in remainder.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b19-8\">The words \u201cand without being accountable in any way or manner to any person or persons whomsoever for any thing or matter belonging to or concerning the premises, other than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>paying the legacies and annuities aforesaid,\u201d only exempt him from giving security to those interested as legatees, annuitants or in remainder, and protect him from interference in management of the property do not enlarge his estate or exempt him from liability for bis own wilful acts. 1 Story on Eq. \u00a7\u00a7 603, 604. <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Burnell, </em>1 Bro.

The only way of avoiding this conclusion is by striking out of the will the gift over to the nieces and their children. But the court will not adopt such a construction, when a construction may be adopted which is rational and legal, and which will give full effect to every part of the will. 1 Sugd.

Under Joseph\u2019s will the nieces and their children are entitled to all the real estate in Boston, and other property therein specified, of which the testator was seised or possessed at the time of his death ; and therefore, assuming the gift to them in the will of Mary Rowe to be void, yet they are entitled to the property therein specified, under the will of Joseph, including all alterations and additions. <em>Dean Chapter of Christ Church </em>v. <em>Barlow, </em>Ambl. 641. <em>Gayre </em>v. <em>Gayre, 2 </em>Vern. 538. <em>All Souls' College </em>v. <em>Coddrington, </em>1 P.

It is not sufficient that the devisees are designated by classes; nor that they stand in such a relation to the testator and to each other, as to render a different intention probable; nor that the will shows an intention that all the devisees shall not take equally, unless it clearly points out in what other mode they shall take. <em>Bladder </em>v. <em>Webb, 2 </em>P.

(Del.) <em>103. </em>This construction is put beyond doubt by the words \u201c to be equally divided among them, share and share alike,\u201d in which \u201c them \u201d must refer to both nieces and children as -individuals, and not\u2019 to classes; or, if to classes, then to the nieces as constituting one class, and the children as constituting another. The words \u201ceach child to have a part\u201d were inserted to express more clearly that the distribution was to be <em>per capita, </em>and to guard against any supposed analogy to the statute of distributions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b22-5\">The shares of Mrs. White and Mrs. Payson depend upon the cortingency of their having children to attain the age of twenty one years or marriage. By the words <em>\u201c </em>upon the death of any mother childless,\u201d the testators intended to provide for the deaths of the nieces whenever they might happen, and not for deaths happening during the lives of the testators.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b22-6\">The personal property specified consists not of chattels, the possession and enjoyment of which are inseparable, but of money and bank stock, which can only be enjoyed by receiving the interest and dividends. The shares of Mrs. White and Mrs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>Payson, while they remain contingent, must therefore be retained by the administrator, and the income only paid to them. <em>Saunderson </em>v.

Mrs. Payson\u2019s share is contingent, subject to be defeated in case she should die before her daughter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>comes of age or is married. The shares of the minor daughters of Mrs. Webster and Mrs. Payson are contingent and defeasi ble in the event of their dying within age or unmarried. Mrs. White\u2019s share is contingent, liable to be devested and go to her sisters in case she should die childless.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">But Mrs. White and Mrs. Payson, who are entitled to shares contingent and liable to be defeated, in case of their dying without children, in favor of the gift over to the other nieces, are to have their shares respectively without security being required, subject however to the contingencies expressed in the will; and the shares of Miss Webster and Miss Payson are likewise to be paid to them immediately through their duly constituted guardians ; and upon the death of the last of the nieces the property will then go to legal representatives according to the terms of the will. <em>Decree accordingly.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
