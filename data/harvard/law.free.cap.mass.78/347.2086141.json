Whipple <em>vs. </em>Robert Rogerson.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b355-6\">An answer in abatement cannot be filed after an affidavit that the defendant has a substantial defence to the action, and intends to bring the same to trial, although the affidavit omits the usual words \u201c on the merits.\u201d</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b355-7\">Action of contract brought in the superior court of the county of Suffolk. Within the tithe fixed by statute for filing an affidavit of merits, the defendant filed the following affidavit: \u201c I verily believe that I have a substantial defence to the above entitled action, and intend to bring the same to trial.\u201d The answer afterwards filed alleged that the plaintiff was a married woman, and therefore not entitled to maintain said action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b355-8\">At the trial, Huntington, J. ruled that the defence of coverture was not open to the defendant, after the filing of the above affidavit; and he alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b355-9\"><em>E. F. </em>Head, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A5nT\">The words \u201c on the merits \u201d being omitted in the affidavit, there was no inconsistency between it and the answer. The plaintiff\u2019s coverture does not appear in the writ, and it does not appear that the defendant did not plead it as soon as he was aware of the fact.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b355-10\"><em>G. </em>Griggs, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b355-11\">Dewey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AdB\">To a plea in abatement that the plaintiff is a <em>feme covert </em>and that her husband should have been joined with her in the suit, it is a good answer that such fact was first alleged in an answer filed after the filing of an affidavit that the party had a substantial defence to the action, and intended to bring the same to trial. <em>Cole </em>v. Ackerman, 7 Gray, 38. Nor can the defendant avoid the effect of postponing filing his plea in abatement until after filing his affidavit of defence as above stated, upon the ground of the omission in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>affidavit of the words \u201c on the merits; \u201d the defendant acting upon the same as an affidavit entitling him to file an answer to the merits, and actually filing such answer. The case must be treated as one where the defendant had filed an affidavit authorizing a substantial defence on the merits; and the plea in abatement was properly rejected as filed too late.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
