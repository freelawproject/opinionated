The estate first devised to the plaintiff was, by the rules of the common law, an estate for life only, there being no words of inheritance ; and it is not enlarged to a fee simple by the Rev. Sts. c. 62, \u00a7 4; for it does \u201c clearly appear by the will that the devisor intended to convey a less estate.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b57-11\">The devise over, in case the plaintiff should \u201c die without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>lawful issue,\u201d would doubtless, by the common law, have en* larged the plaintiff\u2019s estate to an estate tail by implication. But that would have been as a consequence of the rule in <em>Shelley's </em>case, by which a devise to a man for life, and after his death to his issue, gave him an estate tail; and therefore a devise to a man for life, and, upon his death without issue, then over, (by implication a devise to him for life, and after his death to his issue, and in case of his death without issue, then over,) in like manner gave him an estate tail. In both these cases, the life estate originally given was enlarged by the common law to an estate tail; and for the same reason, namely, that in both cases the land would belong to the issue of the devisee after his death, and in all cases where an estate was limited to a devisee and his issue, his issue, by this rule of the common law, took by descent and r. '.f as purchasers.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b58-5\">\u2022 This rule is abolished in Massachusetts, by <em>St. </em>1791, <em>c. </em>60, $ 3, enlarged by the Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>59, \u00a7 9, which provide that any devise \u201c to any person for his life, and after his death to his heirs in fee, or by words to that effect,\u201d gives to him an estate for life only, and to them a remainder in fee simple; and thus expressly cover this case. The limitation over to his \u201c issue \u201d is of the same effect as if to his <em>\u201c </em>heirs; \u201d and if this did not limit the estate to the plaintiff\u2019s heirs, it must have given it to his issue as purchasers, in which case he can only have an estate for life. <em>St. </em>1791, <em>c. </em>60, \u00a7 3. <em>Bowers </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>4 Pick. 207. And the limitation to his heirs in fee tail, is as much within the statute, as if in fee simple. Commissioners\u2019 Report on Rev.

Dodge, 10 Met. 502, the devise was in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>the first instance coupled with words of inheritance, and was cut down to an estate tail.

But there is a fallacy in his ingenious argument, which consists in the assumption, as the basis of the reasoning, that the devise to the plaintiff of the premises in controversy is in legal effect a gift in express terms to him for life and on his death to the heirs of his body, or, what is equivalent, to his lawful issue. But such is not the true interpretation of the devise, construing, as we are bound to do, the two clauses, relating to the premises, together, as being made <em>uno flatu </em>and operating to vest an estate in the devisee at one and the same time. Thus construed, the devise is of an estate tail, which vests in the first taker something more than an estate for life. In other words, the language of the will relating to the premises in dispute creates an estate tail in the plaintiff by implication, and has the same force and effect <em>ex vi termini </em>as if it had been in express terms to the devisee and the heirs of his body lawfully begotten. This point is fully settled by a series of adjudications in this commonwealth, cited by the counsel for the plaintiff, especially by <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>5 Met. 134, and <em>Wheatland </em>v. <em>Hodge, </em>10 Met. 502. It follows that this is not a case to which the statute abolishing the rule in <em>Shelley's case, </em>Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>59, \u00a7 9, ap plies. This statute was not intended to prohibit or restrain the creation of estates tail when the devise should be made by apt and sufficient words according to the well established rules ot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>law. It was only intended to be applicable to those cases where the devise was in express terms or in substance and effect to the first taker for life, and was designed to give effect to the particular intent creating a life estate, to the exclusion of the general intent to create a fee tail, which the rule of the common law implied from a gift so expressed. But in this case no particular intent to give to the plaintiff a life interest is expressed or implied. On the contrary, as has been already stated, the implication is that an estate tail was created.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">\n<em>Demmrer overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
