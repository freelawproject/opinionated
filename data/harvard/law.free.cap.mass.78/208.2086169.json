B. </em>Goodrich, for the petitioner.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AUz\">The original insolvent law of 1838, c. 163, \u00a7 1, allowed proceedings to be commenced either in the county where the debtor resided, or in that in which he had his usual place of business. By the <em>St. </em>of 1858, <em>c. </em>93, \u00a7 3, all the jurisdiction and authority of judges of insolvency under previous laws is transferred to the judges of probate and insolvency under the new act. The provision of \u00a7 10, that \u201c the judges of probate and insolvency in the several counties shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction of all cases of insolvent debtors who reside within their respective counties,\u201d should not be construed to change in so material a particular as this a system of twenty years\u2019 standing.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b216-9\"><em>E.
