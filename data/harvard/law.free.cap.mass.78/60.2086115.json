Sts. <em>c. </em>107, \u00a7 5, upon a writ of entry to foreclose a mortgage, distinct debts cannot be set off.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-10\">Writ of entry to foreclose a mortgage. The defendant was defaulted, and filed in set-off an account for goods sold and delivered and work and labor done.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-11\">At the hearing in the court of common pleas, the defendant offered evidence to prove the items in his account, by way of set-off against the debt secured by the mortgage, to reduce that debt, and the amount for which conditional judgment should be rendered. The plaintiff objected to this evidence as inadmissi ble, and contended that it was not competent to reduce that amount by an account in set-off merely, and not of payments; and claimed to have other debts owing him from the defendants, not secured by mortgage or otherwise, which he claimed to set off against their account. <em>Perkins, </em>J. rejected the account <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>in set-off, and entered conditional j udgment. The defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b69-5\"><em>E. Ames, (E. Wilkinson </em>with him,) for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-S\">If the plaintiff had sued on the note only which was secured by the mortgage, the defendant\u2019s account would have been admissible in set-off. Rev. Sts. c. 96, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 7. Upon a writ of entry to foreclose a mortgage, conditional judgment is to be entered for so much only as is due in equity and good conscience. Prov St. 10 W. 3, (1698,) Anc. Chart. 324. <em>St. </em>1785, c. 22, \u00a7 1. Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>107, \u00a7 5. Dwarris on Sts. (2d ed.) 568-572. <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>11 Met. 388, 389. <em>Briggs </em>v. <em>Richmond, </em>10 Pick. 393. The defendants\u2019 set-off should therefore have been allowed. If the plaintiff held, as he claimed, other debts against the defendants, they would go to defeat or cut down <em>pro tanto </em>the defendants\u2019 set-off.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b69-6\"><em>W.

Sts. <em>c. </em>107, \u00a7 5, the question is, \u201c how much is due to the plaintiff on the mortgage,\u201d not what would be due between the parties upon a settlement of all mutual demands between them/ The set-off was therefore rightly disallowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
