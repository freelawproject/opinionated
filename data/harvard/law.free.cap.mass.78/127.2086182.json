Pillsbury is shown by the records of the mayor and aldermen to have been appointed an agent of the city to sell intoxicating liquor. The notice issued to him of his appointment is in substance, if not technically, a certificate of authority. The giving of a bond and receiving a certificate required by <em>St. </em>1855, <em>c. </em>215, \u00a7 8, are not conditions precedent to executing the authority conferred by appointment under \u00a7 5 ; but only directory ; and compliance with these requirements, as with the rules and regulations prescribed by the mayor and aldermen under \u00a7 5, is sufficiently secured by the power to remove at pleasure; and this penal statute is to be construed strictly.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b137-9\">2.

The defendants failed to show any legal authority to sell intoxicating liquors. The provisions of <em>St. </em>1855, <em>c. </em>215, \u00a7\u00a7 5, 8, relating to the appointment of agents by cities and towns for the purchase and sale of such liquors, are to be construed together. Under these provisions, no appointment is complete, and no authority is conferred to make purchases and sales, until a bond has been given by the person appointed to th\u00e9 city or town, and a certificate has been issued to him by the mayor and aldermen or selectmen in pursuance of \u00a7 8. This bond and certificate are intended to be conditions precedent, to be complied with by the agent before his authority to act becomes perfect. Any other construction of this part of the statute would be unreasonable. The bond is intended to secure the faithful performance of the duties of the agent, and the strict compliance on his part with the provisions of law and the rules which the mayor and aldermen or selectmen may from time to time prescribe concerning the mode of conducting the business of the agency. This purpose would be defeated if the authority to make sales and purchases were full and complete, imme<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>diately on the passage of a vote appointing a person to be an agent. The various acts necessary to create the agent and, clothe him with the requisite authority must necessarily be done <em>gradatim. </em>First, the appointment is to be made, then the bond is to be given, and lastly the certificate is to issue; in like manner as in cases of appointment to public office, the act designating or nominating a person for the place is the first step, then the oaths of office are to be taken, and in many cases a bond is to be given, and thereupon and not before the authority to perform the duties of the office is vested in the appointee. The notice given to the defendant Pillsbury by the clerk of the city was only an announcement of his appointment to the agency, for the purpose of enabling him to take the necessary steps to procure the bond and receive the regular- certificate of his appointment. But it contains none of the requisites of such certificate according to the provisions of \u00a7 8. On this pari of the case, therefore, the instructions were clearly right, and all questions concerning the revocation of the appointment became wholly immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\"><em>2. </em>The instructions to the jury concerning the effect of a delivery of intoxicating liquors, as constituting <em>prima facie </em>evidence of a sale, were in conformity to the provisions of the statute on this point, which establishes the same rule \u201c in all cases under this act,\u201d and which has \u25a0 already been decided to be a constitutional and valid enactment. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams </em>6 Gray, 1. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>7 Gray, 222.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
