One of the defendants\u2019 witnesses testified: \u201c There were many men there, and almost all the women in Eockport; all who could walk or move on crutches. All the men appeared to be approving, except the rumsellers; I heard no objection. The selectmen, ministers, deacons, policemen were present; none of them forbade what was done, but all was peace and harmony. They appeared to be very happy, and the shouts came up from the gentlemen. The justices of the peace were there; everything that could walk. We determined to carry it through and destroy all the liquor.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-7\">So much of the judge\u2019s instructions as concerned the points decided by the full court was reported by him as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-8\">\u201c The most material question is, whether this proceeding was justifiable upon the grounds stated and relied on. That justification is, that by statute all intoxicating liquors kept for sale, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>and the vessels and implements actually used in selling and keeping the same, contrary to the provisions of that act, <em>(St. </em>1855, c. 215, \u00a7 37,) are declared to be common nuisances and are to be regarded and treated as such ; and that by another statute <em>(St. </em>1855, <em>c. </em>405) all buildings, places or tenements, used as houses of ill fame, resorted to for prostitution, lewd ness, or for illegal gaming, or used for the illegal keeping or sale of intoxicating liquors, are declared to be common nuisances, and are to be regarded and treated as such.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-5\">\u201c Upon this three questions arise: 1st. Whether all persons, members of the community, have a lawful right to destroy intoxicating liquor thus kept, by way of abatement of a com mon nuisance ? 2d. Whether for this purpose they have a right to use force to break open the place where it is so kept, if the nuisance cannot be reached and abated otherwise ? 3d. Is it justifiable for a large number of persons to combine and agree together to take and destroy such intoxicating liquor by force, and to use force in breaking open such a shop, in order to come at and get possession of the liquor to be destroyed ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-6\">\u201c Upon these questions I was of opinion and instructed the jury as follows: 1st. That intoxicating liquors kept for sale,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-7\">with the vessels containing them, and articles used in the sale, being declared by law to be a common nuisance, it is lawful for any person to destroy them, by way of abatement of a common nuisance, and that it is the exercise of a common and lawful right. 2d. That if kept in such a shop, not a dwelling-house, locked or otherwise closed, it is justifiable to use force, but no more force than is necessary to reach the liquor and vessels, if it cannot be come at otherwise. 3d. That if the combination or conspiracy of a large number of persons extends no further than to take and destroy intoxicating liquor and the vessels, and to use no unnecessary force, the fact that such combination is entered into by a large number of persons to act together, in doing that and no more, would not take away the justification they would have, if done by one or a few of them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-8\">\u201c But the jury were cautioned that this was a dangerous power, to be construed under very strict conditions; comment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>was made upon the danger of permitting people to take the law into their own hands, alluding to lynch law, vigilance committees, etc., leading to resistance, to riots, bloodshed and violence, destruction to the peace of a civilized community; that as a general rule private persons must rely upon the law for their protection and the redress of grievances, and if the law is in any respect inoperative and ineffectual, it is the province of the legislature to amend it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-5\">\u201c The restrictions under which this power can be lawfully exercised, the jury were instructed to be as follows: 1st. The</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-6\">power claimed by the defendants is a power conferred by law, and not by license or authority conferred by private persons, and must therefore be construed strictly, and if they exceed their authority, they are trespassers <em>ab </em>initia, this justification wholly fails, and the plaintiff is entitled to recover for all the damage sustained ; so, if they break open a shop where no intoxicating liquor is kept, or, if kept, if none is kept for sale, they do it at their peril; and if none such is found, the justification fails; so, if after entering they do unlawful acts, they are trespassers <em>ab initia. </em>2d. If any more force was used than was necessary, or any damage done to the building or to any articles in the building, beyond that of taking and destroying the intoxicating liquor kept for sale and the vessels which contained it, then the parties so acting were trespassers <em>ab </em>initia, and the justification is not established.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-7\">\u201c Under these views the evidence was briefly reviewed and submitted to the jury, upon the several questions of fact above stated; especially whether any unnecessary force was used, in breaking open the shop, without first requesting the owner to unlock it; or whether any unlawful acts were done by the party after entering the shop, either to the building or articles in it, and whether a barrel of vinegar, or any article other than intoxicating liquor and the vessels, was taken away or damaged.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-8\">The jury returned a verdict for the defendants; and the plaintiff moved for a new trial, on the ground that the jury were misdirected in matters of law; and this motion was reserved for the consideration of the whole court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b101-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>O.

This right is confined to abating that which is the nuisance, and never embraces the right to destroy property which is made or becomes a common nuisance merely by reason of some immoral or illegal use to which it is put or intended to be put by its owner. <em>Hopkins v. Crombie, </em>4 N. H. 520. <em>Graves </em>v. <em>Shattuck, </em>35 N. H. 257. <em>Gray </em>v. Ayres, 7 Dana, 375. <em>State </em>v. <em>Paul, </em>5 R. I. 185. The principal cases in which the right has. been asserted have been of public physical nuisances, such as obstructions of a highway or navigable stream. <em>Tames </em>v. <em>Hayward, </em>Cro. Car. 184. <em>Lodie </em>v. <em>Arnold, </em>2 Salk. 458. <em>Penruddock's case, </em>5 Co. 101. <em>Baten\u2019s case, </em>9 Co. 53. <em>Wales </em>v. <em>Stetson, 2 </em>Mass. 143. <em>Arundel </em>v. <em>McCulloch, </em>10 Mass. 70. <em>Garey </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>1 Cush. 307. In <em>Meeker </em>v. <em>Van Rensselaer, </em>15 Wend. 397, which is the strongest case in favor of the right of individuals to abate a public nuisance, the thing abated was a dwelling-house, cut up into small apartments, inhabited by a great number of poor people, in a filthy condition, and dangerous to the health and life of the neighborhood.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b101-5\">No man has a right to remedy a wrong and execute the law himself. <em>\u201c </em>Taking the law into one\u2019s own hands \u201d has the same signification as abating a nuisance by private individuals, and means simply that a party may relieve himself against peril. The fallacy and confusion arise from not distinguishing the exercise of certain natural rights from the execution of certain legal remedies.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b101-6\">The right of private individuals to abate common nuisances has the same origin, the same extent, and the same limitations, as the right of selfdefence. If an individual is attacked by an assassin, he may in defence of his person repel the attack and slay the assaulter, and the law will excuse, and not punish, the homicide. This right of selfdefence is not given by the law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>but by nature. The individual exercising it is not administering a legal remedy, but the law excuses or justifies him because under the circumstances of a sudden attack it cannot otherwise protect him. And if a public or private nuisance so imperils a man\u2019s life, limbs, health, happiness, liberty or property, or so obstructs him in the exercise and enjoyment of his undoubted legal rights, that it is not safe and reasonable for him to invoke the process of the law to abate the nuisance, he may, on the principles of selfdefence, so far remove and abate the nuisance as to relieve himself from immediate peril and his legal rights from dangerous obstructions, and the law will excuse or justify him so far in abating the nuisance. This is what is meant by the phrase, so often found in elementary text books and judicial reports, that \u201c private individuals may abate a corhmon nuisance,\u201d as a careful study of all the cases will show. This explanation places the matter in harmony with the whole body of our law; any other exposition introduces an inexplicable and dangerous anomaly into our system of jurisprudence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b102-5\">By the <em>St. </em>of 1855, c. 215, \u00a7 37, \u201c all intoxicating liquors kept for sale, and the implements and vessels actually used in selling and keeping the same, contrary to the provisions of this act,\u201d as by <em>St. </em>1855, <em>c. </em>405, \u00a7 1,61 all buildings, places or tenements used for the illegal sale or keeping of intoxicating liquors,\u201d are \u201c declared to be common nuisances, and.are to be regarded and treated as such; \u201d that is to say, so regarded by the law, and treated as such by those who have authority by law. The same statute, that declares liquors kept for sale to be common nuisances, also points out the method of proceeding against them, the warrants to be issued, the seizure to be made, the trial to be had, and the destruction that is to follow if a condemnation is secured. When the statute declares a thing to be a common nuisance, and at the same time points out the particular manner in which it shall be proceeded against, it cannot be imagined that the legislature intended to give every man, woman and child in the Commonwealth the right to seize and destroy the obnoxious property whenever and wherever it can be found. No such alarming or dangerous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>inference ought to be sanctioned by any court. <em>State </em>v. Paul, 5 R. I. 185.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b103-5\">If the legislature intended that such results should follow from the statute declaring liquors kept for sale common nuisances, then the statute is unconstitutional and void; for if the destruction of the liquors is in the nature of a punishment or penalty, no man can be punished except upon charge made and trial had according to law; and if the destruction of the liquors is in the nature of a forfeiture, no man can be deprived of his property except by the judgment of his peers and the law of the land.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b103-6\">Intoxicating liquors are not a nuisance ; they are property, entitled to protection as property, may be the subject of larceny, and no man can be deprived of them without due process of law, including trial by jury. <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>McGirr, </em>1 Gray, 1. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Coffee, 9 Gray, 139. <em>Arthur </em>v. <em>Flanders, </em>10 Gray, 107. Intoxicating liquors in the packages in which they were imported, or held for consumption, or to be given broadcast through the Commonwealth, are not a nuisance; nor is drinking them or giving them to another to drink; but it is a necessary element that they should be kept with intention to sell them illegally. It is this motive or intention of the mind, which makes the nuisance. In the case of buildings, there is a use prohibited; but here it is only the condition of mind of the party who holds the liquor. There are kinds of nuisances which are impalpable, and cannot be abated by process of law, and in such case the only judgment can be for the punishment of the offender. Here the intent is the thing; the law itself cannot abate the intent. A man may be indicted, notwithstanding the nuisance has been abated. If a man, having been punished by an individual, can be punished again by the public, what becomes of the clause of the Constitution, which prohibits his being tried twice? This shows that abatement by an individual is not in execution of the law, but to relieve himself from impending peril, and he can justify himself only on that ground. There was nothing here which offended or injured any individual, or put him in such peril that he could not invoke and</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b104-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>await the ordinary processes and protection of the law, and o\u00ed the courts administering the law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b104-5\">It is only under some circumstances that a person can abate a nuisance, even where it does injure himself. He cannot pull down the house where an unlawful trade is carried on. The unlawful trade only is abated by the judgment of the court; the innocent house remains the property of its owner. <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Pappineau, 2 </em>Stra. 686. If a man takes down a fence which obstructs a highway, he cannot destroy or burn the fence. What are nuisances is a question of law, either of common law or of statute. At common law they are the exercise of particular trades, acts of public indecency, actual breaches of the public peace, keeping a disorderly house or bawdy house, or a dangerous animal, or exposing a person having a dangerous disease. Bouvier\u2019s Law Diet. \u201c Nuisance.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b104-6\">If I leave my horse standing in the street an unreasonable length of time, it becomes a nuisance, and may be removed by any person whom it interrupts in his use of the highway. But suppose I resist, can he use all force necessary, even to killing me, if I resist to death ? Can a man abate a nuisance by a nuisance ? Any assault of the person calculated to induce a breach of the peace is a nuisance. What could be more so than this assembly of three hundred women with hatchets, surrounded and supported by a force which should overawe all resistance ? If the law gives no protection to a man and his property, how long will it be before he will protect himself and his property except against the judgment of his peers and the law of the land ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b104-7\">It was never heard of that a bawdy house or the inmates of a bawdy house could be abated by an individual. If it can, what is there to forbid any body of persons going into such a house and preventing its being converted to the unlawful purpose? <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Ayres, </em>7 Dana, 375. That is much easier than this; for here it is only the intent of the keeper, which you can only reach by knocking his brains out. The liquors are not the nuisance; why therefore destroy the liquors ? Some of the authorities go to the point that a dangerous animal, while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>doing an injury, may be destroyed, but not while not doing one.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b105-5\">Whenever that which is a common nuisance obstructs, injures or annoys a person under such circumstances that he cannot wait for the slow process of the law for his remedy, he may do that which relieves him from the impending peril, and which results in an abatement of the nuisance, but which is not technically an abatement of the nuisance. If we go farther than this, and say that any person may go beyond what the law authorizes him to do, and himself execute the law; then we are under a government of men and not of laws; and the legislative, instead of entrusting the execution of the laws to the executive and judicial departments, makes every individual to be judge, jury and executioner in his own case. A nuisance is not different from any other illegal act; a person injured may not execute the law, but he may relieve himself from impending peril. Is it a greater offence to commit a nuisance than to murder a man ? Could the legislature say in case of murder, that any one might make hot pursuit and kill the offender ? Yet he would be doing no more than the law would do.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b105-6\">Suppose a man has a quantity of imported liquors in a storehouse, and has broken bulk of each pipe, and is going away, and says he shall sell the liquors. Here is a nuisance. What is to be abated ? Not the liquor. Not the building. There is nothing palpable to be abated ; the nuisance is only the intent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b105-7\">The distinction made in the instructions to the jury between \u2022che building and the vessels containing the liquor cannot be maintained.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b105-8\"><em>S.

J.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"A9Z\">This is an action for breaking and entering the plaintiff\u2019s shop, and destroying various articles of property.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">The defendants, denying the facts, and putting the plaintiff to proof, insist that if it is proved that they were chargeable with the breaking and entering, it was justifiable by law, on the ground that the shop was a place used for the sale of spirituous liquors, and so was declared to be a nuisance; that they had a right to abate the nuisance, and for that purpose to break and enter the shop, as the proof shows- that it was done; that the shop contained spirituous liquors kept for sale; that the so keeping them was a nuisance by statute; that they had a right to enter by force and destroy them ; that they entered for that purpose and destroyed such articles, and did no more damage than was necessary for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">A great many points were raised in the report, and argued, upon which the court have not passed ; they are all passed over now for the purpose of coming to the main points which are decisive of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">The judge who sat at the trial stated that he ruled the law and directed the jury as stated in the report, subject to the opinion of the whole court, and when many other points were raised, he stated that it might be more convenient to report the whole case, so far as controverted points were presented, for the consideration of the whole court; and this, it was understood, was assented to by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">Passing over all questions as to the plaintiff\u2019s case, and coming to the justification set forth in the answer, the court are of opinion, after argument, that the ruling and instructions to the jury were not correct in matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-10\">1. The court are of opinion that spirituous liquors are not, of themselves, a common nuisance, but the act of keeping them for sale by statute creates a nuisance; and the only mode in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>which they can be lawfully destroyed is the one directed by statute, for the seizure by warrant, bringing them before a magistrate, and giving the owner of the property an opportunity to defend his right to it. Therefore it is not lawful for any person to destroy them by way of abatement of a common nuisance, and <em>a fortiori </em>not lawful to use force for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">2. It is not lawful by the common law for any and all persons to abate a common nuisance, merely because it is a common nuisance, though the doctrine may have been sometimes stated in terms so general as to give countenance to this supposition. This right and power is never entrusted to individuals in general, without process of law, by way of vindicating the public right, but solely for the relief of a party whose right is ob structed by such nuisance.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">3. If such were intended to be made the law by force of the statute, it would be contrary to the provisions of the Constitution, which directs that no man\u2019s property can be taken from him without compensation, except by the judgment of his peers or the law of the land; and no person can be twice punished for the same offence. And it is clear that under the statutes spirituous liquors are property, and entitled to protection as such. The power of abatement of a public or common nuisance does not place the penal law of the Commonwealth in private hands. , (</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">4. The true theory of abatement of nuisance is that an individual citizen may abate a private nuisance injurious to him, when he could also bring an action ; and also, when a common nuisance obsiructs his individual right, he may remove it to enable him to enjoy that right, and he cannot be called in question for so doing. As in the case of the obstruction across a highway, and an unauthorized bridge over a navigable watercourse, if he has occasion to use it, he may remove it by way of abatement. But this would not justify strangers, being-inhabitants of other parts of the Commonwealth, having no such occasion to use it, to do the same. Some of the earlier cases, perhaps, in laying down the general proposition that private subjects may abate a common nuisance, did not expressly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>mark this distinction ; but we think, upon the authority of modern cases, where the distinctions are more accurately made, and upon principle, this is the true rule of law. <em>Lonsdale </em>v. <em>Nelson, 2 </em>B. &amp; C. 311, 312, and 3 D. &amp; R. 566, 567. <em>Mayor &amp;c. of Colchester </em>v. <em>Brooke, </em>7 Ad. &amp; El. N. R. 376, 377. <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Ayres, </em>7 Dana, 375. <em>State </em>v. <em>Paul, </em>5 R. I. 185.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">5. As it is the use of a building, or the keeping of spirituous liquors in it, which in general constitutes the nuisance, the abatement consists in putting a stop to such use.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">6. The keeping of a building for the sale of intoxicating liquors, if a nuisance at all, is exclusively a common nuisance; and the fact that the husbands, wives, children or servants -of any person do frequent such a place and get intoxicating liquor there, does not make it a special nuisance or injury to their private rights, so as to authorize and justify such persons in breaking into the shop or building where it is thus sold, and destroying the liquor there found, and the vessels in which it may be kept; but it can only be prosecuted as a public or common nuisance in the mode prescribed by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">Upon these grounds, without reference to others, which may be reported in detail hereafter, the court are of opinion that the verdict for the defendants must be set aside and a</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">\n<em>New trial had.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b108-11\"> This statement of the decision was drawn up by the chief justice to guide the new trial.
