But, in framing an indictment on a statute, it is not \u201c sufficient to pursue the very words of the statute, unless by so doing you fully, directly and expressly allege the fact in the doing or not doing whereof the offence consists, without any the least uncertainty or ambiguity.\u201d <em>2 </em>Hawk. <em>c. 25, </em>\u00a7 111. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clifford, </em>8 Cush. 217. The words of this statute do not set forth, and were not intended to set forth, fully, directly and expressly, all that is necessary to constitute the offence intended to be pun \u2022 ished. To constitute that offence, there must be an illegal sale and illegal keeping of intoxicating liquors. These facts therefore must be alleged, in an indictment on this statute, in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>same manner in which they are required to be alleged in an indictment for selling intoxicating liquors.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b184-5\"><em>S. H. Phillips, </em>(Attorney General,) for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b184-6\">Metcalf, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aol\">The first section of <em>St. </em>1855, <em>c. </em>405, declares all buildings, places or tenements, used for the illegal sale or keeping of intoxicating liquors to be common nuisances, and that they are to be regarded and treated as such. The second section prescribes the punishment of any person keeping or maintaining any such common nuisance. The indictment sets forth the offence in the words of the statute which creates it. And this is a case in which we think an indictment may well be so framed \u2022 because no allegation of anything more than the words of the statute necessarily import is required in order to show that the statute offence has been committed, by the defendant. The case, in our judgment, cannot be distinguished from <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gooding, </em>12 Wheat. 473, 474; <em>Whiting </em>v. <em>State, </em>14 Conn. 487; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pray, </em>13 Pick. 359 ; and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ashley, </em>2 Gray, 356. Each of these cases was, like, this, an indictment for an offence created by a statute which fully and plainly described the act or acts that constituted the offence thereby made punishable. But in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clifford, </em>8 Cush. 215, cited by the defendant\u2019s counsel, the indictment was for robbery, a common law offence, for which the form of indictment had long been established, but for which offence a statute had provided a punishment, without setting forth all the several acts and facts which constituted robbery. In that case, it was very clear that the indictment, which contained only the words of the statute, omitting allegations of matters that were necessary to constitute robbery, was insufficient to sustain a judgment; just as an indictment for larceny, under the Rev. Sts. c. 126, <em>&amp; </em>17, would be held insufficient, which should merely allege, in the words of that section, that A. committed the offence of larceny, by stealing a horse, the property of B. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
