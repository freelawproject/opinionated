The plaintiff testified that this was the only time that he had ever bought a ticket, or received a check for baggage, from the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-5\">Upon this evidence the judge ruled \u201c that the defendants were liable to the plaintiff for the loss of said baggage, to the same extent as if the plaintiff had actually paid his fare for himself ; that the price paid for the ticket to be used for his wife included the compensation to the defendants for carrying the trunk, the contents thereof being nearly wholly her personal apparel; and so the defendants became the common carriers of said trunk, for a valid consideration, and liable, notwithstanding there was no notice that it was to be carried under different circumstances from those under which the plaintiff ordinarily travelled.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-6\">The defendants offered evidence that when the plaintiff applied at their ticket office for a ticket, he received one bearing only these words: \u201c Worcester to Albany. Albany to Suspension Bridge; \u201d and also a pasteboard check, three inches long by an inch and a half wide, upon the face of which were printed in large type, \u201c B. &amp; W. R. R. Check. Boston to Worcester; \u201d and in smaller type, \u201c Good only with a ticket sold at Boston by B. &amp; W. R. R. Co. to some point beyond Worcester; \u201d in facsimile of handwriting, the signature, . \u201c H. G. Perkins; \u201d and in the left hand lower corner, in quite small type, the words, \u201c Look on the back.\u201d On the back, in equally small type, was the following: \u201c Passengers are not allowed to carry more than 80 lbs. of baggage, all of which must be strictly <em>personal </em>and not exceeding $50 in value, unless notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>is given and an extra price paid. The company will not hold itself liable to pay for any package or other article taken by the passenger with him into the cars. Passengers must not stand on the platform of the cars; nor take or leave the cars when in motion; nor put their heads or arms out of the car windows. g@r= For other regulations see printed notice in the cars and at the stations.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b398-5\">The defendants also offered evidence that in each of the defendants\u2019 cars was posted a placard containing a like notice of limitation of liability, and notices as to smoking in the cars, standing on the platform, and putting heads and arms out of the windows; and that the plaintiff had read notices in the defendants\u2019 cars as to smoking or standing on the platform.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b398-6\">The plaintiff could read the English language; and testified that he never read any notice limiting the defendants\u2019 liability for baggage ; that he had no notice or knowledge thereof; that his attention was not called by the ticketseller or any one to the notice on the back of this check, and that he had no knowledge thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b398-7\">The defendants requested the judge to rule that it was a presumption of law that the plaintiff read the whole, if he read a part, of the placard; so that, if he was shown to have read the part thereof relating to smoking or standing on the platform, he was chargeable with knowledge of that part of the same placard, \u25a0which related to the limitation as to baggage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b398-8\">The judge declined so to rule; and instructed the jury \u201c that there was no such presumption, but that the question whether notice of said limitation was brought home to the plaintiff was one of fact, to be decided by them on all the evidence, and the inferences to be by them drawn, and that the said reading of a part was a circumstance to be by them weighed in passing upon this question; that notice of the limitation must be brought to the knowledge of the plaintiff, and it was a question of fact whether the plaintiff knew of the limitation before he started on the journey; that the plaintiff\u2019s receiving said ticket, and with it said check, in the manner stated, raised no legal presumption that the plaintiff, before leaving the station in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>the train, had the required notice of the limitations and conditions on the back of said check; that the posting of said placards and the plaintiff\u2019s having read thereon a notice as to smoking or standing on the platform raised no such presumption ; but if the plaintiff had read notice of such limitation on the placard, or on said check, or was in any way apprised thereof, or had his attention otherwise called thereto, before the train left the station, then it became a part of the contract and binding on him; and this was a question of fact on the whole evidence.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AMg\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $190, and the defendants alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b399-6\"><em>G. S. Hale, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-L6\">1. The defendants stood in ihe position of a mandatory, liable only for gross negligence. Story on Bailments, \u00a7\u00a7 174 <em>&amp; seq. </em>Angell on Carriers, c. 2. They were not common carriers of the mail, the agent, his own, or his wife\u2019s luggage. <em>Collett </em>v. <em>London &amp; Northwestern Railway Co. </em>16 Ad. &amp; El. N. R. 984. <em>Nollon </em>v. <em>Western Railroad, </em>15 N. Y. 444. <em>Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad </em>v. <em>Derby, </em>14 How. 468. He was bound to show negligence, of which there was no sufficient evidence, or at least it should have been left to the jury. Angell on Gamers, \u00a7\u00a7 38, 51, 61. These rules certainly apply to his own effects, which are not distinguished in the evidence or damages from those of his wife. The plaintiff was bound to notify the defendants that the trunk was that of a passenger paying fare, if it could be so considered; otherwise, they had a right to presume that be was travelling as usual. This was negligence, an assent to travel on the usual terms, or an estoppel to deny a fact which be thus led them to believe, justifying less vigilance. The purchase of a ticket was not such notice; it should have been given to the baggage master, or other proper agent. <em>Sager </em>v. <em>Portsmouth, Saco &amp; Portland Railroad, </em>31 Maine, 228.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b399-7\">2. The contract was governed by the limitation on the ticket and placards. That was reasonable. Angell on Carriers, \u00a7 245. 1 Parsons on Con. 711. 2 Greenl. Ev. \u00a7 215. And it was made part of the contract by sufficient notice. The effect of the ruling was that the evidence offered by the defendants was not</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b400-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number><em>prima facie </em>evidence of notice. 1 Greenl. Ev. \u00a7\u00a7 33 <em>&amp; seq. </em>Mathews on Presumption, 1. But it was sufficient to raise a presumption, or furnish <em>prima facie </em>evidence. Angell on Carriers, \u00a7 248. <em>Butler </em>v. Heane, 2 Campb. 415. <em>Clarke </em>v <em>Cray, </em>6 East, 564. <em>Leeson </em>v. <em>Holt, </em>1 Stark. R. 188. <em>Rowley </em>v. <em>Horne, </em>3 Bing. 2. <em>Shaw </em>v. York <em>North Midland Railway, </em>6 Railw, Cas. 87. <em>Walker </em>v. York <em>North Midland Railway, </em>2 El. &amp; Bl. 750. <em>York, Newcastle &amp; Berwick Railway </em>v. <em>Crisp, </em>14 C. B. 527. <em>Whitesell </em>v. <em>Crane, </em>8 W. &amp; S. 369. <em>Gould </em>v. <em>Hill, 2 </em>Hill N. Y. 623. It was consistent with a wilful omission to read the limitation, which would not certainly defeat its effect. <em>Emerson </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>8 Scott N. R. 222. A different rule would violate the ordinary presumptions of notice in common life, subject the defendants to the consequences of the plaintiff\u2019s negligence in not examining his ticket at all, render it impossible to secure a protection admitted to be reasonable, and leave them, as in this case, under the present law of evidence, absolutely at the mercy of ready forgetfulness, or of an oath given under strong tempta tians, with little possibility of detection.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b400-5\"><em>A. O. Allen, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b400-6\">Dewey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A-d\">This case must be held to be analogous to the case of <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Eastern Railroad, </em>11 Cush. 97, and may, like that, be decided without any adjudication upon the broader question whether a limitation of the liability of the railroad company as to the amount and value of the baggage of passengers transported on the road may not be effectually secured by the delivery of a ticket, to the passenger so printed in large and fair type on the face of the ticket that no one could read the part of the ticket indicating the place to which it purports to entitle him to be conveyed without also having brought to his notice the fact of limitation as to liability for his baggage. The present case as to the ticket only differs from the case of <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Eastern Railroad, </em>in having printed in small type on the face of the ticket, \u201c Look on the back.\u201d But there is nothing, on the face of the ticket, alluding to the subject of baggage; no notice to look on the back for regulations as to baggage, The delivery of such a ticket does not entitle the railroad com-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>pony to ask for instructions that there resulte therefrom a legal presumption of notice of the restricted liability as to the baggage of the passenger. The ruling as to the placards posted in the cars was correct, and no legal presumption of notice arose therefrom. The court properly submitted the question of notice to the jury as a question of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">We have not particularly considered the question of liability of the defendants as to certain small items, if any, of the wearing apparel of the husband, that were contained in the lost trunk. The articles are stated in the bill of exceptions to have been \u201c nearly wholly his wife\u2019s wearing apparel,\u201d and the court was not asked to direct the jury to exclude the other articles in assessing damages. Without expressing any opinion upon the 'point whether these articles, if any, of the husband\u2019s would be embraced in the baggage which the defendants assumed to transport as common earners, the husband paying no fare for his personal transportation, the court are of opinion that in the present aspect of the case judgment should be entered generally on the verdict. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
