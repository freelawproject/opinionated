In March 1856, the plaintiffs, through the agency of Ezra C. Hutchins of Boston, who was employed by their president, and by him furnished with money for that purpose, bought the note after it had been indorsed by the payees and by the defendants. It did not appear that the plaintiffs knew where the maker resided, except that he lived out of the city. On the 24th of March 1856, the plaintiffs\u2019 cashier sent the note to Hutchins, with no instructions or explanation besides these words : \u201c I enclose for collection and deposit in Suffolk Bank; Wm. P. Moore, due May 1-4.\u201d Hutchins then knew the maker\u2019s residence and place of business. On the 24th of April following the cashier sent the note to the Merchants\u2019 Bank of Newbern, whose cashier returned it, not protested, to Hutchins, in a letter dated April 30th, saying, \u201c Your letter of the 24th instant with one enclosure as stated is received, and which enclosure I return herein as below. Note <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>of Wm. P. Moore, $1000. Exchange is so scarce that I could not remit if paid.\u201d The 4th of May was Sunday. Hutchins received this letter and the enclosed note on the 5th of May, and immediately informed the defendants, and asked them to waive demand and pay it; but they declined to do so, and Hutchins on the same day sent the note back to Newbern, where, on the 12th of May, it was presented by a notary public to Moore for payment, which he refused, and the note was duly protested and notice thereof sent to the defendants, who received it on the 17th of May.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b478-5\"><em>H.

Why should the holder be compelled to go abroad to find the maker and present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>the note, when the maker resided abroad, at the date of the note, and yet be excused from making a demand when the maker leaves the State after making the note ? It cannot be because there is an implied contract that the residence of the maker shall continue as at the date of the note; for if that were so, the holder would not be compelled (as it is well settled that he is) to follow the maker if he changes his residence to another place within the State after the making of the note. Story on Notes, \u00a7 237 &amp; cases cited. The reason why the holder is not compelled to go abroad, to present a note to a maker who has left the State since it was made, is not because of the greater distance or difficulty of finding him than in a new residence within the State, nor because the holder may not by inquiry find out where he is, but because he has gone within another jurisdiction ; and for the same reason the same rule must be applied when the maker has always resided abroad. <em>Hepburn </em>v.

Nor had the plaintiffs\u2019 agent, Hutchins, until the note was sent to him for collection ; and if he had, it would not affect the plaintiffs, as he was only their agent for the purpose first of buying the note and afterwards of collecting it. The case of <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Philbrick, </em>10 Gray, 252, is conclusive in favor of the plaintiffs.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b479-6\"><em>H Jewell, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AsG\">The plaintiffs had no right to expect payment of the note at Boston at maturity; and did not in fact, but had sent it away for presentment at Newbern. The general rule of law, requiring a demand on the maker at maturity, as a condition precedent to charging the indorser, is well settled. <em>Farnum </em>v. <em>Fowle, </em>12 Mass. 89. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Haight, </em>13 Johns. 470. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Richards, </em>2 Caines, 343.

Nor is it like the case of a maker who, after making the note, removes into another state or country; and even in that case payment must be demanded at his original residence. <em>Wheeler </em>v. <em>Field, </em>6 Met. 290. Demand must be made on the exact day of maturity, unless prevented by the act of God or hostile force. <em>Patience </em>v. <em>Townley, </em>2 Smith, 223.

Story on Notes, \u00a7 265, note. 20 Law Reporter, 336.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b480-5\">This case was decided in February 1860.</p>\n<author id=\"b480-6\">Metcalf, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AFo\">[After stating the facts as above.] On these facts, the question is, whether the defendants are liable as indorsers. If they are, it is not because seasonable demand was made on the promisor and seasonable notice of nonpayment given to them. The note fell due on Saturday, May 3d \u2014 the last day of grace being Sunday \u2014 and no demand was made on the promisor until nine days afterwards. This delay discharged the defendants from their liability to the plaintiffs unless the fact that the promisor always resided in North Carolina excused the holders from making personal demand on him, or from using due efforts to make such demand. The plaintiffs rely on this fact to sustain their action, and cite the decision in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Philbrick, </em>10 Gray, 252, as conclusive in their favor. That was an action by an indorser against a prior indorser of a note made in Boston by one whose only residence and place of business were in Texas, and on whom no demand was made; and it was decided that no demand on him was necessary to charge the defendant. The court said there was no evidence to show whether, the plaintiff, or any of the subsequent holders of the note, knew where the promisor\u2019s residence was; that if his residence had been known to the holder, at the maturity of the note, it might perhaps have been incumbent on him to forward it to Texas for presentment, as was held in <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Snyder, </em>3 Denio, 145.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">In the case before us, the plaintiffs\u2019 agent, whom they employed to purchase and also to collect the note, knew where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>Moore\u2019s residence was ; and the legal effect of his knowledge of that fact is the same as would have been the effect of their knowledge of it. Notice to an agent, whilst he is concerned for the principal, is notice to the principal himself. And we are of opinion, as intimated in <em>Smith </em>v. Philbrick, that by reason of the plaintiffs\u2019 knowledge (through their agent) of the place of Moore\u2019s residence, a demand on him there, and seasonable notice of his default, were prerequisites to the defendants\u2019 liability as indorsers. We think this case is within the general and familiar rule which applies to the holders of indorsed notes, and not an exception to that rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">When a resident in the State, after giving a note, remove\u00bb from the State and takes.up a residence out of the State, it has been repeatedly decided that it is not necessary, in order to charge an indorser of the note, to demand payment of the promisor at his new residence. This exception to the general rule which requires demand on the promisor, and notice to the indorser, seems to be established. But we see no sufficient reason for taking the present case out of that rule. And we hold, that where the maker of a note, when it is made and indorsed, has a known residence out of the State, which residence remains unchanged at the maturity of the note, demand must be made on him, or due diligence used for that purpose, and notice of nonpayment given to the indorser before the indorser can be charged. So it was decided by the court of appeals in New York, in <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Snyder, </em>before referred to, and in <em>Spies </em>v. <em>Gilmore, </em>1 Comst. 321, In this last case, Bronson, J. said: <em>\u201c </em>The only excuse which has been offered for not making demand is, that it would have been inconvenient to go or send to Matamoras for the purpose. It is often inconvenient to present the note for payment, when the maker and holder both reside in the same state; and yet, when the maker has a known place of residence, and there has been no change of circumstances after the giving of the note, mere trouble or inconvenience to the holder has never been held a good excuse for omitting demand. And this is so, however wide asunder the maker and holder may live If the plaintiff wished to avoid the inconvenience of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>sending to Mata moras, he should have made the note payable in New York, or got an indorsement with a waiver of demand He has no right to change the contract which the indorser made, for the purpose of promoting his own convenience.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendants.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
