Both parties moved for summary judgment, and the District Court granted summary judgment in favor of Ravalli County, concluding that as a matter of law the County did not have a duty to prevent Russell from harming Prindel. The District Court declined to order release of various documents to Prindel and held that Prindel is not entitled to discovery of other documents. Prindel now appeals, and we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"ABC\">\u00b62 Prindel raises the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">\u00b63 (1) whether the District Court erred when it held that Ravalli County owed no duty of care to Prindel;</p>\n<p id=\"b365-10\">\u00b64 (2) whether the District Court erred when it declined to order release of records pertaining to Russell compiled or possessed by the Missoula Pre-Release Center; and</p>\n<p id=\"b365-11\">\u00b65 (3) whether the District Court erred when it failed to compel production of the Ravalli County Attorney\u2019s files concerning Russell.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">\u00b66 On the evening of December 29, 1998, a group of revelers gathered at a private residence<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in Hamilton, Montana, to celebrate the year\u2019s crepuscular remnants. Russell and Prindel both attended the soiree. The partygoers imbibed spirits well into the night. The party, not to be contained within a single day, spilled over into the early morning of December 30, 1998, whereupon violence tragically pierced the revelry. Russell stabbed Prindel in the heart with a six-inch knife, inflicting life-threatening injury and permanently impairing Prindel.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">\u00b67 In connection with this stabbing, Russell was convicted of attempted deliberate homicide and sentenced to life in prison with an additional ten years for the use of a deadly weapon. Subsequently, Prindel filed a complaint against Ravalli County alleging that the county jail\u2019s failure to incarcerate Russell on December 28, 1998, despite a district court order that Russell begin serving a sentence on that date, amounted to negligence that proximately caused Prindel\u2019s injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">\u00b68 During a hearing on December 23, 1998, Russell, who had previously received three suspended sentences and had been released subject to certain conditions, admitted to violating those conditions. Specifically, Russell admitted to consuming alcohol and engaging in disorderly conduct. The District Court for the Twenty-First Judicial District in Ravalli County revoked Russell\u2019s suspended sentences and ordered him to serve ten days in the Ravalli County Jail (the Jail). In a gesture of generosity befitting the spirit of the season and acceding to Russell\u2019s wish to spend Christmas unconfined, the District Court ordered him to report to the Jail \u201cno later than 8:00 a.m. on [Monday,] December 28,1998.\u201d When Russell showed up at the Jail, however, the jailers turned him away.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">\u00b69 Russell reported to the Jail at 10:00 a.m. on December 28,1998, to begin serving his sentence. He spoke with Heather Anderson (Anderson), who was on duty at the Jail, by telephone from the Jail lobby. Anderson could not find a written order of commitment from the court mandating the Jail to admit Russell. She informed Russell that he could not be booked until the Jail had the requisite paperwork and instructed him to return on January 2, 1999. Anderson did not place a call to the Ravalli County Clerk of Court (Clerk) to inquire whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>there was an order mandating Russell\u2019s commitment. Nor does the evidence indicate that she requested that Russell go to the Clerk\u2019s office (located in the same building as the jail), procure the court\u2019s written order and return. Before informing Russell that he should return several days later, Anderson apparently spoke with Jason McCawley (McCawley), another staff member of the Jail, about a prior incident when Russell had attempted, unsuccessfully, to gain unauthorized entry to the Jail in order to harm an inmate. According to Anderson\u2019s deposition testimony, her knowledge of this previous incident played \u201c[a] small part\u201d in her decision to turn Russell away. According to McCawley, he was familiar with Russell, having seen Russell make threatening gestures to another inmate during one of his prior stints in the Jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">\u00b610 Russell called the Jail again at 3:00 p.m. on December 28, 1998, seeking admission to serve his sentence. He was reminded that he should return to the Jail on January 2, 1999, to serve his sentence. \u00b611 Anderson and McCawley both testified that it was not uncommon for a person to report to the Jail without the requisite paperwork and that, time permitting, the Jail would call the Clerk to confirm that the court had ordered such persons incarcerated. Moreover, Anderson testified that the Clerk could fax the order of commitment to the Jail within twenty or thirty minutes. McCawley testified that he called the Clerk after turning Russell away and that he could have called the Clerk before deciding not to admit Russell. David Anderson, the third person on duty at the Jail on December 28, testified that he would have sent a purported prisoner who was lacking commitment papers to \u201cgo get\u201d the court order. He also indicated that he \u201cprobably would ... contact\u201d the Clerk to verify that the court had ordered incarceration. Finally, both McCawley and Anderson testified that the Clerk\u2019s office called the Jail at some undetermined time on the afternoon of December 28, 1998, to confirm that the District Court had ordered Russell to serve time in the Jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">\u00b612 No stranger to institutional living, Russell had an extensive criminal history. In 1981, Russell was sentenced to ten years in prison in connection with four felonies: two counts of theft; attempted escape; and bail jumping. In 1987, Russell pled guilty to burglary. By the mid-nineties, Russell had allegedly delved into the world of violent crime. He was arrested in 1995 and charged with felony aggravated assault and again arrested in 1996 and charged with domestic abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">\u00b613 In December 1997, Russell\u2019s proclivity for criminal behavior resurfaced, eventually culminating in his being sentenced to serve ten days in the Jail in December 1998. He was arrested and charged with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>two counts of felony assault, stemming from an incident when he allegedly fired a pistol into the air in a residential neighborhood while threatening to kill his neighbor and her barking dogs. Russell, who was allegedly intoxicated at the time, claimed that he had only fired a \u201ccap gun,\u201d not a lethal pistol. Russell eventually pled guilty to two counts of misdemeanor assault in connection with this incident and was sentenced to concurrent sentences of 180 days in prison, with 150 days suspended. In November 1998, the State filed a petition for revocation of Russell\u2019s suspended sentence. The hearing of December 23,1998, whence the District Court ordered Russell to serve ten days commencing on December 28, 1998, addressed this petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">\u00b614 As alluded to above, Prindel filed suit against Ravalli County asserting a claim of negligence. Both parties moved for summary judgment. The County asserted that Prindel failed to establish that it had a duty to incarcerate Russell or prevent him from harming Prindel. The County also denied that its failure to imprison Russell caused Prindel\u2019s injuries. The County additionally asserted the defense of judicial immunity. Prindel retorted that the County waived the affirmative defenses of superseding intervening cause, public duty doctrine, and judicial immunity by its failure to plead them.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">\u00b615 The District Court denied Prindel\u2019s motion for summary judgment and granted summary judgment in favor of Ravalli County. In its order, the District Court stated that a \u201cduty to protect another from harm\u201d may arise where there is a \u201cspecial relationship [that] is \u2018custodial by nature,\u2019 thus requiring the defendant to exercise reasonable control over his or her charge so as to prevent foreseeable harm to others.\u201d The court also acknowledged that in analyzing foreseeability in the duty context, the determinative question is whether the injured party was a foreseeable plaintiff. The court stressed that Russell was sentenced to prison in December 1998 because he had violated conditions of his suspended sentence for <em>misdemeanor </em>convictions. The court then detailed the process that generally occurs after it convicts a person on misdemeanor charges. The court order emphasizes that, consistent with local district court rules, the Clerk has two business days to file the minute entry with the jail ordering a person\u2019s incarceration. Here, the Clerk had until the end of December 28,1998, to file the minute entry. The court suggests that \u201c[d]ue to the absence of any documentation of Russell\u2019s sentence, due to the holiday in the midst of the two business days in which the minute entry was required to be prepared, due to the fact that the staff was shorthanded that Monday following the three-day weekend, and due to an unusually hectic day, Russell\u2019s date to begin his sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>was rescheduled by the jail staff\u2019 and that this rescheduling was an \u201cunderstandable result of [these] circumstances ....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">\u00b616 The District Court determined that during the early morning hours of December 30,1998, the County (by and through the Jail staff) did not have a special custodial relationship to Russell that would give rise to a duty to prevent him from inflicting harm on third persons, for the simple reason that the Jail had not physically taken Russell into custody. \u201cThe jail staff properly did not believe they had authority to admit Russell to the jail, so they made alternative arrangements ....\u201d Judge Langton concluded that \u201c[i]t is not reasonably foreseeable that the failure of the jail staff to take a person (Russell) who voluntarily presented himself at jail to serve a ten-day misdemeanor probation violation sentence for non-violent activity is likely to cause an unreasonable risk of harm to Prindel (a person Russell barely knew).\u201d Judge Langton observed that \u201c[t]here was nothing on the morning of December 28 to indicate that Russell would go out into the world and exhibit violent behavior.\u201d Consequently, he determined that \u201cPrindel has failed to show that the County had a legal duty to protect him, from Russell [so] Prindel\u2019s negligence claim against the County must fail.\u201d \u00b617 During discovery, Prindel obtained a copy of the presentence investigation report that was prepared after Russell was convicted of attempted deliberate homicide. Prindel claims that this report states that Russell was \u201cbooted out of the Missoula Pre-Release Center.\u201d Prindel subsequently filed a motion requesting that the court order the release of all information compiled or possessed at any time by the Missoula Pre-Release Center. Prindel argued that this information may be relevant or lead to the discovery of relevant evidence concerning what the County knew or should have known about Russell on December 28,1998. The County objected that the information held by another county at some indeterminate prior time is not relevant to the issue of what the County knew or should have known about Russell, nor will it lead to relevant information. The court denied Prindel\u2019s motion, reasoning that \u201cthis information was not within the purview of the jail staff (and most likely not in the purview of the County)... and therefore could not have a bearing on the foreseeability of Russell\u2019s act of violence against Prindel.\u201d Prindel argues that the District Court abused its discretion when it denied his request for access to these files.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">\u00b618 In addition, Prindel filed two motions requesting that the District Court order the Ravalli County Attorney\u2019s Office to provide Prindel with its files containing information concerning Russell. Pursuant to \u00a7 44-5-303, MCA, the first motion sought disclosure by the County <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>Attorney\u2019s Office of criminal justice information concerning Russell contained in its files, but excluding attorney work product and other privileged information. The County did not object to this motion. On December 24, 2003, the District Court ordered the Ravalli County Attorney to produce a \u201ccopy of any and all criminal justice information compiled on Richard Leroy Russell prior to December 28, 1998 [excluding attorney work product and other privileged information.]\u201d The parties then filed a joint motion, indicating that \u201cthe initial Order was unduly limited and Plaintiff will need additional information concerning Richard Russell to properly prepare his case.\u201d Accordingly, on February 18, 2004, the District Court found <em>\u201cto the extent applicable, </em>pursuant to \u00a7 44-5-303, MCA,... the demands of individual privacy do not clearly exceed the merits of public disclosure\u201d (emphasis added) and ordered the Ravalli County Attorney to produce \u201c[a]ll files and records concerning Richard Russell\u201d within twenty days.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On March 31,2004 (more than forty days later), having received a portion of the requested records, along with a letter from the County Attorney refusing to fully comply with the court orders, Prindel moved the District Court to compel compliance with the court\u2019s previous orders. Prindel argued that any work product privilege claimed by the County Attorney is undermined by the fact that the criminal case is closed and the documents requested are relevant to a pending civil case. The County argued that the joint motion covered only criminal justice information, as defined by \u00a7 44-5-103(8), MCA, but did not cover the County Attorney\u2019s notes reflecting his thoughts about the investigation and Russell\u2019s case. Prindel notes that the County Attorney, a named witness for the defense, though twice ordered to produce these documents, never appealed this order, nor sought a protective order, nor followed any other statutorily delineated procedure to protect against discovery of these documents. Instead, on June 21, 2004, the County filed notice that the County Attorney\u2019s office submitted its files for <em>in camera </em>review. After reviewing the County Attorney\u2019s files, including \u201cletters, notes, phone messages, memos, etc.,\u201d the District Court determined that \u201c[t]he only evidence that raised a flag was a paragraph in a letter\u201d that the County Attorney wrote to an officer of the Crime Victim Compensation Program in 1999. In that letter, the County Attorney wrote, \u201c[Richard Russell] has a long criminal history of violence. ... I prosecuted [Russell] for 2 counts of felony assault last <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>year, where he threatened neighboring women with a gun, firing it off a dozen times, yelling threats all the while. A threat with a knife was involved in that case.\u201d In declining to order these files released to Prindel, the District Court reasoned that this letter \u201cis colored by hindsight,\u201d and so presumably would not be relevant to the County\u2019s knowledge of Russell prior to the stabbing. Prindel contends that the County\u2019s failure to produce these documents pursuant to the court order violated Rule 37(d), M.R.Civ.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">\u00b619  We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P. <em>Lopez v. Great Falls Pre-Release Services, Inc., </em>1999 MT 199, \u00b6 16, 295 Mont. 416, \u00b6 16, 986 P.2d 1081, \u00b6 16. Summary judgment should be granted only when there is an absence of genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Rule 56(c), M.R.Civ.P. The party seeking summary judgment bears the burden of initially establishing the complete absence of a genuine issue of material fact. <em>LaTray v. City of Havre, </em>2000 MT 119, \u00b6 14, 299 Mont. 449, \u00b6 14, 999 P.2d 1010, \u00b6 14. Only after the moving party has satisfied this requirement does the burden shift to the non-moving party to \u201cshow by more than mere denial, speculation, or conclusory statements, that a genuine issue of material fact exists.\u201d <em>LaTray, </em>\u00b6 14. In evaluating a motion for summary judgment, \u201cthe evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, and all reasonable inferences will be drawn therefrom in favor of the party opposing summary judgment.\u201d <em>Lopez, </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">\u00b620  \u201cOrdinarily, questions of negligence are poorly suited to adjudication by summary judgment and are better left for jury determination at trial.\u201d <em>LaTray, </em>\u00b6 15. Nevertheless, the existence of a legal duty is a matter of law properly determined by the court. <em>Nautilus Ins. v. First National Ins. </em>(1992), 254 Mont. 296, 299, 837 P.2d 409, 411.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">\u00b621 We review a district court\u2019s order denying discovery to determine whether the district court abused its discretion. <em>Marriage of Caras </em>(1994), 263 Mont. 377, 384, 868 P.2d 615, 619. \u201cA court abuses its discretion if it acts arbitrarily without employment of conscientious judgment or exceed[s] the bounds of reason resulting in substantial <em>injustice.\u201d McDermott v. Carie, </em>2005 MT 293, \u00b6 10, 329 Mont. 295, \u00b6 10, 124 P.3d 168, \u00b6 10 (quotations and citation omitted, alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">\n<em>Issue 1: Whether the District Court erred when it held that Ravalli County owed no duty of care to Prindel.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">\u00b622 Prindel argues that the District Court erroneously determined that the County had no duty to protect him from Russell and thus erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the County. Prindel contends that the County had a statutorily imposed duty to incarcerate Russell and it failed to take reasonable measures to confirm that he had been committed to the Jail by competent authority. Prindel avers that the County\u2019s failure to confine Russell, as required by statute, constitutes evidence of negligence as well as negligence <em>per se </em>and he notes that the District Court failed to even address these statutory arguments. Prindel maintains that the County had custody of Russell from the moment that he reported to the Jail to begin serving his sentence and that he-a person in the immediate vicinity of the Jail-was a foreseeable plaintiff; therefore, the County owed Prindel a duty of reasonable care under <em>Lopez. </em>Under the circumstances, Prindel suggests, the standard of reasonable care obliged the Jail to inquire into the veracity of Russell\u2019s claim that he had been ordered by the Court to serve time in prison. Prindel asserts that the District Court erroneously overlooked the fact that our prior holdings do not require that the government have actual custody of a person before a duty arises, but merely the authority or ability to control the person who causes injury. Prindel stresses that if this Court requires the County to have physical custody of a person before it owes a duty to protect the public from that person, then the County could not be held liable even if it had possessed a court\u2019s commitment order when it turned Russell away. In addition, Prindel suggests that the District Court relied on a number of improper factual determinations to support its conclusion that the County had no duty to protect him from Russell. Prindel urges that policy considerations support the imposition of a duty of care on the County because the County\u2019s conduct is morally culpable and the imposition of a duty would prevent future harm to the public while placing only a minimal burden on the County. Finally, Prindel contends that the County has failed to properly present to this Court its argument that the public duty doctrine precludes the imposition of a duty and argues that even if the County has presented this issue, the public duty doctrine should be considered an affirmative defense that the County waived by failing to plead.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">\u00b623 The County contends that the District Court properly determined that the County did not owe a duty of reasonable care toward Prindel. The County suggests that the District Court properly determined that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>statutes cited by Prindel-which do not specify a class of protected persons, but are general in nature-did not give rise to a duty in the absence of commitment papers from the court. The County maintains that it never took custody of Russell because without the commitment papers, it had no legal power to incarcerate him. Though exceedingly vague as to the specific theory it relies upon, the County\u2019s argument rests on either the latent implication that the public duty doctrine shields it from liability because Russell was not in actual custody, or our observation that \u201c <em>\u2018a </em>person is not liable for the actions of another and is under no duty to protect another from harm in the absence of a <em>special relationship of custody or control.\u2019 \u201d Lopez, </em>\u00b6 24 (quoting <em>Krieg v. Massey </em>(1989), 239 Mont. 469, 472, 781 P.2d 277, 279) (emphasis in <em>Lopez). </em>In addition to denying the existence of a custodial relationship with Russell, the County insists that the foreseeability required to give rise to a duty was lacking because the Jail staff had no basis for anticipating Russell\u2019s violent outburst. The staff did not have access to Russell\u2019s extensive criminal record and he appeared to serve \u201cmittimus\u201d time, indicating that he had committed a misdemeanor and was not considered particularly dangerous by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">\u00b624 Finally, the County, without actually setting forth any substantive argument in its brief and instead referring this Court to its brief in support of summary judgment before the District Court, argues that judicial immunity shields it from liability and that it is entitled to summary judgment on grounds of causation and comparative negligence. We do not condone this practice of incorporating arguments by reference and thus will not consider the question of judicial immunity or whether the County is entitled to summary judgment on the basis of comparative negligence. After determining that the County did not owe Prindel a legal duty, the District Court indicated that \u201cthere is no need to address the causation issue.\u201d Our ruling herein will require the District Court to address the causation issue on remand. In this case, the factual underpinnings required to establish foreseeability in the respective contexts of duty and causation are inextricably intertwined. Therefore, we briefly discuss the issue of foreseeability in the context of causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">A. Additional Arguments Not Addressed:</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">\u00b625 It is difficult to ascertain from the County\u2019s brief on appeal whether the County intends to argue that the County owed no duty to Prindel because of the effect of the public duty doctrine, <em>see, e.g., Nelson v. Driscoll, </em>1999 MT 193, \u00b6\u00b6 21-22, 295 Mont. 363, \u00b6\u00b6 21-22, 983 P.2d 972, \u00b6\u00b6 21-22, or because of the general rule that \u201cin the absence of a <em>special relationship of custody or control,\u201d </em>\u201cthere is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>duty to protect others against harm from third persons,\u201d <em>Lopez, </em>\u00b6 24 (citations and quotations omitted) (emphasis in <em>Lopez). </em>Although the County argued on the basis of the public duty doctrine in its brief in support of its motion for summary judgment at the District Court level, it does not cite any authority concerning the public duty doctrine in its brief on appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Nor does it explicitly raise the public duty doctrine as a defense. Therefore, we will not address the public duty doctrine. <em>See </em>Rules 23(a)(4), 23(b), M.R.App.P. (\u201c[t]he argument shall contain the contentions of the [respondent] with respect to the issues presented, and the reasons therefor, with citations to the authorities ... relied on\u201d). Because we decline to address the applicability of the public duty doctrine, we need not resolve the question, raised by Prindel, of whether the public duty doctrine is an affirmative defense. Since the County does cite to <em>Lopez </em>and <em>LaTray, </em>both of which discuss a \u201cspecial relationship of custody,\u201d we presume that the County\u2019s argument concerning the absence of a common law duty is premised on the principle that we articulated in <em>Lopez.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">\u00b626 An obvious similarity exists between the principle articulated and applied in <em>Lopez </em>and <em>LaTray </em>and the public duty doctrine, which recognizes that a court may impose a duty on a government agency which has \u201cactual custody of the plaintiff or of a third person who causes harm to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Nelson, </em>\u00b6 22. In the future, when the issue has been properly briefed, it may be appropriate for this Court to weave these parallel strands of authority together. For now, however, they remain but theoretically bound by the common thread of a custodial relationship as a prerequisite to the imposition of a duty. \u00b627  We also decline to address Prindel\u2019s argument that the County\u2019s violation of \u00a7 7-32-2205, MCA (requiring a jail to admit persons committed by competent authority), constitutes negligence <em>per se. </em>In order to establish negligence <em>per se, </em>a plaintiff must prove that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5m\">(1) the defendant violated the particular statute; (2) the statute was enacted to protect a specific class of persons; (3) the plaintiff is a member of that class; (4) the plaintiffs injury is of the sort the statute was enacted to prevent; and (5) the statute was intended to regulate members of defendant\u2019s class.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-5\"><em>Schwabe v. Custer\u2019s Inn Associates, 2000 </em>MT 325, \u00b6 23, 303 Mont. 15,</p>\n<p id=\"b375-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>\u00b6 23, 15 P.3d 903, \u00b6 23. Here, Prindel\u2019s complaint clearly alleges that the County owed a duty to Prindel, that it breached that duty, that its breach caused Prindel to suffer an injury, and that Prindel has sustained compensable damages. Thus, Prindel has alleged the elements of common law negligence. <em>See, e.g., Henricksen v. State, </em>2004 MT 20, \u00b6 20, 319 Mont. 307, \u00b6 20, 84 P.3d 38, \u00b6 20. Prindel\u2019s complaint does not, however, allege any of the elements of an action for negligence <em>per se. </em>Consequently, he has not preserved this argument for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">\u00b628 We will, however, consider Prindel\u2019s argument that the County\u2019s violation of the statute is evidence of negligence. Logically, this would mean that the statute provides evidence of the existence of a duty and that violation of that statute is evidence of a breach of that duty. Thus, here, we need only consider whether the statute indicates that the County owed a duty of reasonable care to Prindel.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">B. Statutory Duty:</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">\u00b629  Under Montana law, it is well established that a duty may arise from a statutorily imposed obligation. <em>See, e.g., Gibby v. Noranda Minerals Corp. </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 420, 427-28, 905 P.2d 126, 130-31 (holding that an employer owed a duty of care to its employee under a statute); <em>Jackson v. State, </em>1998 MT 46, \u00b6\u00b6 62, 74, 287 Mont. 473, \u00b6\u00b6 62, 74, 956 P.2d 35, \u00b6\u00b6 62, 74 (noting that \u201c[i]t is axiomatic that applicable statutes may create a duty in a negligence action,\u201d and concluding that the statute at issue imposes a duty); <em>Rookhuizen v. Blain\u2019s Mobile Home, Inc. </em>(1989), 236 Mont. 7, 10, 767 P.2d 1331, 1333 (noting that a duty may be established by statute); <em>Massee v. Thompson, </em>2004 MT 121, \u00b6\u00b6 33, 43-45, 321 Mont. 210, \u00b6\u00b6 33, 43-45, 90 P.3d 394, \u00b6\u00b6 33, 43-45 (noting that a statute can give rise to a special duty for purposes of common law negligence and observing that \u201ceven if a violation of a statute does not constitute negligence <em>per se, </em>such violation may nonetheless be considered as evidence of negligence\u201d). Prindel asserts that the County owed him a duty of care on the basis of \u00a7 7-32-2205, MCA, which mandates that \u201c[t]he detention center administrator <em>shall receive all persons committed to the detention center by competent authority </em>and provide them with necessary food, clothing, and bedding.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Moreover, \u201ca prisoner convicted must be actually confined in the detention center until he is legally discharged.\u201d Section 7-32-2208, MCA. The statutes thus mandate that a detention center receive and confine a prisoner who is convicted by competent authority until he or she is discharged by equally competent authority. The determinative question then becomes, what constitutes \u201ccompetent authority\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b376-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>\u00b630  The parties agree that if the Jail had possessed a written copy of the District Court\u2019s order of December 23, 1998, this would have qualified as \u201ccompetent authority\u2019 committing Russell to the detention center. Essentially, the County suggests that if the Jail did not possess the actual written order, then Russell had not been committed to the Jail by competent authority. This argument is without merit. The authority of the District Court\u2019s order does not hinge on the Jail\u2019s actual possession of physical documentation of that order. \u201c[T]he oral pronouncement of a criminal sentence is the legally effective sentence.\u201d <em>State v. Wiedrich, </em>2005 MT 127, \u00b6 11, 327 Mont. 214, \u00b6 11, 112 P.3d 1054, \u00b6 11 (citing <em>State v. Lane, </em>1998 MT 76, 288 Mont. 286, 957 P.2d 9 (holding that when there is a conflict between an orally pronounced sentence and its written manifestation, the oral pronouncement controls)). In other words, the oral pronouncement of a criminal sentence provides the competent authority by which to incarcerate a defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">\u00b631 Although the Jail had not received notice of the court order via official channels (i.e., from the Clerk), we attribute this communication breakdown to either the office of the Clerk (which apparently failed to transmit documentation of the commitment order to the Jail by the time that Russell was due to report to the Jail), or to the Jail (which may have misplaced or neglected to retrieve the commitment order from the Jail\u2019s mail box in the Clerk\u2019s office). In either case, the failure of transmittal was due to the conduct of an agent of Ravalli County. \u00b632  Due to the Countys internal communication breakdown, the Jail\u2019s staff was unaware of the court order committing Russell. Nevertheless, when Russell appeared and reported to Anderson that he had been ordered by the court to begin serving a sentence, the Jail had constructive notice of the District Court\u2019s commitment order. A copy of the minute entry documenting the order could easily have been obtained by the Jail if its staff had expended even minimal effort to verify that the court had ordered Russell imprisoned at that time. As suggested by David Anderson, the Jail staff could have called the Clerk\u2019s office or they could have requested that Russell go to the Clerk\u2019s office, located in the same building, to retrieve a copy of his commitment papers. Instead, the Jail staff unilaterally rescheduled Russell\u2019s sentence. The Jail\u2019s ignorance of the court\u2019s order of commitment does not diminish the order\u2019s status as \u201ccompetent authority\u2019 to commit Russell. Nor does the dilatory transmittal of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>written order to the Jail by the Clerk.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> To rule otherwise would give unilateral power to the Jail staff or to the Clerk to override court orders by mere inaction. The courts\u2019 authority is not so tenuous. The court order of December 23,1998, provided competent authority for the Jail to admit Russell. The Jail staff and the Clerk lacked legal authority to unilaterally discharge Russell. The Jail staff likewise lacked legal authority to decline to take custody of Russell when ordered to do so by the court. Consequently, the statutory provisions quoted above evidence the existence of the Jail\u2019s duty to take Russell into custody for the protection of the surrounding public.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">\u00b633 In its order granting summary judgment in favor of the County, the District Court emphasizes that pursuant to Rule 2(H) of the Montana Twenty-First Judicial District Court Rules (1993), the Clerk of Court had until the close of business on December 28, 1998, to transmit the minute entry documenting the court\u2019s commitment order to the Jail. By its explicit terms, however, this rule governs only service of minute entries on counsel and merely establishes that such service must occur \u201cwithin two business days of the date any case is heard.\u201d Rule 2(H), Montana Twenty-First Judicial District Court Rules (1993). Unlike counsel who are in attendance at the hearing and do not need immediate written confirmation of the court order, the Jail staff does not normally have notice of the court\u2019s commitment order until actual receipt of the minute entry. It is reasonable to expect counsel (who attended the hearing documented in the minute entry) to wait a couple of days before counsel is served with a minute entry. It would, however, produce an absurd result if we interpreted this rule to mean that the Clerk may provide the Jail with a minute entry documenting a court\u2019s commitment order <em>after </em>a sentence is actually scheduled to commence, effectively nullifying the court-ordered commencement date. We construe, interpret and apply the law so as to avoid absurd results. <em>Marriage of Syverson </em>(1997), 281 Mont. 1, 19, 931 P.2d 691, 702. Accordingly, we reject the District Court\u2019s suggestion that the local rule governing service of minute entries on attorneys somehow excuses the County\u2019s dilatory transmittal of the written order of commitment to the Jail. Regardless, it does not affect the general rule that the oral pronouncement of a sentence provides legal authority by which to incarcerate a defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>C. Common Law Duty:</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">\u00b634 In <em>Lopez, </em>we held that a prerelease center owes a \u201ccustodial duty\u201d to prevent inmates with whom it had a \u201cspecial relationship of custody\u201d from harming certain members of the general public. \u00b6\u00b6 18-26; <em>see also </em>Restatement (Second) Torts, \u00a7 302B, cmt. e and situation F (1965) (noting that a reasonable man can assume a \u201cspecial responsibility\u201d towards another such that he \u201cis required to anticipate and guard against the intentional, or even criminal, misconduct of others.\u201d For example, such a duty arises when one \u201chas taken charge or assumed control of a person whom he knows to be peculiarly likely to inflict intentional harm upon others\u201d). In the absence of foreseeability, there is no duty; thus, the prerelease center owed a duty only to foreseeable plaintiffs. <em>Lopez, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 26-28; <em>LaTray </em>\u00b6 24. This duty extends to all \u201cmembers of the general public who would be placed within the foreseeable zone of risk created by the negligent supervision of a [defendant\u2019s custodial charge].\u201d <em>Lopez, </em>\u00b6 26. Thus, to determine whether the County owed Prindel a duty to protect him from harm by Russell we must first consider whether a \u201cspecial relationship of custody\u201d existed between Russell and the County. If so, we must then ascertain whether Prindel qualifies as a foreseeable plaintiff,</p>\n<p id=\"Al3\">i. Custodial Relationship:</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">\u00b635 The District Court reasoned that because the Jail never actually took physical custody of Russell, no special relationship ever formed that would give rise to a duty to protect Prindel from Russell\u2019s subsequent violent outburst. The court\u2019s rationale, however, ignores the definition of custody that this Court has repeatedly adopted when considering whether a custodial relationship exists that gives rise to a duty. The legislature has not defined \u201ccustody\u201d in the context of a prisoner, so we have adopted the following definition of custody: \u201c[detention; charge; control; possession. The term... may mean actual imprisonment ... or <em>mere power, legal or physical, of imprisoning or taking manual possession.\u201d Starkenburg v. State </em>(1997), 282 Mont. 1, 16, 934 P.2d 1018, 1027 (quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, 460 (1968)) (emphasis added); <em>see also Nelson, </em>\u00b6 28 (defining custody as \u201cimmediate charge and control ... actual imprisonment or physical detention or <em>mere power, legal or physical, of imprisoning or taking manual possession\u201d </em>(emphasis added) (quotations and citation omitted)). This definition is consistent with our determination that a \u201cspecial relationship of custody\u201d-giving rise to a legal duty of care-existed between an inmate and the prerelease facility from which he absconded and that this relationship and consequent duty persisted for several days after the facility lost actual, physical custody of him. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number><em>Lopez, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 13, 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">\u00b636  We have already determined that the court\u2019s order of commitment of December 23, 1998, constituted competent authority under \u00a7 7-32-2205, MCA. Accordingly, on December 28,1998, the Jail had legal authority to imprison Russell notwithstanding the staff\u2019s ignorance of that authority. Therefore, for purposes of establishing a special relationship, the Jail took custody and assumed control of Russell on December 28,1998. Despite relinquishing physical control over him, the County retained custody of Russell through the early morning horns of December 30, 1998, when Russell harmed Prindel. Consequently, the County cannot avoid liability for Prindel\u2019s injuries by invoking the principle that \u201cthere generally is no duty to protect others against harm from third persons.\u201d W. Page Keeton et al., Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts \u00a7 56, at 385 (5th ed. 1984). Because the County entered into a custodial relationship with Russell, it owed a special duty to certain citizens to protect them from a foreseeable risk of harm at the hands of Russell.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">\u00b637 In determining whether a defendant owes a duty of care to a plaintiff, we also weigh the \u201cpolicy considerations for and against the imposition of liability.\u201d <em>Jackson, </em>\u00b6 38 (quoting <em>Singleton v. L.P. Anderson Supply Co., Inc. </em>(1997), 284 Mont. 40, 44, 943 P.2d 968, 971). These policy considerations include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-6\">(1) the moral blame attached to a defendant\u2019s conduct; (2) the prevention of future harm; (3) the extent of the burden placed on the defendant; (4) the consequences to the public of imposing such a duty; and (5) the availability and cost of insurance for the risk involved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-7\"><em>Jackson, </em>\u00b6 39. Here, the balance of these factors support the imposition of a duty of care on the County. Certainly it is morally culpable to release a purportedly convicted person on an unwitting public without bothering to verify whether he had in fact been convicted, nor ascertaining what offense he had committed. The imposition of a duty will prevent future harm of this sort because it will encourage jail staff to ensure that persons actually committed to prison by legal authority are not set loose simply because verification of the sentence proves momentarily inconvenient. The burden to confirm the validity of commitment orders is minimal. As members of the Jail staff testified, it could be accomplished by a mere telephone call to the Clerk and perhaps a follow-up fax. Finally, the imposition of a duty benefits the public because potentially dangerous and volatile persons who have been adjudged guilty of violating the laws of the state, court orders and conditions of suspended or deferred sentences <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>will less frequently remain free to perpetrate harm. Moreover, the public suffers no significant detriment if a person who reports to a jail to serve time-but who has not actually been committed to prison by a court \u2014 must remain at the jail while the staff confirms the absence of an order of commitment,</p>\n<p id=\"Aqd\">ii. Foreseeability:</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">\u00b638 Having confirmed that a special custodial relationship existed between the County and Russell, which imposed a duty upon the County to protect certain third persons from Russell and that policy considerations support the imposition of a duty of care on the County, we must now consider whether Russell posed a foreseeable risk and whether Prindel qualifies as a foreseeable plaintiff. In other words, was it foreseeable that Russell posed a risk, and was Prindel within the \u201cforeseeable zone of risk\u201d created by the J ail\u2019s failure to incarcerate and properly supervise Russell?</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">\u00b639 We have long held that foreseeability is of primary importance in establishing the existence of a duty. <em>See, e.g., Mang v. Eliasson </em>(1969), 153 Mont. 431, 437, 458 P.2d 777, 781. Thus, \u201c[i]f a reasonably prudent defendant can foresee neither any danger of direct injury nor any risk from an intervening cause he is simply not negligent.\u201d <em>Busta v. Columbus Hospital Corp. </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 342, 362, 916 P.2d 122, 134 (quoting <em>Mang, </em>153 Mont. at 437, 458 P.2d at 781). The particular accident that ensues, however, need not be foreseen. <em>Ekwortzel v. Parker </em>(1971), 156 Mont. 477, 483, 482 P.2d 559, 562-63. In <em>Lopez, </em>we held that the Great Falls Pre-Release Center owed a duty of reasonable care to protect community members from being harmed by an inmate in its custody, notwithstanding the fact that he had been incarcerated for non-violent property offenses. <em>Lopez, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 5, 31. That holding reflects our implicit conclusion that a reasonably prudent defendant should foresee the risk inherent in inadequately supervising or controlling an inmate-since the inmate, when allowed to roam free may intentionally injure a member of the public in their person or property. While a reasonably prudent defendant may not foresee that such an unfettered prisoner would travel from Montana to Mongolia, for instance, and wreak havoc on unsuspecting foreigners, it is not beyond the bounds of reason to anticipate that he or she might cause trouble within the immediate vicinity of the facility where he or she ought to be confined. Thus, we explained that the prerelease center charged with legal custody of the prisoner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-6\">owed a duty of reasonable care to <em>all those persons present within the area to which [thatprisoner] could reasonably and foreseeably have access during his period of freedom. </em>That class of persons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>clearly encompasses Lopez, who resided relatively near to the Center in Great Falls. ... [T]he Center clearly owed nearby residents, like Lopez, a legal duty of care ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-4\"><em>Lopez, </em>\u00b6 31 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">\u00b640 Here, we conclude that the County, by and through the Jail, could have foreseen that Russell, if left free to roam, would somehow harm Prindel or others. The court had revoked Russell\u2019s suspended sentence and ordered that Russell serve time in prison because Russell admitted to engaging in disorderly conduct while intoxicated. During the week preceding the dawn of a New Year, anybody with a modicum of common sense and rudimentary knowledge of Russell\u2019s substance abuse history should have expected, let alone foreseen the possibility, that he would consume intoxicants. Moreover, based on his recent criminal conduct-engaging in disorderly conduct and assaulting his neighbor, allegedly with a gun-one could reasonably anticipate that he might become disorderly, confrontational, and perhaps even aggressively violent while intoxicated. While the record does not indicate that the Jail staff knew anything of Russell\u2019s recent criminal conduct, it does reflect that McCawley and Anderson were familiar with Russell and both knew that Russell had previously threatened a fellow inmate. McCawley, who witnessed Russell\u2019s threats toward another prisoner first-hand, had actually seen Russell display emotional volatility and aggression while previously imprisoned. The County contends that the Jail staff did not know anything of Russell\u2019s criminal past-his several felony convictions, some for violent crimes-at the time when they turned him away and thus could not have anticipated his, arguably unprecedented, violent outburst. This overlooks their avowed knowledge of his threats to a fellow inmate. Furthermore, if the Jail staff lacked knowledge of Russell\u2019s proclivity for violence, this was a natural consequence of their complete failure to make any inquiries concerning Russell\u2019s claim that he had been ordered by the court to serve time in the Jail. McCawley\u2019s testimony reveals that the Jail staff had online access to Russell\u2019s criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">\u00b641  The Jail staff had access to information that would inform them that Russell posed a potential risk to the community if left unsupervised and given unrestricted access to intoxicants. Yet, nobody bothered to look at this information before turning Russell away, just as nobody bothered to check whether the court had in fact ordered Russell committed to their custody on the morning of December 28, 1998. We do not condone such willful ignorance and will not encourage it. A defendant who has information readily available to him or her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>that would inform him or her of the foreseeable risk of a particular course of conduct, but chooses to act impulsively, without first making an informed calculation of risk, is not a \u201creasonably prudent defendant.\u201d Accordingly, one who makes decisions while blinded by a veil of self-imposed ignorance may not later invoke the unforeseeability of an otherwise reasonably ascertainable risk to defeat the existence of a duty. Nor may she avail herself of the benefit of information that she chose to ignore when pursuing that risky course of conduct. Thus, the County may not utilize Russell\u2019s actual criminal history to downplay his propensity for violence and argue that his later crime was not foreseeable. As far as the Jail staff knew (or cared), he could have been a convicted sex offender serving time for violating a term of a suspended sentence that ordered him to steer clear of schools. As Anderson testified, \u201c[w]e had no idea what kind of criminal he was.\u201d Absent some effort to ascertain the scope of the risk posed by Russell, the Jail staff should have assumed that he posed the same risk that any unknown convicted criminal might pose. One of the primary purposes behind incarcerating criminal offenders is to \u201cprotect the public [and] reduce crime.\u201d Section 46-18-101(2)(b), MCA. It is foreseeable that if a convicted criminal is not incarcerated as ordered and is left to his own devices, he will commit additional crimes and injure members of the community in the process.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">\u00b642  Finally, we note that Russell stabbed Prindel at a private residence within ten blocks of the Jail. Prindel resided within Ravalli County. Although the record does not reveal exactly where Prindel resided, his presence in such proximity to the Jail brings him well within the foreseeable zone of danger created by the Jail staffs unilateral decision to unleash Russell on the general public and renders him a foreseeable plaintiff. Consequently, the County owed a duty to Prindel to exercise reasonable care to protect him against harm at the hands of Russell.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">\u00b643 The District Court erroneously granted summary judgment in favor of the County on the basis that it owed no duty of care to Prindel. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">D. Foreseeability in the Context of Causation</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">\u00b644 The County has not properly presented to this Court the issue of whether it is entitled to summary judgment on the issue of causation. Nevertheless, because the County moved the District Court for summary judgment on this basis, it is appropriate that we comment briefly on the issue for the benefit of the District Court and for the sake of judicial economy. \u201cAlthough foreseeability is generally properly confined to the duty element of negligence under Montana law, where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>a dispute presents the issue of an intervening act of a third party, as here, we address foreseeability in the proximate cause context as well.\u201d <em>Lopez, </em>\u00b6 32. In the proximate cause context, we consider whether the unforeseeability of an intervening cause (i.e., Russell\u2019s intentional criminal act of stabbing Prindel) severs the chain of causation. <em>Samson v. State, </em>2003 MT 133, \u00b6 25, 316 Mont. 90, \u00b6 25, 69 P.3d 1154, \u00b6 25. In order to establish proximate causation, however, <em>\u201cthe specific injury to a plaintiff need not have been foreseen.\u201d Samson, </em>\u00b6 26 (quoting <em>Lacock v. 4B\u2019s Restaurants, Inc. </em>(1996), 277 Mont. 17, 22, 919 P.2d 373, 375-76), <em>overruling, in part, Lopez, </em>\u00b6 32, and <em>LaTray, </em>\u00b6 28 (to the extent that those decisions suggested that the specific injury suffered by the plaintiff must be foreseeable).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">\u00b645 \u201cThe causal issue of intervening criminal or noncriminal acts normally involves questions of fact which are more properly left to the finder of fact for resolution.\u201d <em>Lopez, </em>\u00b6 34 (quotations and citation omitted). \u201cThus, it is only <em>when reasonable minds could reach but one conclusion </em>that the question of foreseeability may be determined as a matter of law for purposes of summary judgment.\u201d <em>Lopez, </em>\u00b6 35 (quotations and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">\u00b646  In light of our foregoing analysis of the foreseeability of risk posed by Russell, we conclude that reasonable minds could differ as to whether Russell\u2019s intentional act of stabbing Prindel was so unforeseeable as to sever the chain of causation. Consequently, this issue of causation should not be decided on summary judgment, but should be resolved by the trier of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">\n<em>Issue 2: Whether the District Court erred when it declined to order release of records pertaining to Russell compiled or possessed by the Missoula Pre-Release Center.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">\u00b647 Prindel argues that the District Court abused its discretion when it denied his motion requesting that the court order the Missoula PreRelease Center (Center) to produce the records it possessed regarding Russell. Prindel notes that during the course of discovery, he became aware that Russell had been kicked out of the Center and posits that the Center\u2019s records may be relevant to the question of foreseeability in the context of causation or may at least lead to evidence relevant to this issue. The County responds that district courts enjoy broad discretion in determining whether evidence is relevant and admissible and Prindel has made no showing that the records could have been considered by the Jail staff or influenced their decision to not admit Russell to the Jail. Thus, the County concludes, the court correctly denied Prindel access to the records held by the Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">\u00b648 Rule 26(b)(1), M.R.Civ.P., provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>[p]arties may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, which is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action ... including the existence, description, nature, custody, condition and location of any books, documents, or other tangible things .... It is not ground for objection that the information sought will be inadmissible at the trial if the information sought appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">The scope of discovery extends to documents possessed by non-parties \u201cas provided in Rule 45.\u201d Rule 34(c), M.R.Civ.P. Rule 45(a)(3), M.R.Civ.P., in turn, mandates that \u201c[t]he clerk shall issue a subpoena, signed but otherwise in blank, to a party requesting it, who shall complete it before service.\u201d Thus, generally, Prindel could have compelled a non-party such as the Center to produce relevant documents simply by subpoenaing those documents through normal discovery procedures, but the District Court could not have compelled a non-party to produce documents pursuant to Rule 37, M.R.Civ.P. \u00b649 The records collected and preserved by the Center, however, constitute criminal justice information. Section 44-5-103(8)(a), MCA. Morever, these records qualify as confidential criminal justice information. <em>See </em>\u00a7 44-5-103(3)(e), MCA (defining as confidential criminal justice information any criminal justice information \u201cnot clearly defined as public criminal justice information\u201d). Consequently, Prindel could not gain access to the files compiled by the Center absent authorization from the District Court \u201cupon a written finding that the demands of individual privacy do not clearly exceed the merits of public disclosure.\u201d Section 44-5-303(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">\u00b650 It is difficult to discern the legal basis for Prindel\u2019s motion from his brief on appeal. Nevertheless, his motion, titled \u201cMotion for Order Directing Release of Criminal Justice Information,\u201d seeks the release of such information. Consequently, we conclude that Prindel has, pursuant to \u00a7 44-5-303, MCA, requested that the court authorize the Center to release confidential criminal justice information contained in its files.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">\u00b651 The District Court denied Prindel\u2019s motion because \u201cthis information was not within the purview of the jail staff (and most likely not in the purview of the County) prior to Russell\u2019s Pre-Sentence Investigation Report, and therefore could not have had a bearing on the foreseeability of Russell\u2019s act of violence against Prindel.\u201d The court essentially decided, without the court or either party ever seeing the information contained in the Center\u2019s files, that this information was not relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>\u00b652  \u201cRelevant evidence means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d Rule 401, M.R.Evid. While all relevant evidence is admissible, non-relevant evidence is not admissible. Rule 402, M.R.Evid. Thus, had the District Court been ruling on a motion seeking to admit the Center\u2019s files as evidence, a proper determination that the files lacked relevance would have provided a valid basis for exclusion. Prindel\u2019s motion, however, was not a motion seeking a ruling on admissibility, but a motion requesting that the court order release of confidential criminal justice information under the Criminal Justice Information Act. The Criminal Justice Information Act sets forth the criteria that a district court should employ when considering a motion for release of criminal justice information. <em>See </em>\u00a7 44-5-303(1), MCA (\u201cdissemination of confidential criminal justice information is restricted to ... those authorized to receive it by a district court upon a written finding that the demands of individual privacy do not clearly exceed the merits of public disclosure\u201d). Rather than engaging in the statutorily mandated balancing of competing concerns, the District Court impermissibly conjectured that the information contained in those files was unknown to the County before Russell stabbed Prindel. The District Court assumed too much regarding the County\u2019s ignorance of the Center\u2019s files. Information in the Center\u2019s files may indicate that Prindel came there from Ravalli County, or was sent to a Ravalli County facility after being kicked out of the Center. This would have a bearing on what the County knew or should have known about Russell. The District Court effectively ruled on a non-existent motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude the contents of documents that were not in possession of the court or either of the parties. By ignoring the statutory criteria and denying access to the Center\u2019s records on the conjectural basis that such records are not relevant, the District Court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">\u00b653  We now turn to whether the \u201cdemands of individual privacy\u201d \u201cclearly exceed the merits of public disclosure.\u201d Section 44-5-303(1), MCA. Pursuant to \u00a7 44-3-303(3), MCA, Prindel would be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any criminal justice information that he might receive. Thus, unless that information is admitted at trial, it will never become truly \u201cpublic\u201d information. To be admitted at trial, such information must be relevant to an issue in the case. Rule 402, M.R.Evid. The record does not reflect that Russell has asserted his privacy rights by opposing the disclosure of these records. Moreover, any such assertions of privacy would be undermined by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>fact that Russell is currently serving a <em>life </em>sentence at the Montana State Prison for deliberate attempted homicide and that his victim seeks the records in order to obtain legal redress. Any diminution of Russell\u2019s standing in the community caused by revelation of his conduct at the Center will be forever overshadowed by the fact that he once attempted to kill Prindel. In light of the foregoing analysis, we conclude that the demands of individual privacy do not clearly outweigh the merits of disclosing to Prindel the Center\u2019s records pertaining to Russell.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">\u00b654 Though ostensibly ruling on Prindel\u2019s motion seeking the release of criminal justice information compiled and possessed by the Center, the District Court justified denying Prindel access to this information because the information is not relevant. The District Court effectively ruled that this evidence is not admissible under Rule 402, M.R.Evid. Relevance is not required for the release of criminal justice information. Moreover, information need not be relevant in order to be discoverable, but need only be reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of relevant information. As demonstrated above, the Center\u2019s files are reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of relevant information. Therefore, we reverse the District Court\u2019s denial of Prindel\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">\n<em>Issue 3: Whether the District Court erred when it failed to compel production of the Ravalli County Attorney\u2019s files concerning Russell.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">\u00b655 According to Prindel, in response to the District Court\u2019s order requiring the County Attorney to produce \u201c[a]ll files and records concerning Richard Russell,\u201d the County Attorney produced some records but specifically declined to produce \u201cwork product, notes, correspondence and things of that nature\u201d unless specifically ordered to do so by the District Court. In the District Court, the County argued simply that Prindel had requested only criminal justice information from the County Attorney and that work product and notes do not constitute criminal justice information under \u00a7 44-5-103(8), MCA. The District Court later completed an <em>in camera </em>review of the files and records that had not been produced-presumably to ascertain which of them contained work product and other privileged information-and expressed concern over only one of these documents: a letter written by the County Attorney after Russell stabbed Prindel. The court found that this letter \u201cis colored by hindsight,\u201d and denied Prindel\u2019s motion to compel production of additional files possessed by the County Attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">\u00b656 Prindel argues that the District Court erred when it declined to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>issue an order compelling production of all of the Ravalli County Attorney\u2019s files concerning Russell, despite having issued two previous orders to produce such files. Prindel notes that the court\u2019s second order related to more than just criminal justice information and ordered the County Attorney to produce all of his files concerning Russell. The County argues that Prindel sought the County Attorney\u2019s files through an order to release criminal justice information under \u00a7 44-5-303, MCA, rather than by way of a request for discovery. The County maintains that the District Court properly exercised its discretion when it determined, after an <em>in camera </em>review, that the requested files, with the exception of one letter, were not relevant. As to that letter, the County contends that the District Court properly determined that it was colored by hindsight, and therefore not relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">\u00b657 The County\u2019s contention-that Prindel sought access to the County Attorney\u2019s files only through an order to release criminal justice information under \u00a7 44-5-303, MCA, and not via a discovery request-lacks merit. After Prindel initially requested access to the criminal justice information regarding Russell contained in the County Attorney\u2019s files, specifically \u201cexcluding attorney work product and any other information otherwise privileged,\u201d the parties jointly filed a second motion, indicating that Prindel would need \u201cadditional information ... to properly prepare his case.\u201d The court then ordered the County Attorney to release \u201c[a]ll files and records concerning Richard Russell.\u201d The court order, in stating that \u201cto the extent applicable,\u201d the requirements for disclosure under \u00a7 44-5-303, MCA, have been met, contemplates production of more than just the criminal justice information contained in the County Attorney\u2019s files. Even if the request had been limited to criminal justice information, this would not necessarily exclude letters, notes and memos prepared by the County Attorney. <em>See </em>\u00a7 44-5-103(8), MCA (defining \u201ccriminal justice information\u201d as \u201cinformation relating to criminal justice collected, processed, or preserved by a criminal justice agency\u201d but excluding the administrative records of a criminal justice agency). The sole letter \u201cflagged\u201d by the court communicates the County Attorney\u2019s understanding of Russell\u2019s assault against his neighbors. Thus, it qualifies as information collected and processed by a criminal justice agency. Without viewing the remaining files-which, as a result of the District Court\u2019s ruling, are not included in the record on appeal-we cannot say whether or not they constitute criminal justice information. \u00b658  To the extent that Prindel\u2019s request covered criminal justice information, the District Court should have weighed the demands of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>individual privacy against the merits of public disclosure. <em>See </em>\u00a7 44-5-<em>303(1), </em>MCA. As with the records compiled by the Center, the District Court should have ordered release of the County Attorney\u2019s files, excepting those individual files that failed to satisfy the statutory criteria. The District Court abused its discretion when it declined to order release of the County Attorney\u2019s files containing criminal justice information.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">\u00b659 To the extent that Prindel\u2019s request covered more than criminal justice information, it is governed by the rules of discovery. A party may obtain discovery of information that is relevant or that appears \u201creasonably calculated to lead to the discovery\u201d of relevant information. Rule 26(b)(1), M.R.Civ.P. Rule 34, M.R.Civ.P., provides that a party may serve on another party a request to produce designated documents. A party\u2019s failure to \u201cserve a written response to a request for inspection submitted under Rule <em>34, </em>after proper service of the request\u201d \u201cmay not be excused on the ground that the discovery sought is objectionable unless the party failing to act has applied for a protective order as provided by Rule 26(c).\u201d Rule 37(d), M.R.Civ.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">\u00b660 Prindel properly served a request for inspection of \u201c[a]ll files and records concerning Richard Russell,\u201d under Rule 34, M.R.Civ.P. The County did not apply for a protective order pursuant to Rule 26(c), M.R.Civ.P. The County also did not serve a written response to Prindel\u2019s request. Its failure to do so, therefore, may not be excused on the grounds that the discovery sought by Prindel is objectionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">\u00b661  Without question, the opinion of the prosecutor, a county employee, that Russell had used a handgun and knife when he assaulted his neighbors in 1997 is relevant to what the County knew or should have known about Russell in December 1998. Consequently, this information is relevant to the issue of causation. Moreover, the County Attorney is listed as a defense witness, so his recorded impression and recollections of the initial criminal case against Russell are doubly relevant, as these may provide means of impeaching him as a witness. Without scrutinizing them, we cannot say whether the other notes, correspondences and work product concerning Russell appear reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of relevant information and the District Court never made such a determination. Instead, the District Court\u2019s order reflects an implicit conclusion that because the County Attorney\u2019s letter \u201cis colored by hindsight,\u201d it lacks the requisite relevance to be discoverable. The District Court abused its discretion when it determined, <em>ex parte </em>and despite the absence of a filed motion requesting such a determination, that the County Attorney\u2019s files are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>not sufficiently relevant to be admitted into evidence. Such error is compounded by the fact that the parties had already stipulated to production of those files.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">\u00b662 Finally, the fact that the withheld documents may contain the County Attorney\u2019s work product, should not preclude discovery of these documents. Rule 26(b)(3) provides that a party may obtain discovery of documents prepared for trial \u201cby or for another party or by or for that other party\u2019s representative ... only upon a showing that the party seeking discovery has substantial need of the materials in the preparation of the party\u2019s case and that the party is unable without undue hardship to obtain the substantial equivalent of the materials by other means.\u201d Rule 26(b)(3), M.R.Civ.P. Nevertheless, \u201c[a] party may obtain without the required showing a [written and signed or otherwise adopted] statement concerning the action or its subject matter previously made by that party.\u201d Rule 26(b)(3), M.R.Civ.P. In applying these limits on the scope of discovery-which are identical to the limits contained in the Federal Rules-by federal courts \u201chave found the work-product privilege unavailable when a prosecutor in a prior criminal investigation later objects to discovery by a litigant in a related and subsequent civil lawsuit.\u201d <em>Ostrowski v. Holem, </em>2002 WL 31956039 (N.D.Ill. 2002), *4, and cases cited therein. A person who is neither a party to the litigation in which discovery is sought nor a representative of a party to that litigation may not claim work product immunity. <em>In Re California Public Utilities Comm\u2019n </em>(9th Cir. 1989), 892 F.2d 778, 781; <em>Doubleday v. Ruh </em>(E.D.Cal. 1993), 149 F.R.D. 601, 605-06 (noting that the People of California, rather than a particular county, is the plaintiff in a criminal prosecution; therefore, the work product of the district attorney may be discovered in a subsequent action against a county). A basic purpose behind the work product privilege is the concern with interfering with an ongoing criminal investigation. <em>In re Dept. of Investigation of City of New York </em>(2d Cir. 1988), 856 F.2d 481, 484. When the underlying criminal case has been closed, however, this concern disappears. <em>Ostrowski, </em>*4.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">\u00b663 Here, Russell has been convicted of attempted deliberate homicide. He has appealed, and his conviction has been affirmed by this Court. <em>State v. Russell, </em>2001 MT 278, 307 Mont. 322, 37 P.3d 678. Thus, the criminal case against Russell has been closed by the County Attorney and we assume, absent evidence to the contrary, that any preceding prosecutions against Russell have likewise been closed. Moreover, the State of Montana was the plaintiff in the prosecutions of Russell, for the stabbing and for the assault against his neighbors, though these cases were handled by the Ravalli County Attorney on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>behalf of its client, the State. Accordingly, Prindel should have access to the County Attorney\u2019s files regarding Russell, including the County Attorney\u2019s work product. On remand, the District Court should protect against disclosure of opinion work product prepared in anticipation of the present litigation with Prindel. <em>See Palmer v. Farmers Insurance </em>(1993), 261 Mont. 91, 117, 861 P.2d 895, 911, (distinguishing between ordinary and opinion work product and allowing disclosure of opinion work product only if the \u201cmental impression is <em>directly at issue </em>in the case and the need for the material is compelling\u201d); <em>see also </em>Rule 26(b)(3), M.R.Civ.P. (\u201cthe court shall protect against disclosure of the mental impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal theories of an attorney or other representative of a party concerning the litigation [in which discovery is sought]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">\u00b664  In evaluating Prindel\u2019s request for access to the County Attorney\u2019s files regarding Russell, the District Court failed to apply any of the relevant rules or statutory criteria. It did not ascertain whether the demands of individual privacy clearly exceed the merits of public disclosure of criminal justice information contained in the withheld files. It did not conclude that the information contained in the withheld files was not reasonably calculated to lead to discoverable information. Finally, it did not determine that Rule 26(b)(3), M.R.Civ.P., precludes discovery of any work product contained in the withheld files. Instead, it made an ad hoc, <em>ex parte </em>assessment of the relevance of the contents of the files themselves and decided that they were not relevant, and so would not be admissible. The District Court thereby abused its discretion by wrongly employing the admissibility standard in lieu of criminal justice information, discovery, or work product standards. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">\u00b665 As a matter of law, on December 30,1998, the County owed a duty of care to Prindel to protect him from harm at the hands of Russell, with whom it had entered into a custodial relationship. The District Court improperly determined that no such duty existed. Although Russell\u2019s act of stabbing Prindel was an intervening cause, it was not so unforeseeable that it breaks the chain of proximate causation as a matter of law. The issue of causation should be submitted to a jury for determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">\u00b666 The District Court abused its discretion when it refused to order the release of the files concerning Russell compiled and possessed by the Missoula Pre-Release Center. The District Court likewise abused its discretion when it denied Prindel\u2019s request that it order the County <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>Attorney to produce all files concerning Russell.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">\u00b667 We reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b391-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, WARNER, MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b366-8\"> The residence where this party took place is located within ten blocks of the Ravalli County Jail-</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b370-4\"> This order also ordered other law enforcement agencies to release various criminal justice information.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b374-6\"> The County cites to <em>LaTray </em>but only in order to argue that the District Court understood its nature and meaning.
