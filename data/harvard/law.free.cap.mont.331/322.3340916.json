Ingold (Ingold), seeks reversal of summary judgment in favor of Respondents Kenneth and Sharon Creveling (Crevelings), and interpretation by this Court of a restrictive covenant (covenant) contained in the warranty deed that effectuated the sale of real property from Ingold to the Crevelings. The covenant states, \u201cNo trailers or mobile homes are to be placed upon the property conveyed by this deed.\u201d At issue is whether the District Court was correct in determining that the covenant allowed: (1) temporary placement of trailers and mobile homes on the property, (2) placement of trailer houses and mobile homes for non-residential purposes, and (3) development of the property as a campground for recreational vehicles (RVs) and travel trailers. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">\u00b62 The restated issues on appeal are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-5\">1. Did the District Court err by ruling that the covenant prohibits only the <em>permanent </em>placement of mobile homes and trailers on the property?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-6\">2. Did the District Court err by ruling that \u201ctrailers or mobile homes,\u201d as used in the covenant, means only trailer <em>houses </em>or mobile homes <em>used for </em>residences'?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-7\">3. Did the District Court err by ruling that the covenant allows development of the property as a campground for RVs and travel trailers?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">\u00b63 The material facts underlying this dispute are not at issue. Ingold sold a portion of his land to the Crevelings in 1977 while he retained adjoining parcels. At Crevelings\u2019 request, the warranty deed transferring the property contained a restrictive covenant which states, \u201cNo trailers or mobile homes are to be placed upon the property conveyed by this deed.\u201d The deed contained no other covenants except those of public record. Nor did the deed contain any other language either explaining the purpose of the covenant, or defining its terms. \u00b64 During the summer of 2004, Crevelings negotiated the sale of their property to a third-party purchaser who planned to develop a \u201csportsman\u2019s or RV park.\u201d On July 1, 2004, Crevelings filed a petition for declaratory judgment in the District Court, seeking an interpretation of the covenant, and a judicial determination of whether the terms of the covenant prevented use of the property as a campground accommodating RVs and travel trailers. Ingold responded to the petition on August 13,2004. On September 24,2004, Crevelings moved for summary judgment, which Ingold opposed on October 5, 2004. The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of Crevelings on November 24, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b348-11\">\u00b65 Generally, we review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s summary judgment ruling, applying the same Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P. criteria applied by the district court. <em>Howard v. St. James Community Hospital, </em>2006 MT 23, \u00b6 14, 331 Mont. 60,\u00b6 14, 129 P.3d 126 \u00b6 14 (citation omitted). Here, however, as the material facts are uncontroverted, we limit our review to questions of law. <em>Travelers Cas. v. Ribi Immunochem Research, </em>2005 MT 50, \u00b6 14, 326 Mont. 174, \u00b6 14, 108 P.3d 469, \u00b6 14 (citation omitted). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>A district court\u2019s interpretation of a restrictive covenant is a conclusion of law which we review to determine whether the court\u2019s conclusion is correct. <em>Pablo v. Moore, </em>2000 MT 48, \u00b6 12, 298 Mont. 393, \u00b6 12, 995 P.2d 460, \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">\u00b66 Ingold raises three allegations of error by the District Court. First, Ingold contests the District Court\u2019s determination that use of the phrase \u201cplaced upon\u201d in the covenant prevents only permanent, but not temporary, placement of trailers and mobile homes on the property. Second, Ingold argues the District Court erred when it interpreted the covenant as preventing trailer <em>houses </em>and mobile homes <em>used as residences, </em>but not RVs and travel trailers used temporarily for camping purposes. Finally, Ingold disputes the District Court\u2019s determination that the covenant does not preclude use of the property for a \u201cRV park, which would provide facilities such as water and electricity, and sewage\u201d for \u201ctents, motor homes, or travel trailers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">\u00b67 <em>1. Did the District Court err by ruling that the covenant prohibits only the permanent placement of mobile homes and trailers on the property?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">\u00b68  General rules of contract interpretation apply to restrictive covenants. <em>Toaves v. Sayre </em>(1997), 281 Mont. 243, 245, 934 P.2d 165, 166 (citations omitted). Any person having an interest under a writing constituting a contract-like a restrictive covenant \u2014 may seek declaratory relief concerning any question of construction arising under the instrument. Section 27-8-202, MCA. Where a contract, and by extension a restrictive covenant, has been reduced to writing, the intention of the parties is to be ascertained, if possible, from the writing alone. Section 28-3-303, MCA; <em>Wurl v. Polson School Dist. No. 23, </em>2006 MT 8, \u00b6 16, 330 Mont. 282, \u00b6 16, 127 P.3d 436, \u00b6 16, (citation omitted). The determination of whether an ambiguity exists in a restrictive covenant, as in a contract, is a question of law for a court to determine. <em>King Resources, Inc. v. Oliver, </em>2002 MT 301, \u00b6 21, 313 Mont. 17, \u00b6 21, 59 P.3d 1172, \u00b6 21 (citation omitted). Restrictive covenants are strictly construed and ambiguities in covenants are resolved to allow free use of property. <em>Newman v. Wittmer </em>(1996), 277 Mont. 1, 6, 917 P.2d 926, 929 (citations omitted). Mere disagreement between the parties as to the interpretation of a written instrument, however, does not automatically create an ambiguity. <em>Wurl, </em>\u00b6 17 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>(citations omitted). Where the language of a covenant is clear and explicit, the Court must apply the language as written. <em>Wurl, </em>\u00b616 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">\u00b69 Here, the District Court looked only to the \u201cplain meaning\u201d of the language of the covenant, and not to extrinsic evidence, to interpret the meaning of the covenant. Therefore, the District Court must have concluded the instrument was not ambiguous and its words should be applied as written. The covenant states, \u201cNo trailers or mobile homes are to be placed upon the property conveyed by this deed.\u201d We agree with the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the restrictive covenant is clear and unambiguous. Therefore, Crevelings\u2019 and Ingold\u2019s intent in agreeing to the terms of the covenant shall be determined solely by the language of the covenant itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">\u00b610 The language of a restrictive covenant should be understood in its ordinary and popular sense. <em>Fox Farms Estates Landowners v. Kreisch </em>(1997), 285 Mont. 264, 268, 947 P.2d 79, 82, citing <em>Toaves, </em>281 Mont. at 246, 934 P.2d at 166-67. The District Court here recognized that Montana law gives no specific meaning to the term \u201cplaced upon,\u201d nor was the phrase defined by the parties in their deed. Therefore, \u201cplaced upon\u201d should be given an \u201cordinary meaning.\u201d We disagree however, with what the District Court determined \u201cplaced upon\u201d ordinarily means. The District Court found that \u2018\u201cplaced upon\u2019 contemplates a <em>permanent </em>placement of a trailer or mobile home on the property.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus the District Court concluded that <em>temporary </em>placement of trailers or mobile homes on the property was not precluded by the covenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">\u00b611 Ingold argues that the District Court\u2019s interpretation of \u201cplaced upon\u201d is wrong because the parties to the deed did not use any temporal modifiers, like \u201cpermanently,\u201d to limit the application of the term. We agree. \u201cIn the construction of an instrument, the office of the judge is simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted.\u201d Section 1-4-101, MCA, quoted in <em>Wurl, </em>\u00b6 20. In <em>Wurl, </em>we applied this rule in the context of an employment contract between a speech pathologist and the school district. In that case, unambiguous language in Wurl\u2019s contract stated that Wurl assented to \u201cother provisions\u201d outlined in a separate agreement which dictated Wurl\u2019s compensation. No language of limitation modified the phrase \u201cother provisions.\u201d On that basis, we concluded that \u201cto adopt the School District\u2019s interpretation of the employment contract would require us to ignore our proper role in interpreting contracts and insert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>language such as \u2018salary-related\u2019 into the clear, unambiguous and inclusive phrase \u2018other provisions\u2019 in the contract.\u201d <em>Wurl, </em>\u00b6 20. We declined to insert limiting language into the contract in <em>Wurl. Wurl, </em>\u00b6 20. Similarly, we must decline to insert limiting language into the restrictive covenant before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">\u00b612  As discussed in <em>Wurl, </em>it is not the proper role of the judiciary to insert modifying language into clearly written and unambiguous instruments where the parties to the instrument declined to do so. The unambiguous language of the covenant here contains no words to indicate the parties\u2019 intent to restrict the prohibition of trailers and mobile homes on the property, whether temporally or otherwise. Therefore, pursuant to statutory rules of construction and our case law, we must conclude that the District Court erred in its interpretation of the plain language of the covenant, and that the covenant as written precludes the placement of any trailers or mobile homes upon the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">ISSUE TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">\u00b613 <em>2. Did the District Court err by ruling that \u201ctrailers or mobile homes,\u201d as used in the covenant, means only trailer houses or mobile homes used for residences ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">\u00b614 Ingold next objects to the District Court\u2019s determination that the covenant disallows only trailer <em>houses, </em>and those trailers or mobile homes <em>used for residences.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">\u00b615  Relying on the same rules of interpretation outlined in Issue One, we determine that the District Court erroneously inserted into the covenant modifying language not intended by the parties when it limited the covenant\u2019s effect to prohibiting only \u201ctrailer houses\u201d and mobile homes \u201cused for residences.\u201d The covenant includes neither the word \u201chouse\u201d nor the modifying phrase \u201cused for residences\u201d to confine its application. The covenant\u2019s plain language gives no indication the parties intended anything but an absolute prohibition of trailers and mobile homes on the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">ISSUE THREE</p>\n<p id=\"b351-10\">\u00b616 <em>3. Did the District Court err by ruling that the covenant allows development of the property as a campground for RVs and travel </em>trailers?</p>\n<p id=\"b351-11\">\u00b617  We have determined that the unambiguous language of the covenant prohibits trailers from being placed on the property. Therefore, the District Court erred in ruling that the covenant allows <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>the development of an RV park to the extent that it would accommodate trailers or mobile homes in contravention of the covenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">\u00b618 For the foregoing reasons, we reverse.</p>\n<judges id=\"b352-6\">JUSTICES NELSON, RICE, LEAPHART and WARNER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"Ami\">JUSTICE WARNER</author>\n<p id=\"AEt\">concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">\u00b619 I concur with the Opinion of the Court. The only alternative to this Court\u2019s conclusions is that the warranty deed that effectuated the sale of the property in question from Ingold to Crevelings was ambiguous, and thus a trial would be necessary to determine the intention of the parties. However, Crevelings specifically argued that the deed is unambiguous and is to be interpreted as a matter of law. This Court will not formulate arguments or locate authorities for parties on appeal. <em>State v. Kearney, </em>2005 MT 171, \u00b6 16, 327 Mont. 485, \u00b6 16, 115 P.3d 214, \u00b6 16.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
