The jury also concluded that Tash committed fraud, negligent misrepresentation and constructive fraud against Circle. We reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-10\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b101-11\">\u00b62 The issues on appeal are:</p>\n<p id=\"b101-12\">\u00b63 Did the District Court abuse its discretion in excluding Tash\u2019s expert testimony while allowing Circle to present its non-complying expert testimony and other evidence at trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b101-13\">\u00b64 Did the District Court abuse its discretion in denying Tash\u2019s motion to compel discovery responses?</p>\n<p id=\"b101-14\">\u00b65 Did the District Court abuse its discretion in failing to grant a new trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b101-15\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b101-16\">\u00b66 Circle and T &amp; M Transporting are both Montana corporations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>and, respectively, have been in the seed and transportation brokerage businesses for many years. Ronald Tash is T &amp; M\u2019s president, and is a director and shareholder. Patricia Tash, Ronald\u2019s wife, is vice president, and a director and shareholder. Ronald and Patricia Tash are the sole shareholders and majority directors of T &amp; M.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">\u00b67 In August 1998, Circle and Tash entered into an oral contract under which Circle would purchase, clean and package specialty food grains and Tash would be responsible for marketing, brokering the transportation, and billing the customers. Under the agreement, the parties developed a profit and expense sharing arrangement.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">\u00b68 Circle claims that the business arrangement was a partnership. Tash maintains that the parties did not enter into a written partnership agreement, or take any actions normally associated with forming a partnership, nor did they recognize the existence of a partnership when filing their tax returns. Tash, however, in written correspondence with Circle, referred to the relationship between the parties as a partnership. Patricia Tash, who signed the letter with her husband, later explained that they were not using the term \u201cpartnership\u201d in its legal sense but rather as meaning a \u201cworking together\u201d relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">\u00b69 In late 1999, the parties began to have business disagreements and Circle attempted to purchase T &amp; M. However, when negotiations failed, the Tashes sold T &amp; M to a third party in May 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">\u00b610 Circle filed a complaint against Tash on August 27, 2001. Judge Mark Guenther originally presided over the case. Circle filed an amended complaint on September 3, 2002, and Tash filed its answer and counterclaim on October 4, 2002. A scheduling conference was held on November 21, 2002, during which a scheduling order was issued. Subsequently, Judge Guenther became seriously ill and recused himself. Judge Loren Tucker assumed jurisdiction of the case in April 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">\u00b611 A jury heard the case from June 28 through July 2,2004. The jury found that a partnership arrangement existed between the parties and that Tash breached the partnership agreement, its contract with Circle and its duties as sales agents for Circle. The jury also found that Tash had committed fraud, negligent misrepresentation and constructive fraud against Circle. By special verdict on July 2, 2004, the jury awarded <em>Circle $656,179.50 </em>in compensatory damages. Subsequently, the court entered judgment on July 7,2004, adding to the jury5s award exemplary and punitive damages and costs for a total award of $674,661.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>\u00b612 Tash moved to alter or amend the judgment or, alternatively, for a new trial. Circle responded that Tash\u2019s motion did not comply with Rule 59, M.R.Civ.P., and moved to dismiss it. The District Court noted that Circle\u2019s post-trial motion, if granted, would have effectively precluded Tash from presenting the merits of its position for a new trial. The District Court denied Circle\u2019s motion to dismiss, and reviewed the merits of Tash\u2019s request for amendment or retrial. The court ultimately denied Tash\u2019s motion. Tash filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">\u00b613 We will introduce further facts as they become relevant to our discussion of the issues Tash raises on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">\u00b614 For each of the issues Tash presents, we review the District Court\u2019s rulings for an abuse of discretion. The test for abuse of discretion is whether the trial court acted arbitrarily without employment of conscientious judgment or exceeded the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice. <em>VonLutzow v. Leppek, </em>2003 MT 214, \u00b6 14, 317 Mont. 109, \u00b6 14, 75 P.3d 782, \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">\u00b615 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion in excluding Tash\u2019s expert testimony while allowing Circle to present its non-complying expert testimony and other evidence at trial?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">\u00b616 The District Court held a scheduling conference on November 21, 2002, and issued its scheduling order on the same day. The order established a January 6,2003, deadline for the simultaneous exchange and filing of expert witness lists and Rule 26(b)(4) expert disclosure reports, as well as the exchange and filing of lay witness and exhibit lists. The deadline set for identifying rebuttal expert witnesses was January 27, 2003. The order further specified that it \u201cshall not be modified except by leave of the court upon a showing of good cause.\u201d \u00b617 During December 2002, the parties, without notice to or leave from the court, informally agreed to extend certain deadlines established by the scheduling order. The parties maintain that the decision to modify the schedule informally, rather than through the court, occurred because Judge Guenther had been diagnosed with a serious illness. The parties felt that this informal modification of certain discovery and witness disclosure deadlines would allow the case to move forward but would not affect deadlines that involved the court, such as motion deadlines, the scheduled settlement conference and pretrial hearing. The parties\u2019 counsel signed a written agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>under which witness and exhibit lists and expert disclosure reports would be due on February 1, 2003, and rebuttal experts would be due on February 14, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">\u00b618 Circle served its expert disclosure report on Tash on January 31, 2003, and its witness and exhibit lists on February 4, 2003. Tash served its witness and exhibit lists on February 25, 2003. Due to its continued difficulty locating and arranging for expert witness testimony, of which Tash kept Circle apprised, Tash served its expert witness disclosure report on March 12,2003. On March 13,2003, Tash moved to vacate the court\u2019s original scheduling order and enter an amended schedule allowing for limited expert depositions, extending the pretrial motions and settlement conference dates by sixty days, and scheduling a new pretrial conference at the court\u2019s earliest convenience. On March 25, Circle filed its objection to amending the scheduling order and a motion to strike Tash\u2019s expert on the grounds of untimeliness and inadmissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">\u00b619 On August 18, 2003, after Judge Tucker had assumed control of the case, the District Court granted Circle\u2019s motion to strike Tash\u2019s expert witness. The court based its decision on Tash\u2019s failure to file the expert disclosure in accordance with the deadline established in the original scheduling order, i.e., by January 6, 2003. Significantly, the August 18 Order farther provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-6\">[Circle] has requested that [Tash\u2019s] expert be struck for failure to comply with the Court scheduling order. [Circle] is not immune from the requirements of the scheduling order either. To the extent that [Circle] wishes to rely on evidence to be presented which is not in compliance with the scheduling order, such evidence should not be received.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-7\">Both sides should adhere to the scheduling order. To the extent that the parties have failed to abide by it, both parties should be prohibited from presenting evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">\u00b620 The court gave Tash through September 5, 2003, to object to evidence proposed to be offered by Circle which was not in compliance with the original scheduling order. On August 29, Tash requested an extension of time until September 16 to file its objections, and the court granted the motion on September 4. The record indicates that the order extending the time was served on Circle\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">\u00b621 On September 11,2003, Tash filed its objections to Circle\u2019s expert witness disclosure, lay witness list and exhibit list. It based its objections exclusively on timeliness, relying on the District Court\u2019s August 18 Order and asserting that Circle failed to file its disclosure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>and lists by January 6, 2003. On September 12, Circle responded to Tash\u2019s objection arguing that Tash had failed to file its objections by September 5, 2003; therefore, Circle argued, Tash\u2019s objections were untimely and should be denied. Tash replied that its objection was timely and in accordance with the court\u2019s September 4 Order extending the deadline for objections to September 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">\u00b622 On October 2, 2003, the court denied Tash\u2019s objection to Circle\u2019s expert witness disclosure, witness and exhibit lists on the grounds that it had not been filed by September 5. Tash promptly requested reconsideration, providing copies of its motion requesting an extension of time and the court\u2019s order granting said request. On October 31, 2003, the court issued an order agreeing that Tash had complied with the court\u2019s September 16 deadline, and apologizing for the court\u2019s error. Nonetheless, the court summarily denied Tash\u2019s request for reconsideration. As a result, Circle was allowed to present its expert witness at trial, and Tash was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">\u00b623 While Circle presents numerous justifications for the District Court\u2019s decision to exclude Tash\u2019s expert witness, we are concerned here not with a stand-alone discretionary expert exclusion, but rather with an order of exclusion that conflicted with two previous orders of the court. The court\u2019s decision to exclude Tash\u2019s expert while allowing Circle\u2019s expert to testify directly contradicted both the court\u2019s Order of August 18 declaring that both parties would be precluded from offering late-disclosed expert testimony, <em>and </em>the court\u2019s September 4 Order giving Tash an extension of time to file its objections. Moreover, the end result of this decision was significant, as Circle\u2019s expert was unrebutted at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">\u00b624  While we recognize that district courts have broad discretion is determining what evidence will be allowed at trial, that discretion nonetheless is not unlimited and must be exercised in such a maimer as to afford a fair trial to all parties. <em>Hulse v. State, Dept. of Justice, </em>1998 MT 108, \u00b6 15, 289 Mont. 1, \u00b6 15, 961 P.2d 75, \u00b6 15. In light of the court\u2019s previous orders, we conclude the District Court abused its discretion in excluding Tash\u2019s expert for untimely disclosure, while allowing Circle\u2019s expert to testify. Under these circumstances, either both experts should have testified, or neither should have been allowed to do so. We therefore reverse the District Court\u2019s refusal to allow Tash\u2019s expert to testify, while denying Tash\u2019s motion to strike Circle\u2019s expert, and the court\u2019s denial of Tash\u2019s motion for reconsideration of this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">\u00b625 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion in denying Tash\u2019s </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number><em>motion to compel discovery responses?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">\u00b626 In October 2002, Tash requested production of various corporate documents from Circle, including but not limited to Circle\u2019s Articles of Incorporation; its bylaws; the minutes of directors\u2019 and shareholders\u2019 meetings; copies of pension, profit-sharing and other retirement plans; and various other employment records detailing compensation paid, withholdings for social security, state and federal income taxes, and amounts paid to unemployment and worker\u2019s compensation insurance. On November 2, 2002, Circle produced the Articles of Incorporation but objected to producing the remaining documents on the grounds that the information requested was not relevant and would not lead to relevant information. Additionally, it objected to the production of employee records as burdensome.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">\u00b627 In September 2003, Tash moved to compel production, arguing that corporate documents could provide information which would refute Circle\u2019s claim that a partnership existed between Circle and Tash. On October 21, 2003, the District Court denied Tash\u2019s motion, citing Circle\u2019s concession that it had in its possession no corporate or employee records that contained evidence of the existence of a partnership between the parties. The court concluded that Circle\u2019s admission eliminated the need for discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">\u00b628 At the conclusion of the trial, the jury found that a partnership existed between Circle and Tash.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">\u00b629 Tash argues on appeal that the District Court abused its discretion in denying its motion to compel. It maintains that under Rule 26, M.R.Civ.P., and related case law, the court should have granted its motion under the assumption that the discovery request was appropriate. Circle counters that some of the information requested, in addition to being irrelevant and burdensome, was private and confidential. We note that while Circle made a fleeting reference to \u201cprivate and confidential employment records\u201d before the District Court, it did not argue against the production of any documents on these grounds. Additionally, the court\u2019s order made only a passing reference to \u201cprivacy issues,\u201d as it concluded that \u201cmore importantly\u2019 than privacy considerations, there was no demonstrated need for the discovery because Circle had already represented that there were no relevant documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">\u00b630 Rule 26(b)(1), M.R.Civ.P., states, in relevant part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-9\">Parties may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, which is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action, whether it relates to the claim or defense of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>party seeking discovery or to the claim or defense of any other party, including the existence, description, nature, custody, condition and location of any books, documents, or other tangible things and the identity and location of persons having knowledge of any discoverable matter. It is not ground for objection that the information sought will be inadmissible at the trial if the information sought appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">\u00b631 In accordance with Rule 26, we expressly stated in <em>Preston v. MT 18th Judicial Dist. Court, </em>(1997), 282 Mont. 200, 208, 936 P.2d 814, 819, that \u201cdiscovery requests are to be construed broadly in favor of disclosing any information tending to lead to admissible evidence. Whether that evidence is admissible is for the court to decide at trial ....\u201d Here, Tash complains that at trial, Circle relied upon documents encompassed within its denied discovery requests to support its contention that a partnership existed. Circle offered details of its profit- and expense-sharing arrangements, as well as other business records purporting to establish the existence of a partnership. Because these records had been denied to Tash, Tash was unprepared at trial to either challenge Circle\u2019s interpretations of these records, or adequately examine or cross-examine witnesses relying on them.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">\u00b632  We have held that information that may be used by a party for either direct or cross-examination of witnesses must be supplied prior to trial upon a proper request for discovery. <em>Hobbs v. Pacific Hide and Fur Depot </em>(1989), 236 Mont. 503, 512, 771 P.2d 125, 130-31. In the case before us, Tash was denied access to requested corporate information that was ultimately used or could have lead to information used by Circle during the trial. As we stated in <em>Hobbs, </em>\u201c[t]he objective of the District Court in controlling and regulating discovery is to insure a fair trial to all concerned, neither according one party an unfair advantage nor placing the other at a disadvantage.\u201d <em>Hobbs, </em>236 Mont. at 512, 771 P.2d at 131.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">\u00b633 Based upon the foregoing, we conclude it was an abuse of discretion for the District Court to deny Tash\u2019s motion to compel.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">\u00b634 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion in failing to grant a new trial?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">\u00b635  In light of our conclusion that the District Court abused its discretion both with respect to the expert testimony and the denial of discovery, we conclude that Tash is entitled to a new trial. Therefore, we need not reach this final issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">\u00b636 For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the judgment against Tash and reverse and remand this matter for retrial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b108-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, RICE and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b108-6\">JUSTICE WARNER</author>\n<p id=\"AnE\">concurs and dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">\u00b637 I concur in the Court\u2019s opinion that it was an abuse of discretion for the District Court to deny Tash\u2019s motion to compel, and that this abuse of discretion requires that the judgment against Tash be vacated and this matter reversed and remanded for retrial. I do not agree with the Court\u2019s conclusion that the District Court abused its discretion in excluding Tash\u2019s expert for untimely disclosure, while allowing Circle\u2019s expert to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">\u00b638 In discussing this issue, the Court notes in \u00b6 21 that Tash based his objections to Circle\u2019s expert witness disclosure, lay witness list and exhibit list exclusively on timeliness in reliance on the District Court\u2019s August 18 order. However, in moving to strike Tash\u2019s expert, Circle based its objections in terms of both timeliness and substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">\u00b639 Tash desired to call an expert witness to opine that a partnership did not exist. In its August 18 order, the District Court did not refer only to timeliness, but explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-10\">Moreover, the Court is not persuaded that Defendants\u2019 position is sound in substance. In this case, the determination of the existence of a partnership is essentially a conclusion of law to be drawn from the facts. The example noted in <em>[Heltborg v. Modern Machinery </em>(1990), 244 Mont. 24, 29, 795 P.2d 954, 956-57] is instructive. If a disclosure had been made timely, perhaps the expert could testify as to comparison of the businesses with which the expert may have been familiar. However, in this case, the existence or non-existence of a partnership is one of the ultimate conclusions which the jury would have to determine. Further, it appears that the jury can be properly instructed on the attributes of a partnership. Then the jury can determine whether a partnership exists. The Court has no doubt that the parties can suggest proper instructions for that purpose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-11\">\u00b640 At trial, Circle called a single expert, who testified only concerning damages. This witness did not state an opinion as to whether the relationship between Circle and Tash constituted a partnership, and he declined to do so during cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-12\">\u00b641 As the Court correctly notes in \u00b6 24, district courts have broad discretion in determining what evidence will be allowed at trial, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>that such discretion must be exercised in such a manner as to afford a fair trial to all parties. <em>Hulse, </em>\u00b6 15.1 cannot agree with the Court\u2019s decision that either both experts should have testified or neither should have been allowed to. Given the difference in objections made by the parties, and the difference in expertise of the witnesses, I would conclude that the District Court\u2019s decision to allow Circle\u2019s expert to testify while not allowing Tash\u2019s expert to testify falls within its broad discretion. <em>State v. Boettiger, </em>2004 MT 313, \u00b6 8, 324 Mont. 20, \u00b6 8, 101 P.3d 285, \u00b6 8.1 dissent from the Court\u2019s conclusion to the contrary.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
