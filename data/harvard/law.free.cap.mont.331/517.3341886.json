From his convictions, Buck appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"AIU\">\u00b62 Buck presents the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">\u00b63 1.

Did the District Court err in denying Buck\u2019s \u201cMotion for Expenditure of County Funds for Employment of a Medical Expert\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"AeM\">\u00b69 7. Did the District Court err in limiting the testimony of Buck\u2019s expert witness, Dean Wideman?</p>\n<p id=\"b543-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">\u00b610 During the early morning hours of October 25, 2002, George Evans (Evans), age sixty-four, was beaten to death by an intruder in his home in Kalispell, Montana. During a custodial interrogation two weeks later, Buck admitted that he had entered Evans\u2019 home and attacked him. In its Judgment and Sentence, the District Court described the incident as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-5\">On October 25, 2002, between approximately 2:00 and 3:00 in the morning, the Defendant unlawfully entered the Kalispell residence of George Evans with the purpose to steal a number of the firearms Mr. Evans was known to have collected and stored at that location. When Mr. Evans awoke during the course of that Burglary, the Defendant assaulted him with such violence that he broke five rifles over Mr. Evans\u2019 head and back... it appears that the Defendant also kicked or stomped Mr. Evans with sufficient force to cause multiple, bilateral rib fractures. At some point during the assault, he bound Mr. Evans\u2019 hands behind his back, duct-taped his eyes, and left him to die face down on the floor. The Defendant subsequently left the residence, stealing an unknown quantity of currency and a pair of Mr. Evans\u2019 boots.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">\u00b611 In December of 2002, the State filed its Information charging Buck with deliberate homicide pursuant to \u00a7 45-5-102, MCA. Buck pled not guilty. Thereafter, the State filed a Notice indicating that it would not seek the death penalty, stating \u201cthe prosecutor believes that there is non-sufficient evidence to establish ... the statutory aggravating factors necessary to impose the death penalty under Montana Law.\u201d \u00b612 In March of2003, the State filed notice of its intent to seek Buck\u2019s designation as a persistent felony offender, noting that he had been released from prison less than five years before committing the charged offenses. In April of2003, the State amended the Information to include a charge of burglary, pursuant to \u00a7 45-6-204(1), MCA, and an allegation that Buck had used a dangerous weapon in committing the deliberate homicide-an act separately punishable under \u00a7 46-18-221(1), MCA. Buck pled not guilty to all the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">\u00b613 Following the District Court\u2019s denial of four of his pre-trial motions, Buck filed an Application for Writ of Supervisory Control in May of 2003. We allowed the State an opportunity to respond regarding one issue, and denied the Application with regard to the other issues raised. Buck moved for dismissal of the Application after the outstanding issue was resolved in the District Court, and we issued an Order granting that request.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">\u00b614 Buck waived his right to a speedy trial and a jury was convened <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>on August 8, 2003. On the evening of the final day of trial, August 15, the jury found Buck guilty of the offenses of deliberate homicide and burglary, and found that Buck had used a weapon in committing the homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">\u00b615 In rendering Buck\u2019s sentence, the District Court stated, <em>inter </em>alia:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5E\">Given his prior criminal history, his repeated pattern of violence, drug abuse, and probation violations, the nature of the instant offenses, and his continued violent behavior while in jail, there is little, if any, realistic prospect for the Defendant\u2019s rehabilitation and safe return to a community setting. The safety of this community, and society in general, require a sentence that will guarantee the Defendant\u2019s incarceration for the remainder of his life.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">\u00b616 The court designated Buck as a persistent felony offender<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and sentenced him to a life term, plus fifty years, at the Montana State Prison. Specifically, the court sentenced Buck to a term of life imprisonment upon his conviction for the offense of deliberate homicide; a consecutive term of ten years for his use of a weapon in the commission of the deliberate homicide; a consecutive term of twenty years upon his conviction of the offense of burglary; and a consecutive term of twenty years upon his designation as a persistent felony offender. Additionally, the court specified that Buck would not be eligible for parole or participation in any type of supervised release program during the entirety of his sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">\u00b617 On appeal, Buck does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence upon which his conviction was based. He does, however, seek a new trial based on seven alleged errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">\u00b618 1. Did the District Court err in denying Buck\u2019s Motion to Suppress?</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">\u00b619 Upon request by law enforcement, Buck voluntarily went to the Kalispell Police Department headquarters on November 2, 2002. Before any questioning commenced, Buck was advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Buck also signed a form acknowledging his understanding of these rights. Buck then willingly spoke with Lieutenant Greg Burns (Bums) and Detective Sergeant Roger Nasset (Nasset) for several hours, during which time Buck denied any responsibility in Evans\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>death. During this initial interrogation, Buck did not request counsel, and no counsel was present on his behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">\u00b620 After the interrogation was terminated, Buck was arrested on a probation violation, as a suspect in the investigation of Evans\u2019 homicide. At this stage, Burns sought to obtain a scraping of Buck\u2019s fingernails. The following discussion was preserved by audio-video recording:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-5\">Lt. Burns: Joe, before you, uh, head down to the jail, there\u2019s one other thing I\u2019d like to do-it\u2019s, uh, just to get a scraping of your fingernails, or, I clean your fingernails.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-6\">Buck: Oh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-7\">Lt. Bums: Okay? Do you have any problem with that? This is a permission to search form that we use when we get something like that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-8\">Buck: Um, um, I don\u2019t know. Um, maybe I need to talk to a lawyer or something. I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-9\">Lt. Bums: Do you have a question about this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-10\">Buck: Well, yeah, um, ya know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-11\">Lt. Bums: Go ahead, I\u2019ll fill it out, you can read it and decide if you have a question. Maybe it will help you decide-know what I mean?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-12\">Buck: Yeah, its, I\u2019ll just wait and talk to a lawyer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-13\">Lt. Burns: You want to wait? You don\u2019t want to do this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-14\">Buck: Yeah, I\u2019ll just-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-15\">Lt. Bums: All right, I understand.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-16\">The discussion ended at this point. Buck was not appointed counsel and Burns did not take a fingernail scraping. Buck was then transported to the Flathead County Detention Center. While in custody, several days later, Buck declined to call an attorney after Officer Mike Cooper explicitly offered him the opportunity to do so.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u00b621 On November 8, while still in custody, Buck was transported to the police station where he agreed to another interrogation with Bums and Nasset. Before this session commenced, Buck was again advised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and he again signed a form acknowledging his understanding of these rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">\u00b622 During this interrogation, which was preserved by audio-video recording, Buck did not request counsel, and no counsel was present on his behalf. Buck initially denied any involvement in Evans\u2019 death. Eventually, however, after viewing videotaped statements of witnesses, Buck admitted entering Evans\u2019 house on the morning in question. He then stated that he had encountered Evans and beat him repeatedly. Thereafter, Buck stated he tied Evans\u2019 hands behind his back and placed tape over his eyes. He also stated that Evans \u201cwas cussing and yelling and screaming,\u201d but stated he thought Evans \u201cwas okay when [he] left.\u201d During this discussion, Buck repeatedly stated that he had not intended to kill Evans. Finally, Buck stated, <em>inter alia, </em>that he left the house with a pair of Evans\u2019 shoes and an unspecified amount of cash which he found in a drawer. Nasset then sought and received verbal confirmation from Buck that he had made these statements of his \u201cown free will.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">\u00b623 In March of 2003, Buck filed a Motion seeking to suppress his confession. In his brief supporting the Motion, Buck argued that his confession was obtained illegally because the law enforcement officers did not honor his request for counsel before the second interrogation. The State filed a response, arguing that Buck\u2019s confession was obtained legally because his request for counsel was limited to the bodily search Burns had proposed, and because he waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights before the second interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">\u00b624 The District Court held a suppression hearing in May of 2003. At this hearing, the court viewed the audio-video recording of the discussion between Buck and Burns, noted above, wherein Buck declined to undergo a fingernail scraping without first consulting a lawyer. Burns testified that he believed Buck\u2019s statements regarding \u201ca lawyer\u201d were made in response to the request for a fingernail scraping. Buck testified that he understood the form he had signed which advised him of his rights. He also testified that he understood his right to have counsel present before being questioned, and that he understood his right to terminate a police interrogation and request counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">\u00b625 In rendering its ruling, the District Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-8\">Clearly, from the evidence that\u2019s been presented to me today, during the course of interrogation Mr. Buck never asked for a lawyer, in fact he waived such twice in writing after having-provided his signature after having been advised. His mention of a lawyer with the statement \u201cmaybe I need to talk to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>a lawyer or something\u201d on November 2nd was clearly after the interrogation had stopped, and in the Court\u2019s mind in direct response to Lieutenant Bums\u2019 question-or request for a fingernail scraping, a search of his person. When Mr. Buck made that statement the search did not occur, nor did any further interrogation occur at that time, it had ceased.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-4\">And, again, I want to emphasize, it appears clear to the Court that Mr. Buck\u2019s comment was in direct response to the request from Officer Burns for a scraping.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Upon these findings, the District Court denied Buck\u2019s Motion to Suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">\u00b626 At trial, the prosecutor informed the court that he would not play the recording of Buck\u2019s confession for the jury because it contained \u201ca whole range of things, including prior crimes, prior methamphetamine use, his time in prison, and that stuff is clearly not properly presented to the jury.\u201d Accordingly, the prosecution presented Buck\u2019s confession to the jury through Nasset\u2019s testimony. The State also presented similar evidence through Joel Kelley, a friend of Buck\u2019s, and Jonathan Keys, Buck\u2019s cousin. Both of these individuals testified that shortly after Evans\u2019 death, Buck told them that he had attacked Evans.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">\u00b627 On appeal, Buck claims that the District Court erred in denying his Motion to Suppress. Despite the District Court\u2019s finding to the contrary, Buck claims that his references to a lawyer occurred before the first interrogation was terminated. Similarly, Buck asserts that his references to a lawyer \u201cmerely coincided\u201d with Burns\u2019 request to conduct a bodily search, despite the District Court\u2019s finding that Buck\u2019s statements were made in direct response to Burns\u2019 request. Buck also asserts that he was not capable, based on his education, of distinguishing between a request for counsel for the interrogation, and a request for counsel for the purposes of a bodily search. Finally, Buck argues that his references to a lawyer were not limited to the bodily search which Bums sought to conduct, but were sufficient to invoke his right to counsel in custodial interrogation. Upon these contentions, Buck argues that the law enforcement officers violated his right to counsel when they conducted the second interrogation without counsel present on his behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">\u00b628 Before addressing these arguments, we note two additional arguments which do not merit resolution here. First, Buck argues, in conclusory fashion, that counsel should have immediately been appointed for him pursuant to his probation violation. We will not address this argument because Buck fails to support it with analysis or citation to legal authority, as required by Rule 23(a)(4), M.R.App.P. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number><em>State v. Lynch, </em>2005 MT 337, \u00b6 14, 330 Mont. 74, \u00b6 14, 125 P.3d 1148, \u00b6 14. Second, Buck argues that his confession was involuntary because Nasset utilized \u201cthe coercive technique known as the Reid technique\u201d in the interrogation. Buck states that this technique requires the interrogating officer to lie to the suspect, and claims that it has \u201cgenerated many false confessions.\u201d Buck also notes that Nasset admitted lying to him during the interrogation, and he claims that this technique violated his right to due process and his right to a fair trial. However, Buck does not specify any particular lie in his brief. Moreover, Buck cites no legal authority in support of his argument. Again, we will not address this argument because Buck fails to support it with analysis or citation to legal authority, as required by Rule 23(a)(4), M.R.App.P. <em>Lynch, </em>\u00b6 14. As we have stated, this Court is not obligated to conduct legal research on an appellant\u2019s behalf or develop legal analysis that may lend support to his or her position. <em>State v. Zakovi, </em>2005 MT 91, \u00b6 28, 326 Mont. 475, \u00b6 28, 110 P.3d 469, \u00b6 28 (citing <em>Johansen v. State, Dept. of Natural Resources, </em>1998 MT 51, \u00b6 24, 288 Mont. 39, \u00b6 24, 955 P.2d 653, \u00b6 24). We do note, however, that this Court does not condone the use of lies and deceit to gain a confession or admission from an individual in custodial interrogation, as these practices may render a confession involuntary. <em>State v. Reavley, </em>2003 MT 298, \u00b6\u00b6 16, 43, 318 Mont. 150, \u00b6\u00b6 16, 43, 79 P.3d 270, \u00b6\u00b6 16, 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">\u00b629 We review a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress to determine whether the court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether those findings were correctly applied as a matter of law. <em>State v. Ochadleus, </em>2005 MT 88, \u00b6 16, 326 Mont. 441, \u00b6 16, 110 P.3d 448, \u00b6 16 (citing <em>State v. Lanegan, </em>2004 MT 134, \u00b6 10, 321 Mont. 349, \u00b6 10, 91 P.3d 578, \u00b6 10). A district court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous if they are not supported by substantial evidence, if the court has misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if our review of the record leaves us with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. <em>Ochadleus, </em>\u00b6 16 (citing <em>Lanegan, </em>\u00b6 10).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">\u00b630 We first address Buck\u2019s challenges to the District Court\u2019s factual findings. The court found that Buck\u2019s statements regarding a lawyer were made \u201cclearly after the interrogation had stopped.\u201d Buck contradicts this finding, claiming that his statements occurred during the first interrogation. However, Buck fails to provide any explanation as to how the court may have erred. The audio-video recording before us fully supports the court\u2019s finding. It shows that Buck was in a holding area, rather than the interrogation room, when Burns sought to conduct a fingernail scraping. It also shows that this discussion took <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>place while Buck was being processed for transportation to the detention center. The court also found that Buck\u2019s statements regarding a lawyer were made \u201cin direct response\u201d to Burns\u2019 request to conduct a fingernail scraping. Buck contradicts this finding, asserting that his statements \u201cmerely coincided\u201d with Burns\u2019 request. Here again, Buck fails to provide any explanation as to how the court may have erred, and the audio-video recording before us fully supports the court\u2019s finding. It is well settled that a district court\u2019s decision is presumed correct and an appellant bears the burden of establishing error. <em>State v. Aakre, </em>2002 MT 101, \u00b6 43, 309 Mont. 403, \u00b6 43, 46 P.3d 648, \u00b6 43 <em>(citing In re </em>1998 MT 142, \u00b6 18, 289 Mont. 232, \u00b6 18, 961 P.2d 105, \u00b6 18). Here, Buck\u2019s cursory arguments fail to demonstrate that the court\u2019s factual findings were clearly erroneous. Accordingly, based on the court\u2019s findings and the evidence before us, we proceed on the assumption that the first interrogation ended before Burns sought to conduct a fingernail scraping and, therefore, before Buck made any reference to a lawyer. We also assume that Buck\u2019s request for counsel was made in direct response to Bums\u2019 request to conduct a fingernail scraping.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">\u00b631  Buck also claims that he was not capable of distinguishing between a request for counsel for the interrogation, and a request for counsel for the purposes of a bodily search. Buck cites no evidence demonstrating that he did not understand his rights. Rather, he relies on the fact that he did not advance beyond ninth grade in school. Buck also asserts that he is \u201ca layperson ... uneducated in constitutional principle and legal nicety.\u201d <em>See State v. Johnson </em>(1986), 221 Mont. 503, 514, 719 P.2d 1248, 1255 (holding that \u201cprecise words\u201d need not be uttered to invoke the right to counsel, upon the recognition that \u201c[l]ay people are not learned in constitutional principle nor legal nicety\u2019). We find no merit in Buck\u2019s argument. While we acknowledge that some individuals indeed may be unable to understand the import of making a request for counsel in two different contexts, Buck has not demonstrated such an infirmity. In fact, Buck testified at the suppression hearing that he did understand his right to counsel. As we have held, an appellant bears the burden of establishing error. <em>Aakre, </em>\u00b6 43 <em>(citing In re M.J.W., </em>\u00b6 18). Here, Buck\u2019s cursory argument fails to meet that burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">\u00b632 Before addressing Buck\u2019s remaining argument, we review the law governing the admissibility of confessions obtained in custodial interrogation. In doing so, we address an incongruity in our case law on this subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">\u00b633 The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment, <em>Gideon v. Wainwright </em>(1963), 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799, provides that \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right... to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defense.\u201d The Sixth Amendment right to counsel exists \u201cin order to protect the fundamental right to a fair <em>trial Lockhart v. Fretwell </em>(1993), 506 U.S. 364, 368, 113 S.Ct. 838, 842, 122 L.Ed.2d 180 (citing <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 684, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2063, 80 L.Ed.2d 674). This right is triggered at or after the time that judicial proceedings have been initiated, whether by way of formal charge, preliminary hearing, indictment, information, or arraignment. <em>Fellers v. United States </em>(2004), 540 U.S. 519, 523, 124 S.Ct. 1019, 1022, 157 L.Ed.2d 1016 (citing <em>Brewer v. Williams </em>(1977), 430 U.S. 387, 398, 97 S.Ct. 1232, 1239, 51 L.Ed.2d 424). Absent a knowing and intelligent waiver of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel, no person may be imprisoned for any offense unless he or she was represented by counsel at trial. <em>Alabama v. Shelton </em>(2002), 535 U.S. 654, 662, 122 S.Ct. 1764, 1770, 152 L.Ed.2d 888 (citing <em>Argersinger v.

New Jersey </em>(1966), 384 U.S. 719, 729, 86 S.Ct. 1772, 1779, 16 L.Ed.2d 882. The Court has also stated that this privilege constitutes</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-5\">an important advance in the development of our liberty .... It reflects many of our fundamental values and most noble aspirations: our ... preference for an accusatorial rather than an inquisitorial system of criminal justice; our fear that self-incriminating statements will be elicited by inhumane treatment and abuses; our sense of fair play which dictates a fair state-individual balance by requiring the government to leave the individual alone until good cause is shown for disturbing him and by requiring the government in its contest with the individual to shoulder the entire load,... and our realization that the privilege, while sometimes a shelter to the guilty, is often a protection to the innocent. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-6\">Most, if not all, of these policies and purposes are defeated when a witness can be whipsawed into incriminating himself.... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number><em>Murphy v.

After administering several field sobriety tests which Johnson either refused or was unable to perform, Peterson arrested Johnson and placed him in the patrol car. <em>Johnson, </em>221 Mont. at 506, 719 P.2d at 1250. Peterson stated that he would record Johnson\u2019s statements and then advised him of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. <em>Johnson, </em>221 Mont. at 506, 719 P.2d at 1250.

Johnson sought to suppress his recorded statement, but the district court ruled that it was admissible. <em>Johnson, </em>221 Mont. at 510-11, 719 P.2d at 1253.

II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution.\u201d Johnson, </em>221 Mont. at 514, 719 P.2d at 1255 (emphasis added). However, Article II, Section 24, provides for the right to counsel in \u201ccriminal prosecutions.\u201d This right is distinct from the right to counsel in custodial interrogation, which exists to secure the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination provided for in Section 25. <em>See McNeil, </em>501 U.S. at 177-78, 111 S.Ct. at 2208-09; <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 469, 86 S.Ct. at 1625.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">\u00b646 We perpetuated this error in <em>State v. Spang, </em>2002 MT 120, 310 Mont. 52, 48 P.3d 727, another case where we considered whether a suspect had invoked the right to counsel in custodial interrogation. We set out on the right path when we recognized that the <em>Miranda </em>right to counsel in custodial interrogation serves to protect the Fifth Amendment privilege against compulsory self-incrimination, <em>Spang, </em>\u00b6 20, which is mirrored in Article II, Section 25, of the Montana Constitution. However, we then inexplicably eschewed Section 25 when we relied on <em>Johnson </em>for the proposition that \u201cthe right to counsel afforded by Article II, Section 24, of the Montana Constitution is broader than the rights afforded by the United States Constitution.\u201d <em>Spang, </em>\u00b6 22. Ultimately, our decision improperly identified the Section 24 right to counsel in \u201ccriminal prosecutions\u201d as the right which Spang invoked in his custodial interrogation. <em>Spang, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 20-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">\u00b647 It is clear that <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Spang </em>erroneously conflated the Section 25 privilege against compulsory self-incrimination, and its attendant right to counsel in custodial interrogation, with the Section 24 right to counsel in \u201ccriminal prosecutions.\u201d Of course, a suspect can no more invoke the Section 24 right to counsel at the time of a custodial interrogation than he can invoke the right to trial by jury before being charged with a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">\u00b648 The right to counsel in custodial interrogation clearly exists only in relation to Section 25, because it serves to secure the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination provided for in Section 25. <em>See Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 469, 86 S.Ct. at 1625. It is not a sub-part of the Section 24 right to counsel, nor is it connected thereto in any way. Thus, to the extent that <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Spang </em>identified the Section 24 right to counsel as a right which may be invoked in custodial interrogation, they are hereby overruled. However, we do not reject the principal guidance provided <em>inJohnson-i.e., </em>that form shall not prevail <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>over substance where invocation of the right to counsel in custodial interrogation is concerned. <em>Johnson, </em>221 Mont. at 514, 719 P.2d at 1255. Stated another way, we still adhere to the rule that invocation of that right does not depend on the use of any particular words; rather, it depends on the evident purpose of the suspect\u2019s statement, as viewed in light of the circumstances and in light of the rule that requests for counsel must be construed broadly. <em>Johnson, </em>221 Mont. at 514, 719 P.2d at 1255.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">\u00b649 We now turn to Buck\u2019s primary contention-the argument that his references to a lawyer were not limited to the bodily search which Burns sought to conduct, but were sufficient to invoke his right to counsel in the subsequent custodial interrogation. Pursuant to <em>Johnson, </em>a suspect\u2019s statement evincing a general desire for assistance in dealings with law enforcement, even though vague and not containing a reference to legal counsel, is sufficient to invoke the right to counsel in custodial interrogation. <em>Johnson, </em>221 Mont. at 506-14, 719 P.2d at 1250-55. Here, however, we face an entirely different type of statement than was uttered in Johnson. Buck specifically stated his desire to speak to <em>\u201ca </em>lawyer,\u201d and did so solely with regard to his decision to decline or submit to the bodily search which Burns sought to conduct. Moreover, Buck\u2019s statements were made in an entirely different context than those which we considered in <em>Johnson. </em>Here, Buck made his statements regarding <em>\u201ca </em>lawyer\u201d after he had earlier declined to consult an attorney when the police inform ed him of his right to do so, and after he had willingly submitted to several hours of questioning.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">\u00b650 The resolution of this issue depends on the legal effect of Buck\u2019s statements made in response to Burns\u2019 request to conduct a fingernail scraping. As we have no Montana precedent on point, we look to <em>Connecticut v. Barrett </em>(1987), 479 U.S. 523, 107 S.Ct. 828, 93 L.Ed.2d 920, wherein the United States Supreme Court considered a defendant\u2019s \u201climited\u201d invocation of the right to counsel. In <em>Barrett, </em>the Court reaffirmed the principle that a request for counsel must be broadly construed. <em>Barrett, </em>479 U.S. at 529, 107 S.Ct. at 832 (citing <em>Jackson, </em>475 U.S. at 633, 106 S.Ct. at 1409). However, the Court also indicated that an individual may invoke his or her right to counsel for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>limited purposes. <em>Barrett, </em>479 U.S. at 527-30, 107 S.Ct. at 831-32.</p>\n<p id=\"A39\">\u00b651 While in police custody as a suspect in a sexual assault, Barrett was advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and signed a form acknowledging that fact. <em>Barrett, </em>479 U.S. at 525, 107 S.Ct. at 830. Barrett then stated that \u201che would not give the police any written statements but he had no problem in talking about the incident.\u201d <em>Barrett, </em>479 U.S. at 525, 107 S.Ct. at 830. Approximately thirty minutes later, Barrett was again advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and signed a form acknowledging that fact. <em>Barrett, </em>479 U.S. at 525, 107 S.Ct. at 830. Barrett \u201cstated that he understood his rights, and told the officers that he would not give a written statement unless his attorney was present but had \u2018no problem\u2019 talking about the incident.\u201d <em>Barrett, </em>479 U.S. at 525, 107 S.Ct. at 830. During the subsequent interrogation, in the absence of counsel, Barrett gave an oral statement admitting his involvement in the sexual assault. <em>Barrett, </em>479 U.S. at 525, 107 S.Ct. at 830. Officers conducted a second interrogation after discovering that the tape recorder used to preserve Barrett\u2019s statement had malfunctioned. <em>Barrett, </em>479 U.S. at 525-26, 107 S.Ct. at 830. Barrett was again advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and he again declared his willingness to talk about the incident, but stated that \u201che did not want to put anything in writing until his attorney came.\u201d <em>Barrett, </em>479 U.S. at 526, 107 S.Ct. at 830. Barrett then repeated his confession. <em>Barrett, </em>479 U.S. at 526, 107 S.Ct. at 830. Upon discovering that the tape recorder had again malfunctioned, an officer created a written record of his recollection of Barrett\u2019s statement. <em>Barrett, </em>479 U.S. at 526,107 S.Ct. at 830.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">\u00b652 Barrett moved to suppress his confession, claiming that his right to counsel had been violated. <em>Barrett, </em>479 U.S. at 526, 107 S.Ct. at 830; <em>State v.

Following a jury trial, Barrett was convicted of sexual assault, unlawful restraint, and possession of a controlled substance. <em>Barrett, </em>479 U.S. at 525, 107 S.Ct. at 830.

Noting that requests for counsel are not narrowly construed, the court concluded that Barrett\u2019s expressed desire for counsel before making a written statement served as an invocation of the right <em>for all purposes.

State </em>(Ga. 1994), 440 S.E.2d 190, the defendant was stopped by a deputy sheriff while driving an automobile matching the description of a vehicle identified in connection with a murder investigation. After discovering outstanding arrest warrants against Baird, the deputy placed him under arrest. <em>Baird, </em>440 S.E.2d at 191. Minutes later, police officers arrived at the scene and advised Baird of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. <em>Baird, </em>440 S.E.2d at 191. Baird agreed to speak to the police, but he was not interrogated at that time. <em>Baird, </em>440 S.E.2d at 191. Shortly thereafter, the police sought to search Baird\u2019s vehicle. <em>Baird, </em>440 S.E.2d at 191. Initially, Baird verbally consented to the search. <em>Baird, </em>440 S.E.2d at 191. However, after an officer advised Baird that the search was to be conducted in conjunction with the murder investigation, Baird stated \u201cif this ha[s] to do with a murder investigation, [I] might ought to talk to a lawyer.\u201d <em>Baird, </em>440 S.E.2d at 191. Then, another officer told Baird that he had been advised of his rights and asked if he would consent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>to a search of the vehicle. <em>Baird, </em>440 S.E.2d at 191. At this point, Baird verbally consented to the search and signed a consent form. <em>Baird, </em>440 S.E.2d at 191. The search of Baird\u2019s vehicle yielded a stolen pistol. <em>Baird, </em>440 S.E.2d at 191.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">\u00b656 After being transported to the police station, Baird was again advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and he again stated that he was willing to speak with the police. <em>Baird, </em>440 S.E.2d at 192. He also stated that he did not want a lawyer. <em>Baird, </em>440 S.E.2d at 192.

Baird then reiterated that he was willing to proceed with the interrogation without an attorney. <em>Baird, </em>440 S.E.2d at 192. The interrogation was conducted and Baird made statements which he subsequently moved to suppress. <em>Baird, </em>440 S.E.2d at 192. The trial court denied Baird\u2019s motion and the Georgia Supreme Court granted interim appellate review in order to review this issue, among others. <em>Baird, </em>440 S.E.2d at 191-92.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">\u00b657 On appeal, Baird argued that his reference to a lawyer served to invoke his Fifth Amendment right to counsel, and that the subsequent interrogation was therefore improper pursuant to <em>Miranda.

In recognition of the similarities between Baird\u2019s request for counsel and that of the defendant in <em>Barrett, </em>the court used language directly from <em>Barrett </em>in observing that Baird\u2019s \u201climited\u201d request for counsel was \u201c\u2018accompanied by affirmative announcements of his willingness to speak with the authorities.\u2019\u201d <em>Baird, </em>440 S.E.2d at 192 (quoting <em>Barrett, </em>479 U.S. at 529, 107 S.Ct. at 832).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">\u00b658 Further, the court cited one of its previous cases for the proposition (originally derived from <em>Barrett) </em>that an individual \u201cmay make a limited request for counsel which the police are \u2018required to honor to no greater extent than the express limits of his reservation.\u2019\u201d <em>Baird, </em>440 S.E.2d at 192 (citing <em>Pitts v. State </em>(Ga. 1989), 386 S.E.2d 351, 355). Finally, in rejecting Baird\u2019s argument, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7Q\">[T]he record supports the trial court\u2019s finding that appellant\u2019s statement that he \u201cmight ought to talk to a lawyer,\u201d was made in response to the state\u2019s request to search his vehicle, and was not an assertion of his Fifth Amendment right to counsel during custodial interrogation. ... At most, appellant\u2019s reference to counsel was a limited request for an attorney to be present solely during the search of his car, an issue not before us in this appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ADa\"><em>Baird, </em>440 S.E.2d at 192.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>\u00b659 The Arizona Court of Appeals has also applied <em>Barrett </em>in another situation closely analogous to the case <em>sub judice. </em>In <em>State v. Uraine </em>(Ariz. Ct. App. 1988), 754 P.2d 350, the defendant was stopped by a police officer who observed him driving erratically after leaving the parking lot of a bar. The officer arrested Uraine after he failed field sobriety tests. <em>Uraine, </em>754 P.2d at 350. Uraine agreed to answer questions after being advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights at the police station. <em>Uraine, </em>754 P.2d at 350. The officer then informed Uraine of the implied consent law, after which Uraine \u201cstated that he did not want to take the breath test until he talked to his lawyer.\u201d <em>Uraine, </em>754 P.2d at 350. In the subsequent interrogation, Uraine made statements which he later sought to suppress. <em>Uraine, 754 </em>P.2d at 350. The trial court refused to suppress these statements, concluding that Uraine\u2019s \u201crequest to talk to counsel was, in effect, a limited request to see an attorney before he decided whether or not he would take a breath test.\u201d <em>Uraine, 754 </em>P.2d at 351. Following a jury trial, Uraine was convicted of \u201cdriving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor while his license was revoked.\u201d <em>Uraine, </em>754 P.2d at 350.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">\u00b660 On appeal, Uraine argued that he had invoked his right to counsel when he stated his desire to speak with an attorney before taking a breath test. <em>Uraine, </em>754 P.2d at 350-51. Accordingly, Uraine argued that all questioning should have ceased at that point. <em>Uraine, 754 </em>P.2d at 351. The Arizona Court of Appeals affirmed Uraine\u2019s conviction, stating that \u201cas in <em>Barrett, </em>the invocation of [Uraine\u2019s] right to counsel was a limited one.\u201d <em>Uraine, 754 </em>P.2d at 351. Noting that Uraine specifically stated he understood the <em>Miranda </em>warnings and agreed to answer questions, the court concluded that his \u201climited invocation of the right to counsel did not operate as a request for counsel for all purposes ....\u201d <em>Uraine, </em>754 P.2d at 351.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">\u00b661  In Montana, as noted above, the right to counsel in custodial interrogation is broad enough that it may be invoked, in certain circumstances, by a vague statement which does not include reference to a lawyer. <em>Johnson, </em>221 Mont. at 506-14, 719 P.2d at 1250-55. However, it is not so broad that it may be invoked by a request which is unambiguously limited to another police procedure. To conclude otherwise would require \u201cnot a broad interpretation of an ambiguous statement, but a disregard of the ordinary meaning of [a suspect\u2019s] statement.\u201d <em>See Barrett, </em>479 U.S. at 529-30, 107 S.Ct at 832.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">\u00b662 We recognize that a suspect may seek legal assistance for only limited purposes in his or her dealings with law enforcement. Based upon this recognition, and pursuant to <em>Barrett, </em>we hold that a suspect\u2019s request for counsel which is unambiguously limited to a police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>procedure that does not involve verbal inquiry, does not constitute an invocation of the right to counsel in custodial interrogation. Rather, a clearly limited request is properly construed according to its plain meaning, assuming that the suspect fully understands his or her right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">\u00b663 Of course, no suspect has an affirmative obligation to explain precisely why he or she wants legal assistance. Yet, when a suspect does clearly seek counsel for only limited purposes, the law will respect the limited nature of the request. After all, our legal system does not force a lawyer upon a suspect. <em>See Iowa v. Tovar </em>(2004), 541 U.S. 77, 87-88, 124 S.Ct. 1379, 1387, 158 L.Ed.2d 209 (citation omitted). However, if there is any reasonable doubt as to whether a suspect\u2019s request for counsel is limited to only certain aspects of his or her interaction with investigating officers, the request must be construed as an invocation of the right to counsel in custodial interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">\u00b664 Thus, in following the rationale of <em>Barrett, </em>we do not dilute the well-established principle that a suspect\u2019s requests for counsel must be construed broadly. <em>Johnson, </em>221 Mont. at 514, 719 P.2d at 1255; <em>Barrett, </em>479 U.S. at 529, 107 S.Ct at 832. We merely conclude that literal interpretation of an unambiguous request for limited legal assistance does not undermine the right to counsel in custodial interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">\u00b665 As did the defendants in <em>Baird </em>and <em>TJraine, </em>Buck sought legal counsel with regard to one particular police procedure, but also clearly expressed a willingness to speak to the officers. It is undisputed that Buck was fully advised of his right to remain silent and his right to counsel in custodial interrogation. It is also undisputed that he waived these rights knowingly and intelligently before both interrogations. Moreover, while in custody before the second interrogation, Buck declined to contact an attorney after an officer explicitly gave him the opportunity to do so. When Buck expressed a desire for legal assistance after the first interrogation was terminated, his statement was in direct response to Burns\u2019 request, and it was not ambiguous-i.e., he indicated that he would not submit to a bodily search without first consulting a lawyer. Buck made no other statements suggesting that he sought legal assistance in any other aspect of his dealings with law enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">\u00b666  To construe Buck\u2019s references to a lawyer as a request for counsel in custodial interrogation would require that we disregard the plain meaning of his statements and the context in which they were made. Thus, we conclude that Buck\u2019s statements were unambiguously limited to the bodily search which Burns sought to conduct and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>therefore, did not invoke his right to counsel in custodial interrogation. Accordingly, we hold that the District Court did not err in denying Buck\u2019s Motion to Suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">\u00b667 2. Did the District Court err in denying Buck\u2019s Motion <em>in Limine </em>seeking to exclude evidence of his methamphetamine use?</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">\u00b668 On the first day of trial, Buck filed a Motion <em>in Limine </em>seeking to exclude testimony regarding his use of methamphetamine. In support of this Motion, Buck asserted that such testimony would not be relevant. Buck cited to Rules 401, 402, and 403, M.R.Evid., but presented no analysis regarding the issue of relevance. Buck also observed that the State had not provided notice of its intent to present such testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">\u00b669 The State filed a memorandum opposing Buck\u2019s Motion. In doing so, the State asserted that Buck was under the influence of methamphetamine at the time he committed the charged offenses. The State then argued that it was entitled to present this evidence without prior notice, stating that Buck\u2019s \u201cuse of methamphetamine in the hours preceding the Evans Burglary and Homicide, and the fact that he was under the influence of that drug at the time he committed those offenses, are inseparably related to the offenses charged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">\u00b670 On the second day of trial, the District Court considered Buck\u2019s Motion in chambers, hearing argument from Buck\u2019s counsel, Mark Sullivan, and the prosecutor, Edward Corrigan. The following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-8\">Mr. Corrigan: ... It is not my intention to explore Mr. Buck\u2019s methamphetamine addiction or his past use of [methamphetamine], I intend only to elicit testimony that he and his friends ingested the drug on the night of the homicide and that he, by his own admissions, was under the influence of the drug at the time that Mr. Evans was killed. As I state in my response ... <em>evidence of other crimes that are inextricably or inseparably connected to the crime charged are admissible </em>even without the necessity of-of prior notice under Just. <em>It\u2019s part of the same transaction, </em>corpus delicti-if that\u2019s the right phrase ... it\u2019s part-part of what happened that night, Judge, and the jury should hear it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-9\">The Court: Okay. Mark, do you have anything else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-10\">Mr. Sullivan:... [I]t\u2019s simply not relevant... the prejudicial value of any evidence regarding use of methamphetamine far outweighs any probative value it might have. I think the probative value, if any, is extremely limited, and the prejudicial effect is great, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>therefore, I think it should be excluded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-4\">The Court: Okay. Well, I\u2019m going to deny the motion in limine ... the jury can and undoubtedly should-or will be instructed that the Defendant is not charged with an offense of possessing or using methamphetamine. But if there is evidence that it was used and was an integral part of the charged offenses, namely, the homicide and the burglary, then I think it\u2019s relevant and admissible. And so it will be-evidence concerning it will be admissible on that basis, but the jury will be advised-or instructed that, if you wish, you know, and if you submit appropriate instructions, that it\u2019s not an offense with which he\u2019s charged.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">(Emphasis added.) At trial, Justin Dutton, a friend of Buck, testified that he and Jonathan Keys joined up with Buck on the evening of October 24, 2002, and drove to Whitefish where they obtained methamphetamine. Dutton testified that he observed Buck ingest methamphetamine sometime after 11:00 p.m., that evening. Dutton also testified that based on his own experience, a \u201ccrank high\u201d lasts from half a day to a day. Jonathan Keys also testified, corroborating Dutton\u2019s testimony regarding the group\u2019s trip to Whitefish that evening to obtain methamphetamine. Keys clearly indicated that Buck ingested methamphetamine that evening, but testified that he did not personally see Buck do so. Finally, Nasset testified that Buck admitted, during the second interrogation, that he was under the influence of methamphetamine on the evening of Evans\u2019 death.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">\u00b671 On appeal, Buck argues that the District Court erred when it admitted this testimony regarding his methamphetamine use because none of the procedural requirements of the Modified <em>Just </em>Rule were followed, and because that evidence was both irrelevant and highly prejudicial. We review a district court\u2019s ruling regarding the admission of evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts under Rule 404(b), M.R.Evid., to determine whether the court abused its discretion. <em>Aakre, </em>\u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">\u00b672 Rule 404(b), M.R.Evid., provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-8\">Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">This Court\u2019s precedent supplements Rule 404(b), M.R.Evid., providing both procedural and substantive criteria for the admission of evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>of other crimes, wrongs, or acts. We first announced these criteria in <em>State v. Just </em>(1979), 184 Mont. 262, 268-69, 602 P.2d 957, 961 (citing <em>State v. Jensen </em>(1969), 153 Mont. 233, 239, 455 P.2d 631, 634<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>). Subsequently, we modified <em>Just </em>in <em>State v. Matt </em>(1991), 249 Mont. 136, 142, 814 P.2d 52, 56. Our holding in <em>Matt, </em>which incorporates the language of Rules 403 and 404(b), M.R.Evid., is currently referred to as the Modified <em>Just </em>Rule, and is to be used in determining admissibility of other crimes, wrongs, or acts. <em>State v. Ayers, </em>2003 MT 114, \u00b6 73, 315 Mont. 395, \u00b6 73, 68 P.3d 768, \u00b6 73 (citing <em>Aakre, </em>\u00b6 9). \u00b673 The following four criteria make up the substantive requirements of the Modified <em>Just </em>Rule: (1) the other crimes, wrongs, or acts must be similar; (2) the other crimes, wrongs, or acts must not be remote in time; (3) the evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that he or she acted in conformity with such character, but it may be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident; and (4) although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, misleading of the jury, considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence. <em>Ayers, </em>\u00b6 73 (citing <em>Aakre, </em>\u00b6 9). Each of these four criteria must be satisfied before evidence of prior crimes, wrongs, or acts is admissible. <em>Ayers, </em>\u00b6 76 (citing <em>Aakre, </em>\u00b6 9; <em>State v. Freshment, </em>2002 MT 61, \u00b6 34, 309 Mont. 154, \u00b6 34, 43 P.3d 968, \u00b6 34).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">\u00b674 Additionally, the following procedural requirements must be observed. <em>Ayers, </em>\u00b6 77 (citing <em>State v. Anderson </em>(1996), 275 Mont. 344, 349-50, 912 P.2d 801, 804). First, evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts may not be received unless there has been written notice to the defendant that such evidence is to be introduced. <em>Ayers, </em>\u00b6 77. The notice to the defendant shall specify the evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts to be admitted, and the specific purpose or purposes for which it is to be admitted. <em>Ayers, </em>\u00b6 77. Second, at the time of the introduction of such evidence, the trial court shall explain to the jury the purpose of such evidence and shall admonish the jury to weigh the evidence only for such purposes. <em>Ayers, </em>\u00b6 77. Third, in its final charge, the court shall instruct the jury in unequivocal terms that such evidence was received only for the limited purposes earlier stated and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>that the defendant is not being tried and may not be convicted for any offense except that charged, warning them that to convict for other offenses may result in unjust double punishment. <em>Ayers, </em>\u00b6 77.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">\u00b675 As do many legal rules, the Modified <em>Just </em>Rule has an exception: evidence of acts which are inextricably or inseparably linked with the charged offense are admissible, notwithstanding the substantive and procedural criteria of the Modified <em>Just </em>Rule. <em>See State v. Davis </em>(1992), 253 Mont. 50, 59, 830 P.2d 1309, 1315 (citing <em>State v. Romero </em>(1986), 224 Mont. 431, 438, 730 P.2d 1157, 1162); <em>State v. Cameron </em>(1992), 255 Mont. 14, 21, 839 P.2d 1281, 1286 (citing <em>Romero, </em>224 Mont. at 438, 730 P.2d at 1162); <em>State v. Byers </em>(1993), 261 Mont. 17, 34, 861 P.2d 860, 871<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (citing <em>State v. Wolfe </em>(1991), 250 Mont. 400, 412, 821 P.2d 339, 346).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">\u00b676 In <em>State v. Lozon, </em>2004 MT 34, 320 Mont. 26, 85 P.3d 753, we observed that \u201ca longstanding distinction exists between Rule 404(b) \u2018other crimes\u2019 evidence and evidence of a defendant\u2019s misconduct which is inseparably related to the alleged criminal act.\u201d <em>Lozon, </em>\u00b6 12. We also associated the exception to the Modified <em>Just </em>Rule with the statutory \u201ctransaction rule,\u201d which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-6\">Declaration, act, or omission which is a part of the transaction. Where the declaration, act, or omission forms part of a transaction which is itself the fact in dispute or evidence of that fact, such declaration, act, or omission is evidence as part of the transaction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">Section 26-1-103, MCA. Finally, we stated that \u201c[pjursuant to the \u2018transaction rule,\u2019 evidence of matters which are inextricably linked to, and explanatory of, the charged offense is admissible notwithstanding the rules relating to \u2018other crimes\u2019 evidence.\u201d <em>Lozon, </em>\u00b6 12 (citing <em>State v. Hayworth, </em>1998 MT 158, \u00b6\u00b6 31-32, 289 Mont. 433, \u00b6\u00b6 31-32, 964 P.2d 1, \u00b6\u00b6 31-32).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">\u00b677 In <em>Lozon, </em>the defendant was convicted of felony criminal possession of dangerous drugs. <em>Lozon, </em>\u00b6 1. During an early morning search of the room in which Lozon was living, his probation and parole officer discovered a vial which contained methamphetamine. <em>Lozon, </em>\u00b6 3. After a police officer read Lozon his <em>Miranda </em>rights, Lozon stated that he had used methamphetamine in his room the previous evening. <em>Lozon, </em>\u00b6 3. At trial, Lozon\u2019s probation and parole officer testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>regarding this statement. <em>Lozon, </em>\u00b6 5. On appeal, Lozon argued that the district court abused its discretion in allowing this testimony. <em>Lozon, </em>\u00b6 9. In support of this argument, Lozon argued that his statement constituted evidence of other crimes, and that it was admitted in violation of the notice requirement of the Modified <em>Just </em>Rule. <em>Lozon, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">\u00b678 We concluded that Lozon\u2019s statement was not \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence as contemplated by Rule 404(b), M.R.Evid. <em>Lozon, </em>\u00b6 14. In doing so, we observed that the statement was \u201cclosely related to the charged offense of possession of dangerous drugs, and [was] explanatory of the circumstances surrounding the offense, because it established] his knowledge and possession of drugs in his room shortly prior to the early morning search.\u201d <em>Lozon, </em>\u00b6 13. Accordingly, we held that the district court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the testimony regarding Lozon\u2019s statement that he had used methamphetamine the night before his room was searched. <em>Lozon, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">\u00b679  Here, the evidence of Buck\u2019s methamphetamine use is explanatory of the circumstances surrounding the charged offenses. Two witnesses indicated that Buck ingested methamphetamine within hours of the alleged offenses. Additionally, Nasset testified that Buck admitted being under the influence of methamphetamine on the evening of Evans\u2019 death. Thus, it appears that the evidence of Buck\u2019s methamphetamine use was not only relevant, but was inextricably and inseparably linked with the charged offenses and therefore not precluded by the Modified <em>Just </em>Rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">\u00b680 We recognize that evidence of drug use is, by its very nature, prejudicial. <em>State v. Ingraham, </em>1998 MT 156, \u00b6 47, 290 Mont. 18, \u00b6 47, 966 P.2d 103, \u00b6 47 (citing <em>Simonson v. White </em>(1986), 220 Mont. 14, 23, 713 P.2d 983, 988). However, we also recognize that district courts have broad discretion in determining whether \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence is admissible under Rule 404(b), M.R.Evid. <em>Ayers, </em>\u00b6 72 (citing <em>State v. Whitlow </em>(1997), 285 Mont. 430, 437, 949 P.2d 239, 244). Here, Buck\u2019s counsel offered no significant argument in challenging the introduction of the evidence at issue. He merely cited to several rules of evidence and asserted, in conclusory fashion and without supporting analysis, that the evidence was irrelevant and that its prejudicial value outweighed any probative value. Given the facts of this case, we can not conclude that the District Court erred in rejecting Buck\u2019s conclusory arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">\u00b681 We leave the foregoing discussion with a word of caution, however. We are <em>not </em>suggesting that evidence of methamphetamine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>use prior to an alleged crime is, without more, generally admissible. Absent other evidence establishing a probative linkage between the crime and the methamphetamine use and showing the effect of such use on the defendant, evidence of methamphetamine use may well be inadmissible under the \u201cinseparably-related\u201d exception to the Modified <em>Just </em>Rule or under the statutory \u201ctransaction rule,\u201d \u00a7 26-1-103, MCA. Here, the evidence of Buck\u2019s methamphetamine use shortly before the homicide, his admission that he was under the influence of that drug when he committed his crime, the brutal nature of the crime, and his failure to raise any significant challenge to the evidence, informs our conclusion that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">\u00b682 We note that the court expressed a willingness to admonish the jury regarding properly limited consideration of the evidence of Buck\u2019s methamphetamine use. However, the record before us demonstrates that Buck\u2019s counsel did not act on the court\u2019s offer. We do not fault the District Court here. Yet, this Court has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-5\">[W]e encourage trial courts to apply the safeguards of <em>Just </em>liberally. Even though the procedures <em>o\u00ed Just </em>may not be required in a given case, their use may be proper and wise. ... The procedural safeguards were designed to protect those accused of crime from unfair surprise or double punishment. They should be liberally applied to that end.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-6\"><em>State v. Gillham </em>(1983), 206 Mont. 169, 179, 670 P.2d 544, 550. Although we made this statement before <em>Just </em>was modified by <em>Matt, </em>it is nonetheless applicable to the Modified <em>Just </em>Rule. Thus, we hereby encourage trial courts to liberally apply the procedural safeguards of the Modified <em>Just </em>Rule. These safeguards are particularly important when evidence of drug use is introduced in cases where the defendant is not charged with drug use.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">\u00b683 Finally, we note that some of the cases cited above refer to the doctrines of <em>corpus delicti </em>and <em>res gestae. </em>In <em>State v. Hansen, </em>1999 MT 253, 296 Mont. 282, 989 P.2d 338, we characterized these terms as vague and imprecise, and we outlined misinterpretations and misuses of these doctrines in past cases. <em>Hansen, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 27-84, 96. As for the <em>corpus delicti </em>doctrine, we observed, <em>inter alia, </em>that it had \u201coutlived its usefulness\u201d and had been \u201cthoroughly disparaged by commentators.\u201d <em>Hansen, </em>\u00b6 35 (citations omitted). As for the <em>res gestae </em>doctrine, we observed, <em>inter alia, </em>that \u201c[t]he phrase is too vague and, therefore, it has been disparaged by judges and commentators alike.\u201d <em>Hansen, </em>\u00b6 78 (citation omitted). Ultimately, we urged the practicing bar and the trial courts to avoid using these doctrines in future cases, and to instead <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>utilize clearer and more precise statements of law. <em>Hansen, </em>\u00b6 96. Here, although Buck\u2019s trial occurred nearly four years after our decision in <em>Hansen, </em>the prosecutor raised the <em>corpus delicti </em>doctrine during the proceedings. Again, we urge the practicing bar to take note <em>o\u00ed Hansen. </em>Further, in accordance with <em>Hansen, </em>we must state that our reliance on the above cited cases does not extend to the concepts of <em>corpus delicti </em>and <em>res gestae </em>expressed therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">\u00b684 3. Did the District Court err in denying Buck\u2019s request for funds to employ a jury consultant and submit supplemental juror questionnaires?</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">\u00b685 In March of 2003, Buck filed his \u201cMotion for Expenditure of County Funds for Employment of a Jury Consultant and for Use of Supplemental Juror Questionnaires.\u201d In his brief supporting this Motion, Buck noted the publicity that his case had generated and stated that Evans was well known in the community. Buck also asserted \u201c[t]his case is a complicated case with potentially extreme penalties to the Defendant being a very real possibility and additional resources are necessary.\u201d However, Buck cited no legal authority in his arguments. After the State filed a memorandum opposing Buck\u2019s request, the District Court denied the Motion. In doing so, the court reasoned, without citation to legal authority, \u201c[t]his is not a death penalty case, nor are the issues to be resolved by the jury unduly complex.\u201d The District Court also stated \u201cdefense counsel is an experienced trial attorney and is more than capable of using voir dire ... and the presently used questionnaires to obtain a competent, qualified, and unbiased jury to hear and decide this case without the necessity of a jury consultant or supplemental questionnaires.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">\u00b686 Buck then filed an Application for Writ of Supervisory Control with this Court, asking that we direct the District Court to grant the Motion along with three other pre-trial motions. While we ordered the State to respond regarding one of the issues Buck raised, we declined to grant the Application with regard to the Motion at issue here. Buck also filed a Motion for Reconsideration with the District Court. The court did not rule on that Motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">\u00b687 On appeal, Buck argues that the District Court\u2019s denial of this Motion \u201cviolated his right to a fair trial as guaranteed by [the] <em>Sixth Amendment </em>to the U.S. Constitution and Article II, \u00a7 24 of the Montana Constitution.\u201d Buck notes that the prosecutor was assisted during voir dire by two detectives from the Kalispell Police Department, as well as an assistant from the Flathead County Attorney\u2019s Office. Pursuant to this observation, Buck argues that the prejudice he suffered was \u201cextremely obvious\u201d because \u201cthe number of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>people assisting the prosecutor in voir dire were unlimited.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">\u00b688 We will not address these arguments because Buck does not provide any analysis to support his assertions, nor does he provide citation to legal authority, as is required by Rule 23(a)(4), M.R.App.P. <em>Lynch, </em>\u00b6 14. As we have stated, this Court is not obligated to conduct legal research on an appellant\u2019s behalf or develop legal analysis that may lend support to his or her position. <em>Zakovi, </em>\u00b6 28 (citing <em>Johansen, </em>\u00b6 24).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">\u00b689 4. Did the District Court err in granting the State\u2019s Motion <em>in Limine </em>regarding hearsay?</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">\u00b690 At trial, Buck intended to introduce some of his own statements made subsequent to Evans\u2019 death-his statement that he tried to stop the flow of Evans\u2019 blood with a sock, and his statement that \u201cEvans was alive [when Buck left the residence], was yelling and screaming and cussing at him, and that he checked to determine that Evans was alive.\u201d Buck made these statements to Nasset, Bums, Jonathan Keys, and Joel Kelley, and intended to introduce the statements through the testimony of these four individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">\u00b691 On the second day of trial, the State filed its \u201cMotion in Limine RE: Hearsay\u201d seeking to prohibit Buck from introducing these and other exculpatory statements during cross-examination of the State\u2019s witnesses. The State argued that these statements were inadmissible hearsay, citing Rules 801 and 804, M.R.Evid. That same day, the District Court heard arguments in chambers and granted the State\u2019s Motion. Buck subsequently filed two memoranda in opposition to the State\u2019s Motion, which were unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">\u00b692 On appeal, Buck does not challenge the evidentiary basis on which the District Court granted the State\u2019s Motion. He presents no arguments regarding the Montana Rules of Evidence. Rather, Buck argues that because of the court\u2019s decision, he would have had to relinquish his constitutional right not to testify at trial in order to exercise his \u201cconstitutional right to present a defense.\u201d In support of this argument, Buck cites <em>State v. Gordon Bailey </em>(1982), 201 Mont. 473, 655 P.2d 494, for the proposition that a defendant must not be forced to surrender one constitutional right in order to assert another. <em>Gordon Bailey, </em>201 Mont. at 480, 655 P.2d at 498 (citing <em>Simmons v. United States </em>(1968), 390 U.S. 377, 394, 88 S.Ct. 967, 976, 19 L.Ed.2d 1247). Buck also argues that the court\u2019s decision precluded him from demonstrating the \u201cbias of the Kalispell Police Department in eliminating all other suspects ....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">\u00b693 The authority to grant or deny a motion <em>in limine </em>rests in the inherent power of the court to admit or exclude evidence and to take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>such precautions as are necessary to afford a fair trial for all parties. <em>State v. Krause, </em>2002 MT 63, \u00b6 32, 309 Mont. 174, \u00b6 32, 44 P.3d 493, \u00b6 32 (quoting <em>Hulse v. State, Dept. of Justice, </em>1998 MT 108, \u00b6 15, 289 Mont. 1, \u00b6 15, 961 P.2d 75, \u00b6 15). Therefore, we will not overturn a district court\u2019s grant or denial of a motion <em>in limine </em>absent an abuse of discretion. <em>Krause, </em>\u00b6 32 (citing <em>Hulse, </em>\u00b6 15). It is well settled that a district court\u2019s decision is presumed correct and an appellant bears the burden of establishing error. <em>Aakre, </em>\u00b6 43 (citing <em>In re M.J.W., </em>\u00b6 18). Error cannot be established in the absence of legal authority. <em>State v. James Bailey, </em>2004 MT 87, \u00b6 26, 320 Mont. 501, \u00b6 26, 87 P.3d 1032, \u00b6 26 (citing <em>State v. Clausell, </em>2001 MT 62, \u00b6 48, 305 Mont. 1, \u00b6 48, 22 P.3d 1111, \u00b6 48).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">\u00b694 First, we reject Buck\u2019s constitutional argument. While Buck cites the general rule that a defendant must not be forced to surrender one constitutional right in order to assert another, <em>Gordon Bailey, </em>201 Mont. at 480, 655 P.2d at 498 (citing <em>Simmons, </em>390 U.S. at 394, 88 S.Ct. at 976), he then simply asserts that he was precluded from exercising two constitutional rights simultaneously. He presents no analysis beyond this assertion, and fails to provide authority for the premise that he could not adequately present his defense without introducing his own mitigating statements through the testimony of others. Thus, this conclusory argument fails to establish that the District Court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">\u00b695 Similarly, we reject Buck\u2019s argument that he was precluded from demonstrating \u201cbias\u201d on the part of the Kalispell Police Department. This conclusory assertion, without supporting analysis or legal authority, is insufficient to establish an abuse of discretion by the District Court. Moreover, we note that Buck\u2019s counsel did, in fact, question Burns and Nasset regarding the process by which they eliminated other suspects.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">\u00b696 5. Did the District Court err in denying Buck\u2019s Motion for Change of Venue and his related \u201cMotion for Expenditure of County Funds to Conduct a Public Opinion Survey\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">\u00b697 In March of 2003, Buck filed a Motion for Change of Venue. Buck then requested that he be allowed to withdraw this Motion without prejudice, stating that he needed more time to complete a supporting brief. The District Court granted this request. In July of 2003, Buck again filed his Motion for Change of Venue. In his brief supporting this Motion, Buck identified several newspaper articles regarding Evans\u2019 death, and argued \u201c[t]he prejudicial atmosphere existing in this jurisdiction requires a change of venue.\u201d At a hearing held on August 1, 2003, the State objected to Buck\u2019s request, and the District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>denied the Motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">\u00b698 Buck also filed a \u201cMotion for Expenditure of County Funds to Conduct a Public Opinion Survey\u201d in April of 2003, seeking \u201cto determine the attitudes of the public and knowledge of the public about events and publicity surrounding the death of George Evans....\u201d In his brief supporting this Motion, Buck argued that local newspaper articles were inflammatory, noting that one article characterized Evans\u2019 death as a \u201cbrutal homicide,\u201d while another indicated that Evans may have been tortured. Buck also asserted that \u201cEvans was popular and well-known throughout the community,\u201d citing a newspaper article which reported that between 800 and 900 people attended Evans\u2019 memorial service. The State filed a brief opposing Buck\u2019s request, arguing \u201c[v]oir dire and a sufficiently large jury pool will enable this Court to seat 12 jurors capable of basing their decision on the evidence presented during trial regardless of Mr. Evans\u2019 popularity and the media coverage surrounding his murder.\u201d In May of 2003 the District Court denied Buck\u2019s Motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">\u00b699 Although Buck asks this Court to review of the District Court\u2019s denial of his \u201cMotion for Expenditure of County Funds to Conduct a Public Opinion Survey,\u201d Buck provides no argument as to how the court may have erred. Thus, we will not address the issue. <em>See Gollehon v. State, </em>1999 MT 210, \u00b6 10, 296 Mont. 6, \u00b6 10, 986 P.2d 395, \u00b6 10 (citing <em>State ex rel. Booth v. Montana Twenty First Judicial Dist., </em>1998 MT 344, \u00b6 35, 292 Mont. 371, \u00b6 35, 972 P.2d 325, \u00b6 35). As we have stated, this Court is not obligated to conduct legal research on an appellant\u2019s behalf or develop legal analysis that may lend support to his or her position. <em>Zakovi, </em>\u00b6 28 (citing <em>Johansen, </em>\u00b6 24).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">\u00b6100 As for the District Court\u2019s denial of his Motion for Change of Venue, Buck argues that \u201c[p]re-trial publicity in this case made a fair trial in Flathead County an impossibility.\u201d In support of this argument, Buck states \u201cFlathead County\u2019s local newspaper with the greatest circulation, The Daily Interlake, published a number of articles about the death of George Evans. One article described the killing as possibly involving torture.\u201d Buck also states that he \u201ccontinues in his position that a fair and impartial jury could not be found in Flathead County.\u201d Upon these contentions, Buck seeks \u201ca new trial in a different county to avoid the effect of adverse and prejudicial publicity.\u201d We will not address Buck\u2019s argument because he does not support it with any analysis or citation to legal authority, as is required by Rule 23(a)(4), M.R.App.P. <em>Lynch, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">\u00b6101 6. Did the District Court err in denying Buck\u2019s \u201cMotion for Expenditure of County Funds for Employment of a Medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>Expert\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">\u00b6102 Buck indicated at the omnibus hearing that he would rely on the defense that he \u201cdid not have a particular state of mind that is an essential element of the offense charged.\u201d In December of 2002, Buck filed his \u201cMotion for Expenditure of County Funds for a Psychiatric Evaluation.\u201d Relying on \u00a7 46-14-202, MCA, Buck sought an order authorizing the expenditure of funds to employ Dr. Joseph D. Rich to perform the psychiatric examination of Buck. Specifically, Buck sought Dr. Rich\u2019s opinion \u201cas to the capacity of the Defendant to have a particular state of mind that is an element of the offense charged,\u201d and \u201cas to the capacity of the Defendant, because of the mental disease or defect, to appreciate the criminality of the Defendant\u2019s behavior or to conform the Defendant\u2019s behavior to the requirement of the law.\u201d The District Court granted Buck\u2019s Motion four days after it was filed. \u00b6103 In March of 2003, Buck filed his \u201cMotion for Expenditure of County Funds for Employment of a Medical Expert.\u201d The Motion stated \u201cDefendant ... suffers from Type I diabetes and an expert is required to inform the trier of fact of the effects of blood sugar on a person\u2019s ability to form a particular state of mind and to appreciate the consequences of his or her actions.\u201d However, the Motion contained no citation to legal authority and it was not supported by a brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">\u00b6104 The State filed a memorandum in opposition to this Motion. In doing so, the State conceded that \u201ca defendant is entitled to the assistance of an expert when necessary for a fair trial,\u201d but also argued that Buck had failed to demonstrate why a second expert was necessary to assess his mental state at the time of the charged offenses. The State also argued that Buck had failed to show that diabetes could affect a person\u2019s ability to form a particular state of mind and to appreciate the consequences of his actions. Buck provided no response to the State\u2019s arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">\u00b6105 The District Court denied Buck\u2019s Motion, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-7\">By Order entered December 24, 2002, the Court granted the December 20, 2002, Motion appointing Dr. Rich as specifically requested by Defendant. Now, without any evidence of dissatisfaction with such appointment, nor any showing either as to why a second expert is necessary to conduct another like examination or as to why a diabetologist is better qualified to do so than a psychiatrist with considerable experience in forensic psychiatry, Defendant has filed the instant Motion. Based on the foregoing, the Motion should be denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">Buck then filed an Application for Writ of Supervisory Control with this Court, asking that we direct the District Court to grant the Motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>along with three other pre-trial motions. While we ordered the State to respond regarding one of the issues Buck raised, we declined to grant the Application with regard to Buck\u2019s Motion for a medical expert. Buck also filed a Motion for Reconsideration with the District Court. The court did not rule on that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">\u00b6106 On appeal Buck argues, without citation to authority, that he \u201crequired the services of a medical expert, particularly a diabetologist to present to the jury evidence that he did not possess the mental state requisite to a conviction of either deliberate homicide or burglary.\u201d In support of this argument, Buck asserts that he \u201cwould have presented evidence of extremely low blood sugar\u201d which caused him \u201cto have the inability to form the state of mind required f[o]r him to have acted either purposely or knowingly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">\u00b6107 The authority to grant or deny a motion <em>in limine </em>r\u00e9sts in the inherent power of the court to admit or exclude evidence and to take such precautions as are necessary to afford a fair trial for all parties. <em>Krause, </em>\u00b6 32 (quoting <em>Hulse, </em>\u00b6 15). Therefore, we will not overturn a district court\u2019s grant or denial of a motion <em>in limine </em>absent an abuse of discretion. <em>Krause, </em>\u00b6 32 (citing <em>Hulse, </em>\u00b6 15).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">\u00b6108 It is well settled that a district court\u2019s decision is presumed correct and an appellant bears the burden of establishing error. <em>Aakre, </em>\u00b6 43 (citing <em>In re M.J.W. </em>\u00b6 18). Error cannot be established in the absence of legal authority. <em>James Bailey, </em>\u00b6 26 (citing <em>Clausell, </em>\u00b6 48). Buck has not met that burden here. We conclude Buck\u2019s cursory arguments do not establish that the District Court abused its discretion. Our conclusion is based on the record and the arguments presented here, however, and it must not be interpreted as a general holding that a diabetic defendant is not entitled to the services of a medical expert in his or her defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">\u00b6109 Buck also argues that when the District Court denied his Motion, it precluded him from \u201cpresenting any evidence that he did not have the requisite state of mind called for by the statute charging the offense of deliberate homicide.\u201d Thus, Buck asserts, he was forced to choose between his right to due process and his right not to testify at trial, because the \u201conly remaining avenue to present evidence of his state of mind was through his own testimony.\u201d In support of this argument, Buck cites <em>Gordon Bailey, </em>for the proposition that a defendant must not be forced to surrender one constitutional right in order to assert another. <em>Gordon Bailey, </em>201 Mont. at 480, 655 P.2d at 498 (citing <em>Simmons, </em>390 U.S. at 394, 88 S.Ct. at 976). We do not address this argument because Buck did not raise it in his initial Motion or in his Motion for Reconsideration. It is well established that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>this Court will not address an issue raised for the first time on appeal, or a party\u2019s change in legal theory. <em>State v. Weaselboy, </em>1999 MT 274, \u00b6 16, 296 Mont. 503, \u00b6 16, 989 P.2d 836, \u00b6 16 (quoting <em>Unified Industries, Inc. v. Easley, </em>1998 MT 145, \u00b6 15, 289 Mont. 255, \u00b6 15, 961 P.2d 100, \u00b6 15).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">\u00b6110 7. Did the District Court err in limiting the testimony of Buck\u2019s expert witness, Dean Wideman?</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">\u00b6111 In April of 2003, Buck filed his \u201cMotion for Expenditure of County Funds for a Criminologist and Forensic Scientist.\u201d With this Motion, Buck sought funds to employ Dean Wideman (Wideman), a forensic scientist, stating \u201csuch an expert is required to examine all evidence, including DNA and blood samplings, laboratory reports, photographs, etc.\u201d The State filed a memorandum opposing Buck\u2019s request, arguing that Buck had failed to show a necessity for Wideman\u2019s services. The District Court accepted the State\u2019s argument and entered an Order denying Buck\u2019s Motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">\u00b6112 On May 14, Buck filed a Motion for Reconsideration, together with a supporting memorandum, claiming that the District Court\u2019s denial of the Motion violated his right of confrontation guaranteed by the United States Constitution and the Montana Constitution, as well as his right to due process under the Montana Constitution. In supporting these claims, Buck asserted his belief that \u201cthe evidence\u201d had been tainted by \u201cimproper evidence-gathering techniques\u201d and stated that he needed expert assistance to mount an appropriate challenge to this unspecified evidence. That same day, Buck filed his Application for Writ of Supervisory Control with this Court, asking that we direct the District Court to grant the Motion along with three other pre-trial motions. The next day, the State withdrew its objection to Buck\u2019s Motion seeking funds to employ Wideman.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">\u00b6113 On May 19, this Court entered an Order whereby we declined to further consider Buck\u2019s arguments regarding the other three pre-trial motions. However, as for Buck\u2019s request to employ Wideman, we granted the State twenty days to file a response, and stayed further proceedings in the District Court. On May 21, the District Court held a hearing wherein Buck stated that he would move for dismissal of his Application for Writ of Supervisory Control. The District Court then indicated that Buck\u2019s request for funds to employ Wideman would be granted upon formal dismissal of the Application. At Buck\u2019s request, this Court dismissed his Application for Writ of Supervisory Control. Then, on May 23, the District Court granted Buck\u2019s request for funds to employ Wideman.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-9\">\u00b6114 During Buck\u2019s trial, on August 13, the State filed a Motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>seeking to limit Wideman\u2019s testimony. The State asserted that it had received Wideman\u2019s Preliminary Report on August 7, but nothing further. Consequently, the State requested \u201can order limiting Mr. Wideman\u2019s testimony to the material and opinions he expresses in his August 7th report.\u201d On the last day of trial, before Wideman testified, the District Court discussed this Motion with counsel in chambers. At that time, Buck\u2019s counsel indicated that Wideman\u2019s testimony would be limited to the material contained in his Preliminary Report. The District Court did not enter a formal ruling on the State\u2019s Motion. \u00b6115 In his testimony, Wideman identified what he perceived as problems with the investigative techniques used at the crime scene, including a \u201clack of documentation\u201d and a failure to submit enough items for DNA analysis. The State only objected once during this testimony, after Buck\u2019s counsel asked Wideman whether the DNA methodology used in the investigation was proper. This objection was apparently overruled during a sidebar conference, as Buck\u2019s counsel subsequently proceeded to ask the same question without an objection from the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">\u00b6116 On appeal Buck asserts that the District Court limited Wideman\u2019s testimony to the material contained in his Preliminary Report. This limitation, Buck argues, violated his right of confrontation guaranteed by the United States Constitution and the Montana Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">\u00b6117 It is well established that in order to preserve an issue for this Court\u2019s consideration on appeal, a defendant generally must raise an objection in the proceedings below. Sections 46-20-104(2) and 46-20-701, MCA; <em>State v. White Clay, </em>1998 MT 244, \u00b6 24, 291 Mont. 147, \u00b6 24, 967 P.2d 370, \u00b6 24. Additionally, we have stated that this Court will not hold a district court in error for an action in which the appealing party acquiesced or actively participated. <em>White Clay, </em>\u00b6 24 <em>(citing Matter of R.B.O. </em>(1996), 277 Mont. 272, 283, 921 P.2d 268, 275). Here, although the District Court did not formally rule on the State\u2019s Motion seeking to limit Wideman\u2019s testimony, it did indicate that Wideman\u2019s testimony would be limited to the material contained in his Preliminary Report. At the same time, however, Buck\u2019s counsel agreed with this limitation. The following colloquy occurred in chambers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-6\">Mr. Corrigan: ... [Buck\u2019s counsel] provided me with a preliminary report from Mr. Wideman last Thursday afternoon. I have not received anything since that date, and for that reason would ask this Court to issue an order limiting Mr. Wideman\u2019s testimony to the matters contained within that preliminary report.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>The Court: Okay, Mark?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-4\">Mr. Sullivan: Your Honor, the main thrust of Mr. Wideman\u2019s testimony is expected to be on investigative techniques, how he was-how they are properly conducted based on his experience and training, which is extensive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-5\">Mr. Sullivan: So there really shouldn\u2019t be any surprises in the area he\u2019s going to be testifying.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-6\">The Court: <em>But his testimony ... as I gather, is in line with what is provided in this preliminary report. His testimony is going to be with respect to his observations about the investigation at the scene, right?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-7\">Mr. Sullivan: <em>Yes, </em>sir, he will be testifying about his observations based on-and his training and qualifications of course, he will be giving an opinion as an expert. He\u2019s entitled to do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-8\">Mr. Corrigan: With respect to what he\u2019s talking about here, I\u2019m not sure what Mark is referring to about his training. His training is an open door. To the extent of blood spatter analysis or DNA analysis or a discussion on the merits of this case outside the parameters of his preliminary report-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq7\">The Court: <em>That\u2019s not what you\u2019re talking about, right?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-9\">Mr. Sullivan: <em>I don\u2019t believe I am, Judge.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-10\">The Court: <em>Well, if it gets there it will stop.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-11\">The Court: ... [I]f he\u2019s going to stay within the parameters of discussion of his critique, if you will, of the crime scene investigation-that\u2019s what you intend to do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-12\">Mr. Sullivan: That is my expectation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-13\">(Emphasis added.) The record shows that Buck essentially acquiesced to the State\u2019s Motion. Because he did not object when the District Court indicated that Wideman\u2019s testimony would be confined to the material contained in his Preliminary Report, Buck waived his right to raise this issue on appeal. <em>White Clay, </em>\u00b6 24. Accordingly, we will not address the cursory constitutional argument Buck raises on appeal. <em>White Clay, </em>\u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-14\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b576-15\">\u00b6118  Buck has failed to demonstrate that any reversible error occurred in the proceedings below.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-17\">\u00b6119 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b576-18\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES WARNER, MORRIS and COTTER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b544-10\"> The court imposed this designation based on the fact that Buck was released from prison within five years of his commission of the instant offense. He was serving time pursuant to a conviction for felony theft.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b545-17\"> Buck testified that he appeared before Judge Ortley sometime after his arrest and before the second interrogation. At this time, Buck testified, Michael Keedy was appointed to represent him regarding his probation violation. Buck also testified that he called Michael Reedy\u2019s office before the second interrogation, but was unable to secure representation. Nothing in the record before us explains or verifies any portion of these seemingly conflicting statements. Moreover, Buck does not present any argument regarding the issue of whether an attorney was actually appointed for him before the second interrogation, or the issue of whether an attorney appointed for him pursuant to a probation violation should have been present at the second interrogation. Thus, we do not consider these questions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b551-10\"> The Court specified: \u201cBy custodial interrogation, we mean questioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.\u201d <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 444, 86 S.Ct. at 1612.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b551-11\"> The Court recognized that lawmakers could devise alternative procedures to protect the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination, but stated \u201cunless we are shown other procedures which are at least as effective in apprising accused persons of their right of silence and in assuring a continuous opportunity to exercise it, the following safeguards must be observed.\u201d <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 467, 86 S.Ct. at 1624.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b556-6\"> We do not reach the issue of whether Buck\u2019s first interrogation was in fact \u201ccustodial\u201d because neither party presents arguments in this regard. However the first interrogation may be technically characterized, it is undisputed that Buck clearly indicated his willingness to speak with the police at that time without consulting an attorney.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b558-8\"> Because the attempts to record Barrett\u2019s statement were unsuccessful, the Court did not consider \u201cwhether the result would be different if police had taped the statements and used the recording against Barrett.\u201d <em>Barrett, </em>479 U.S. at 529 n.2, 107 S.Ct. at 832 n.2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b564-5\"> Overruled in part on other grounds in <em>State v. </em>Hansen, 1999 MT 253, \u00b6\u00b6 37-39, 296 Mont. 282, \u00b6\u00b6 37-39, 989 P.2d 338, \u00b6\u00b6 37-39.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b565-9\"> Overruled in part on other grounds in <em>State v. </em>Egelhoff (1995), 272 Mont. 114, 125, 900 P.2d 260, 266, and <em>State v.
