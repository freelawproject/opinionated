We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-10\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b149-11\">\u00b62 The sole issue on appeal is whether the District Court correctly dismissed Fleenor\u2019s case for lack of standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b149-13\">\u00b63 On July 6,2004, Fleenor brought suit for violation by the District of her right to know and right to participate in the Trustees\u2019 decision to hire a new Superintendent. Fleenor brought her suit as \u201ca citizen of Montana and a resident of Ravalli County and the Darby School District.\u201d She claimed that the District failed to properly notify her of votes and decisions leading to the Superintendent\u2019s hiring, and therein violated her Constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-14\">\u00b64 The District moved to dismiss Fleenor\u2019s case for failing to state a claim and for lack of standing. The District argued Fleenor lacked any personal stake in the decisions of the District, and therefore suffered no injury beyond that of any other resident or taxpayer in the community. Fleenor asserted she had standing by virtue of her status as an \u201cinterested party\u201d who \u201cremoved herself from the potentially injured public generally into the smaller class of those citizens who are actually interested in knowing and participating in the process of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>government.\u201d In her view, Fleenor\u2019s interest in matters affected by decisions of the District was sufficient to establish she was injured by the District\u2019s allegedly faulty notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">\u00b65 On September 21, 2004, the District Court held a hearing on the District\u2019s motion to dismiss, and on September 27, 2004, dismissed Fleenor\u2019s claim for lack of standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">\u00b66 The question of whether a district court properly granted a motion to dismiss is a conclusion of law which we review to determine if the court\u2019s interpretation and application of the law is correct. <em>Helena Parents v. Lewis &amp; Clark Cty. </em>(1996), 277 Mont. 367, 370-71, 922 P.2d 1140, 1142 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">\u00b67 Standing is a threshold jurisdictional question \u201cespecially\u201d in cases \u201cwhere a statutory or constitutional violation is claimed to have occurred, ....\u201d <em>Olson v. Department of Revenue </em>(1986), 223 Mont. 464, 469, 726 P.2d 1162, 1166. Fleenor argues that the plain language of Montana\u2019s Constitution grants every citizen standing to enforce the right to know and right to participate in government decision-making. Article II, Sections 8 and 9 provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-9\">Right of participation. The public has the right to expect governmental agencies to afford such reasonable opportunity for citizen participation in the operation of the agencies prior to the final decision as may be provided by law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-10\">Right to know. No person shall be deprived of the right to examine documents or to observe the deliberations of all public bodies or agencies of state government and its subdivisions, except in cases in which the demand of individual privacy clearly exceeds the merits of public disclosure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-11\">\u00b68 Fleenor urges this Court to liberally construe the Constitution and literally interpret \u201cthe public\u201d and \u201ccitizen\u201d to include anyone who has an interest in enforcing the broad policies and protections of Article II, Sections 8 and 9. We agree that Montana\u2019s Constitution is to be broadly and liberally construed. <em>SJL of Mont. Assoc. v. City of Billings </em>(1993), 263 Mont. 142, 146, 867 P.2d 1084, 1086. Accordingly, our standing requirements are broad enough to allow anyone with a true stake in government action to exercise the rights granted by Article II, Sections 8 and 9. <em>See e.g. Air Pollution Control v. Bd. of Env. Rev. </em>(1997), 282 Mont. 255, 937 P.2d 463 (where we determined that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>because citizens of Missoula who breathed the air into which Stone Container expelled pollutants had standing to challenge state regulation of emissions in the airshed, standing extended to the local air pollution control board charged with protecting public health); <em>Armstrong v. State, </em>1999 MT 261, 296 Mont. 361, 989 P.2d 364 (where we held that health care providers had standing to assert on behalf of their patients the individual privacy rights of such patients to obtain constitutionally protected abortions from a health care provider of the patient\u2019s choosing); and <em>Bryan v. District, </em>2002 MT 264, 312 Mont. 257, 60 P.3d 381 (where we rejected as \u201chypertechnical\u201d the school board\u2019s contention that a student\u2019s mother lacked standing because another member of her activist group, rather than the mother herself, requested and was denied documents at issue in her challenge of a school closure). Such standing requirements are not, however, without limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">\u00b69  Even a broad reading of Article II, Sections 8 and 9 does not excuse Fleenor from meeting the well established standing requirements reflected in our jurisprudence. To establish standing to bring suit, the complaining party must (1) clearly allege past, present, or threatened injury to a property right or a civil right, and (2) allege an injury that is distinguishable from the injury to the public generally, though the injury need not be exclusive to the complaining party. <em>Bryan, </em>\u00b6 20, citing Armstrong, \u00b6 6. It is further well established that persons who fail to allege any personal interest or injury, beyond that common interest of all citizens and taxpayers, lack standing. <em>Flesh v. Bd. of Tr. of J. School Dist. 2 </em>(1990), 241 Mont. 158, 162, 786 P.2d 4, 7 (citation omitted). The injury alleged must be personal to the plaintiff as distinguished from the community in general. <em>Carter v. Montana Dept. of Transp. </em>(1995), 274 Mont. 39, 42, 905 P.2d 1102, 1104 (citation omitted). Otherwise stated, the challenged action must result in a \u201cconcrete adverseness\u201d personal to the party staking a claim in the outcome. <em>Bryan, </em>\u00b6 20, citing <em>District No. 55 v. Musselshell County </em>(1990), 245 Mont. 525, 528, 802 P.2d 1252, 1254.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">\u00b610 Fleenor attempts to distinguish herself from the general citizenry and other taxpayers by arguing that she is \u201cactually interested in knowing and participating in the process of government.\u201d She argues that her civic interest makes her \u201cindividualized enough to remove her sufficiently from the proscribed public generally\u2019 so as to grant her a personal stake in the outcome of the District\u2019s hiring decision. In essence, Fleenor maintains that being an informed and interested citizen is sufficient to confer standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>\u00b611 Because Fleenor insists no allegation of injury is necessary, she makes none. In fact, she does not even allege that the District\u2019s faulty notice somehow injured or threatened to injure her. And, other than establishing that Fleenor resides within the Darby School District, attends some school board meetings, and has no children in school, the record is completely silent as to her personal stake or interest in the matter of the hiring of the Superintendent. The \u201cconcrete adverseness\u201d to Fleenor resulting from the District\u2019s actions, as called for in <em>District No. 55 </em>and <em>Bryan </em>is completely lacking.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">\u00b612  While the allegation of membership within the school district is a good start toward establishing standing, it is not, on its own, enough. Under <em>Bryan, Flesh, </em>and <em>Carter, </em>there must also be some sort of injury or threatened injury alleged. The threshold is not high, but it does exist, and Fleenor failed to meet it.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">\u00b613  On the record before us, we cannot conclude that the District Court erred in its application of the law to Fleenor\u2019s claim. Therefore, we affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b152-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, WARNER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
