The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of Bearpaw. Bearpaw then moved the court to award attorney fees. The District Court awarded Bearpaw $79,107.50 in attorney fees. Chase now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">\u00b62 We reframe the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">\u00b63 (1) whether the District Court erred in awarding attorney fees to Bearpaw; and</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">\u00b64 (2) whether the District Court abused its discretion in calculating the amount of attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b447-11\">\u00b65 This dispute has endured in the courts of Montana for nearly half a decade and has reached this Court once before. Thankfully, we need not rehash its entire sordid past to resolve the issues on appeal. Instead, we begin <em>in medias res, </em>when the District Court granted summary judgment in favor of Bearpaw, by order dated September 4, 2003. The District Court did not file this order, however, until October 16, 2003. Meanwhile, on October 2, 2003, Chase filed a notice of appeal. Neither Chase nor Bearpaw filed a notice of entry of judgment on the court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-12\">\u00b66 After both parties had filed appellate briefs in this Court, Chase eventually moved this Court to dismiss its appeal. We dismissed the case and remanded for a determination of costs, pursuant to Rule 36, M.RApp.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-13\">\u00b67 On June 23, 2004, Bearpaw filed a motion requesting that the District Court award attorney fees. On August 13, 2004, the District Court signed an order granting Bearpaw\u2019s request for attorney fees and scheduling a subsequent hearing to determine the proper amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>of attorney fees. This ruling was filed on August 23, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">\u00b68 The District Court initially provided three potential bases for its decision to award attorney fees: a contractual fee-shifting provision, rendered reciprocal by \u00a7 28-3-704, MCA; the Declaratory Judgment Act, \u00a7 27-8-313, MCA; and the equitable <em>Foy </em>exception to the American Rule, <em>see, e.g., National Cas. Co. v. American Bankers, </em>2001 MT 28, \u00b6 28, 304 Mont. 163, \u00b6 28, 19 P.3d 223, \u00b6 28. The District Court failed, however, to specify which of the three rationales it relied upon in ruling that Bearpaw is entitled to recover attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">\u00b69 The District Court granted Chase\u2019s motion to vacate the scheduled hearing on the proper amount of attorney fees so that the court could also address the question of whether it lacked jurisdiction to award attorney fees. Chase argued that, pursuant to Rule 59(g), M.R.Civ.P., the District Court\u2019s failure to hold a hearing and award attorney fees within sixty days of Bearpaw\u2019s initial request for attorney fees divested the court of jurisdiction to make such an award.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">\u00b610 Chase\u2019s counsel failed to show up for the beginning of the consolidated hearing on the issues of whether the District Court retained the authority to award attorney fees and determination of the appropriate amount of attorney fees. At the hearing, Bearpaw presented the testimony of its counsel, Leonard Smith, who indicated that Bearpaw would be billed $8,352 for legal services rendered in August and September of 2004. Bearpaw also presented an expert witness, Robert E. Lee (Lee), who commented on the \u201cwork-enhancing characteristics\u201d of the case-including the need to communicate with multiple individual defendants, the \u201conerous\u201d burden to review voluminous documents, and the contentious zeal that characterized Chase\u2019s prosecution of the case (\u201ca scorched earth approach on the part of the plaintiffs and their counsel\u201d). Lee testified that each of the seven factors considered in determining the reasonableness of attorney fees, <em>see Forrester &amp; MacGinnis v. B. &amp; M. Co. </em>(1914), 29 Mont. 397, 409, 74 P. 1088, 1093, and <em>Plath v. Schonrock, </em>2003 MT 21, \u00b6 36, 314 Mont. 101, \u00b6 36, 64 P.3d 984, \u00b6 36, supported the reasonableness of an award of $71,171.50 in attorney fees (for expenses incurred through July 26, 2004). Lee also speculated that \u201cwhatever fees have been accrued since [July 26] dealing with the motions that I have seen on file and the issues that I have heard discussed in my presence in court today, even that additional amount, which I haven\u2019t personally reviewed, would be justified in this case.\u201d Chase\u2019s counsel arrived during Lee\u2019s testimony and informed the court that he had not received notice of the hearing until he received a telephone call from the clerk of court when the hearing began. After the District Court denied Chase\u2019s counsel\u2019s first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>request for a continuance so that he could prepare for the hearing, counsel cross-examined Lee. Avowedly lacking notice of the hearing, however, counsel was not prepared to offer testimony from Chase\u2019s own witnesses. Consequently, Chase\u2019s counsel requested that the hearing be continued until such time as those witnesses would be available to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">\u00b611 Several weeks later, the court held a second hearing at which time Chase offered the expert testimony of Bruce Fain (Fain). Fain testified that in his opinion, charges totaling $10,763 for client conferences are excessive for a case that is resolved on summary judgment. He also testified that, in comparison to similar cases he has litigated, $12,122 is an unreasonable charge for briefing and preparing a motion for summary judgment. Fain opined that Chase\u2019s opposition to Bearpaw\u2019s fee claim is reasonable, and therefore Bearpaw should not recover fees incurred in attempting to recover attorney fees, nor should Bearpaw recover appellate fees, since the Supreme Court declined to award them when afforded the opportunity. Finally, although he acknowledged that Bearpaw\u2019s counsel needed to review roughly 8,000 documents, Fain suggested that the seven factors utilized in assessing a claim for attorney fees would support an award of only $15,200, which roughly coincides with the fees incurred by Chase before the court granted summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">\u00b612 Chase also sought to present the testimony of the three named plaintiffs. The District Court, however, sustained Bearpaw\u2019s objection to their testimony. Chase made an offer of proof which indicated that the plaintiffs anticipated that the litigation would be quickly resolved, that they made eleven separate offers to settle or submit to arbitration, and that they would suffer hardship if saddled with nearly $80,000 in fees. The corut denied the offers, reasoning that the three lay witnesses lacked competence to testify as to the propriety of attorney fees claimed by Bearpaw and that their testimony would not prove relevant to that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">\u00b613 The District Court subsequently ordered Chase to reimburse Bearpaw $79,107.50 (plus interest) for the attorney fees incurred in defending the suit and seeking attorney fees. The court specified that Bearpaw is entitled to recover attorney fees incurred in defending the action in the District Court pursuant to a contractual fee-shifting provision, rendered reciprocal by \u00a7 28-3-704, MCA. The court determined that Bearpaw is entitled to recover attorney fees incurred in preparing its appeal of the summary judgment ruling pursuant to the <em>Foy </em>equitable exception to the American Rule. Finally, the court held that Bearpaw is entitled to recover attorney fees incurred in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>seeking attorney fees (\u201cfees-for-fees\u201d) pursuant to <em>State ex rel. DOT v. Slack, </em>2001 MT 137, 305 Mont. 488, 29 P.3d 503, because Chase unreasonably opposed Bearpaw\u2019s fee claims. Chase then filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">\u00b614 \u201cWe review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether the district court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct.\u201d <em>Chamberlin v. Puckett Construction (1996), </em>277 Mont. 198, 202-03, 921 P.2d 1237, 1240. \u201cThe construction and interpretation of a contract is a question of law for the court to decide.\u201d <em>Cole v. Valley Ice Garden, L.L.C., </em>2005 MT 115, \u00b6 24, 327 Mont. 99, \u00b6 24, 113 P.3d 275, \u00b6 24 (citation and quotations omitted). Whether or not a party is entitled to recover attorney fees is \u201cstrictly a question of law.\u201d Thus, \u201c[w]e review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law pertaining to the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees to determine whether those conclusions are correct.\u201d <em>Transaction Network v. Wellington Tech., </em>2000 MT 223, \u00b6 17, 301 Mont. 212, \u00b6 17, 7 P.3d 409, \u00b6 17 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">\u00b615 We review a district court\u2019s award of reasonable attorney fees for an abuse of discretion. <em>Chamberlin, </em>277 Mont. at 206, 921 P.2d at 1242. \u201cA court abuses its discretion if it acts arbitrarily without employment of conscientious judgment or exceed[s] the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice.\u201d <em>McDermott v. Carie, </em>2005 MT 293, \u00b6 10, 329 Mont. 295, \u00b6 10, 124 P.3d 168, \u00b6 10 (quotations and citations omitted, alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">\n<em>Issue 1: Whether the District Court erred in awarding attorney fees to Bearpaw.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">\u00b616 Chase argues that the District Court erred in awarding attorney fees to Bearpaw because, pursuant to Rule 59, M.R.Civ.P., the District Court lost authority to award attorney fees when it failed to hold a hearing to determine the appropriate amount of attorney fees within sixty days of Bearpaw\u2019s motion requesting attorney fees. Chase notes that Rule 59(g), M.R.Civ.P., requires a court to rule on a motion to alter or amend a judgment within sixty days or else that motion is deemed denied. Further, Chase maintains that a petition for attorney fees cannot be adjudicated absent an evidentiary hearing; therefore, Chase suggests, a court cannot legally rule on a post-judgment motion for attorney fees without first holding an evidentiary hearing to determine the proper amount of fees. Accordingly, Chase concludes that the court\u2019s failure to hold an evidentiary hearing within sixty days <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>of Bearpaw\u2019s motion divested the court of jurisdiction to amend its judgment by awarding fees to Bearpaw.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-3\">\u00b617 Bearpaw argues that the District Court retained the authority to award attorney fees because the court never entered judgment when it awarded summary judgment in favor of Chase, and therefore, the request for attorney fees was not a post-judgment motion to amend the judgment. Alternatively, Bearpaw maintains that Rule 59, M.R.Civ.P., requires only that the District Court rule within sixty days whether it will award attorney fees, but allows the court to later hold a hearing to determine the proper amount of fees to award. We agree with Bearpaw\u2019s interpretation of Rule 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\"><em>A. </em>The District Court\u2019s Authority to Award Fees:</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">\u00b618 \u201cA motion for attorneys\u2019 fees filed after entry of a judgment is treated as a motion to alter or amend a judgment.\u201d <em>Associated Press v. Croft, </em>2004 MT 120, \u00b6 36, 321 Mont. 193, \u00b6 36, 89 P.3d 971, \u00b6 36. Thus, to determine whether Rule 59 applies, we must first ascertain whether the District Court entered summary judgment before Bearpaw requested attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">\u00b619 Although Bearpaw contends that judgment was not entered on the court\u2019s grant of summary judgment until December 21, 2004, this argument lacks merit. The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of Bearpaw on September 4,2003. Chase then filed a notice of appeal on October 2,2003, two weeks before the clerk of court filed the order granting summary judgment. By filing the judgment, the clerk effectively entered judgment against Chase. <em>See Firefighters, Local No. 8 v. District Court, </em>2002 MT 17, \u00b6 16, 308 Mont. 183, \u00b6 16, 40 P.3d 396, \u00b6 16 (acknowledging that the actual filing of a judgment in the clerk of court\u2019s office constitutes entry of the judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">\u00b620 Given that Rule 59 applies, we must consider whether the court was divested of its authority to award attorney fees when it failed to hold an evidentiary hearing and award a specific figure within sixty days of Bearpaw\u2019s motion requesting fees. By its terms, Rule 59 mandates the court to \u201cdetermine\u201d a motion to alter or amend a judgment within sixty days, \u201cand if the court shall fail to <em>rule </em>on the motion within the 60 day period, the motion shall be deemed deified.\u201d Rule 59(g), M.R.Civ.P. (emphasis added). The Rule does not require a district court to hold all required hearings within sixty days of the motion, nor does it require that the court determine specifically <em>how </em>to amend the judgment within sixty days. It simply requires the court to rule, within sixty days, whether it will amend the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">\u00b621 Chase argues that <em>Croft </em>requires a district court to hold a hearing and award a specific figure within sixty days. Chase misreads <em>Croft. </em>In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number><em>Croft, </em>the court held an evidentiary hearing within sixty days of the motion requesting attorney fees. \u00b6 34. The court, however, did not rule that it would award fees within sixty days of the motion requesting fees. \u00b6 37. We reversed the award of attorney fees because the court failed to \u201crender a decision [within sixty days] regarding\u201d the motion for fees. \u00b6 37. <em>Croft </em>does not require a district court to hold a hearing and award a specific figure for attorney fees within sixty days of a motion. It simply requires the court to render a decision whether or not to award attorney fees within sixty days of a post-judgment request for fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">\u00b622  Existing precedent confirms that a distinction exists between a court\u2019s decision to award attorney fees and a court\u2019s determination of the proper measure of fees. In <em>Plath </em>we held that a district court abused its discretion when it awarded $10,000 in attorney fees without first holding an evidentiary hearing. We noted that the $10,000 figure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1-\">is not supported by competent evidence established as the result of an evidentiary hearing. Accordingly, <em>although we affirm the District Court\u2019s discretionary decision to grant attorney fees[,] ... </em>we reverse the District Court\u2019s order of attorney fees in the amount of $10,000 and remand the cause for an evidentiary hearing....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-5\"><em>Plath, </em>\u00b6 41 (emphasis added). Likewise, in <em>Rossi v. Pawiroredjo, </em>2004 MT 39, 320 Mont. 63, 85 P.3d 776, we reversed a district court\u2019s award of $7,166.40 absent an evidentiary hearing. Although we did not disturb the court\u2019s determination that fees should be awarded, we vacated the award and \u201cremanded for an evidentiary hearing to determine the proper <em>amount </em>of attorney fees to be awarded.\u201d <em>Rossi, </em>\u00b6 29 (emphasis added). Thus, while it is abundantly clear that an evidentiary hearing must be held before attorney fees may be awarded in any specific amount, it is equally clear that such a hearing need not be held before a court may decide to award attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">\u00b623  In light of the foregoing analysis, we conclude that on August 13, 2004-fifty-one days after Bearpaw filed its motion-the District Court had authority to grant Bearpaw\u2019s motion requesting attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">B. Whether the District Court Properly Awarded Fees:</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">\u00b624 Having established that the District Court retained authority to rule on Bearpaw\u2019s motion for attorney fees, we now turn to whether the District Court properly awarded fees to Bearpaw. Chase correctly observes that the District Court order of August 13, 2004, awarding attorney fees fails to specify the basis for the award. Nevertheless, in its later order on the proper amount of attorney fees, the court clarified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>the various bases for its award. The court indicated that \u00a7 6.02 of the Declaration of Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions, rendered reciprocal by \u00a7 28-3-704, MCA, enabled Bearpaw to recover attorney fees incurred during the initial phase of litigation in the District Court, which culminated in the court\u2019s granting summary judgment in favor of Bearpaw. The court found that Chase had pursued a frivolous appeal, entitling Bearpaw to recover fees incurred on appeal pursuant to the <em>Foy </em>exception to the American Rule as articulated in <em>Tanner v. Dream Island, Inc. </em>(1996), 275 Mont. 414, 429-30, 913 P.2d 641, 650-51. Finally, the court justified awarding fees-for-fees because Chase\u2019s recalcitrance in persistently re-raising settled issues qualifies as an \u201cextraordinary circumstance\u201d that merits such a sanction. <em>See Slack, </em>\u00b6 33 (noting that fees-for-fees are justified only in those \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d when the \u201cState\u2019s objection to a condemnee\u2019s fee claim is unreasonable\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">1. Fees Incurred in the District Court and on Appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">\u00b625 The Declaration of Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions (\u201cDeclaration\u201d) provides that \u201cBearpaw Ranch... shall be subject to the following easements, covenants, conditions, and restrictions <em>and will bind the grantees, heirs, successors, and assigns of the owners and any future owners.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Section 6.02 of the Declaration provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-6\">[i]n any action of any kind for the enforcement of the Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions, if the relief prayed for is granted in whole or in part, the applicant for relief shall be entitled to recover necessary court Costs [sic] for the action, including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">Chase argues that this provision does not entitle Bearpaw to recover attorney fees because Bearpaw was not the \u201capplicant for relief.\u201d Chase overlooks \u00a7 27-3-704, MCA, however, which renders such contractual fee-shifting provisions reciprocal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-8\">Whenever, by virtue of the provisions of any contract or obligation in the nature of a contract[,] ... one party to such a contract or obligation has an express right to recover attorney fees from any other party to the contract or obligation in the event the party having the right shall bring an action upon the contract or obligation, then in any action on such contract or obligation all parties to the contract or obligation shall be deemed to have the same right to recover attorney fees and the prevailing party in such action ... shall be entitled to recover his reasonable attorney fees from the losing party or parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">Under the Declaration, Chase could have recovered reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>attorney fees if he had prevailed on his claims.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Due to the statutorily imposed reciprocity of fee-shifting, the Declaration entitles Bearpaw-the prevailing party against whom Chase brought a claim-to recover reasonable attorney fees. Because the Declaration does not explicitly exclude attorney fees incurred on appeal, such fees may also be recovered pursuant to the fee-shifting provision of the contract, as they are \u201cnecessary\u201d costs incurred in ultimately prevailing on the claim. <em>See, e.g., Chamberlin, </em>277 Mont. at 210, 921 P.2d at 1244 (\u201cwhere an award of attorney\u2019s fees is based on a contract, the prevailing party is also entitled to an award of reasonable attorneys fees incurred on appeal\u201d). Athough the District Court did not base its award of appellate fees on the Declaration, we will not reverse a district court when it reaches the correct result, even if for the wrong reason. <em>Palmer v. Bahm, </em>2006 MT 29, \u00b6 20, 331 Mont. 105, \u00b6 20, 128 P.3d 1031, \u00b6 20. Accordingly, we affirm the District Court\u2019s determination that Bearpaw is entitled to recover fees incurred on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">2. Fees Incurred in Litigating the Withdrawal of Chase\u2019s Attorney:</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">\u00b626 Chase suggests that the District Court improperly awarded Bearpaw fees that it incurred in securing the withdrawal of Chase\u2019s initial counsel (Towe) due to a conflict of interest. While securing the withdrawal of Towe may have benefited Bearpaw, we cannot say that this was a \u201cnecessary\u2019 expense incurred in \u201cenforcing] the Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions\u201d contained in the Declaration. Rather, Bearpaw chose to litigate this wholly collateral issue, which had <em>nothing </em>to do with enforcement of the Declaration. Had Chase prevailed, he could not have recovered the costs he incurred in connection with Towe\u2019s withdrawal. Nor may Bearpaw recover the attorney fees incurred in lititgating this issue. According to Fain, Bearpaw was awarded $5,777 in fees related to the withdrawal issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">3. Fees Incurred in Recovering Fees (Fees-for-Fees):</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">\u00b627 Finally, we turn to the question of whether the District Court properly awarded fees-for-fees to Bearpaw. Chase argues that the District Court erroneously awarded fees-for-fees. As a matter of law, the District Court erred in applying the \u201cunreasonable objection\u201d standard articulated in <em>Slack </em>and <em>State By Dep\u2019t of Highways v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number><em>McGuckin </em>(1990), 242 Mont. 81, 788 P.2d 926. Both of these cases dealt with the issue of fees-for-fees under a statutory framework<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that entitled the defendants to recover attorney fees in the specific context of condemnation proceedings. Here, Bearpaw is entitled to recover attorney fees pursuant to a contractual fee-shifting provision (rendered reciprocal by statute), rather than pursuant to the constitutionally mandated statutory framework that informed our holdings in <em>Slack </em>and <em>McGuckin. </em>Consequently, we rely on caselaw interpreting the scope of contractual fee-shifting provisions, rather than <em>Slack </em>or <em>McGuckin.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">\u00b628 In <em>Amazi v. Atlantic Richfield Co. </em>(1991), 249 Mont. 355, 816 P.2d 431, this Court considered whether a party who recovers attorney fees pursuant to a contractual provision may additionally recover fees-for-fees. GN (a subcontractor) had indemnified ARCO \u201cagainst all claims, liabilities, demands, causes of action and judgments (including costs and reasonable attorneys fees)\u201d asserted by third parties who were injured <em>\u201cin whole or in part\u2019 </em>as a result of GN\u2019s negligent conduct. <em>Amazi, </em>249 Mont./ at 359, 816 P.2d at 433. We affirmed the ruling that the indemnity provision allowed ARCO to recover attorney fees incurred in defending against claims of ARCO\u2019s negligence (which was concurrent with GN\u2019s own negligent conduct). <em>Amazi, </em>249 Mont. at 360, 816 P.2d at 434. ARCO additionally sought to recover attorney fees incurred in establishing its right to indemnity. <em>Amazi, </em>246 Mont. at 360, 816 P.2d at 434. In other words, ARCO sought fees-for-fees. We held that \u201cabsent an express contractual term an indemnitee may not recover attorneys\u2019fees incurred in establishing <em>indemnity.\u2019\u2019Amazi, </em>249 Mont. at 361, 816 P.2d at 435. We held that a contractual provision that required \u201cthe responsible party [to] ... pay all ... reasonable attorneys fees, and other related expenses[,]\u201d was \u201cnot sufficiently express\u201d to enable ARCO to recover fees incurred in establishing its right to attorney fees pursuant to the indemnification provision. <em>Amazi, </em>249 Mont. at 361, 816 P.2d at 435.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">\u00b629 Our holding <em>in. Amazi </em>is consistent with the American Rule, which posits that a party generally pays its own attorney fees. <em>Finke v. State ex rel. McGrath, </em>2003 MT 48, \u00b6 30, 314 Mont. 314, \u00b6 30, 65 P.3d 576, \u00b6 30. Contractual fee-shifting provisions are a recognized exception to the American Rule. <em>Finke, </em>\u00b6 30. The terms of the contract necessarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>dictate the <em>scope of </em>the exception and fee-shifting occurs only to the extent that the contracting parties clearly intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">\u00b630 The fee-shifting provision in the Declaration is strikingly similar to the fee-shifting provision at issue in <em>Krumme v. Westpoint Stevens Inc. </em>(S.D.N.Y. 1999), 79 F.Supp.2d 297. In determining whether Krumme was entitled to fees-for-fees, the <em>Krumme </em>court applied the rule-consistent with our holding in Amazi-that \u201ca general contract provision for the shifting of attorneys\u2019 fees does not authorize an award of fees for time spent in seeking the fees themselves.\u201d 79 F.Supp.2d at 312 (quoting <em>F.H. Krear &amp; Co. v. Nineteen Named Trustees </em>(2d Cir. 1987), 810 F.2d 1250, 1266); <em>see also National Union Fire Ins. Co. v. Hartel </em>(S.D.N.Y. 1992), 782 F.Supp. 22, 24-25 (requiring clear contractual language evincing the parties\u2019 intent to override the general rule in order for a party to recover fees-for-fees). The fee-shifting clause provided, \u201c[i]f... there should arise any dispute as to the validity, interpretation or application of any term [or] condition of this Agreement... Cluett agrees ... to provide sums sufficient to pay on a current basis ... [Krumme\u2019s] costs and reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees ... incurred by [Krumme] in connection with any dispute or litigation....\u201d <em>Krumme, </em>79 F.Supp.2d at 300. Because the fee-shifting clause was itself a term of the Agreement, the court awarded Krumme \u201cexpenses incurred in litigating the terms of the attorneys\u2019 fees provision,\u201d (i.e., fees incurred in establishing Krumme\u2019s contractual entitlement to fees). <em>Krumme, </em>79 F.Supp.2d at 313. The court, however, denied Krumme\u2019s claim for fees incurred \u201cin connection with [proceedings to collect] reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees,\u201d (i.e., fees incurred in establishing the amount of fees that may be recovered), because the fee-shifting provision lacks specific language that would entitle Krumme to recover such fees. <em>Krumme, </em>79 F.Supp.2d at 313. The court expressed concern that \u201cthe exception would swallow the rule,\u201d if Krumme could recover fees incurred in establishing a \u201c \u2018reasonable\u2019 amount of fees ....\u201d <em>Krumme, </em>79 F.Supp.2d at 313.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">\u00b631  Here, the Declaration itself provides for recovery of attorney fees \u201cin any action of any kind <em>for the enforcement </em>of the Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions^]\u201d (Emphasis added.) The fee-shifting provision is one such \u201cCondition\u201d of the Declaration. Litigation over the <em>entitlement </em>to fees <em>under the contract </em>is properly construed as an action for the enforcement of a condition contained in the Declaration. Consequently, pursuant to the express terms of the contract, Bearpaw is entitled to recover attorney fees incurred in establishing its entitlement to fees under the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>\u00b632  Fees incurred in establishing the <em>amount </em>of \u201creasonable attorney's fees,\u201d however, are not compensable under the contract. A dispute over the reasonableness of the fees incurred by Bearpaw is not properly construed as an action for enforcement of a \u201cCondition\u201d included in the Declaration. Instead, it is a dispute over the interpretation of a generic term of the Declaration and a factual dispute over the necessity of particular fee claims.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As such, the contract itself does not provide for recovery of fees incurred in establishing the <em>amount </em>of attorney fees reasonably incurred by Bearpaw.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">\u00b633  We hold that the District Court properly awarded attorney fees to Bearpaw for most expenses incurred in proceedings preceding its grant of summary judgment to Bearpaw as well as for all costs subsequently incurred on appeal. Additionally, the court properly awarded fees-for-fees only to the extent that such fees were incurred in establishing Bearpaw\u2019s entitlement to fees under the terms of the Declaration. The District Court erred, however, in awarding fees-for-fees to compensate Bearpaw for expenditures incurred to establish the reasonable amount of attorney fees. The District Court also erred in awarding fees to compensate Bearpaw for expenses incurred in procuring the withdrawal of Towe.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">\n<em>Issue 2: Whether the District Court abused its discretion in determining the amount of attorney fees.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">\u00b634 Chase argues that the District Court awarded an excessive amount of fees to Bearpaw. Chase maintains that during each phase of litigation it expended considerably less in attorney fees than the fees that Bearpaw claimed; therefore, Bearpaw\u2019s claimed fees are unreasonable. Additionally, Chase notes that the amount recovered by Bearpaw vastly exceeds fee awards that this Court has affirmed in cases disposed of on summary judgment. Chase contends that the fee award erroneously included fees-for-fees and fees incurred in procuring the withdrawal of Towe. Chase avers that Bearpaw improperly recovered billings for general association matters and fees incurred in holding conferences with clients. Finally, Chase suggests that the District Court abused its discretion when it denied plaintiffs the opportunity to testify during the hearing on the proper measure of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">\u00b635 Bearpaw observes that both parties presented expert testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>concerning the reasonableness of its fee claims and stresses that the District Court properly exercised its broad discretion in according greater weight and credibility to the testimony of Bearpaw\u2019s expert. Bearpaw denigrates Chase\u2019s attempts to compare the fee award it received to other awards this Court has affirmed because the reasonableness of fees depends on the unique facts of each case. In sum, Bearpaw contends that Chase has not established that the District Court abused its discretion in determining the amount of fees. \u00b636 \u201c[T]he reasonableness of attorney\u2019s fees must be ascertained under the unique facts of each case.\u201d <em>Chamberlin, </em>277 Mont. at 205, 921 P.2d at 1241-42. Thus, in arguing that the District Court erred in awarding $79,107.50 in attorney fees, Chase cannot avail himself of comparisons to fee awards in other cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">\u00b637 Also without merit is Chase\u2019s argument that the District Court abused its discretion when it declined to allow the three named plaintiffs to testify at the hearing on the proper measure of damages. None of the three plaintiffs is an attorney, nor did any of them profess expertise in assessing the veracity or reasonableness of attorneys\u2019 billings. The District Court properly determined that they lacked competence to testify as to the reasonableness of the fees claimed by Bearpaw. The offer of proof made by Chase\u2019s counsel confirms that these witnesses\u2019 testimony-that several other members of the association were interested in resolving the issues raised by plaintiffs, that the plaintiffs offered to submit to arbitration or mediation, and that the plaintiffs would incur great hardship if made to pay Bearpaw\u2019s fees-would not have been relevant in determining the reasonableness of Bearpaw\u2019s claimed fees. Nor would it have been relevant to the issue of whether the court retained authority to award fees in the first place. As such, the testimony was properly excluded. <em>See </em>Rule 402, M.R.Evid.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">\u00b638 The following factors should be considered as guidelines in determining the reasonableness of attorney fees:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-6\">(1) the amount and character of the services rendered; (2) the labor, time and trouble involved; (3) the character and importance of the litigation in which the services were rendered; (4) the amount of money or the value of the property to be affected; (5) the professional skill and experience called for; (6) the attorneys\u2019 character and standing in their profession; and (7) the results secured by the services of the attorneys.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-7\"><em>Plath, </em>\u00b6 36 (citing <em>Swenson v. Janke </em>(1995), 274 Mont. 354, 361, 908 P.2d 678, 682-83). These factors are not exclusive; district courts may consider other factors as well. <em>Morning Star Enterprises v. R.H. Grover </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>(1991), 247 Mont. 105, 113, 805 P.2d 553, 558. Nevertheless, a comparison of the parties\u2019 respective expenditures is not necessarily a proper measure of reasonableness. If, due to the nature of the case, one party received significantly more legal services requiring more time and labor-for example, by conducting extensive document review-than the other side and prevailed in the end, consideration of the factors would justify awarding fees irrespective of any disparity between the parties\u2019 respective expenditures.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">\u00b639 Bearpaw offered Lee\u2019s expert testimony during the hearing on the proper amount of attorney fees. Lee testified that certain characteristics of the case increased the amount of labor, time and trouble involved and he detailed how each of the seven factors supported the reasonableness of fees of $79,523.50. Chase offered the expert testimony of Fain, who opined that in comparison to similar cases that he has litigated, Bearpaw\u2019s claimed fees are not reasonable. Fain\u2019s report specifically identifies charges for conferences with clients and billings for general association matters as improperly submitted fees. Fain briefly touched on the seven factors and suggested that they would support awarding fees of only $15,200. Fain did, however, acknowledge that Bearpaw\u2019s counsel had to review roughly 8,000 documents to ascertain their relevance. Towe (Chase\u2019s initial counsel) testified that he <em>may </em>have reviewed these documents but that in any event he did so \u201cquickly,\u201d because his clients had already flagged the important documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">\u00b640 Faced with irreconcilably conflicting expert testimony, the District Court had to decide which expert provided a more persuasive opinion concerning the reasonableness of Bearpaw\u2019s claimed fees. The District Court found Lee\u2019s testimony more credible than Fain\u2019s testimony and it awarded an amount slightly lower than that which Lee deemed reasonable-$79,107.50. \u201c[Wjitness credibility and the weight accorded testimony are within the province of the District Court.\u201d <em>Chamberlin, </em>277 Mont. at 207, 921 P.2d at 1242. Given the fact that Bearpaw had to consult with multiple individual clients, we cannot say that the District Court abused its discretion in awarding Bearpaw all of the fees it claimed for client conferences. While Fain\u2019s report suggests that Bearpaw has claimed fees for general association matters, the evidence that he provides of such is tenuous and incomplete. If, upon closer examination, the court determines that these claimed expenses were not in fact incurred in litigating this matter, they should not be charged to Chase. We cannot say that the District Court abused its discretion in according greater credibility to the testimony of Lee and adopting his recommended figure, albeit with slight modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>\u00b641 Nevertheless, the District Court did err in awarding fees-for-fees-totaling $15,494<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>-without determining whether those fees were incurred in establishing the entitlement to fees or in establishing the reasonable amount of fees. The District Court could not, pursuant to the terms of the Declaration, order Chase to compensate Bearpaw for fees incurred in establishing the proper amount of fees. Consequently, it abused its discretion in awarding Bearpaw <em>all </em>of the legal costs it had incurred in litigating the issue of attorney fees without making any effort to ascertain the specific source of those costs. Likewise, the District Court abused its discretion in awarding Bearpaw $5,777 for expenses it incurred in litigating the issue of Towe\u2019s withdrawal. We reverse and remand for a proper determination of the amount of fees, particularly fees-for-fees, that Bearpaw may recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">\u00b642  The District Court had authority to rule on Bearpaw\u2019s motion for attorney fees on August 13, 2004. The District Court properly awarded fees incurred by Bearpaw in defending its first appeal before this Court and in its initial proceedings in the District Court (excepting those expenses related to the withdrawal of Towe). The District Court properly awarded attorney fees incurred by Bearpaw in establishing its entitlement to fees. The District Court erred, as a matter of law, in awarding Bearpaw the fees that it incurred in establishing the compensable <em>amount </em>of attorney fees. The District Court also erred, as a matter of law, in awarding Bearpaw fees that it incurred in litigating the issue of Towe\u2019s withdrawal as Chase\u2019s attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">\u00b643 We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings concerning the amount of attorney fees that Bearpaw may recover consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b460-7\">JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER, MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b454-8\"> In his Amended Compliant, Chase specifically requested attorney fees pursuant to \u00a7 6.02 of the Declaration.

Leonard Smith testified that Bearpaw incurred an additional $8,352 in fees during August and September. Because the sole issue litigated on remand was the question of attorney fees, we assume that Bearpaw incurred these fees either in establishing its entitlement to fees, or in establishing a reasonable amount of fees.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
