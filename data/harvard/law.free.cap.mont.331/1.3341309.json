Both motions were denied by the Thirteenth Judicial District Court. Chase appeals from the District Court\u2019s second order, entered June 24, 2004, denying Chase\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea. We reverse. \u00b62 We consider the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b26-9\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea?</p>\n<p id=\"b26-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b26-11\">\u00b64 Sitting in a pickup truck on the banks of the Yellowstone River on the evening of July 26, 2002, and intending to stay overnight, Chase and his twenty-two-year-old son were talking and drinking beer when they were approached by Yellowstone County sheriffs deputies. The truck was parked at the end of an unimproved railroad service road which was closed to the public. The railroad had posted \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d signs, which were nearby and visible.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-12\">\u00b65 The deputies arrested Chase and charged him with Driving Under the Influence, a felony, and, alternatively, Operation of a Noncommercial Vehicle by Person With an Alcohol Concentration of .10 or more (DUI <em>per </em>se), also a felony. The District Court appointed the Yellowstone County Public Defender\u2019s office to represent Chase, and that office assigned Solomon Neuhardt (Neuhardt) to Chase\u2019s case. Neuhardt, after meeting with Chase, filed a motion to dismiss the charges on the grounds that Chase was not arrested on a \u201cway of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>state open to the public.\u201d Later, Neuhardt withdrew the motion without Chase\u2019s knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\">\u00b66 As Chase\u2019s case progressed toward trial, disagreement between Chase and Neuhardt became commonplace. Most distressing to Chase was his confusion or disagreement regarding (1) the effect of a guilty plea, (2) his potential status as a persistent felony offender, and (3) Neuhardt\u2019s unilateral withdrawal of the motion to dismiss. Chase brought the issues to the attention of the District Court, which concluded that Chase\u2019s concerns were \u201cseemingly substantial\u201d and therefore held a hearing to evaluate Neuhardt\u2019s effectiveness and to consider Chase\u2019s request for new counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">\u00b67 At the January 2, 2003, hearing, the District Court questioned Chase extensively regarding his dissatisfaction with Neuhardt. Neuhardt\u2019s withdrawal of the motion to dismiss on the \u201cway of the state open to the public\u201d issue was at the center of that questioning. Chase, as he had been from the beginning, was convinced that the DUI charge was inappropriate since he had been arrested on unimproved private property. After investigating the arrest scene, however, Neuhardt had reached a different conclusion, and believed the site to be a public fishing access. Consequently, Neuhardt withdrew the motion to dismiss, although he failed to notify Chase of the withdrawal until after it had occurred. Believing the private property status of the arrest scene his best defense, Chase could not understand this action and was angered by what he believed was Neuhardt\u2019s secret withdrawal of the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">\u00b68 Near the close of the hearing, the District Court expressed its approval of Neuhardt\u2019s actions regarding the motion, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-7\">There\u2019s no question in my mind that that issue would have failed. There was no grounds for a motion to dismiss based upon the fact that you weren\u2019t on a way open to the state-public way open to the state. I think Mr. Neuhardt made a good decision not to file the brief in support of that motion. I don\u2019t think he had grounds to do so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b27-8\">The court also opined that defense counsel\u2019s work had been above and beyond that expected in a DUI case, and denied Chase\u2019s request for new counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-9\">\u00b69 In response, Chase resignedly expressed his desire to enter a guilty plea, stating to the District Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-10\">If you\u2019re not going to [provide new counsel], I might as well go ahead and plead guilty and get sentenced to the pen and get on this with this [sic]. I can see where it\u2019s headed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b28-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>The court, obviously attempting to quell Chase\u2019s frustration, responded with this explanation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-4\">Mr. Chase, if you think you have some defenses, of course you can bring them to a jury. <em>I believe your attorney is correct, I don\u2019t see any legal defenses that would get you out of this. </em>There is the possibility that the State can\u2019t meet it\u2019s [sic] burden of proof, and you have the right to test that. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">Chase replied \u201cI don\u2019t see no sense in a trial\u201d and again offered to plead guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">\u00b610 The court then called a recess in the proceeding to allow Chase to speak with Neuhardt. After the recess, Chase tendered a signed Acknowledgment of Rights by Plea of Guilty form, and affirmed his desire to plead guilty. Thereafter, the court questioned Chase again, this time regarding his desire to plead guilty. While the colloquy was thorough, it is clear that Chase still believed that the location of his arrest was a viable defense to the DUI charge, and specifically, he was unwavering in his criticism of Neuhardt\u2019s withdrawal of the motion to dismiss on the \u201cpublic way\u201d issue, as the following exchange exemplifies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-7\">THE COURT: Obviously you have had concern about this because we just had a Finley hearing,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but I thought that he did a good job. I don\u2019t want my impressions to change yours. Are you truly satisfied with the investigation he\u2019s done in this case, with the time he spent with you on this case, and with his advice given to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-8\">[CHASE]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-9\">THE COURT: Okay. Then what\u2019s the concern?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-10\">CHASE: Him and me just have a disagreement on the private property issue, because there ain\u2019t no fishing access down there. The fishing access is on the other side of the river.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b28-11\">Pursuing testimony which would support acceptance of the guilty plea, the court also had trouble eliciting an admission by Chase that he was on a \u201cway of the state open to the public,\u201d as the following exchange exemplifies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>THE COURT: So you said in the previous hearing that we just had, you think you had a potential defense of a way open to the public; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-4\">CHASE: Well, when I went down there, what I knew of the DUI laws, if I had known enough, and went down, I wouldn\u2019t get one because we were going to stay there all night and not be driving. The cop come down. That\u2019s the only reason.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-5\">THE COURT: You were on a private road, apparently at some sort of fishing access by the Yellowstone River?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-6\">CHASE: They say a fishing access, but Burlington said it\u2019s not. Apparently that don\u2019t get brought up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-7\">THE COURT: You were on a private road owned by Burlington Northern; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-8\">CHASE: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-9\">THE COURT: Apparently leased to Montana Rail Link?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-10\">CHASE: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-11\">THE COURT: Do you guys agree it was a fishing access, or not? CHASE: Well, whether I disagree or not apparently ain\u2019t the point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-12\">THE COURT: Do you believe at this time, this juncture, that you were on a public road open to the public, even though it was a private road, but was open to the public, would you agree with that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-13\">CHASE: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b29-14\">The court ultimately accepted Chase\u2019s guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-15\">\u00b611 About a month later, on February 11, 2003, Neuhardt filed a motion to withdraw plea on behalf of Chase. Though Neuhardt did not support the motion with briefing or argument, the District Court again questioned Chase about the matter. Chase told the court that his guilty plea was the result of his confusion, and reiterated his belief that he had defenses to the DUI charge. Chase also affirmed his dissatisfaction with Neuhardt, and again requested new counsel. The court denied Chase\u2019s request for new counsel and his motion to withdraw the guilty plea. Thereafter, the court sentenced Chase to ten years in prison with five years suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-16\">\u00b612 On February 12, 2004, Chase requested appointment of counsel to further his efforts to withdraw his guilty plea. The District Court granted the request on March 10, 2004, and appointed the Appellate Defenders Office to represent Chase. That office, on behalf of Chase, moved for withdrawal of Chase\u2019s guilty plea. Upon review, the District Court issued an extensive order denying the motion, concluding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>its plea colloquy with Chase was adequate and that a basis for withdrawal of the plea did not exist. Chase appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">\u00b613 On a denial of a motion to withdraw a plea, this Court reviews a district court\u2019s findings of fact to determine if they are clearly erroneous, and the court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine if they are correct. <em>State v. Warclub, </em>2005 MT 149, \u00b6 24, 327 Mont. 352, \u00b6 24, 114 P.3d 254, \u00b6 24. A defendant\u2019s guilty plea must be voluntary, knowing, and intelligent. <em>State v. Radi </em>(1991), 250 Mont. 155, 159, 818 P.2d 1203, 1206; <em>citing North Carolina v. Alford </em>(1970), 400 U.S. 25, 91 S.Ct. 160, 27 L.Ed.2d 162. The question of a plea\u2019s voluntariness is a mixed question of law and fact, and we review such questions <em>de novo, </em>determining whether the district court\u2019s holding was correct. <em>Warclub, </em>\u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">\n<em>Did the District Court err in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b30-8\">\u00b614  Section 46-16-105(2), MCA (2001), permits a defendant to withdraw a guilty plea, before or after entry of judgment, if \u201cgood cause\u201d is shown. Section 46-16-105(2), MCA (2001). The involuntariness of a plea constitutes \u201cgood cause\u201d under \u00a7 46-16-105(2), MCA (2001). <em>State v. Lone Elk, </em>2005 MT 56, \u00b6 19, 326 Mont. 214, \u00b6 19, 108 P.3d 500, \u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-9\">\u00b615  The question presented here is whether Chase\u2019s January 2, 2003 plea of guilty was knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily entered. <em>See Warclub, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 17-18; <em>see also State v. Favi, </em>2005 MT 288, \u00b6 12,329 Mont. 273, \u00b6 12, 124 P.3d 164, \u00b6 12. As we stated in <em>State v. Ereth, </em>1998 MT 197, \u00b6 27, 290 Mont. 294, \u00b6 27, 964 P.2d 26, \u00b6 27, \u201c[t]his Court will deem a guilty plea involuntary where it appears that the defendant was laboring under such a strong inducement, fundamental mistake, or serious mental condition that the possibility exists that [h]e may have plead guilty to a crime of which [h]e is innocent.\u201d <em>Ereth, </em>\u00b6 27 (internal citations omitted); <em>see also State v. Pelke </em>(1964), 143 Mont. 262, 271, 389 P.2d 164, 169.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-10\">\u00b616 Convinced that he had been arrested on private property, thereby potentially negating a required element of his DUI charge, Chase disputed Neuhardt\u2019s conclusion that he had been on a \u201cway of the state open to the public\u201d when arrested. Neuhardt believed the arrest scene was a public fishing access, but Chase believed it was not. However, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>light of the District Court\u2019s apparent agreement with Neuhardt, and the manner in which the issue was explained, Chase pled guilty under a belief that the \u201cpublic way\u201d defense was either not valid or could not be further pursued.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-4\">\u00b617 There is information in the record which provided a basis for Chase\u2019s belief in this defense. There was no dispute that the arrest site was private property, and an affidavit by Pete Lawrenson, Chief of Security and Safety for Montana Rail Link, indicated that, \u201cTHE PUBLIC IS NOT ALLOWED ON THE PROPERTY\u201d (emphasis in original). \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d signs were posted at the site, and area maps noted that the area was private. Law enforcement personnel were well aware that the area was closed to the public. While defense counsel visited the scene, neither railroad and nor law enforcement officials were consulted regarding the status of the property. When asked why railroad officials were never contacted regarding the property, a defense investigator gave the curious response that Chase\u2019s daughter had never given them the names and phone numbers of the officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">\u00b618 We reach no conclusion here regarding whether Chase was on \u201ca way of this state open to the public,\u201d and likewise decline to take up the State\u2019s argument that the District Court\u2019s analysis of the issue was proper under <em>State v. Weis </em>(1997), 285 Mont. 41, 945 P.2d 900. As the District Court correctly noted in its order denying Chase\u2019s motion to withdraw plea, the public way issue \u201cis not the real issue before the Court today,\u201d but, rather, the issue is Chase\u2019s understanding when he entered the plea. The record information about the investigation, however, serves to demonstrate that there was a legitimate basis for Chase\u2019s belief that this defense had not been adequately pursued, giving rise to uncertainty about his guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">\u00b619  A significant part of the voluntariness inquiry is an evaluation of the court\u2019s plea colloquy with the defendant, the purpose of which is to ensure that the defendant had been well advised of his options and the potential consequences of his plea. <em>Ereth, </em>\u00b6 27; <em>see also Brady v. United States </em>(1970), 397 U.S. 742, 755, 90 S.Ct. 1463, 1472, 25 L.Ed.2d 747, 760. While the District Court thoroughly questioned Chase multiple times regarding his counsel\u2019s performance and his desire to plea guilty, the Court nevertheless made comments which, under the circumstances, appear to have unintentionally helped to prompt a guilty plea from Chase which was not knowing and intelligent. Specifically, Chase appeared to lack understanding about the distinction between raising the \u201cpublic way\u201d issue as a legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>defense and raising it as a factual defense. First, with regard to Neuhardt\u2019s withdrawal of the motion to dismiss on the \u201cpublic way\u201d issue, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-4\">There\u2019s no question in my mind that that issue would have failed. There was no grounds for a motion to dismiss based upon the fact that you weren\u2019t on a way open to the state - public way open to the state. I think Mr. Neuhardt made a good decision not to file the brief in support of that motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">Then, after Chase expressed resignation that \u201cI can see where it\u2019s headed,\u201d the court added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-6\">Mr. Chase, if you think you have some defenses, of course you can bring them to a jury. I believe your attorney is correct, I don\u2019t see any legal defenses that would get you out of this. There is the possibility that the State can\u2019t meet it\u2019s [sic] burden of proof, and you have the right to test that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">While the court may have been correct in stating there were no legal defenses as a matter of law, it is problematic that the court confidently expressed its view on an issue which could also have been tested factually before a jury. Clearly, it was not explained to Chase by the Court that the \u201cpublic way\u201d issue he felt strongly about, while not constituting a legal defense to the charge, was yet available as factual defense which he could raise at trial. From our review of the record, it appears that Chase believed the issue was entirely lost, and then pled guilty based upon that incorrect understanding, evident from the uncertain exchanges during the plea colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-8\">THE COURT: You were on a private road, apparently at some sort of fishing access by the Yellowstone River?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-9\">CHASE: They say a fishing access, but Burlington said it\u2019s not. Apparently that don\u2019t get brought up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-10\">THE COURT: Do you guys agree it was a fishing access, or not? CHASE: Well, whether I disagree or not apparently ain\u2019t the point.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b32-11\">\u00b620 The conclusion that Chase pled guilty under the mistaken impression that he had entirely lost his \u201cpublic way\u201d defense is further bolstered by defense counsel\u2019s testimony at the hearing. When asked whether he had advised Chase that, even if a motion to dismiss on the \u201cpublic way\u201d issue was not pursued, the issue could still be raised at trial, defense counsel responded, \u201cI don\u2019t remember discussing that with him.\u201d Thus, there is no evidence that Chase had been advised or was aware of this important distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>\u00b621  As a result, we conclude that Chase did not enter his plea knowingly and intelligently. Rather, it appears he entered the plea on the basis of a fundamental misunderstanding which he held regarding the availability of his \u201cpublic way\u201d defense. We therefore reverse the District Court\u2019s denial of the motion to withdraw guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">\u00b622 Reversed and remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b33-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, LEAPHART and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b28-12\"> A district court must undertake review of a defendant\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel when the claims are \u201cseemingly substantial.\u201d <em>State v.
