We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">\u00b62 The Appellants raise the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b48-10\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err by concluding that the Appellants brought this action as taxpayers and, as such, lacked standing to challenge Montana\u2019s school funding system under the equitable funding of education provision of Article X, Section 1 of the Montana Constitution?</p>\n<p id=\"b48-11\">\u00b64 Is equality of educational opportunity a fundamental constitutional right under Montana\u2019s Constitution?</p>\n<p id=\"b48-12\">\u00b65 Did the District Court err by denying the Appellants\u2019 motion to summarily judge Montana\u2019s school funding system unconstitutional? \u00b66 Because we conclude that this matter is no longer justiciable, we decline to address the issues raised by the Appellants herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-13\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b48-14\">\u00b67 The Appellants filed suit in the District Court challenging the constitutionality of Montana\u2019s system of funding public schools. Their complaint claimed that the system violated equal protection, due process, the \u201cTax Purposes\u201d Clause (Article VIII, Section 1, denominated their \u201cuniform taxation\u201d claim), and the \u201cProperty Tax Administration\u201d Clause (Article VIII, Section 3, referred to as the \u201ctax equalization doctrine\u201d). In an order dated September 30, 2002, the District Court dismissed the Appellants\u2019 complaint, concluding that the claims as alleged must fail. Thereafter, the court granted the Appellants leave to amend their pleadings, and, in their Second Amended Complaint (\u201cComplaint\u201d hereinafter), the Appellants alleged that the State violated \u201cthe equitable funding provisions of Article X, Sect. 1 (3)\u201d of the Montana Constitution \u201cbecause the system of funding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>the state\u2019s share of the base budget arbitrarily and capriciously imposes different mill levies on like taxpayers.\u201d In support of the Complaint, Conrad Stroebe submitted an affidavit in which he averred that he and his wife were both public school board members and parents of students in Montana public schools.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">\u00b68 The State moved to dismiss the Complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, pursuant to Ride 12(b)(6), M.R.Civ.P., arguing that the Appellants lacked standing to bring suit under Article X, Section 1(3). The Appellants responded by moving for summary judgment, requesting that the District Court declare the school funding system unconstitutional as violating the Public Schools Clause of Article X. In its order of December 3,2003, the District Court granted the State\u2019s motion, concluding that the Appellants had clearly brought the action as taxpayers, and that the Public Schools Clause does not convey standing to taxpayers to bring suit. Further, the District Court denied the Appellants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. The Stroebes appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">\u00b69 \u201cWe review a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), M.R.Civ.P., <em>de novo.\u201d Cowan v. Cowan, </em>2004 MT 97, \u00b6 10, 321 Mont. 13, \u00b6 10, 89 P.3d 6, \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">\u00b610 Is the question whether Montana\u2019s school funding system satisfies the equitable funding provisions of Article X, Section 1(3) of the Montana Constitution currently justiciable?</p>\n<p id=\"b49-9\">\u00b611 The parties offer countering arguments regarding the District Court\u2019s dismissal of the action for the Appellants\u2019 lack of standing. The Appellants contend that the District Court erred in concluding that they brought their action only as taxpayers because they are also parents of children in the public schools and as members of public school boards, referencing their supporting affidavit. Alternatively, the Appellants argue that, even if they brought the action only as taxpayers, that status is sufficient to confer standing under this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Helena Parents Comm\u2019n v. Lewis and Clark County Comm\u2019rs </em>(1996), 277 Mont. 367, 922 P.2d 1140.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-10\">\u00b612 The State responds that the District Court correctly found that the Appellants based their Complaint entirely on their status as taxpayers, not as parents or public school board members on behalf of students, and that the Appellants\u2019 taxpayer status was sufficient only to bring their \u201cuniform taxation\u201d and other tax-related constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>claims. Because the Appellants offer no argument on appeal regarding these other claims, the State argues that we should affirm the District Court\u2019s holdings thereon. However, except for their equal protection argument, mentioned below, the Appellants do not challenge the District Court\u2019s other rulings on appeal, and thus, we do not address them.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">\u00b613 Beyond standing, the Appellants argue for the relief they ultimately seek-for this Court to \u201cdirect the entry of summary judgment holding Montana\u2019s school-funding system unconstitutional.\u201d The Appellants argue that the school system is more inequitably funded now than it was at the time it was declared unconstitutional by this Court in <em>Helena Elementary School District No. 1 v. State </em>(1989), 236 Mont. 44, 769 P.2d 689. Asserting that educational opportunity is a fundamental right, the Appellants argue that the District Court erred by applying a rational basis test and in holding that the school funding system did not violate equal protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">\u00b614  Standing is part of the larger question whether a controversy is justiciable. The question of justiciability of a matter may be raised by the Court <em>sua sponte. Skinner v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>2005 MT 323, \u00b6 15, 329 Mont. 511, \u00b6 15, 127 P.3d 359 \u00b6 15. Generally, justiciability is evaluated under a three-part test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-6\">First, a justiciable controversy requires that parties have existing and genuine, as distinguished from theoretical, rights or interest. Second, the controversy must be one upon which the judgment of the court may effectively operate, as distinguished from a debate or argument invoking a purely political, administrative, philosophical or academic conclusion. Third, it must be a controversy the judicial determination of which will have the effect of a final judgment in law or decree in equity upon the rights, status or legal relationships of one or more of the real parties in interest, or lacking these qualities be of such overriding public moment as to constitute the legal equivalent of all of them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"As\"><em>Skinner, </em>\u00b6 15 (quoting <em>Northfield Ins. Co. v. Montana Ass\u2019n of Counties, </em>2000 MT 256, \u00b6 12, 301 Mont. 472, \u00b6 12, 10 P.3d 813, \u00b6 12) (brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">\u00b615 Recently, we addressed the constitutionality of Montana\u2019s school funding system in <em>Columbia Falls Elementary Sch. Dist. No. 6 v. State, </em>2005 MT 69, 326 Mont. 304, 109 P.3d 257. We held therein that \u201cthe current school system is constitutionally deficient,\u201d <em>Columbia Falls, </em>\u00b6 22, and we referred the matter to the Legislature for reform of the system. <em>Columbia Falls, </em>\u00b6 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">\u00b616 Also raised in <em>Columbia Falls </em>was the issue the Appellants raise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>here-whether the school funding system violates equal protection. <em>Columbia Falls, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 8, 38. Taking up this issue after holding the system unconstitutional as inadequately designed and funded, we stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-4\">The District Court concluded that the present system violates Article X, Section 1(3), of the Montana Constitution (basic system of free quality public schools), but not Article II, Section 4 (equal protection). Since we have concluded that the present system violates Article X, Section 1(3), we need not address the question of whether the system complies with the Equal Protection Clause of Article II, Section 4. <em>See Helena Elementary, </em>236 Mont. at 55, 769 P.2d at 691. Similarly, when the District Court concluded that the present system violates Article X, Section 1(3), it need not have addressed the Coalition\u2019s equal protection claim. Accordingly, we direct the District Court to vacate its conclusion that the system does not violate the Equal Protection Clause of Article II, Section 4, of the Montana Constitution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-5\"><em>Columbia Falls, </em>\u00b6 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">\u00b617  Likewise, we here conclude that we need not address the Appellants\u2019 equal protection challenge to the school funding system. <em>Columbia Falls </em>requires that the system undergo reform, and, consequently, a further constitutional challenge to the funding system at this time is not \u201cone upon which the judgment of the court may effectively operate.\u201d <em>Skinner, </em>\u00b6 5. Indeed, the system as challenged by the Appellants has already been invalidated and is undergoing change. Regardless of what constitutional insufficiencies may have plagued the previous funding system, the circumstances under which this action was brought have now sufficiently changed as a result of <em>Columbia Falls </em>that another judgment from this Court would come both too late and too early-that is, too late for the old system and too early for the new system. To render a decision now would not only interfere with our decision in <em>Columbia Falls, </em>but would decide a question that has been essentially mooted. Consequently, we hold that the equitable funding challenge raised herein by the Appellants is not currently justiciable.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">\u00b618 The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b51-8\">JUSTICES NELSON, WARNER, LEAPHART and, COTTER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
