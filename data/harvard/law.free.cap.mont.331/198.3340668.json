(Mother) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>and A.E., II (Father) with regard to their son, A.J.E., III (A.J.E.). On different grounds, both parents appeal. We restate the issues as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">\u00b62 1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in terminating Mother\u2019s parental rights by concluding that conditions rendering Mother unfit to parent were unlikely to change within a reasonable time pursuant to \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(f)(ii), MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">\u00b63 2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in terminating Father\u2019s parental rights because Father could not assume the role of parent within a reasonable time?</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">\u00b64 A.J.E. was born on August 10, 2003, to Mother and Father. At nine days old, Mother, who suffered from bipolar disorder, took A. J.E. to visit Father at Montana Chemical Dependency Center (MCDC) where he was incarcerated for assault on a police officer. Concerned by Mother\u2019s disoriented appearance-she was wearing pajamas and two different shoes-and by the fact that A. J.E. was covered in feces and urine, MCDC called the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services, Child and Family Services Division (State). Stephanie Galle, a social worker with the State, responded to the call and removed A. J.E. from Mother\u2019s custody. Galle had Mother taken to St. James Hospital for a crisis response evaluation; she was subsequently committed to the Montana State Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">\u00b65 Galle transported A.J.E. to the office of Dr. Mark Rafferty, a family practitioner who had provided prenatal care to Mother. Dr. Rafferty noted that A.J.E. had lost weight and diagnosed him as suffering from failure to thrive syndrome. The District Court granted temporary legal custody to the State, which placed A. J.E. in foster care-where he has lived throughout the pendency of this case-and issued an order adjudicating A. J.E. as a youth in need of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">\u00b66 OnNovember 15,2004, the District Court conducted a hearing for termination of Mother\u2019s and Father\u2019s parental rights. The court heard testimony from several professionals who had evaluated and/or worked with Mother and Father.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">\u00b67 Dr. Rafferty testified that he had concerns over Mother\u2019s ability to parent. During Mother\u2019s postpartum visits, he observed Mother cause A. J.E. to become hypoxic by smashing A. J.E.\u2019s nose against her breast tissue while breast-feeding him. Family members contacted Dr. Rafferty to complain that Mother failed to properly clothe and feed A. J.E. Dr. Rafferty also noticed a bruise and black eye on Mother and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>suspected that Father physically abused her. Although Mother denied that Father hurt her, family members confirmed Dr. Rafferty\u2019s suspicions.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">\u00b68 Two clinical psychologists, Dr. Ned Tranel and Dr. William Cook, evaluated Mother to determine whether she could safely and adequately parent A.J.E. Dr. Tranel performed a psychological evaluation on September 24, 2003, concluding that Mother had three severe and chronic handicapping conditions relative to her inability to parent. First, she suffered from borderline level of intellectual functioning-a level slightly below the cut-off point for mild mental retardation. Second, Dr. Tranel described Mother as having a brief psychotic disorder, meaning that while under stress, Mother would float into and out of reality. Finally, Dr. Tranel believed Mother had a grossly inadequate concept of parenting behaviors-sometimes described as a deficit in emotional intelligence, or a deficit in the ability to identify and utilize available resources for performing one\u2019s every day tasks. Such deficits, Dr. Tranel testified, could not be controlled with medication. Based on these conclusions, Dr. Tranel opined that Mother could not meet the minimal standards of parenting for a young child, even with rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">\u00b69 Dr. Cook evaluated Mother on November 14, 2003, and reached conclusions similar to those of Dr. Tranel. Dr. Cook\u2019s testing results indicated that Mother suffered from a thought disorder or mood instability, exasperated by her failure to consistently take her medication. Persons with such a thought disorder often lack insight into their problems and tend to harbor anger and resentment towards others, while mood instability can preclude attending to the needs of a child and choosing appropriate peers. Dr. Cook noted that Mother had poor judgment and had difficulty protecting herself within a relationship, specifically with regard to Father; he expressed concerns that Mother would not be able to protect A. J.E. from Father. Dr. Cook further concluded that based on his evaluation, Mother did not have the ability to meet the needs of a child within a reasonable time.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">\u00b610 The Court approved a treatment plan for Mother, which despite the State\u2019s assistance, she failed to complete. Specifically, Mother did not obtain medical and psychiatric diagnosis and treatment, nor did she consistently attend mental health appointments. Mother also failed to attend family and individual counseling and did not follow the guidelines of the visitation contract, as she failed to provide appropriate attention to A. J.E. during their visits. On one occasion, A.J.E. crawled dangerously close to a floor heater when Mother left <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>him unattended. Moreover, Mother\u2019s in-home parenting coach had to perform many of the tasks Mother needed to do for herself, including preparing meals, getting bottles ready and bathing A. J.E.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">\u00b611 Cheryl D\u2019Remy, Mother\u2019s therapist at the Western Montana Health Center from August 2001 to June 2004, testified that during Mother\u2019s three years of treatment, she observed no change in Mother\u2019s ability to deal with life\u2019s problems. D\u2019Remy found it difficult to work with Mother because Mother did not feel a need to make changes in her life and turned away from resources. D\u2019Remy explained that Mother needed to develop many skills, including how to make healthy, appropriate companions, how to deal with conflict and stress, and how to manage money. D\u2019Remy noted that Mother did not see the use in taking classes for stress and anger management or parenting, even though throughout treatment, Mother became easily stressed and reacted with hostility. Mother also excused Father\u2019s temper, which caused D\u2019Remy to worry that Mother would not be able to shield A. J.E. from potential abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">\u00b612 Paula Van Meel, a family support worker involved in the parenting classes Mother attended, supervised some of Mother\u2019s visits with A.J.E; she testified that Mother needed cues in order to implement her parenting training. Although Van Meel believed that Mother loved A. J.E. and would not intentionally cause him harm, she expressed concern over leaving Mother to parent alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">\u00b613 David Fenchak, the Executive Director of the Anaconda Family Resource Center, also supervised visits between Mother and A.J.E. Fenchak similarly opined that he did not feel comfortable leaving A. J.E. with Mother unsupervised.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">\u00b614 With regard to Father, the State presented testimony from Dr. Tranel and Dr. Page, both of whom noted that Father\u2019s incarceration in the Great Falls Regional Prison created an initial prohibitory factor.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">\u00b615 Dr. Tranel testified first, providing the results of an evaluation he performed on Father at Montana State Prison on January 21, 2004-approximately ten months prior to the termination hearing. Because Father refused to complete the standard testing procedures, Dr. Tranel explained that he instead spent several hours talking with Father and reviewing voluminous records and data relating to Father\u2019s history. Dr. Tranel\u2019s findings included a diagnosis of antisocial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>personality disorder and poly substance dependence, as well as a suggestion of bipolar disorder. Dr. Tranel advised that Father could not adequately parent A. J.E. and, further, that it was highly unlikely that he would be able to parent within a reasonable time because Father lacked awareness of his shortcomings and resisted treatment. \u00b616 Dr. Page, who administered a battery of tests to Father on March 11,2004, testified to having reached similar conclusions to those of Dr. Tranel, including a diagnosis of antisocial behavior. In particular, Dr. Page noted that Father\u2019s anger issues-including a tendency to act outwardly towards objects or people when enraged-could negatively affect his ability to parent. In addition, Father\u2019s one-dimensional awareness of parenting skills indicated that he would have trouble making spontaneous decisions in the best interest of a child. Moreover, Dr. Page testified that separating A. J.E. from his foster parents, with whom he had bonded, would likely cause A.J.E. to suffer reactive attachment disorder, hindering his ability to form healthy patterns of emotional growth. Based on these factors, Dr. Page concluded that Father could not safely parent A.J.E.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">\u00b6 17 At the termination hearing, Father testified, setting forth reasons for why the court should provide him the opportunity to parent his son. Father testified that he had taken steps to rehabilitate himself, including attending group mental health treatment sessions and completing anger management, parenting, and cognitive principles and restructuring classes. Father pointed out that he completed these classes after Dr. Tranel and Dr. Page completed their evaluations. \u00b618 To rebut Father\u2019s testimony implying that he had overcome his behavioral problems, the State elicited Dr. Page\u2019s opinion as to whether Father\u2019s rehabilitation efforts improved his chances of parenting adequately. Dr. Page testified that despite his efforts, Father still lacked adequate skills to parent. In reaching this conclusion, Dr. Page relied on his professional experience, as well as an evaluation performed by Dr. Timothy J. Casey, another clinical psychologist, who met with Father in August 2004, a few months after Dr. Tranel and Dr. Page performed their evaluations and after Father had completed his rehabilitative programs.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Dr. Page noted that Dr. Casey presented an opinion consistent with Dr. Page\u2019s-that is, that Father did not have the appropriate level of skill to parent A. J.E. Dr. Page further testified that dramatic changes in individuals such as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>Father are rare.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">\u00b619 Social worker Galle asked the court to terminate Father\u2019s parental rights, given Father\u2019s prison status, violent history and lack of relationship with A.J.E. Galle also asked the court to terminate Mother\u2019s parental rights because Mother failed to successfully complete her parenting plan and, in Galle\u2019s opinion, A. J.E. would not be safe in Mother\u2019s care. Moreover, Galle advised that removing A. J.E. from his foster home where he was thriving and bonded to potential adoptive parents would not be in his best interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">\u00b620 Based on the testimony and evidence presented at the termination hearing, the District Court terminated Mother\u2019s and Father\u2019s parental rights and awarded legal custody to the State, concluding that since Mother\u2019s and Father\u2019s \u201cconduct or conditions ... are unlikely to change within a reasonable time,\u201d foster care and/or adoption served A. J.E.\u2019s best interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">\u00b621 We review a district court\u2019s decision to terminate parental rights to determine whether the court abused its discretion. The test for an abuse of discretion is whether the trial court acted arbitrarily, without employment of conscientious judgment, or exceeded the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice. However, because a parent\u2019s right to the care and custody of a child is a fundamental liberty interest, it must be protected by fundamentally fair procedures. To satisfy the relevant statutory requirements for terminating a parent-child relationship, a district court must make specific factual findings. We review those findings of fact to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. Lastly, we review the court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether the court interpreted the law correctly. <em>Matter of A.F., </em>2003 MT 254, \u00b6 12, 317 Mont. 367, \u00b6 12, 77 P.3d 266, \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">\u00b622 The district court is bound to give primary consideration to the physical, mental and emotional conditions and needs of the child. Section 41-3-609(3), MCA. Consequently, the best interests of the child are of paramount concern in a parental rights termination proceeding and take precedence over the parental rights. Moreover, the party seeking to terminate parental rights must demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the statutory requirements for termination have been met. <em>Matter of A.F., </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">\u00b623 We presume that a district court\u2019s decision in such a case is correct and will not disturb it on appeal unless there is a mistake of law or a finding of fact not supported by substantial evidence that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>would amount to clear abuse of discretion. <em>Matter </em>of A.F., \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">\u00b624 1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in terminating Mother\u2019s parental rights by concluding that conditions rendering Mother unfit to parent were unlikely to change within a reasonable time pursuant to \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(f)(ii), MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">\u00b625 Section 41-3-609(l)(f), MCA, states that a district court may order the termination of the parent-child relationship where \u201cthe child is an adjudicated youth in need of care and both of the following exist: (i) an appropriate treatment plan that has been approved by the court has not been complied with by the parents or has not been successful; and (ii) the conduct or condition of the parents rendering them unfit is unlikely to change within a reasonable time.\u201d Section 41-3-609(l)(f), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">\u00b626 Mother concedes that the District Court adjudicated A.J.E. a youth in need of care and that she failed to successfully complete a treatment plan approved by the court. However, Mother maintains that the court erred in concluding that the conduct or condition rendering her unfit to parent was unlikely to change within a reasonable time, as required by subsection (ii) of \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(f), MCA. Specifically, Mother contends that the District Court erroneously relied on \u201cstale evidence and incomplete files\u201d because Dr. Tranel and Dr. Cook performed their evaluations approximately one year prior to the termination hearing and lacked knowledge of her rehabilitation efforts. Mother further points out that the District Court misstated in its conclusions of law \u201cthat both clinical psychologists had the benefit of the current evaluation of Dr. Tim Casey in reaching their conclusions\u201d when the record shows that neither psychologist relied on Dr. Casey\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">\u00b627 Mother cites to <em>In Re the Matter of J.C., Jr. and R.B., </em>2003 MT 369, \u00b6 11, 319 Mont. 112, \u00b6 11, 82 P.3d 900, \u00b6 11, in which we held that a district court is required to assess \u201cthe past and present conduct of the parent\u201d when determining whether the conduct or condition rendering a parent unfit is likely to change within a reasonable time. Mother emphasizes this Court\u2019s statement in <em>Matter of J.C. </em>that a district court should, at least in part, look to a parent\u2019s \u201cpresent conduct.\u201d Importantly, however, we also emphasized in <em>Matter of J.C. </em>the importance of looking to a parent\u2019s <em>past </em>behavior in determining his or her fitness to parent in the future-without a \u201ccrystal ball,\u201d a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>decision to terminate parental rights must \u201cto some extent [find basis in] a person\u2019s past conduct.\u201d <em>Matter of J.C., </em>\u00b6 11. This Court affirmed the District Court\u2019s decision to terminate J.C.\u2019s mother\u2019s parental rights, even though she had made improvements, because his mother had a \u201chistory\u201d of not following through with her \u201cstrides\u201d and \u201csteps.\u201d <em>Matter of J.C., </em>\u00b6 15. Moreover, we noted \u201cthat evidence of rehabilitation does not render a district court powerless to find future danger to the child, it is simply evidence to be considered by the district court.\u201d <em>Matter of J.C., </em>\u00b6 16. We therefore concluded that the court did not abuse its discretion when it found that the mother\u2019s history of noncompliance with her treatment plan outweighed her more recent efforts to comply with the plan. <em>Matter of J.C., </em>\u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">\u00b628 In this case, the District Court assessed evidence from a variety of professionals who had evaluated and/or observed Mother since A. J.E.\u2019s birth. While the District Court misstated in its conclusions of law that Dr. Tranel and Dr. Cook relied on a current evaluation by Dr. Casey, when in fact, neither psychologist referenced a report by Dr. Casey, this misstatement amounts to harmless error. <em>See In the Matter of S. C. and </em>L.Z., 2005 MT 241, \u00b6 29, 328 Mont. 476, \u00b6 29, 121 P.3d 552, \u00b6 29 (\u201c[a] harmless error does not mandate that we reverse a district court\u2019s judgment; an error must cause substantial prejudice to warrant reversal.\u201d) (citation omitted). The fact that Dr. Tranel and Dr. Cook evaluated Mother roughly one year before the termination hearing and did not rely on more recent information does not lessen the import of their testimony, which centered on Mother\u2019s chronic disabilities which preclude her from parenting adequately. Moreover, a therapist, a family support worker and the Executive Director of the Anaconda Family Resource Center-all of whom worked with Mother in the months after Dr. Tranel and Dr. Cook performed their psychological evaluations-testified that despite the State\u2019s efforts to help Mother learn necessary skills through parenting and anger management classes, she exhibited an inability to implement the lessons taught. Not one of these professionals felt comfortable with the idea of leaving A.J.E. alone with Mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">\u00b629  Given the evidence presented at the termination hearing, we conclude that the District Court employed conscientious judgment and did not abuse its discretion in concluding that \u201c[t]he conduct or condition of [Mother] rendering [her] unfit is unlikely to change within a reasonable time.\u201d Section 41-3-609(l)(f)(ii), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">\u00b630 2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in terminating Father\u2019s parental rights because Father could not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>assume the role of parent within a reasonable time?</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">\u00b631 Section 41-3-609(4)(b), MCA, states that a district court may terminate parental rights without requiring a treatment plan if \u201ctwo medical doctors or clinical psychologists submit testimony that the parent cannot assume the role of parent within a reasonable time.\u201d Section 41-3-609(4)(b), MCA. Pursuant to this section, the District Court terminated Father\u2019s rights based on the testimony of two clinical psychologists\u2019 opinions that it was unlikely Father would be able to parent within a reasonable time.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">\u00b632 Father argues that the District Court erred in relying on Dr. Tranel\u2019s and Dr. Page\u2019s testimony because both psychologists evaluated Father before he engaged in various treatments through the <em>prison </em>system. Dr. Tranel evaluated Father roughly nine months prior to the termination hearing,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> while Dr. Page conducted his evaluation approximately seven months before the hearing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In the months after the psychological evaluations and prior to the hearing, Father completed the intensive treatment unit at the Montana State Prison for chemical dependency, parenting, anger management, and cognitive principles and restructuring; he also attended group mental health counseling at the Great Falls Regional Prison. Father maintains that in light of these rehabilitative steps, Dr. Tranel and Dr. Page provided outdated reports and therefore, the District Court should not have relied on their testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">\u00b633 As we noted above, \u201cevidence of rehabilitation does not render a district court powerless to find future danger to the child, it is simply evidence to be considered by the district court.\u201d <em>Matter of J.C., </em>\u00b6 16. While Father took steps to rehabilitate himself, the court determined that Father\u2019s extensive criminal history-including partner assault on Mother and violent behavior-as well as his lack of responsibility for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>behavior that made him unavailable to parent his child, contradicted his claims of rehabilitation. The court appropriately looked to Dr. Tranel\u2019s opinion that Father suffered from antisocial personality disorder, poly substance dependence and likely bipolar disorder, and Dr. Page\u2019s conclusion that Father\u2019s tendency to behave aggressively when angry would inhibit his ability to parent appropriately, as well as both psychologists\u2019 advice that it was highly unlikely that Father would be able to rehabilitate within a reasonable time.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">\u00b634  Given Father\u2019s extensive history with mental instability, aggression and crime, as presented by two clinical psychologists, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that Father could not assume the role of parent within a reasonable time. In the best interest of A. J.E., the court appropriately ordered termination of Father\u2019s parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">\u00b635 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b231-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, MORRIS and WARNER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b225-9\"> While Father resided in MCDC at the time of A.

Not only did Father fail to object to Dr. Page\u2019s testimony during the hearing, the District Court appropriately allowed Dr. Page\u2019s testimony on grounds that the information in Dr. Casey\u2019s report is of the type normally relied on by these clinical experts in the formulation of their opinion. <em>See </em>Rule 703, M.R.Evid.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
