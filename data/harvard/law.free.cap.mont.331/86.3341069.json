We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">\u00b62 Joseph raises the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">\u00b63 1. Whether sufficient other evidence supported Joseph\u2019s conviction for assault with a weapon even assuming Joseph preserved his <em>Crawford </em>issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">\u00b64 2. Whether the District Court abused its discretion by denying Joseph\u2019s motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">\u00b65 Early in the morning of December 29, 2003, after an evening of drinking, Joseph came home and argued with his pregnant girlfriend, Tracyn Elrich (Tracyn). Joseph struck Tracyn in the face, back, and stomach, pulled her hair, and slammed her head against the wall. Joseph\u2019s brother, David-who along with his wife and daughter, Tiffany Paoni (Tiffany), lived in the same house as Joseph-attempted to break up the fight between Joseph and Tracyn. The argument between the two brothers escalated until Joseph eventually struck David in the eye with the butt of a rifle.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-10\">\u00b66 Tiffany called 911 and summoned officers to the house, alerting law enforcement that Joseph was drunk and armed with a gun. David also spoke with the 911 operator and informed her that Joseph had struck him in the face with the gun. He further told the operator that he had disarmed Joseph and locked the rifle in the trunk of his car. David also informed the operator that Joseph was now outside the house and possibly armed with a knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-11\">\u00b67 Police officers arrived at the house and arrested Joseph. The State charged Joseph with assault with a weapon, two counts of criminal endangerment, partner-family member assault, and criminal mischief. The State premised the assault with a weapon charge on Joseph striking David in the face with the butt of a rifle.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-12\">\u00b68 David moved with his family, including Tiffany, to Sangamon County, Illinois, before Joseph\u2019s trial began. The District Court for the Twenty-First Judicial District, Ravalli County, issued subpoenas for David and Tiffany and the State mailed them to the Sangamon County Sheriffs Office. Nothing in the record indicates that the State or proper authorities presented the subpoena to a Sangamon County court of record, as required by \u00a7 46-15-113, MCA. The sheriff in Illinois attempted to serve David by leaving a copy of the subpoena at his abode. Thus, it appears that the Illinois authorities failed to serve the Ravalli County subpoena personally on David, as required by \u00a7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>46-15-107, MCA. The State admitted that it was unlikely David or Tiffany would show up to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">\u00b69 Joseph moved to dismiss the assault with a weapon count on Sixth Amendment grounds before trial. He argued that the Sixth Amendment guaranteed him the right to confront the witnesses against him, and if David failed to show up for trial he would not have the ability to cross-examine David, examine his motives, or examine his testimony. The District Court denied the motion. Joseph\u2019s counsel then informed the court that he would object to any hearsay statements by David as the State offered them at trial. David and Tiffany did not appear at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">\u00b610 The State opened the trial by attributing the following statement to Joseph: \u201cI want the baby dead. I hope the baby dies.\u201d Joseph did not object at the time, but instead moved for a mistrial the following day during a conference in chambers based on the State\u2019s use of these remarks. Joseph argued that the State\u2019s use of Joseph\u2019s comment denied him his right to a fair trial. The District Court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">\u00b611 Both the State and Joseph offered into evidence during trial statements made by David. Joseph largely failed to object to the admission of David\u2019s hearsay statements. For instance, Deputy Rhodes, one of the officers who arrived on the scene after Tiffany had called 911, testified that David told him that he and Joseph had engaged in a physical scuffle, and that Joseph had caused David\u2019s injuries by striking him in the face with the rifle. Joseph made no objection to this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">\u00b612 The jury found Joseph guilty on all charges. Joseph then filed a Motion for a New Trial and/or Motion for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict on the assault with a weapon charge against David and one of the criminal endangerment charges. Joseph argued that the District Court improperly had admitted all of David\u2019s hearsay statements in violation of Joseph\u2019s Sixth Amendment right of confrontation as expounded in <em>Crawford v. Washington </em>(2004), 541 U.S. 36,124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177. The District Court denied the motion and entered a judgment of conviction on all counts. The court sentenced Joseph to 20 years in the Montana State Prison with 5 years suspended. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">\u00b613 We review rulings on the admissibility of evidence under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>State v. Damon, </em>2005 MT 218, \u00b6 12,328 Mont. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>276, \u00b6 12, 119 P.3d 1194, \u00b6 12. We leave determination of the relevancy and the admissibility of evidence to the sound discretion of the trial judge, and we will not overturn it absent a showing of abuse of discretion. <em>Damon, </em>\u00b6 12. The standard for denial of a motion for a mistrial is whether the district court abused its discretion. <em>State v. Steele, </em>2004 MT 275, \u00b6 15, 323 Mont. 204, \u00b6 15, 99 P.3d 210, \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">\u00b614 1. Whether sufficient other evidence supported Joseph\u2019s conviction for assault with a weapon even assuming Joseph preserved his <em>Crawford </em>issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">\u00b615 Joseph argues on appeal that the District Court violated his Sixth Amendment right to confront the witnesses against him, as expounded in <em>Crawford, </em>when it admitted certain of David\u2019s hearsay statements. The State counters that Joseph failed to raise a proper objection at trial and thus waived the right to raise the confrontation clause issue on appeal. Alternatively, the State argues that the District Court correctly admitted David\u2019s statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">\u00b616  A defendant waives an objection and may not seek appellate review when a defendant fails to make a contemporaneous objection to an alleged error in the trial court. Section 46-20-104(2), MCA; <em>State v. Olsen, </em>2004 MT 158, \u00b6 10, 322 Mont. 1, \u00b6 10, 92 P.3d 1204, \u00b6 10. A defendant does not waive an issue by failing to object at trial, however, when he has filed a motion sufficiently specific to preserve the issue for appeal. <em>State v. Vukasin, 2003 MT 230, </em>\u00b6 29, 317 Mont. 204, \u00b6 29, 75 P.3d 1284, \u00b6 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">\u00b617 Joseph\u2019s counsel filed four separate motions in limine regarding various evidentiary issues. Joseph also argued in a separate pretrial motion to dismiss that the court would abrogate Joseph\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to confront the witnesses against him if David failed to appear for trial and the court did not dismiss the assault with a weapon charge. The District Court denied the motion at a pretrial conference on the morning of the first day of trial. Shortly thereafter Joseph\u2019s counsel informed the court that he would be objecting to any of David\u2019s hearsay statements as the State attempted to offer them. \u00b618 Throughout the trial, however, Joseph repeatedly failed to object to David\u2019s hearsay statements. For instance, the State\u2019s first witness, Deputy Rhodes, testified when asked if David told him what caused his black eye that David stated \u201cthat the actual weapon striking his face is what caused that, that injury.\u201d It was not until Deputy Cashell, another officer present the night of the incident and the second witness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>to testify, attempted to relay a conversation with David that Joseph objected. The District Court sustained the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">\u00b619 Moreover, Joseph failed to object, on hearsay grounds, to the admission of the recorded 911 conversation between Tiffany, David, and the 911 operator. Joseph initially objected to the tape\u2019s admission on the grounds that the tape contained Tiffany\u2019s impermissible statements regarding Joseph\u2019s prior bad acts, and that the State had failed to provide him with <em>Just </em>notice that it would be seeking to use evidence of Joseph\u2019s prior bad acts. Judge Haynes opined that the tape was \u201calso riddled with hearsay\u2019 and asked Joseph \u201cwhat\u2019s the basis of your objection?\u201d Joseph reiterated that it was the <em>\u201cJust </em>notice. This is prior bad acts that would be in front of the jury at this point that officers have actually come out here before.\u201d Joseph then requested redaction of the tape so as not to invoke any violation of the <em>Just </em>notice requirement. The court agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">\u00b620 The court then played the redacted tape for the jury, without any objection to David\u2019s hearsay statements. In particular, David told the 911 operator that \u201cwhen [Joseph] started beatin\u2019 [Tracyn] I went up there and tried to break it up and I got hit with the gun and I took the guns away and locked em in my trunk ....\u201d Tiffany also made statements on the 911 tape that support Joseph\u2019s conviction for assault with a weapon. Tiffany told the 911 operator that \u201cmy dad just come down here and [Joseph] hit him in the eye with the butt of the gun, it\u2019s all purple ....\u201d The 911 operator then asked \u201c[h]e hit your dad in the eye with a gun?\u201d and Tiffany responded \u201c[y]ep, with the butt of it.\u201d Joseph did not object to the admission of these statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">\u00b621 Joseph maintains on appeal that he filed a motion in limine to keep David\u2019s hearsay statements out of evidence. None of Joseph\u2019s four motions in limine requested, however, the exclusion of David\u2019s statements. The only pretrial motion that Joseph made regarding David\u2019s statements was the motion to dismiss the assault with a weapon charge. Joseph based this motion on the grounds that if David failed to testify and the court did not dismiss the charge, the court would violate Joseph\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to confront the witnesses against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">\u00b622  A motion to dismiss, like a motion in limine, can be \u201csufficiently specific to preserve [an] issue for appeal.\u201d <em>Vukasin, </em>\u00b6 29. We need not address whether Joseph\u2019s pretrial motion to dismiss sufficiently preserved his <em>Crawford </em>issue for appeal, however, as the State presented the jury with sufficient evidence independent of David\u2019s statements to support Joseph\u2019s conviction for assault with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">\u00b623 First, the State presented the redacted 911 tape without objection from Joseph. Tiffany did not testify at trial, but the 911 tape included her statements. Tiffany was present at the scene of the incident and observed first hand her father\u2019s injury. She told the 911 operator that Joseph struck her father in the eye with a rifle, causing it to turn purple.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">\u00b624 Officer Rhodes\u2019s independent observations support Tiffany\u2019s statements. Officer Rhodes testified without obj ection that he observed a \u201cclear, reddening cut with exposed blood on the upper left portion of [David\u2019s] eyebrow area.\u201d The State also presented without objection from Joseph a photograph of David on the night of the incident depicting his injured eye.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">\u00b625  Joseph\u2019s motion to dismiss did not preserve for appeal the admissibility of Tiffany\u2019s statements, Officer Rhodes\u2019s observations, and the photograph of David\u2019s injury. Joseph argued in his pretrial motion with respect to the assault with a weapon charge that if David failed to testify at trial, Joseph would \u201cnot have the ability to cross-examine him, examine his motives, examine his testimony whatsoever.\u201d The motion to dismiss did not discuss any potential evidence supporting the assault with a weapon charge other than David\u2019s hearsay statements. And the motion to dismiss was not sufficiently specific to alert the trial court that Joseph would be objecting to Tiffany\u2019s statements to the 911 dispatcher, Officer Rhodes\u2019s observations of David\u2019s injury, and the photograph of David\u2019s injury. Thus, under Vukasin, \u00b6 29, Joseph\u2019s motion to dismiss did not preserve an objection to this evidence on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">\u00b626  The State presented the jury with other evidence that proved the same fact as David\u2019s hearsay statements-that Joseph struck David in the face with a rifle. In <em>Van Kirk </em>we adopted the \u201ccumulative evidence\u201d test for harmless error analysis. <em>State v. Van Kirk, </em>2001 MT 184, \u00b6 43, 306 Mont. 215, \u00b6 43, 32 P.3d 735, \u00b6 43. We held that in order for a trial error to be harmless under this test, \u201cthe State must demonstrate that the fact-finder was presented with admissible evidence that proved the same facts as the tainted evidence, and qualitatively, by comparison, the tainted evidence would not have contributed to the conviction.\u201d <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 47. We conclude that the admission of David\u2019s hearsay statements through the testimony of Officer Rhodes was harmless in light of the other evidence that the State presented on the assault with a weapon charge through the 911 tape, Officer Rhodes\u2019s observations, and the photograph of David\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>injury. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">\u00b627 The admission of the redacted 911 tape without objection from Joseph also renders much of Officer Rhodes\u2019s testimony cumulative and, thus, harmless error. We faced a similar situation concerning a defendant\u2019s failure to object to the admission of a 911 tape in our recent decision in <em>State v. Mizenko, </em>2006 MT 11, 330 Mont. 299, 127 P.3d 458. The State presented three witnesses who testified regarding hearsay statements of the victim, Debra Mizenko (Debra), who did not testify at trial. <em>Mizenko, </em>\u00b6 25. Debra\u2019s neighbor, Dawn Grove (Grove), testified that an out of breath Debra appeared at Dawn\u2019s house and asked her to call 911. <em>Mizenko, </em>\u00b6 3. Grove further testified that Debra told her that Mizenko had been drinking and was trying to hurt her. <em>Mizenko, </em>\u00b6 4. The 911 operator, Tami King (King), testified that Debra told her that Mizenko hit her, pushed her down, and pulled her hair out. <em>Mizenko, </em>\u00b6 5. Finally, Officer Scott Buennemeyer (Buennemeyer) testified that when he arrived at the scene he saw a lock of hair on the kitchen floor and another one on the living room floor. <em>Mizenko, </em>\u00b6 6. He farther testified that Debra told him that the hair was hers, and that Mizenko had pulled it from her head during the altercation. <em>Mizenko, </em>\u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">\u00b628 Mizenko objected to the hearsay statements from Grove, King, and Buennemeyer, arguing that the court\u2019s decision to admit them denied him his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation. <em>Mizenko, </em>\u00b6 7. He failed to object, however, to the admission of the 911 tape. <em>Mizenko, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 5, 26. The State played the tape for the jury, wherein Debra told King that Mizenko hit her, pushed her down, and pulled out her hair. <em>Mizenko, </em>\u00b6 26. We determined that, in light of Mizenko\u2019s failure to object to the admission of the 911 tape, \u201cKing\u2019s and Buennemeyer\u2019s testimony concerning the hair pulling, even if objectionable, was cumulative and, thus, harmless error.\u201d <em>Mizenko, </em>\u00b6 26, citing <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 43. We likewise concluded that King\u2019s statements that Mizenko had pushed Debra down and hit her constituted harmless error, at most. <em>Mizenko, </em>\u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">\u00b629 Here the 911 tape revealed damaging statements from both David and Tiffany regarding the assault with a weapon charge. Both stated on the tape that Joseph struck David with a gun. Joseph failed to object to the admission of the tape on hearsay grounds. Joseph initially objected to the tape on <em>Just </em>notice grounds and requested that the court redact the tape to cure any <em>Just </em>notice violations. Judge Haynes alerted Joseph that the tape was \u201criddled with hearsay,\u201d yet Joseph made no objection on those grounds, thereby allowing damaging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>statements into evidence regarding the assault with a weapon charge. We repeatedly have held that a party\u2019s assertion of error \u201cmust stand or fall on the ground\u201d raised in the trial court. <em>State v. Davis, </em>2000 MT 199, \u00b6 39, 300 Mont. 458, \u00b6 39, 5 P.3d 547, \u00b6 39. Thus, as in <em>Mizenko, </em>the testimony of Deputy Rhodes regarding statements made by David, even if objectionable, was cumulative and, thus, harmless error. <em>Mizenko, </em>\u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">\u00b630 2. Whether the District Court abused its discretion by denying Joseph\u2019s motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">\u00b631 Joseph argues that the District Court abused its discretion by denying his motion for a mistrial based on impermissible remarks made by the State in its opening statement. He argues that the statement, attributed to Joseph, \u201cI want the baby dead. I hope the baby dies,\u201d repeated during the State\u2019s opening statement prejudiced his right to a fair trial because no foundation had been laid for the statement. The State counters that Joseph waived his right to appeal because of his failure to make a contemporaneous objection to the State\u2019s opening comment. Alternatively, the State asserts that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Joseph\u2019s motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">\u00b632 Joseph filed a motion in limine to exclude any reference to Joseph\u2019s statement to Tracyn that he wanted the baby dead. The court responded that if the State could demonstrate that the statement was made in the immediate course of the charged struggle it would allow the statement. If the statement was made on a previous evening or pertained to an unrelated desire to terminate the pregnancy, however, the court agreed with Joseph that the statement should be excluded. \u00b633 The State began its opening statement with \u201cI want the baby dead. I hope the baby dies. These statements are going to be part of the State\u2019s case ....\u201d Joseph did not object and did not move for a mistrial until a conference in chambers the following morning. Joseph argued that the statement\u2019s admissibility was pending and the State effectively took the power away from the court to rule on the issue. The court denied Joseph\u2019s motion for mistrial. The court determined that the State had not violated a court ruling by using \u201cI want the baby dead. I hope they baby dies,\u201d in its opening statement. The court reasoned that if the State failed to show that Joseph made these comments, Joseph could point out the State\u2019s failure to present promised evidence during his closing statement. The court also admonished Joseph for failing to make a contemporaneous objection. \u00b634 Joseph argues on appeal that his failure to timely object to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>State\u2019s remarks is \u201cwell explained.\u201d He asserts that he had no time to object, given how quickly the State made the comment. He further asserts that his belief that the motion to exclude the statement was pending justifies his failure to contemporaneously object.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">\u00b635 A defendant must make a timely objection to properly preserve an issue for appeal. <em>State v. Gardner, </em>2003 MT 338, \u00b6 49, 318 Mont. 436, \u00b6 49, 80 P.3d 1262, \u00b6 49. The defendant in <em>Gardner </em>failed to object to allegedly impermissible evidence until two days after the State presented the evidence to the jury. <em>Gardner, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 52, 53. We held that the defendant did not make a timely objection and therefore declined to consider his issue on appeal. <em>Gardner, </em>\u00b6 59. In so holding, we distinguished <em>State v. Whitlow </em>(1997), 285 Mont. 430, 949 P.2d 239, wherein we chose to consider the merits of the defendant\u2019s claimed error even though he waited until his cross-examination to object to alleged impermissible testimony admitted during the State\u2019s case-in-chief. <em>Whitlow, </em>285 Mont. at 442, 949 P.2d at 247. We noted in <em>Gardner </em>that \u201cwhatever flexibility in the timing of an evidentiary obj ection may have been bestowed by Whitlow cannot be stretched into a delay of two days after the evidence has been presented to the jury.\u201d <em>Gardner, </em>\u00b6 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">\u00b636 <em>Gardner </em>applies to Joseph\u2019s case. The flexibility in the timing of an objection conferred in <em>Whitlow </em>does not extend to the following day. We agree with the District Court that Joseph should have made a timely objection to the State\u2019s comment. Moreover, we find unpersuasive Joseph\u2019s assertion that the State\u2019s comment was made too quickly for him to object. Joseph\u2019s failure to make a timely objection to the State\u2019s alleged impermissible comment waives the objection and precludes appellate review. <em>Gardner, </em>\u00b6 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">\u00b637 Moreover, even if Joseph had made a timely objection to the State\u2019s comment, the State later established the proper foundation for the statement. Deputy Cashell testified that Tracyn told him immediately after the incident that Joseph said he \u201cwanted the baby to die\u201d just before punching Tracyn in the stomach. Tracyn admitted that she told officers on the night of the incident that Joseph said he wanted the baby dead several times that day. Tracyn recanted her story at trial and, though she admitted to having told officers that Joseph said he wanted the baby dead, she denied that Joseph actually had made those remarks. The State used Tracyn\u2019s admission to introduce her statement to officers on the night of the incident. The District Court admitted the statement without objection. The court previously had redacted portions of Tracyn\u2019s statement to cure a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>potential <em>Just </em>notice violation. Tracyn repeatedly told officers that Joseph said he wanted the baby dead and hoped the baby died several times on the day of the incident in the redacted version of her statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">\u00b638  We previously have held that facts asserted by a party in an opening statement that they do not prove during trial may constitute grounds for a mistrial if there is a reasonable possibility that the unproved facts-on which evidence was either not offered or not admitted-contributed to the conviction. <em>See State v. Scheffelman </em>(1991), 250 Mont. 334, 339, 820 P.2d 1293, 1296. Joseph\u2019s statements, as recounted by the State in its opening statement, do not fall, however, within the ambit of <em>Scheffelman. </em>Here, the District Court admitted without objection evidence establishing those statements through Deputy Cashell\u2019s testimony and Tracyn\u2019s statement to police, with the proper <em>Just </em>notice redactions. Joseph conceded during a pretrial conference that Tracyn\u2019s redacted statement constituted \u201csubstantive evidence,\u201d and, more importantly, the State established through the testimony of Tracyn and Deputy Cashell that Joseph had uttered \u201cI want the baby dead. I hope the baby dies,\u201d during the immediate course of the charged struggle. Thus, since the State later proved the statements on which Joseph based his motion for mistrial, <em>Scheffelman </em>has no application here. The District Court therefore did not abuse its discretion in denying Joseph\u2019s motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">\u00b639 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b120-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES LEAPHART, WARNER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b120-7\">JUSTICE NELSON</author>\n<p id=\"AfX\">concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">\u00b640 I concur in the result of this case only because Joseph did not object to the admission of Tiffany\u2019s statements on the redacted 911 tape and because of the corroboration of David\u2019s injuries through Deputy Rhodes\u2019 testimony. That evidence, standing alone, was sufficient to sustain the jury\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">\u00b641 I do not agree with the superfluous discussion in the rest of the Court\u2019s opinion as to Issue 1. In my view, Joseph more than adequately preserved his Sixth Amendment <em>Crawford </em>claim by virtue of his pretrial Motion to Dismiss Count I and, having done so, had no obligation to make contemporaneous objections throughout the trial to the admission of David\u2019s hearsay statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-10\">\u00b642 Finally, and for the same reasons that I dissented in <em>State v. Mizenko, </em>2006 MT 11, 330 Mont. 299, 127 P.3d 458, I do not agree and will continue to disagree with the whole concept of \u201cvictimless\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>prosecutions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See <em>Mizenko, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 44-192 (Nelson, J., dissenting). Most of the problems that plagued <em>Mizenko </em>plague this case as well, including the State\u2019s failure to secure the attendance of the victim for trial, the denial of the defendant\u2019s right of confrontation through the use of hearsay, and the District Court\u2019s questionable rationale for admitting the victim\u2019s out-of-court statements: \u201c[0]n a homicide case, the victim is dead and the defendant doesn\u2019t get to confront the dead person.... So I don\u2019t view the confrontation right as running directly to having the right to have a victim present in court. It\u2019s just if they are present then the defendant has a right to see them face to face and ask them questions.\u201d</p>\n<judges id=\"b121-4\">JUSTICE COTTER joins in the concurrence of JUSTICE NELSON.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b121-5\"> The prosecution was \u201cvictimless\u201d with respect to Count I, in which Joseph was charged with assaulting David with a weapon. Because Tracyn appeared and testified at trial, prosecution of the charges related to her injuries was not \u201cvictimless.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
