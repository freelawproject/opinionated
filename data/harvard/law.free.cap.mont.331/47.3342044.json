The District Court appointed Scott Spencer-who, in 1993, prosecuted Hendricks on a different charge while serving as Lincoln County Attomey-to serve as Hendricks\u2019s counsel. Hendricks pled not guilty; a jury subsequently found him guilty of aggravated assault. On May 12, 2004, Hendricks filed a petition for postconviction relief. The District Court issued an order denying the petition. Hendricks appeals the court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">\u00b62 We restate the issues as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">\u00b63 1. Is there <em>per se </em>ineffective assistance of counsel when appointed defense counsel previously prosecuted the defendant on another matter?</p>\n<p id=\"b72-10\">\u00b64 2. Is there <em>per se </em>ineffective assistance of counsel when appointed defense counsel works simultaneously as a city attorney and a county public defender in the same jurisdiction?</p>\n<p id=\"b72-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b72-12\">\u00b65 In the early morning hours of October 26,2001, Hendricks became involved in an altercation with Don Scott. During this altercation, Hendricks stabbed Scott with a kitchen knife. The knife entered Scott\u2019s right side between his ribs and penetrated his liver and diaphragm, causing severe physical injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-13\">\u00b66 The State charged Hendricks with the felony offenses of attempted deliberated homicide and aggravated assault. Amy Guth, Administrator of the Lincoln County Public Defender contract, moved the court to appoint Scott Spencer to represent Hendricks. At the time she made the appointment, Guth knew that Spencer had previously charged Hendricks with sale of dangerous drugs during his tenure as Lincoln County Attorney. <em>See State ex rel. Fletcher v. District Court </em>(1993), 260 Mont. 410, 859 P.2d 992. In that case, Hendricks, along with twenty-three other petitioners, moved to dismiss various drug cases and one burglary case. <em>Fletcher, </em>260 Mont. at 412-13, 859 P.2d at 993. After the District Court denied their motion, the petitioners applied for a writ of supervisory control alleging outrageous government conduct. <em>Fletcher, </em>260 Mont. at 412-13, 859 P.2d at 993. This Court ultimately dismissed the case and remanded it to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>District Court without prejudice. <em>Fletcher, </em>260 Mont. at 419, 859 P.2d at 997.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">\u00b67 During Spencer\u2019s first meeting with Hendricks regarding the present case, Hendricks brought up the fact that Spencer had previously prosecuted him in the <em>Fletcher </em>case. According to Spencer, Hendricks \u201cexpressed concerns that because [Spencer] had prosecuted him that it would somehow carry over into [Spencer\u2019s] defense of him in this case.\u201d Spencer maintains, however, that by the time he finished explaining to Hendricks that the <em>Fletcher </em>case would have \u201cno bearing\u201d on his representation, Hendricks \u201cdidn\u2019t seem to have a problem\u201d with his proceeding as counsel. Hendricks, on the other hand, claims that from the beginning, he \u201cwas unwilling to have [Spencer] as an attorney\u201d and requested that Spencer remove himself as defense counsel. During the evidentiary hearing, Hendricks testified that he objected to Spencer representing him for \u201ca number of reasons,\u201d including that Spencer \u201chad sent [him] to prison and then filed charges when [he] was ready to get out of prison ... [he had] just been prejudiced by the man ... [and that they didn\u2019t] have a good relationship just, you know, as people.\u201d Hendricks further testified that he called Guth\u2019s office to complain, but she informed him that it was Spencer\u2019s duty to inform the court of the conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">\u00b68 Pursuant to Spencer\u2019s representation, Hendricks pled not guilty. After a three-day trial, a jury found Hendricks guilty of aggravated assault, but not guilty of attempted deliberate homicide. Oh the same day the court sentenced Hendricks to twenty years in prison, Spencer moved to withdraw as Hendricks\u2019s attorney because \u201cthe working relationship between counsel and client has deteriorated to the point that no viable working relationship exists between attorney and client.\u201d The court appointed the Montana Appellate Defender Office to represent Hendricks for any appeal or postconviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">\u00b69 Hendricks appealed his conviction, arguing that Spencer rendered ineffective assistance of counsel when he failed to raise a self-defense theory. This Court issued an opinion affirming Hendricks\u2019s conviction and dismissing his appeal without prejudice, concluding that because Hendricks\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim could not be addressed without considering matters outside of the record, he could only raise this claim in a postconviction relief proceeding. <em>State v. Hendricks, </em>2003 MT 223, \u00b6 1, 317 Mont. 177, \u00b6 1, 75 P.3d 1268, \u00b6 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">\u00b610 This Court reviews a district court\u2019s denial of postconviction relief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>to determine whether the court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether its conclusions of law are correct. Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are mixed questions of law and fact, which we review <em>de novo. Thurston v. State, </em>2004 MT 142, \u00b6 8, 321 Mont. 411, \u00b6 8, 91 P.3d 1259, \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">\u00b611 1. Is there <em>per se </em>ineffective assistance of counsel when appointed defense counsel previously prosecuted the defendant on another matter?</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">\u00b612 Hendricks asks this Court to adopt a rule that there is <em>per se </em>reversible conflict of interest when appointed defense counsel previously prosecuted the defendant on another matter. A review of our precedent, however, does not support this approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">\u00b613 In <em>State v. Deschon, </em>2002 MT 16, \u00b6 18, 308 Mont. 175, \u00b6 18, 40 P.3d 391, \u00b6 18, we addressed the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel due to attorney conflict of interest-although on different factual grounds. In that case, Deschon argued that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because his attorney had a conflict of interest in representing him at the same time he represented one of Deschon\u2019s key defense witnesses. <em>Deschon, </em>\u00b6 15. In reaching the conclusion that Deschon did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel, we determined that \u201c[a] defendant claiming ineffective assistance of counsel due to a conflict of interest must show: (1) that counsel actively represented conflicting interests; and (2) that an actual conflict of interest adversely affected counsel\u2019s performance.\u201d <em>Deschon, </em>\u00b6 18. We emphasized that \u201c[a]n actual conflict, as opposed to the mere possibility of a conflict, is necessary\u201d and that \u201c[s]uch conflict must be proved through a factual showing on the record.\u201d <em>Deschon, </em>\u00b6 18. After reviewing the record, we concluded that an actual conflict did not exist. <em>Deschon, </em>\u00b6 19. We further noted that even if an actual conflict did exist, defense counsel\u2019s performance was not adversely affected and, therefore, Deschon was not denied effective assistance of counsel. <em>Deschon, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">\u00b614 In <em>Thurston, </em>we applied the same standard as set forth in <em>Deschon. Thurston, </em>\u00b6 17. Thurston argued that his defense counsel had a conflict of interest because, during his previous tenure as Deputy Cascade County Attorney, he exchanged information about the investigation of Thurston\u2019s case. <em>Thurston, </em>\u00b6 16. Although we have not adopted the American Bar Association\u2019s Standards for Criminal Justice, 4-3.5, <em>Thurston </em>cited to it, along with \u00a7 37-61-413, MCA, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>arguing that defense counsel should not have represented him after supposedly gaining knowledge of his case through counsel\u2019s former employment as a Deputy Cascade County Attorney. <em>Thurston, </em>\u00b6 19.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We determined that even though Standard 4-3.5, and \u00a7 37-61-413, MCA, supported Thurston\u2019s argument, there was no basis for reversal unless Thurston established that an \u201cactual conflict\u201d existed. <em>Thurston, </em>\u00b6 20. Because we concluded that no evidence supported the notion that defense counsel\u2019s representation of Thurston was influenced by the suggested conflict, we affirmed the District Court\u2019s denial of Thurston\u2019s conflict of interest claim. <em>Thurston, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">\u00b615 In this case, Hendricks argues that Spencer had a conflict of interest because he prosecuted Hendricks several years earlier while serving as Lincoln County Attorney. More specifically, Hendricks contends that because he, along with the other <em>Fletcher </em>petitioners, filed a motion and brief alleging outrageous government conduct, Spencer likely remembered Hendricks and \u201charbored resentment\u201d against him. Hendricks\u2019s speculation regarding Spencer\u2019s state-of-mind does not amount to a factual showing on the record that an \u201cactual conflict\u201d existed between counsel and the defendant. As we noted, \u201cthe mere possibility of a conflict\u201d will not suffice; the \u201cconflict must be proved through a factual showing on the record.\u201d <em>Deschon, </em>\u00b6 18. Despite Hendricks\u2019s speculative allegations that Spencer \u201charbored resentment\u201d against him, or that his representation was influenced by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>his having previously prosecuted Hendricks, there is nothing in the record supporting the assertion that an actual conflict existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">\u00b616 Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that an actual conflict of interest did exist, Hendricks fails to establish that the conflict adversely affected Spencer\u2019s performance resulting in ineffective assistance. In determining whether a defendant received ineffective assistance of counsel, we apply the <em>Strickland </em>test-that is, a defendant must first show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, and second, that he was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s deficient performance. <em>State v. Henderson, </em>2004 MT 173, \u00b6 5, \u00b6 9, 322 Mont. 69, \u00b6 5, \u00b6 9, 93 P.3d 1231, \u00b6 5, \u00b6 9. <em>See Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. Hendricks argued to the District Court that Spencer provided ineffective assistance of counsel by: (1) failing to pursue the defense of justifiable use of force (self-defense); (2) not honoring Hendricks\u2019s request to be present during Spencer\u2019s witness interviews; and (3) failing to perform a courtroom demonstration the way that Hendricks wanted the demonstration conducted. Applying the second prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test, the District Court concluded that no prejudice resulted from Spencer\u2019s performance as counsel because, in not pursuing a self-defense theory, \u201cSpencer made a strategic decision based upon sound logic,\u201d there was \u201cno reason to believe that Hendricks\u2019s presence during the interviews of any of the other witnesses would have helped his defense in any way,\u201d and there was \u201cno likelihood that Hendricks would have been acquitted if the [courtroom] demonstration had been performed to his liking.\u201d Moreover, the court found that \u201c[b]ased upon Hendricks\u2019s demeanor and his response to questions, it seemed obvious ... that Hendricks was prepared to say whatever he had to say to obtain a new trial.\u201d The court ultimately concluded that Spencer\u2019s testimony was more credible than Hendricks\u2019s. On appeal, we will not disturb a district court\u2019s determination of witness credibility; this determination rests exclusively within the province of the finder of fact. <em>State v. Boucher, </em>1999 MT 102, \u00b6 19, 294 Mont. 296, \u00b6 19, 980 P.2d 1058, \u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">\u00b617  We hold that Hendricks has not shown that an actual conflict of interest existed. Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that there was an actual conflict of interest, he has not satisfied the second prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test; that is, he has not shown that Spencer\u2019s representation was adversely affected or that Hendricks was prejudiced by the alleged conflict. Thus, Hendricks\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">\u00b618 2. Is there <em>per se </em>ineffective assistance of counsel when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>appointed defense counsel works simultaneously as a city attorney and a county public defender in the same jurisdiction?</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">\u00b619  Hendricks also argues that Spencer had a conflict of interest because, while representing Hendricks in Lincoln County, Spencer simultaneously served as City Attorney in Libby-an overlapping jurisdiction. Arguing that \u201cit is impossible to speculate how the subtle and subconscious affect of the dual representation impacted Spencer,\u201d Hendricks contends that this Court should conclude there was structural error in Spencer\u2019s serving as city attorney and as his defense counsel. Accordingly, Hendricks asks this Court to adopt a <em>per se </em>rule that a city attorney is disqualified from representing an indigent criminal defendant in a county of overlapping jurisdiction. We decline to adopt such a rule. Instead, we apply the same standard set forth in Issue 1-that is, \u201c[a] defendant claiming ineffective assistance of counsel due to a conflict of interest must show: (1) that counsel actively represented conflicting interests; and (2) that an actual conflict of interest adversely affected counsel's performance.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00b6 13. Similar to Issue 1, we hold that there is nothing in the record supporting a conclusion that Spencer\u2019s work as a city attorney in the same jurisdiction in which he defended Hendricks resulted in an actual conflict that adversely affected his representation of Hendricks.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">\u00b620 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b77-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b75-5\"> The American Bar Association\u2019s Standards for Criminal Justice Standard 4-3.5 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-6\">(f) Defense counsel should not defend a criminal case in which counsel\u2019s partner or professional associate is or has been the prosecutor in the same case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-7\">(g) Defense counsel should not represent a criminal defendant in a jurisdiction in which he or she is also a prosecutor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-8\">(h) Defense counsel who formerly participated personally and substantially in the prosecution of a defendant should not thereafter represent any person in the same or a substantially related matter.

Section 37-61-413, MCA, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-10\">Former public prosecutors not to defend. An attorney and counselor who has brought, carried on, aided, advocated, or prosecuted or has been in anywise connected with an action or special proceeding, civil or criminal, as attorney general, county attorney, or other public prosecutor, must not, at any time thereafter, directly or indirectly advise concerning, aid, or take any part in the defense thereof; or take or receive, either directly or indirectly, from a defendant therein or other person a fee, gratuity, or reward for or upon any cause, consideration, pretense, understanding or agreement, either express or implied, having relation thereto or to the prosecution or defense thereof.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b77-7\">JUSTICE NELSON</author>\n<p id=\"ASe\">dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">\u00b621 I would reverse and remand for appointment of new counsel and a new trial on Issue 2.1 would, therefore, not reach Issue 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-9\">\u00b622 The Court\u2019s Opinion fails to apply the proper analysis in Issue 2. There is an inherent or <em>per se </em>conflict of interest when an attorney defends a criminally accused person in one jurisdiction while, simultaneously, acting as prosecutor in an overlapping jurisdiction. The error implicit in such an arrangement constitutes structural error and is, therefore, presumptively prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-10\">\u00b623 During the time that Spencer was representing Hendricks as a county public defender, he was also working as the Libby City Attorney. Libby is the county seat of Lincoln County, thus, both the Libby Police Department and the Lincoln County Sheriffs Office are located in that city. Spencer admitted that the Libby Police Department officers and Lincoln County Sheriffs deputies assist each other on cases. Spencer also admitted that, in his position as a city prosecutor, he would sometimes call sheriff\u2019s deputies as witnesses in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>his city prosecutions. Spencer never discussed this conflict of interest with Hendricks, nor did he obtain a waiver of the conflict from his client.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">\u00b624 While this Court has not previously addressed this issue, the American Bar Association, the Montana State Bar Ethics Committee, and sister jurisdictions have.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">\u00b625 The American Bar Association\u2019s Standards for Criminal Justice provide that \u201c[djefense counsel should not represent a criminal defendant in a jurisdiction in which he or she is also a prosecutor.\u201d <em>ABA Standards for Criminal Justice Prosecution Function and Defense Function </em>4-3.5(g) (3d ed. 1993) (hereinafter <em>ABA Standards). </em>The Commentary to this Standard, in pertinent part, explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-6\">There are, indeed, advantages to the operation of an adversary system in which lawyers can avoid being stereotyped in their roles. <em>In our system of institutionalized prosecution offices, it is difficult, if not impossible, however, for prosecutors to simultaneously appear in a defense role. </em>But it is feasible to have experienced defense counsel appointed as special prosecutors from time to time. The long-range benefits of such interchange, however, are such that lawyers who have been trained in prosecution offices should be encouraged to devote some period of their professional careers in defense work, whether privately or as public defenders, <em>after they have left prosecution offices. </em>Correspondingly, public defender staff members should be encouraged to move into prosecution offices. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AW\">\u00b626 Ethics Opinion 010417 of the State Bar of Montana\u2019s Ethics Committee follows this Standard. The question addressed was: \u201cMay the county public defender continue to defend within the county while also criminally prosecuting on behalf of the city?\u201d The Ethics Committee held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-7\">[a]n attorney may not simultaneously occupy the positions of a city attorney with prosecutorial functions and county public defender when the jurisdictions overlap. The proposed representation creates a conflict of interest of the type identified by Rule 1.7 of the Montana Rules of Professional Conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">\u00b627 Rule 1.7 of the Montana Rules of Professional Conduct prohibits conflicts of interest. Specifically, this Rule mandates that a lawyer shall not represent a client if the representation of that client will be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>directly adverse to another client.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Ethics Committee stated that \u201c[a] criminal defendant\u2019s interests are, almost by definition, adverse to the interests of the political subdivision\u2019s (i.e., cities, towns and counties) law enforcement authority.\u201d The Ethics Committee went on to quote from Ethics Opinion 881130, noting that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-4\">for the city attorney charged with public duties including the prosecution of crimes to accept employment in defense of one charged with crimes, would appear to place him in [a] position adverse to his public employer likely to destroy public confidence in him as a public officer and thus bring reproach to his profession, as well as to himself. This apparent conflict of interest should be avoided.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">\u00b628 Clearly, our State Bar Ethics Committee was correct in its determination that a public prosecutor for a city cannot simultaneously serve as a county public defender in overlapping jurisdictions. \u201cThe basic duty defense counsel owes to the administration of justice and as an officer of the court is to serve as the accused\u2019s counselor and advocate with coinage and devotion and to render effective, quality representation.\u201d <em>ABA Standards </em>4-1.2(b). That we now approve of this obvious breach of Rule 1.7 of the Montana Rules of Professional Conduct denigrates the professional responsibility of criminal defense attorneys and diminishes their duty of loyalty to the accused. The Court\u2019s decision here does nothing to further higher ethical standards for criminal defense lawyers. Indeed, it accomplishes quite the opposite result.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">\u00b629 Other jurisdictions that have considered this issue agree. The law is well summarized and collected in <em>State v. Brown </em>(Utah 1992), 853 P.2d 851. In that case, our sister jurisdiction, Utah, reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction holding that as a matter of public policy and pursuant to the court\u2019s inherent supervisory authority over other courts, as well as its express power to govern the practice of law, counsel with concurrent prosecutorial obligations may not be appointed to defend indigent persons. <em>Brown, </em>853 P.2d at 857.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">\u00b630 The <em>Brown </em>court\u2019s rationale is instructive. The court first concluded that the vital interests of criminal justice are jeopardized when a city prosecutor is appointed to assist in the defense of a person accused of a crime. Next, noting that a criminal defendant is entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>to undivided loyalty from his attorney,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the court astutely observed that this duty is compromised when an attorney with prosecutorial responsibilities represents an indigent defendan1&gt;-a practice also known as dual representation. Specifically, the court noted that the divided loyalty inherent in this practice is evident in various facets of representation and public perception. Distilled from the <em>Brown </em>court\u2019s discussion, these evils include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-4\">\u2022 There will inevitably arise a struggle between, on the one hand, counsel\u2019s obligation to represent his client to the best of his ability and, on the other hand, a public prosecutor\u2019s natural inclination not to anger the very individuals whose assistance he relies upon in carrying out his prosecutorial responsibilities. The temptation might well arise not to be too hard on a police witness who is against your client today, but would be the star witness for your prosecution tomorrow.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-5\">\u2022 A municipality is an ancillary unit of state government and both city and state prosecutors deal interchangeably with law enforcement personnel from each jurisdiction. Whether state or municipal, prosecutors share the same loyalties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-6\">\u2022 Counsel may hesitate to attack the constitutionality of laws he or she has sworn to uphold as a prosecutor. He may be loath to take a position as defense counsel which he would find embarrassing as a prosecutor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-7\">\u2022 While counsel may intend to diligently represent his client\u2019s interests, it is impossible to determine what sort of unconscious influences may affect such advocacy. When matters of judgment and trial tactics are made in the name of the accused, a defense counsel with conflicted loyalties may be unable to establish the propriety of his actions. Such conflicts, whether consciously perceived or not, jeopardize the integrity of the criminal adjudication process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-8\">\u2022 The defendant\u2019s interests may be further compromised because of his natural hesitancy in confiding fully in a prosecutor. For example, the defendant may have information regarding other crimes that he or she would not want the prosecutor to know. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>defendant may not feel that he or she is fully protected from potential abuse of confidences placed in defense counsel who also wears a prosecutor\u2019s hat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-4\">\u2022 Dual representation erodes public confidence in the criminal justice system which depends on diligently maintaining the appearance of fairness and impartiality in the adjudication process, in that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-5\">\u2022 An unavoidable appearance of impropriety is created when a prosecutor assists in the defense of an accused, as the public may perceive that the prosecutor, desiring to further his or her own professional career, may use connections and influence to obtain a favorable result for the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-6\">\u2022 The public may also infer that the prosecutor will not jeopardize his or her \u201claw and order\u201d reputation by using vigorous defense tactics.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-7\">\u2022 The public may conclude that a prosecutor\u2019s vigorous defense of an accused will result in decreased support from law enforcement in future cases. A prosecutor who alienates the law enforcement agencies upon which he or she depends, compromises his or her prosecutorial responsibilities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-8\">\u2022 Regardless of counsel\u2019s diligence, the inherent conflicts of the situation expose counsel to charges that the representation was not entirely faithful.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-9\"><em>Brown, </em>853 P.2d at 857-59 (internal citations omitted). <em>Accord State v. White </em>(Tenn. 2003), 114 S.W.3d 469 (holding that counsel\u2019s dual roles as prosecutor and defense counsel in the same county were inherently antagonistic and, thus, created an actual conflict of interest that required disqualification); <em>State v. Ross </em>(Mo. 1992), 829 S.W.2d 948 (holding that the appearance of impropriety arising from fact that two members of the law firm which represented defendant in a civil case brought by assault victim were working part time as county prosecutors, necessitated disqualification of the entire prosecuting attorney's office, even without a showing of actual prejudice).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-10\">\u00b631 Finally, the <em>Brown </em>court, in contradiction to our decision here, held that because it would be very difficult to assess prejudice in cases involving dual representation, it would be unnecessary and ill-advised to pursue a case-by-case inquiry to weigh actual prejudice. Rather, there should be a <em>per se </em>rule of reversal whenever such dual representation is undertaken so as to prevent its recurrence. <em>Brown, </em>853 P.2d at 859.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-11\">\u00b632 Similarly, in the case <em>sub judice, </em>and for the reasons referred to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>above, Spencer, who was involved in text-book dual representation, could not provide effective assistance of counsel to Hendricks. <em>Aper se </em>rule of reversal is required because this type of error is structural. Prejudice must, therefore, be presumed because of Spencer\u2019s inherent conflict of interest and divided loyalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">\u00b633 Structural error is a defect in the framework within which a trial proceeds and, as such, undermines the fairness of the entire trial proceeding. Structural error is presumptively prejudicial. <em>State v. LaMere, </em>2005 MT 118, \u00b6 25, 327 Mont. 115, \u00b6 25, 112 P.3d 1005, \u00b6 25 (citing <em>State v. Van Kirk, </em>2001 MT 184, \u00b6 38, 306 Mont. 215, \u00b6 38, 32 P.3d 735, \u00b6 38).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">\u00b634 As the United State Supreme Court stated in <em>Holloway v. Arkansas </em>(1978), 435 U.S. 475, 489, 98 S.Ct. 1173, 1181, 55 L.Ed.2d 426, the Sixth Amendment guarantee of the assistance of counsel is among those \u201cconstitutional rights so basic to a fair trial that their infraction can never be treated as harmless error.\u201d In <em>Holloway, </em>the Supreme Court, after finding that a conflict of interest existed between counsel and the defendant, held that reversal was required. \u201cThe right to have the assistance of counsel is too fundamental and absolute to allow courts to indulge in nice calculations as to the amount of prejudice arising from its denial.\u201d <em>Holloway, </em>435 U.S. at 488, 98 S.Ct. at 1181. If a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel is infringed, prejudice is presumed regardless of whether it was independently shown. Reversal is automatic. <em>Holloway, </em>435 U.S. at 489, 98 S.Ct. at 1181 (citing <em>Gideon v. Wainwright </em>(1963), 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799; <em>Hamilton v. Alabama </em>(1961), 368 U.S. 52, 82 S.Ct. 157, 7 L.Ed.2d 114; <em>White v. Maryland </em>(1963), 373 U.S. 59, 83 S.Ct. 1050, 10 L.Ed.2d 193).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">\u00b635 We have held that an accused\u2019s right to counsel under Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution is broader than that under the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution. <em>State v. Garcia, </em>2003 MT 211, \u00b6 37, 317 Mont. 73, \u00b6 37, 75 P.3d 313, \u00b6 37 (citing <em>State v. Spang, </em>2002 MT 120, \u00b6 22, 310 Mont. 52, \u00b6 22, 48 P.3d 727, \u00b6 22). <em>Accord State v. Johnson </em>(1986), 221 Mont. 503, 514-15,719 P.2d 1248, 1255; <em>Ranta v. State, </em>1998 MT 95, 288 Mont. 391, 958 P.2d 670. Accordingly, under Montana\u2019s Constitution, Hendricks was even more clearly entitled to counsel free from the conflicts of interest and divided loyalties inherent where his defense counsel was also a prosecutor. Prejudice must be presumed. A <em>per se </em>rule of reversal is required because of the structural error implicit in dual representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">\u00b636 This Court is constitutionally tasked with supervising not only the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>trial courts, but also the practice of law in this State. Art. VII, \u00a7 2, Mont. Const. Unfortunately, in declining to condemn the evils of dual representation and the violation of Rule 1.7 of the Montana Rules of Professional Conduct inherent in that practice, and in refusing to adopt a standard prohibiting this practice-a standard so fundamental that it is recognized by the American Bar Association, by the Ethics Committee of the State Bar of Montana, by the United States Supreme Court, and by numerous courts in sister jurisdictions-we have abrogated our supervisory responsibilities over both the trial courts and the Bar and, worse, our obligation to ensure that indigent criminal defendants receive effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">\u00b637 I strenuously urge our new Public Defender Commission and our new Chief Public Defender to rectify our default by adopting a statewide standard prohibiting criminal defense attorneys from simultaneously acting as prosecutors.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">\u00b638 I would reverse Hendricks\u2019 conviction; I would order that the tried court appoint conflict-free counsel to represent him; and I would remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">\u00b639 I dissent from our failure to do so.</p>\n<judges id=\"b83-7\">JUSTICE WARNER joins in the dissent of JUSTICE NELSON.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b79-8\"> The version of Rule 1.7 interpreted by the Ethics Committee is somewhat different than the present version of the Rule. Notwithstanding, both versions prohibit lawyers from representing clients with directly adverse interests.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b80-9\"> <em>Brown, </em>853 P.2d at 857 (citing <em>Glasser v.
