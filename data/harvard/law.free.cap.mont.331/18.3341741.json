Fregien pled not guilty and moved to suppress the blood test results obtained by the State via an investigative subpoena. The District Court denied the motion. Fregien subsequently entered a plea agreement, reserving the right to appeal the court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress. He now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">\u00b62 We state the issue as follows: Did the District Court err in denying Fregien\u2019s motion to suppress the results of the diagnostic blood test?</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">\u00b63 We note at the outset that Fregien, in violation of Rules 23 and 9 of the Montana Rules of Appellate Procedure, includes witness statements in his appellate brief that are neither cited to nor included in the record. Appellate briefs are required to include \u201cfacts relevant to the issues presented for review, with references to the pages of the parts of the record at which material facts appear.\u201d Rule 23(3), M.R.App.P. \u201cIt is the duty of a party seeking review of a judgment, order or proceeding to present the supreme court with a record sufficient to enable it to rule upon the issues raised.\u201d Rule 9(a), M.R.App.P. Because \u201c[t]he record ... is the only evidence of which this Court can rely in making a determination on the issue at bar,\u201d <em>Huffine v. Boylan </em>(1989), 239 Mont. 515, 517, 782 P.2d 77, 78, we ignore Fregien\u2019s non-record based assertions and base our decision on the following facts of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">\u00b64 On the afternoon of November 30,2003, Officer Joshua T. Brown of the Montana Highway Patrol responded to a motorcycle crash on Frontage Road in Gallatin County, Montana. Officer Brown reported to the crash site and observed a damaged motorcycle belonging to Fregien, whom emergency personnel were treating. Belgrade firefighter, Tony Young, indicated that he smelled the odor of an alcoholic beverage on Fregien\u2019s breath. Fregien was transported to the Bozeman Deaconess Hospital where medical staff treated his injuries. \u00b65 While at the hospital, Officer Brown spoke with Fregien about the crash. Fregien indicated that the crash occurred because he swerved to avoid hitting a deer. Officer Brown noticed the odor of an alcoholic beverage on Fregien\u2019s breath and Fregien stated that he had consumed a couple of beers approximately thirty to forty-five minutes before the crash. Officer Brown read the implied consent advisory to Fregien and asked him to submit to a breath and blood test. Fregien refused both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">\u00b66 The State subsequently applied for and received an investigative subpoena from the District Court to obtain the results of Fregien\u2019s blood test conducted by the hospital after the crash. The medical reports indicated that Fregien\u2019s blood alcohol concentration was 0.240. In addition, Daniel Gannon, M.D., noted that Fregien smelled of alcohol and was, indeed, under the influence of alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">\u00b67 Based on the above facts, as well as Fregien\u2019s three prior convictions of driving under the influence of alcohol and his lack of a valid driver\u2019s license for operating a motorcycle, the State charged Fregien by information with one felony count of driving under the influence of alcohol and one misdemeanor count of driving without a valid driver\u2019s license. After pleading not guilty, Fregien filed a motion to suppress the blood test results obtained by the State via the investigative subpoena. The District Court denied Fregien\u2019s motion to suppress, concluding that objective and reliable facts supported the conclusion that probable cause existed to issue the investigative subpoena. The Court committed Fregien to the Department of Corrections for thirteen months, plus an additional three years to be served consecutively with the thirteen months upon conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">\u00b68 \u201cWe review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress to ascertain whether the court\u2019s factual findings are clearly erroneous and whether the findings were correctly applied as a matter of law.\u201d <em>State v. Nelson </em>(1997), 283 Mont. 231, 236, 941 P.2d 441, 445.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b44-9\">\n<em>Did the District Court err in denying Fregien\u2019s motion to suppress the results of the diagnostic blood test ?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b44-10\">\u00b69 Fregien contends that the District Court erred in granting the State an investigative subpoena to retrieve Fregien\u2019s blood test results from Bozeman Deaconess Hospital. In support of this argument, Fregien cites <em>Nelson </em>in which this Court set out the following rule regarding the use of investigative subpoenas to retrieve medical records:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-11\">When an investigative subpoena seeks discovery of protected medical records or information, the subpoena can be likened to a search warrant which must satisfy the strictures of the Fourth Amendment and Article II, Section 11 of the Montana Constitution. A search warrant can only issue upon a showing of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>\u201cprobable cause.\u201d In the context of search and seizure law, probable cause exists when facts and circumstances presented to a magistrate would warrant an honest belief in the mind of a reasonable and prudent person that an offense has been, or is being, committed and that property (or information) sought exists at the place designated. We hold that in order to establish that there is a compelling state interest for the issuance of an investigative subpoena for the discovery of medical records, the State must show probable cause to believe that an offense has been committed and medical information relative to the commission of that offense is in the possession of the person or institution to whom the subpoena is directed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-4\"><em>Nelson, </em>283 Mont. at 243-44, 941 P.2d at 449 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">\u00b610  Fregien argues that the evidence in this case does not rise to the level of probable cause. Fregien\u2019s argument turns on the fact that he told Officer Brown that the accident occurred because he swerved his motorcycle in order to avoid hitting a deer. In light of the record, this argument is unpersuasive. The affidavit in support of the investigative subpoena stated the following: Firefighter Young \u201cindicated that he smelled the odor of an alcoholic beverage on Fregien\u2019s breath\u201d; Officer Brown also \u201cnoticed the odor of an alcoholic beverage on Fregien\u2019s breath\u201d; and Fregien admitted \u201cthat he had consumed a couple of beers approximately thirty to forty-five minutes before the crash.\u201d These facts \u201cwould warrant an honest belief in the mind of a reasonable and prudent person,\u201d <em>Nelson, </em>283 Mont. at 243-44,941 P.2d at 449, that Fregien had committed the offense of driving while under the influence of alcohol-thereby establishing probable cause for the investigative subpoena for Fregien\u2019s blood test results. We conclude that the District Court properly denied Fregien\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">\u00b611 Additionally, we note Fregien\u2019s assertion-\u201c[t]o allow the discovery of blood alcohol levels taken by an independent physician after consent has been denied by [a] defendant renders the implied consent statute meaningless\u201d-only to point out that this Court has already addressed and dismissed this argument in <em>State ex rel. McGrath v. State Twenty-First Judicial Dist. Court, </em>2001 MT 305, 307 Mont. 491, 38 P.3d 820. Section 61-8-402(4), MCA, states that an arrested person may refuse a breath or blood test, subject to seizure of his or her driver\u2019s license. On the basis of this statute, Fregien contends that the State should not have been allowed to circumvent Fregien\u2019s refusal to consent by subpoenaing his diagnostic blood tests. In <em>McGrath, </em>we pointed out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>that subsection (10) of \u00a7 61-8-402, MCA, \u201cexpressly states that \u2018[t]his section does not apply to blood... tests, samples, and analyses used for purposes of medical treatment or care of an injured motorist ....\u201d <em>McGrath, </em>\u00b6 12 (citing \u00a7 61-8-402(10), MCA). We concluded that \u201cthe criteria for admissibility under \u00a7 61-8-402, MCA (1999), relating to blood tests administered under the implied consent statute are inapplicable to diagnostic blood tests taken by a hospital or treating physician.\u201d <em>McGrath, </em>\u00b6 16.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AZ\">\u00b612 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b46-4\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, WARNER and</judges>\n<judges id=\"b46-5\">COTTER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b46-9\"> Although the Legislature has amended \u00a7 61-8-402, MCA, since <em>McGrath, </em>these amendments do not affect the issue in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b46-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY,</author>\n<p id=\"AV\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">\u00b613 I concur in the Court\u2019s opinion, but write separately on the subject of counsel including matters not of record in Fregien\u2019s opening brief on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">\u00b614 As the Court points out, the Rules are perfectly clear with regard to citing only to matters of record. Counsel are expected to read and follow those rules. Failure to do so results in opposing counsel having to waste valuable time in ensuring that such matters are brought to our attention. Such practices also waste this Court\u2019s time-to the detriment of litigants in the hundreds of other cases pending here. I would admonish Fregien\u2019s counsel in this cause and caution counsel in other cases that they are \u201cofficers of the court\u201d in addition to being advocates for their clients.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
