We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">\u00b62 We address the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err by granting primary residential custody of Victoria to her father, Scott?</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">\u00b64 Victoria was bom to Scott and Kim on February 5, 1999. Three months later, in May 1999, Scott and Kim separated, and their marriage was dissolved on April 4, 2000. After the separation, Scott remained in Wolf Point, Montana, where the couple had resided together, but Kim moved to Kalispell, Montana, over 500 miles away. \u00b65 Pursuant to a Final Parenting Plan approved by the District Court on April 4, 2000, and modified on January 30, 2001, Victoria spent alternating months with each of her parents, requiring her to travel between Kalispell and Wolf Point at least once a month. The plan also provided that Scott would become the primary residential custodian when Victoria reached school age. However, this Court vacated this latter portion of the plan in <em>In re Marriage of Toavs, </em>holding that \u201cthe facts and issues necessary to support such relief have not been tried and proven at trial and the District Court was without authority to grant such relief.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Toavs, </em>2002 MT 230, \u00b6 27, 311 Mont. 455, \u00b6 27, 56 P.3d 356, \u00b6 27 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">\u00b66 On November 10, 2003, as Victoria approached school age, Kim filed a petition to determine primary residential custody of Victoria and to determine child support. The District Court held a bench trial March 16 through 19, 2004. On May 26, 2004, the District Court entered its findings of fact, conclusions of law, and decree, including a parenting plan, directing that Victoria would primarily reside with Scott and attend school in Wolf Point. According to the new plan, Victoria will spend summers and most holidays with Kim in Kalispell. Kim appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b462-10\">\u00b67 In <em>In re Marriage of Epperson, </em>2005 MT 46, \u00b6 17, 326 Mont. 142, \u00b6 17, 107 P.3d 1268, \u00b6 17, we articulated the applicable standard of review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-11\">Our standard of review for a district court\u2019s award of child custody is whether the district court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous. When the findings are supported by substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>credible evidence, we will affirm the district court\u2019s decision unless a clear abuse of discretion is shown. <em>In re Marriage of Baer, </em>1998 MT 29, \u00b6 18, 287 Mont. 322, \u00b6 18, 954 P.2d 1125, \u00b6 18. The test for abuse of discretion is whether the trial court acted arbitrarily without employment of conscientious judgment or exceeded the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice. <em>State v. Baker, </em>2004 MT 393, \u00b6 13, 325 Mont. 229, \u00b6 13, 104 P.3d 491, \u00b6 13 (citation omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">\u00b68 Did the District Court err by granting primary residential custody of Victoria to her father, Scott?</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">\u00b69 Rim argues that the District Court abused its discretion by awarding primary residential custody to Scott. Offering extensive citations to the record, Rim contends that it is in Victoria\u2019s best interest, as that term is defined by \u00a7 40-4-212, MCA, for Rim to have primary residential custody. However, as noted above, our task is to consider whether the District Court abused its discretion by acting arbitrarily or outside the bounds of reason or whether the District Court committed clear error in its findings. \u201c[W]hen the evidence furnishes reasonable grounds for different conclusions, the findings of the District Court will not be disturbed.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Glanville </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 22, 25, 899 P.2d 527, 529 (quoting <em>Lumby v. Doetch </em>(1979), 183 Mont. 427, 431, 600 P.2d 200, 202). In this regard, Rim\u2019s argument is not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">\u00b610 It appears from the District Court\u2019s findings of fact that awarding primary residential custody to one party or the other was a relatively close call. For example, the District Court noted that both parents are reasonable parents and are in good mental health but that neither parent is reasonable in dealing with the other and that each has made inappropriate decisions and provokes the other. In addition, the District Court found that both parents\u2019 families are respectable, that Victoria has adjusted well to both communities, and that the schools and homes in each community are acceptable. However, commenting on credibility, the District Court found that Rim\u2019s facial expressions and body language communicated that her testimony was insincere, that she seemed to be \u201calmost choking on her words when talking about wanting Scott to be involved in Victoria\u2019s life,\u201d that Rim has let the animosity between her and Scott \u201cinterfere with her decisions involving Victoria,\u201d and that Efim is \u201cfar less accommodating than Scott when it comes to adjusting schedules to better fit the parties [sic] lives.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b464-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>\u00b611 Kim does not challenge any of the above findings. The only finding of fact that she argues was erroneous referred to Scott\u2019s girlfriend at the time of trial, Dr. Jennifer Gray. At trial, Scott gave uncontroverted testimony that he and Dr. Gray were considering engagement and that Dr. Gray had a good and trusting relationship with Victoria. The District Court found that the \u201crelationship [with Scott] is serious and Dr. Gray has a good relationship with Victoria.\u201d After the decree was entered, Kim brought a consolidated Rule 59, M.R.Civ.P., motion to alter the judgment and Rule 60(b), M.R.Civ.P., motion seeking relief from the judgment based upon new evidence. In her affidavit in support of the motion, Kim stated that she had discovered that Dr. Gray had moved to Africa shortly after the trial and that Scott knew about this impending departure at the time of trial but wanted to use his relationship with Dr. Gray to bolster his position before the District Court. The District Court denied the motion, and Kim does not challenge that ruling. We therefore do not contemplate her affidavit in support of the post-trial motion. Based on Scott\u2019s uncontroverted testimony, we conclude that this finding of fact was supported by substantial credible evidence and was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">\u00b612 In challenging the District Court\u2019s exercise of discretion, Kim calls into question Scott\u2019s veracity, attitude, and character, and she accuses Scott of abusing her emotionally and physically and of abusing alcohol. The \u201cemotional abuse\u201d to which Kim refers consists of two instances in which Scott used profanity toward her. Whether this was done in front of Victoria was disputed. The \u201cphysical abuse\u201d is comprised of one incident during an exchange in Havre. Kim described the incident at trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-5\">I was taking Victoria to Scott. I got out of the car to take her to him. I was wanting to put her in her car seat, and he didn\u2019t want me to put her in her car seat. And he started to shut the door on me, and I stopped the door, and I said, \u201cScott, let me buckle her in, and then I will leave.\u201d And he took my arm, pulled me away from the truck, slammed the door, and took off.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">Regarding alcohol use, the record indicates that Scott uses alcohol in moderation, but that on occasion, particularly during his college years, he has drunk to excess. As to Scott\u2019s veracity, Kim argues that Scott lied to the District Court about whether he had allowed Kim to speak to Victoria over the telephone on one of Victoria\u2019s birthdays, about whether Kim had been late to exchanges in Havre, and about whether he had taken Victoria to the hospital on one occasion. The record indicates that Scott did contradict himself regarding the birthday and Havre incidents, but the testimony regarding the hospital incident was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>less clear. Kim reasons that, in light of the above factors, the District Court \u201cexceeded the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice\u201d by awarding primary residential custody to Scott.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">\u00b613  Despite Kim\u2019s contentions, it is clear from the findings of fact that the District Court considered the \u201cinappropriate decisions\u201d of both Scott and Kim, weighed them, and found that Scott \u201cseems to have learned more from those mistakes so that it will have less adverse impact than Kimberly\u2019s anger,\u201d and that Scott was the \u201cmost likely to insure [sic] that Victoria has continuing and frequent contact with both parents ....\u201d As we have noted before, \u201cWe recognize the difficult position in which district courts are placed regarding child custody cases and therefore presume the District Court\u2019s decision is correct since it is in a better position than this Court to resolve such cases.\u201d <em>In re Paternitiy </em>of C.T.E.-H., 2004 MT 307, \u00b6 18, 323 Mont. 498, \u00b6 18, 101 P.3d 254, \u00b6 18. In the present case, Kim has failed to demonstrate that the District Court \u201cacted arbitrarily without employment of conscientious judgment or exceeded the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It is not clear that Scott\u2019s \u201cinappropriate decisions\u201d outweigh Kim\u2019s, given the District Court\u2019s perception of Kim\u2019s anger and apparent insincerity about co-parenting. Therefore, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion by awarding primary residential custody to Scott.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">\u00b614 Though we find no fault with the District Court\u2019s decision, we consider it necessary to address some of the comments and conduct of both the trial judge and Kim\u2019s counsel. We conclude that these are not matters of law but of decorxun. The District Court Judge made a number of comments that are not conducive to an atmosphere of respectful administration of the law. We need not mention every instance, but we feel compelled to make note of several.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">\u00b615 In encouraging the parties to settle after the presentation of both cases-in-chief, the judge said the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-7\">It\u2019s still not too late to settle. I mean, now, both guys have got to have their say, both guys know what the other side has to say.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>Both lawyers can tell their clients what my decision is based on and what the evidence is generally. And, again, it\u2019s because it\u2019s better for you. <em>It\u2019s easier for me to just poop out a decision and be done with it. </em>I mean, it really is, than to encourage settlement because I waste a lot of time over the years waiting 45 minutes every morning and-Well, that\u2019s what-you can ask her, she\u2019ll tell you. If it\u2019s a 9 o\u2019clock divorce hearing, it doesn\u2019t usually get to start until 10 because I make them argue for an hour first. [Emphasis added. ]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">The judge also offered the following when instructing Scott regarding how he should respond to questions from counsel for the opposition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1L\">THE COURT: Yeah, that\u2019s just-answer the question. You can almost <em>play a game with him </em>and be as short as possible and to the point and accurate. If something needs explaining, that\u2019s why you pay the lady in black to make notes, see, and she\u2019ll... add to it and go from there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-5\">THE COURT: Again, <em>just play the game. </em>Answer his questions-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUF\">MR STUFFT [counsel for Kim]: And, Judge it\u2019s not a game to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATi\">THE COURT: Well, no, but I mean, I\u2019m trying to get him to just answer yes or no and make his answers as short as possible. That seems to be couching in phrases like play the game, then it works easier for him to understand what I\u2019m trying to get him to do. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Although Kim argues that these and other comments by the judge suggest he was biased against her, we cannot conclude from the context of any of the comments that the inappropriateness of the judge\u2019s comments worked against either party or affected the court\u2019s decision. However, the use of such turns of phrase is not appropriate from the bench and convey an attitude of disrespect about the judicial process. Words matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">\u00b616 Kim\u2019s counsel exacerbated matters. Based on an obscure reference to witness testimony, he suggested the judge was \u201can ace in the hole\u201d for the opposing side and instigated <em>an </em>apparently heated exchange between himself and the judge. Counsel made a record of the judge\u2019s \u201cfacial features\u201d and \u201cglaring.\u201d He then offered an argument for the judge\u2019s recusal, which, from a review of the transcript, may have been within the bounds of plausibility, but counsel\u2019s manner was unnecessarily accusatory and inciting. That manner has also revealed itself in the tone of the briefs on appeal, wherein counsel accuses the judge of partiality but makes no reasonable demonstration of how the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>judge\u2019s inappropriate words or actions may have biased his factual findings or legal conclusions against Kim.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">\u00b617 We perceive no impact on the District Court\u2019s order resulting from bias and no abuse of discretion on the part of the judge from this record. However, a troubling lack of respect for decorum was clearly evident, which we trust will henceforth be avoided.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">\u00b618 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b467-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES WARNER, LEAPHART and NELSON concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b465-8\"> Moreover, other than citing cases for the standard of review and noting the previous appeal involving these parties, Kiin cites only one authority in support of her position, and only on a tangential point. To demonstrate the impropriety of the District Court\u2019s finding that Kim had helped Victoria sign her name with her mother\u2019s surname and that this was an example of Kim\u2019s poor attitude, Kim cites <em>In re Custody of J.C.O., </em>1999 MT 325, 297 Mont. 327, 993 P.2d 667 (affirming the trial Court\u2019s decision to deny the child\u2019s natural father his request that the minor child take his surname). <em>J.C.O. </em>is unsupportive of Kim\u2019s argument. Victoria\u2019s surname is Toavs, not Buis, but in any event the surname is not at issue. Kim\u2019s attitude reflected by the incident was the relevant consideration for the District Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
