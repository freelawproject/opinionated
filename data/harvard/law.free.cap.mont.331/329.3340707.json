We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">\u00b62 We review whether the District Court properly revoked DeShields\u2019s deferred sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b354-11\">\u00b63 DeShields entered a guilty plea to felony sexual assault on July 15, 1995. The District Court deferred imposition of his sentence for a period of four years subject to certain terms and conditions. The State filed a petition to revoke the deferred sentence two years later on October 2, 1997, alleging that DeShields had failed to participate in sex offender treatment. The District Court did not act on the petition, however, because DeShields had left Montana. When DeShields returned to Montana in 2001, the District Court deferred his sentence for another four years.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-12\">\u00b64 The State filed a second petition to revoke on October 22, 2003. The petition to revoke alleged that DeShields again had violated the terms of his deferred sentence. The District Court again revoked his deferred sentence and ordered DeShields to serve four years at the Montana State Prison. DeShields did not file an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-13\">\u00b65 DeShields filed a petition for postconviction relief on May 5,2004, challenging the factual basis for the revocation of his deferred sentence in 2003. DeShields alleged that the District Court improperly revoked his sentence based on criminal charges of which he was ultimately acquitted and that the District Court failed to require a presentence investigation. The District Court ruled that \u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA, prevented DeShields from raising a factual challenge to his revocation proceeding that reasonably could have been raised on direct appeal and denied DeShields\u2019s petition for postconviction relief. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">\u00b66 DeShields raises two additional issues for the first time on appeal. He contends that the District Court violated his due process rights by failing to consider alternatives to imprisonment when it revoked his deferred sentence. DeShields also maintains that the District Court lacked jurisdiction to impose a four-year deferred sentence because \u00a7 46-18-201(l)(a), MCA(1995), only permits a sentence tobe deferred for three years. We will not consider his due process argument as it is a well-established rule that this Court will not address an issue raised for the first time on appeal. <em>State v. Wetzel, </em>2005 MT 154, \u00b6 13, 327 Mont. 413, \u00b6 13, 114 P.3d 269, \u00b6 13. We will consider his challenge of the District Court\u2019s jurisdiction, however, because a party may challenge the sentencing court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction at any time. <em>See Pena v. State, </em>2004 MT 293, \u00b6 17, 323 Mont. 347, \u00b6 17, 100 P.3d 154, \u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Deferred Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">\u00b67 We review criminal sentences for legality only to determine whether the sentence falls within the parameters set by statute. <em>See State v. Montoya, </em>1999 MT 180, \u00b6 15, 295 Mont. 288, \u00b6 15, 983 P.2d 937, \u00b6 15. A district court\u2019s authority to impose a sentence is defined and constrained by statute, and the court cannot impose a sentence in the absence of specific statutory authority. <em>State v. Nelson, </em>1998 MT 227, \u00b6 24, 291 Mont. 15, \u00b6 24, 966 P.2d 133, \u00b6 24. We use the criminal statutes in effect at the time the crime was committed to evaluate the sentence. <em>Dexter v. Shields, </em>2004 MT 159, \u00b6 13, 322 Mont. 6, \u00b6 13, 92 P.2d 1208, \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">\u00b68 Section 46-18-201(l)(a), MCA (1995), states that a sentencing judge may defer the imposition of a sentence \u201cfor a period not exceeding 3 years for any felony.\u201d The District Court imposed a four-year deferred sentence for DeShields\u2019s felony sexual assault conviction. This four-year deferral runs afoul of the three-year limit set forth in \u00a7 46-18-201(l)(a), MCA (1995). DeShields contends that the District Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to impose a deferred sentence beyond the maximum time authorized by statute. Therefore, DeShields argues, his entire sentence is void.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">\u00b69 DeShields improperly characterizes the issue of the District Court\u2019s imposition of his sentence as jurisdictional. He mistakenly relies on our decision in <em>State v. Yorek </em>for the proposition that \u201cthe question of whether a district court possesses the authority to impose a sentence is a jurisdictional issue.\u201d <em>State v. Yorek, </em>2002 MT 74, \u00b6 15, 309 Mont. 238, \u00b6 15,45 P.3d 872, \u00b6 15 <em>(citing State v. Moorman </em>(1996), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>279 Mont. 330, 336, 928 P.2d 145, 149). To the extent that the <em>Yorek </em>decision stands for the proposition that sentencing issues are jurisdictional, it does not represent good law. <em>See Pena, </em>\u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">\u00b610 \u201cJurisdiction is a word of many, too many, meanings.\u201d <em>Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Environment </em>(1998), 523 U.S. 83, 90, 118 S.Ct. 1003, 1010, 140 L.Ed.2d 210. We, along with other courts, sometimes have been \u201cprofligate\u201d in our use of the term. <em>Arbaugh v. Y &amp; H Corp. </em>(Feb. 22, 2006), 126 S.Ct. 1235, 2006 WL 397863 at *6. Jurisdictional claims challenge a court\u2019s power or capacity to entertain the subject matter of the proceeding. <em>Pena, </em>\u00b6 22. A district court possesses original jurisdiction in all felony cases. Art. VII, Sec. 4, Mont. Const. Whether a district court commits a statutory error in imposing a sentence must not be confused with whether the court had the power or capacity to impose a sentence. <em>Pena, </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">\u00b611  The District Court improperly imposed a deferred sentence beyond its statutory authority. <em>See </em>Section 46-18-201(l)(a), MCA (1995). The mere fact that the District Court exceeded its statutory authority in imposing a criminal sentence, however, does not render the sentence void ab initio. A sentence in excess of one prescribed by law is not void ab initio because of the excess, but is good insofar as the power of the court extends and is invalid only as to the excess. <em>Charles v. Commonwealth </em>(Va. 2005), 270 Va. 14, 20, 613 S.E.2d 432,435. Only the portion of the sentence beyond the district court\u2019s statutory authority is illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">\u00b612 The District Court deferred imposition of DeShields\u2019s sentence for four years. Section 46-18-201(l)(a), MCA (1995), authorizes a court to defer imposition of a sentence for a felony for three years. The court\u2019s decision to defer imposition of DeShields\u2019s sentence beyond the three-year statutory limit did not render the entire sentence void. Only the final year of DeShields\u2019s deferred sentence exceeded the statutory authority of \u00a7 46-18-201(l)(a), MCA (1995). Thus, the first three years of DeShields\u2019s deferred sentence remained valid and in full force. <em>See Charles v. Commonwealth, </em>270 Va. at 20, 613 S.E.2d at 435.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">\u00b613  The District Court properly revoked DeShields\u2019s deferred sentence in 2001 and 2003. The District Court first sentenced DeShields in 1995. The State initially filed a petition in 1997 to revoke DeShields\u2019s original deferred sentence within the three-year deferral period provided by \u00a7 46-18-20l(l)(a), MCA (1995). Although the court did not rule on the petition until 2001, after the time authorized by statute, the court retained jurisdiction because the State filed a timely petition to revoke. <em>See </em>Section 46-18-203(2), MCA (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>\u00b614  Similarly, the State timely filed its second petition to revoke in 2003, two years after the court reimposed DeShields\u2019s four-year deferred sentence. DeShields was serving the second year of his deferred sentence when the State filed its second petition to revoke. Section 46-18-201(l)(a), MCA (1995), authorizes a three-year deferral and the State filed its revocation petition within that valid three-year deferral period.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">Revocation of sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">\u00b615 DeShields also contends that the District Court improperly revoked his sentence in 2003, based upon a lack of sufficient evidence. DeShields reasonably could have raised this argument on direct appeal. We will not consider grounds for postconviction relief that reasonably could have been raised on direct appeal. <em>See </em>\u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA. Criminal defendants may not substitute postconviction relief for direct appeal. <em>See State v. Hanson, </em>1999 MT 226, \u00b6 14, 296 Mont. 82, \u00b6 14, 988 P.2d 299, \u00b6 14. DeShields had the opportunity to file a direct appeal from the revocation of his deferred sentence and chose not to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">\u00b616 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b357-7\">JUSTICES WARNER, LEAPHART, NELSON and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
