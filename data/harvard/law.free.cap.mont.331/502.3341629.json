On appeal, Price raises two issues, which we restate as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">\u00b62 Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it <em>sua sponte </em>objected to testimony elicited earlier in the trial, instructed the jury to disregard that testimony, and limited testimony on that same subject by a future witness?<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b527-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b527-11\">\u00b63 Shortly after midnight on April 26,2004, someone drew a serrated knife across William Yocom\u2019s throat, leaving behind a non-fatal slit in his neck. Yocom did not see his assailant. Following an investigation of the incident, the State charged Price with assault with a weapon, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-213, MCA (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-12\">\u00b64 Testimony at Price\u2019s trial, held September 15 and 16, 2004, established the following facts. The assault took place at Price\u2019s residence. At the time, Price shared the house with Frank Fouse. Yocom, who was already acquainted with both Price and Fouse, went <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>over to the house during the late afternoon or early evening of April 25, 2004, to discuss renting a room in Price\u2019s basement. After seeing the room, Yocom visited with Price and Fouse in Price\u2019s living room. The three socialized for several hours, drinking beer and, later, whiskey. At some point, Fouse and Yocom engaged in \u201cplay wrestling\u201d because, according to Yocom, Fouse \u201cwanted to see what I was made of, pretty much, and just boys will be boys type attitude.\u201d The wrestling was so rough that Yocom ended up with a rib fracture which was treated at the hospital later that night, and Fouse exhibited several \u201craspberries\u201d on his face, which one witness defined as \u201ca rug burn, or you know, something, you\u2019d gotten your skin pulled, it was pink. Not necessarily an abrasion, but some sort of irritant.\u201d Meanwhile, as Yocom and Fouse wrestled, Price sat calmly on the couch observing the activity, drinking his beer, and saying nothing. \u00b65 The parties dispute what took place next. Yocom and Fouse both testified during the State\u2019s case-in-chief that sometime between midnight and 1:00 a.m. on April 26, they were standing in the living room approximately two or three feet apart facing each other and talking. Just then, Price-who Fouse testified had gone to the kitchen-allegedly returned to the living room, walked up behind Yocom, pulled Yocom\u2019s head back, \u201cwhipped out a knife and slit [Yocom\u2019s] throat.\u201d Although the knife cut deeply into Yocom\u2019s skin, it did not hit any critical structures in his neck and did not cause immediate bleeding. Yocom panicked, attempted to leave the house through the front door, which was locked, ran through the kitchen and ultimately exited through the garage. He flagged down a passing vehicle, and the driver gave him a ride to the hospital where he was treated for his injury. He received twelve stitches.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">\u00b66 There was no evidence that another person had been in the house with Yocom, Price, and Fouse at the time of the assault. Thus, the defense sought to show that Fouse, not Price, had been the perpetrator. For instance, Yocom admitted on cross-examination that if Price had been standing where Yocom claimed he was at the time of the assault, then Yocom would have had to pass by Price when he ran from the living room into the kitchen and out the garage; yet, Yocom did not recall seeing Price at any time during and after the assault. There also was testimony that Yocom, in talking to medical personnel and the investigating officers that night, did not immediately identify the person who had caused his injury and that Fouse and Yocom had interacted at the police station after Fouse had given a statement but before Yocom had given one (an intimation that Fouse had influenced or \u201ccontaminate^]\u201d Yocom\u2019s identification of his attacker).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>\u00b67 Of particular relevance to this appeal, Price sought to bolster his theory that Fouse had committed the assault with evidence that Fouse had a propensity for violence. In his opening statement, counsel for Price pointed out that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-4\">the County Attorney [in her opening statement] said that the State has no evidence as to why Mr. Price would slit this guy\u2019s throat. Keep in mind, though, when you\u2019re trying to figure out who would have a motive, look to [Fouse], the other individual who was there, the guy that was violently wrestling with Mr. Yocom to the extent that ribs have been broken. [Fouse] was the person with the motive that night to slit [Yocom\u2019s] throat.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">\u00b68 Price had subpoenaed Mike Francell, who was to testify concerning Fouse\u2019s violent character. The prosecutor attempted preemptively to counter this evidence through a number of her own witnesses. For instance, during her direct examination of Fouse she remarked, without objection, \u201cNow, there\u2019s also been some allegations by a guy, who used to be one of your friends, that you\u2019re kind of a violent guy,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to which Fouse replied, \u2018You know, I guess, that\u2019s-everybody has their own opinion.\u201d The prosecutor also questioned Fouse\u2019s ex-wife, Lisa Fruin, and his ex-girlfriend, Marie Moore, without objection, concerning Fouse\u2019s character when he has been drinking. Fruin testified that, \u201cHe likes to play around and be silly. He\u2019s really in good spirits, for the most part.\u201d When asked whether \u201che get[s] mean, or violent,\u201d she replied, \u201cNo, he does not.\u201d Similarly, Moore testified that, \u201cHe would just, around me, he would always just, you know, he\u2019d be fine. Sometimes he\u2019d say some stuff, but usually it was just, you know, he\u2019d get really drunk and then go to sleep.\u201d She stated that she had never seen him \u201cget mean, or violent, when he was drinking.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">\u00b69 In response to this testimony, defense counsel asked Fouse, without objection, \u201cDo you get ornery, or violent, when you drink?\u201d Fouse replied that he does not. Counsel also examined Fouse concerning an incident in which Fouse had armed himself with a butcher knife in anticipation of an altercation with Price. However, counsel did not shake Moore\u2019s opinion concerning Fouse\u2019s character for violence, and he did not address this issue at all with Fruin. Rather, it appears that he planned to introduce the bulk of his evidence concerning Fouse\u2019s propensity for violence through Francell, after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>State had rested.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">\u00b610 The foregoing testimony by Fouse, Fruin, and Moore was presented during the State\u2019s case-in-chief on the first day of trial. The following morning, prior to resuming the proceedings and out of the jury\u2019s presence, the District Court <em>sua sponte </em>raised an objection to the evidence introduced thus far concerning Fouse\u2019s character:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-5\">[T]he Court, listening to testimony yesterday had a real question. So, before we go any further, I want some answers. [\u00b6] I am not sure, under the rules of evidence, that you can bring all this information up about Frank Fouse. I want to know what the defense\u2019s purpose is.... I don\u2019t think any of this testimony about Frank Fouse is admissible. What\u2019s your point in doing this? Or, can you tell me where you can, under the rules of evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">\u00b611 In response, defense counsel presented two grounds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-7\">First off, we\u2019re contending that Mr. Fouse is the person that actually did the assault. So, I would argue that his propensity for violence, or not violence, would be admissible. [\u00b6] Either way, the prosecution opened the door by asking his girlfriend, or ex-girlfriend, whether he was violent, or not. And I think the prosecution, on direct, asked him if he\u2019s violent on the stand, so the door was opened by the State by asking him, are you violent? ... So, I think I\u2019m entitled. The door is open. If there was no grounds otherwise, the door is now open. The State can\u2019t ask him and have him, and his girlfriend, ex-girlfriend, say that he\u2019s not a violent person, and then not have me be able, then, to put a witness on to say otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">\u00b612 Counsel also provided an offer of proof concerning Francell\u2019s expected testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-9\">Francell will say that Fouse used to brag that he was a trained killer. He\u2019ll, also, say that Fouse, on one or more occasions, attacked him when his back was turned and therefore he would never-he knew never to have his back to Fouse. In this case, the victim was assaulted from behind. He\u2019ll also testify as to, and I quote, Frank would get crazy when he drank. And the State asked Frank how he gets when he drinks.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-10\">\u00b613 The prosecutor argued that because of Price\u2019s opening statement characterizing Fouse as the perpetrator, \u201cthe State was in a position where we had to ask the witnesses if they\u2019d ever-and I didn\u2019t ask [Fouse] if he was violent, I asked him how he acted when he was drinking. So, I\u2019m not sure that the State has opened the door.\u201d Thereafter, the court ruled that Price could question Francell only as to how Fouse behaves when he drinks. In addition, after bringing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>jurors in, the court instructed them as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-4\">Members of the jury, the Court has determined that there was testimony yesterday about the propensity for nonviolence, or violence, of a witness named Frank Fouse. The Court has determined that is not relevant testimony. It should not be considered by the jury, in any manner, when arriving at a decision in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">\u00b614 In conformity with the court\u2019s ruling, defense counsel later questioned Francell as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-6\">Q. Did you have occasion to be around Mr. Fouse when he was drinking?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-7\">A. A few times, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-8\">Q. How did he get when he was drinking, when you were around him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-9\">A. Ignorant, stupid, wild. He\u2019s a pretty violent guy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-10\">\u00b615 Immediately following this testimony, the defense rested, and the parties gave their closing arguments, during which defense counsel emphasized Fouse\u2019s character and violent behavior on the night of the assault:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-11\">Now, you saw Frank Fouse on the stand, and you can judge for yourself his demeanor and what you think of him. You\u2019re entitled to ask yourselves if he seemed like the kind of guy, or looks like the kind of guy, that\u2019s capable of doing that. And we ask that you do apply your judgment in that case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-12\">Now, you heard the witness here today, that we called, who testified. Mike Francell testified, that when he drinks, Frank gets violent, that he gets wild.[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-13\">Now, all the evidence, all the testimony, what is Ron Price doing that night? He\u2019s calmly sitting on the couch, drinking a beer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-14\">What is Frank doing? By the State\u2019s own testimony, he is violently wrestling with Yocom, to the extent that Yocom had a broken rib, and to the extent that Frank has raspberries on his face. Now, who knows what was going on? Who knows if Frank got mad and slit his throat in anger? Who knows if they were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>fooling around and he accidentally slit his throat, just playing with him? Because it wasn\u2019t a deep cut, I mean, maybe, they were playing around. And Yocom doesn\u2019t remember.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-4\">But, clearly, Ron Price is just sitting there calmly. Everybody that testified has testified that all their dealings with Ron have been calm. They\u2019ve never seen Ron violent, or act this way. But we know that Frank was being violent that night, violent enough to break Yocom\u2019s rib.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">\u00b616 The jury deliberated approximately nine hours and returned a verdict of guilty. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">\u00b617 We review discretionary trial court rulings, including trial administration issues and evidentiary rulings, for \u201cabuse of discretion.\u201d <em>State v. Beavers, </em>1999 MT 260, \u00b6 20, 296 Mont. 340, \u00b6 20, 987 P.2d 371, \u00b6 20. In determining whether a trial court abused its discretion, the question is not whether the reviewing court agrees with the trial court, but rather whether the trial court acted arbitrarily without the employment of conscientious judgment or exceeded the bounds of reason, resulting in substantial injustice. <em>See State v. Ferguson, </em>2005 MT 343, \u00b6 22, 330 Mont. 103, \u00b6 22, 126 P.3d 463, \u00b6 22; <em>Porter v. Porter </em>(1970), 155 Mont. 451, 457, 473 P.2d 538, 541. Notwithstanding this deferential standard, however, judicial discretion must be guided by the rules and principles of law; thus, our standard of review is plenary to the extent that a discretionary ruling is based on a conclusion of law. In such circumstance, we must determine whether the court correctly interpreted the law. <em>See State v. Incashola, 1998 </em>MT 184, \u00b6 9, 289 Mont. 399, \u00b6 9, 961 P.2d 745, \u00b6 9. The burden to demonstrate an abuse of discretion is on the party seeking reversal of an unfavorable ruling. <em>See State v. Sheehan, </em>2005 MT 305, \u00b6 18, 329 Mont. 417, \u00b6 18, 124 P.3d 1119, \u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b532-9\">\u00b618 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it sua sponte objected to testimony elicited earlier in the trial, instructed the jury to disregard that testimony, and limited testimony on that same subject by a future witness?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b532-10\">\u00b619 As described above, the District Judge raised a <em>sua sponte </em>objection the second day of trial to testimony concerning Fouse\u2019s propensity for violence. He determined that this evidence was inadmissible and, accordingly, imposed limitations on any future testimony on this subject. He also instructed the jury that the prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>testimony was \u201cnot relevant\u201d and \u201cshould not be considered by [you], in any manner, when arriving at a decision in this case.\u201d Price claims that these actions-\u201cvolunteering\u201d the objection, limiting future testimony, and instructing the jury to disregard the earlier testimony-constituted an abuse of discretion that impaired Price\u2019s defense. He maintains that he is entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">\n<em>A. The District Court\u2019s Objection</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">\u00b620 With respect to the court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>objection, Price points out that \u201c[a] trial judge must take care to insure that he does not abandon his role as impartial judge in favor of that of an advocate\u201d (citing <em>State v. Stafford </em>(1984), 208 Mont. 324, 331, 678 P.2d 644, 648). However, he has not persuaded us that by raising the objection at issue here, the District Judge crossed the line between arbiter and advocate.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Apy\">\u00b621 To be sure, in our adversarial system, the development of the facts is a task primarily assigned to counsel, and the role of the trial judge is to regulate the proceedings and ensure that the trial is fair. <em>See State v. McConville </em>(1922), 64 Mont. 302, 308, 209 P. 987, 989. \u201c \u2018The purposes and modes of thought of the advocate and the judge are different and no person can successfully enact the dual role of prosecutor and judge. They are inconsistent.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Richardson </em>(1924), 69 Mont. 400, 404, 222 P. 418, 419 (quoting <em>People v. Judycki </em>(Ill. 1922), 134 N.E. 134, 137). For this reason, the judge should avoid \u201cofficious interference\u201d in the proceedings, <em>Richardson, </em>69 Mont. at 403-04, 222 P. at 419, and must at all times maintain \u201cimpartiality in demeanor as well as in actions,\u201d <em>United States v. Hickman </em>(6th Cir. 1979), 592 F.2d 931, 933 (internal quotation marks omitted). <em>See also People v. De Jesus </em>(N.Y. 1977), 369 N.E.2d 752, 755-56; <em>People v. Martinez </em>(Colo. 1974), 523 P.2d 120, 121; <em>Greenhow v. United States </em>(D.C.App. 1985), 490 A.2d 1130, 1136; <em>State v. Thornburgh </em>(Iowa 1974), 220 N.W.2d 579, 585; Canons 5 and 15, Montana Canons of Judicial Ethics (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">\u00b622  At the same time, however, \u201c[t]he presiding judge is not a mere figurehead or umpire at the trial. It is his province to see that justice is done.\u201d <em>McConville, </em>64 Mont. at 308, 209 P. at 989. Thus, he is not required to remain silent and passive throughout a jury trial, speaking only to rule on motions or objections. <em>See </em>McCormick on Evidence (5th ed. 1999) (hereinafter, \u201cMcCormick\u201d), \u00a7 55, at 247 (\u201cA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>party\u2019s failure to object ... does not preclude the trial judge from excluding [inadmissible] evidence on his own motion if ... the judge believes the interests of justice require the exclusion.\u201d). To the contrary, it is his duty to conduct the trial in a manner calculated to ensure fairness, avoid needless consumption of time, keep from the jury extraneous matters likely to mislead them, and facilitate the ascertainment of truth. <em>See State v. Dickens </em>(1982), 198 Mont. 482, 486, 647 P.2d 338, 341; <em>State v. LaMere </em>(1980), 190 Mont. 332, 339-40, 621 P.2d 462, 466; <em>State v. Cassill </em>(1924), 70 Mont. 433, 453, 227 P. 49, 57; <em>Richardson, </em>69 Mont. at 403, 222 P. at 419; Rule 611(a), M.R.Evid. \u00b623  In the case at hand, it is evident that the District Judge raised the challenged objection not to influence the minds of the jurors concerning Price\u2019s guilt, but rather to address the real possibility that they could be misled by extraneous matters or base their verdict on incompetent evidence. He explained to counsel that \u201cI sometimes don\u2019t like to submit my own [objection], but I don\u2019t think [evidence of Fouse\u2019s propensity for violence] was proper testimony\u201d because \u201c[t]he rules of evidence limit attack of a witness to character for truthfulness, or untruthfulness. What we\u2019re doing here is bringing up evidence that-violent, nonviolent, he\u2019s not the victim in this case. ... I don\u2019t think any of this testimony about Frank Fouse is admissible.\u201d It appears from this explanation that the judge\u2019s purpose was to regulate the proceedings so as to ensure a fair trial, not to advocate on behalf of the State. Significantly, unlike a judge with an agenda, the judge here did not immediately rule on his objection. Rather, he solicited and heard arguments from both parties concerning the merits of the objection before issuing a ruling. Moreover, the objection related to testimony elicited by <em>both </em>the State and Price the previous day; thus, it had the capacity to adversely affect both parties.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> And finally, the judge raised the objection outside the jury\u2019s presence, thereby avoiding the risk of appearing in the eyes of the jurors to be on the side of the prosecution. For these reasons, we conclude that the District Judge did not abuse his discretion in volunteering the objection to testimony concerning Fouse\u2019s propensity for violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>\n<em>B. The District Court\u2019s Ruling and Jury Instruction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AJe\">\u00b624 As noted above, the District Judge heard arguments from Price and the State (outside the jury\u2019s presence) on the merits of his objection. Defense counsel advanced two arguments against the exclusion of testimony concerning Fouse\u2019s character: (1) \u201cwe\u2019re contending that Mr. Fouse is the person that actually did the assault. So, I would argue that his propensity for violence, or not violence, would be admissible\u201d; and (2) \u201cthe prosecution opened the door.\u201d Counsel also provided an offer of proof: witness Francell would testify that Fouse \u201cused to brag that he was a trained killer\u201d; that Fouse, \u201con one or more occasions, attacked [Francell] when his back was turned and therefore [Francell]... knew never to have his back to Fouse\u201d; and that Fouse \u201cwould get crazy when he drank.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">\u00b625 The judge ruled that counsel could \u201cask [Francell] what [Fouse is] like when he\u2019s drinking,\u201d since \u201cthe State opened the door to that [issue],\u201d but nothing more. In response to counsel\u2019s inquiries concerning the precise scope of this ruling, the judge clarified that counsel could not let Francell provide examples of things Fouse had done when he was drinking, that counsel could not inquire further about the incident in which Fouse armed himself with a butcher knife in anticipation of an altercation with Price, and that Francell could not testify that Fouse \u201cused to brag that he was a trained killer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">\u00b626 Price claims that imposing these restrictions on the scope of Francell\u2019s testimony was an abuse of discretion. First, he argues that \u201c[t]he State\u2019s direct examination of Moore and Fouse opened the door for [defense counsel] to explore Fouse\u2019s propensity for violence as well as to call Francell and elicit testimony regarding Fouse\u2019 [sic] habit of becoming violent.\u201d Yet, the District Judge instructed the jury that the \u201ctestimony yesterday about the propensity for nonviolence, or violence, of a witness named Frank Fouse\u201d-the evidence to which the State had opened the door-\u201cis not relevant testimony\u201d and \u201cshould not be considered by [you], in any manner, when arriving at a decision in this case.\u201d Consequently, given that the court had ruled this testimony irrelevant and so instructed the jury, there was no need for Price to rebut the State\u2019s evidence with further testimony on this subject. To be sure, when a party places a matter at issue on direct examination, fairness mandates that the opposing party be permitted to offer contradictory evidence. However, one does not need to refute testimony that the court has declared irrelevant and that the jury has been instructed not to consider in its deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">\u00b627 In any event, the limitation imposed by the court on the scope of Francell\u2019s testimony was proportionate to the issue to which the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>had \u201copened the door\u201d-specifically, how Fouse behaves when he drinks. Francell, in fact, testified that when Fouse drinks, he gets \u201c[i]gnorant, stupid, wild. He\u2019s a pretty violent guy.\u201d This testimony was probative of whether Fouse was the actual perpetrator of the assault on Yocom. Indeed, defense counsel echoed Francell\u2019s characterization of Fouse during his closing argument, and he reminded the jury that while Fouse had been behaving violently on the evening of the assault-the play wrestling with Yocom, Yocom\u2019s broken rib, the raspberries on Fouse\u2019s face-Price, by contrast, had been \u201cjust sitting there calmly.\u201d Thus, the judge\u2019s ruling did not prevent Price from countering the evidence presented by the State on the issue of whether Fouse behaves violently when he drinks.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">\u00b628 Besides his \u201cState opened the door\u201d argument, Price submits two additional grounds for the admission of Francell\u2019s testimony. First, he contends that the testimony had substantive value-i.e., it supported his theory that Fouse assaulted Yocom-and that, by excluding the testimony, the District Judge precluded him from presenting his theory of the case. Second, he contends that the testimony was admissible for its impeachment value:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-5\">Fouse testified he does not get violent when he drinks. Fouse\u2019s ex-girlfriend also testified that Fouse never got mean or violent when he was drinking. That testimony was untruthful. Francell\u2019s testimony would have established that both Fouse and Ms. Moore lied to the trial jury when they testified about Fouse\u2019s habits and character. Demonstrating that they were liars could have convinced the jury Price\u2019s version of events on the night of the assault was more credible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">Thus, Price suggests that the District Judge precluded him from fully impeaching two of the State\u2019s witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">\u00b629 With respect to the proffered testimony that Fouse would get crazy when he drank, we have already determined that Price was not prevented from presenting the jury with this evidence. Furthermore, Francell\u2019s testimony that Fouse gets \u201c[ijgnorant, stupid, wild\u201d when he drinks and that Fouse is \u201ca pretty violent guy\u201d supported Price\u2019s theory that Fouse had committed the assault, and it forced the jury to decide whether Fouse, Moore, and Fruin had lied when they testified the previous day about Fouse\u2019s habits and character. As such, Francell\u2019s testimony served the substantive and impeachment purposes sought by Price.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">\u00b630 With respect to the proffered testimony that Fouse bragged of being a trained killer and that Fouse attacked Francell on one or more occasions when Francell\u2019s back was turned, we conclude that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>exclusion of this evidence did not preclude Price from presenting his theory of the case or from impeaching Fouse and Moore. Even assuming, arguendo, that there is some merit to the dubious proposition that specific instances of Fouse\u2019s propensity for violence were admissible as evidence of his \u201chabit\u201d of behaving violently after he drinks and/or for the purpose of attacking Fouse\u2019s and Moore\u2019s credibility, such evidence was cumulative. As stated above, defense counsel elicited testimony from Francell that Fouse gets \u201c[ijgnorant, stupid, wild\u201d when he drinks and that Fouse is \u201ca pretty violent guy.\u201d Moreover, during his closing argument, counsel highlighted the fact that Fouse had been \u201cviolently wrestling with Yocom\u201d that night, and he argued to the jury that Fouse may have \u201cgot[ten] mad and slit [Yocom\u2019s] throat in anger.\u201d Thus, the judge did not abuse his discretion by excluding the remaining portions of Francell\u2019s proposed testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">\u00b631  The District Judge did not abuse his discretion by objecting <em>sua sponte </em>to evidence of Fouse\u2019s propensity for violence when he drinks. The objection pertained to testimony elicited by both parties the previous day; the judge\u2019s purpose was to address the possibility that the jurors could be misled by extraneous matters or base their verdict on incompetent evidence; and he solicited and heard arguments from both Price and the State concerning the merits of the objection before issuing a ruling. Thus, we conclude that the judge did not abandon his duty of impartiality in favor of that of an advocate by volunteering this one objection and corresponding instruction to the jury. Rather, his action was in the nature of regulating the proceedings so as to ensure a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">\u00b632  Nor did the District Judge abuse his discretion by limiting Francell\u2019s testimony to the issue of how Fouse behaves when he drinks. This is the extent to which the State had \u201copened the door\u201d with testimony concerning Fouse\u2019s character, and the judge\u2019s ruling was proportional to that testimony. Furthermore, the remainder of Francell\u2019s proffered testimony, which the judge excluded, was cumulative of the evidence already before the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">\u00b633 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b537-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, WARNER and NELSON concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b527-13\"> The two issues presented by Price are simply two nuances of this one issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b529-7\"> Francell had not yet testified; thus, it appears that the prosecutor was referring to out-of-court allegations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b531-15\"> At this point, the prosecutor objected, claiming that counsel had misstated Francell\u2019s testimony. The court sustained the objection, believing that \u201c[Francell] didn\u2019t say [Fouse] got violent,\u201d but also indicating that \u201cthe jury has to rely on their own memory.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b533-7\"> The judge volunteered a number of objections dining the course of the trial; however, Price challenges only the objection pertaining to the evidence of Fouse\u2019s propensity for violence. Thus, we do not address whether the court\u2019s other <em>sua sponte </em>interruptions constituted improper advocacy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b534-4\"> The State had an interest in retaining for the jury\u2019s consideration the testimony by Fouse, Fruin, and Moore that Fouse did <em>not </em>have a propensity for violence, since such evidence made it less probable that Fouse had committed the assault. <em>See </em>McCormick, \u00a7 185, at 638 (\u201c[Elvidence that a [person] charged with assaulting a neighbor has a reputation for being non-violent... seems to make it less likely that he would commit an assault, presumably because we accept the underlying generalization that fewer people with a reputation for non-violence assault their neighbors than do people with no such reputation.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
