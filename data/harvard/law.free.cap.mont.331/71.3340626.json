We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">\u00b62 The drivers\u2019 appeal presents the sole issue of whether a person may be convicted of driving while license suspended or revoked under \u00a7 61-5-212, MCA, without having possessed or possessed in recent years a valid Montana driver\u2019s license or other statutorily granted privilege to drive.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b96-11\">\u00b63 At some point preceding the present charges, the State had \u201csuspended\u201d or \u201crevoked\u201d the drivers\u2019 privilege to drive pursuant to various provisions of Title 61. None of the drivers possessed valid Montana licenses at the time that the State purportedly suspended or revoked their privileges. With one exception, Cristan, none had ever possessed a valid Montana license. Cristan had let his Montana license lapse approximately 20 years before this latest incident. He never had reapplied for a license.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-12\">\u00b64 At various times in 2003 and 2004, law enforcement officers stopped each of the drivers following traffic violations and cited them for driving while license suspended or revoked pursuant to \u00a7 61-5-212, MCA. None of the drivers possessed a valid Montana driver\u2019s license at the time law enforcement officials issued the respective citations. \u00b65 The drivers filed motions to dismiss in Billings Municipal Court, arguing that they could not be charged with driving while license suspended or revoked because they did not possess a valid driver\u2019s license or other privilege to drive. The court denied the motions. The drivers entered nolo contendere pleas and reserved the right to appeal. The drivers appealed their convictions to the District Court for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>Thirteenth Judicial District, Yellowstone County. The drivers also moved to consolidate their cases on appeal. The District Court consolidated the cases and affirmed the Municipal Court\u2019s denial of their motions to dismiss. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">\u00b66 The denial of a motion to dismiss in a criminal case presents a question of law. <em>State v. Mallak, </em>2005 MT 49, \u00b6 13, 326 Mont. 165, \u00b6 13, 109 P.3d 209, \u00b6 13. We conduct plenary review of a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether the court\u2019s conclusions are correct as a matter of law. <em>In re Conservatorship of Kloss, </em>2005 MT 39, \u00b6 7, 326 Mont. 117, \u00b6 7, 109 P.3d 205, \u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">\u00b67 Section 61-5-212, MCA, provides, in part, that a person \u201ccommits the offense of driving a motor vehicle during a suspension or revocation period if the person drives ... a motor vehicle on any public highway of this state at a time when the person\u2019s privilege to do so is suspended or revoked in this state or any other state ....\u201d The drivers argue that the State first must have granted a person the privilege to drive, either through a driver\u2019s license or other statutorily authorized means, for the State to charge them under \u00a7 61-5-212, MCA. The State maintains that the privilege to drive \u201cencompasses the act of an individual-independent of any prerequisite grant secured by law or otherwise-to simply enjoy, or have the benefit\u201d of driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">\u00b68 When interpreting a statute, we seek to implement the objectives the legislature sought to achieve, and if the legislative intent can be determined from the plain language of the statute, the plain language controls. <em>Kloss, </em>\u00b6 10. It is blackletter law that in the construction of a statute, the office of a judge is simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to omit what has been inserted or insert what has been omitted. Section 1-2-101, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">\u00b69 Section 61-1-101(16), MCA, defines \u201cdriver\u2019s license\u201d as \u201ca license or permit to operate a motor vehicle issued under or granted by the laws of this state, including ... the privilege of any person to drive a motor vehicle, whether or not the person holds a valid license ....\u201d Section 61-5-102, MCA, provides, in part, that \u201c[e]xcept as provided in 61-5-104, a person may not drive a motor vehicle upon a highway in this state unless the person has a valid Montana driver\u2019s license.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-10\">\u00b610 Section 61-5-104, MCA, lists persons who are exempt from licensure requirements. For example, this provision exempts from licensure requirements \u201ca person who is a member of the armed forces <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>of the United States while operating a motor vehicle owned by or leased to the United States government and being operated on official business.\u201d Section 61-5-104(l)(a), MCA. Similarly, this provision also exempts <em>\u201ca </em>person who temporarily drives, operates, or moves a road machine, farm tractor ... or implement of husbandry for use in intrastate commerce on a highway....\u201d Section 61-5-104(l)(d), MCA. \u00b611 \u201cThe ability to drive a motor vehicle on a public highway is not a fundamental right; it is a revocable privilege that is granted upon compliance with statutory licensing procedures.\u201d <em>State v. Skurdal, </em>235 Mont. 291, 295, 767 P.2d 304, 307. The relevant licensing procedures require a person to hold a valid Montana driver\u2019s license to drive a motor vehicle unless they qualify for a statutory exemption. Sections 61-5-102 and -104, MCA. Moreover, the legislature included the privilege to drive in its definition of \u201cdriver\u2019s license,\u201d and requires that such a license be \u201cissued under or granted by the laws of this <em>state...\u201d </em>Section 61-1-101(16), MCA. The plain reading of these statutes, taken together, demonstrates that the State must grant a person the privilege to drive. The legislature limited the privilege to drive, absent a valid driver\u2019s license, to those instances identified in \u00a7 61-5-104, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">\u00b612 We recognize that the definition of \u201cdriver\u2019s license\u201d includes \u201cthe privilege of any person to drive,\u201d regardless of whether the person possesses a driver\u2019s license. Section 61-1-101(16), MCA. We also recognize, however, that Title 61 uses the terms in the disjunctive. For example, the department of justice may not issue a driver\u2019s license to a person \u201cwhose <em>license or driving privilege </em>is currently suspended, revoked, or canceled ....\u201d Section 61-5-105(2), MCA (emphasis added). The State asserts that requiring the privilege to drive to stem from a positive grant of authority by the State ignores this distinction. We disagree. The distinction throughout Title 61 between \u201clicense\u201d or \u201cdriving privilege\u201d instead demonstrates that individuals lawfully can drive in Montana either by obtaining a driver\u2019s license pursuant to \u00a7 61-5-102, MCA, or by establishing that they have a privilege to drive without a license pursuant to \u00a7 61-5-104, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">\u00b613  The plain language of \u00a7 61-5-212, MCA, requires that a person possess a privilege to drive before that privilege can be suspended or revoked. We have determined that the privilege to drive must be granted by law. Therefore, absent a license or privilege to drive without a license pursuant to \u00a7 61-5-104, MCA, the State cannot convict a person under \u00a7 61-5-212, MCA, with driving while license suspended or revoked. Adopting the State\u2019s position would require this Court to enlarge the phrase \u201csuspended or revoked\u201d of \u00a7 61-5-212, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>MCA, to include a driving privilege never granted. It is not the role of this Court to insert what has been omitted when applying statutes. Section 1-2-101, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">\u00b614 Other jurisdictions have reached similar results. For instance, the Kansas Supreme Court, when interpreting substantially similar statutory language, concluded that Kansas granted the privilege to drive only to persons with a valid driver\u2019s license or those statutorily exempt from the licensure requirement. <em>State v. Bowie </em>(Kan. 2000), 999 P.2d 947, 951. Thus, the court concluded that a person who never obtained a license or failed to qualify for an exemption could not be charged with driving while their privilege was cancelled, suspended, or revoked. <em>Bowie, </em>999 P.2d at 952. The Court of Appeals of Alaska likewise concluded that the \u201cprivilege to drive\u201d derived from a legal authorization to drive, even though the definition of \u201clicense to operate a motor vehicle\u201d included the \u201cprivilege to drive\u201d regardless of whether the person held a valid license. <em>Francis v. Municipality of Anchorage </em>(Alaska Ct. App. 1982) 641 P.2d 226, 227. The court determined that in the absence of a prior legal authorization, such as a valid driver\u2019s license or a statutory exemption from licensure requirements, a person could not be charged with driving while their license was suspended. <em>Francis, </em>641 P.2d at 228.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">\u00b615  Our decision does not leave the State without recourse when dealing with unlicensed drivers. The State could have charged the drivers here with driving without a license under \u00a7 61-5-307, MCA. The State argues that the harsher penalty under \u00a7 61-5-212, MCA, would favor unfairly drivers who have never bothered to obtain a license over those who have taken the trouble to obtain a license or who have qualified for a statutory privilege and subsequently had that privilege suspended or revoked. Both sections, however, provide for the same maximum penalty. A mandatory two-day detention imposed under \u00a7 61-5-212, MCA, represents the only distinction in the sentencing. Despite this discrepancy, we must be guided by giving effect to the legislative intent of the statutes. <em>Kloss, </em>\u00b6 10. A reasonable and sensible interpretation of the relevant statutory scheme leads us to conclude that a person who does not have a privilege to drive, either through a driver\u2019s license or statutory licensure exemption, cannot be charged with driving while their privilege has been suspended or revoked under \u00a7 61-5-212, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">\u00b616 We therefore reverse and remand with instructions to the District Court to vacate the drivers\u2019 convictions.</p>\n<judges id=\"b99-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, WARNER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
