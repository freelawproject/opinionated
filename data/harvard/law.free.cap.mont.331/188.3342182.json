We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-11\">\u00b62 The issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in denying Swan\u2019s amended petition for postconviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">\u00b63 In 1998, a jury found Swan guilty of deliberate homicide and the District Court sentenced him to a life term at the Montana State Prison without the possibility of parole. Swan appealed, raising the sole issue of whether the District Court violated his constitutional right to represent himself when it denied his motion to dismiss his court-appointed counsel and proceed to trial <em>pro se. </em>We concluded that the District Court did not err in denying Swan\u2019s motion because Swan\u2019s request to proceed <em>pro se </em>was not unequivocal, and affirmed his conviction. <em>State v. Swan, </em>2000 MT 246, \u00b6 25, 301 Mont. 439, \u00b6 25, 10 P.3d 102, \u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">\u00b64 In December of 2001, Swan filed a <em>pro </em>se petition for postconviction relief alleging that he had been denied effective assistance of counsel and a fair trial in the underlying proceeding. He also requested the appointment of counsel to represent him in the postconviction proceeding. Swan filed an amended postconviction relief petition in March of 2002, again acting <em>pro se </em>and alleging he was denied effective assistance of counsel and a fair trial. The District Court appointed counsel for Swan and, noting that Swan\u2019s earlier petition and amended petition were filed without the assistance of an attorney, ordered that newly-appointed counsel could file an amended petition if deemed necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">\u00b65 In December of2002, Swan\u2019s counsel filed an amended petition for postconviction relief alleging as grounds for relief that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-7\">Mr. Swan seeks post-conviction relief, in the form of a new trial, on the grounds that his original counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel when she failed to act on his request that she invoke his statutory right to an automatic substitution of judges, as provided by Mont. Code Ann. \u00a7 3-1-804, and when she openly opposed his motion to exercise his constitutional right to represent himself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">The District Court held a hearing and subsequently entered its opinion and order denying Swan\u2019s newly amended petition. Swan appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b214-10\">\u00b66 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a postconviction relief petition to determine whether the court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and its conclusions of law correct. <em>State v. Daniels, </em>2005 MT 110, \u00b6 7, 327 Mont. 78, \u00b6 7, 111 P.3d 675, \u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">\u00b67 Did the District Court err in denying Swan\u2019s amended petition for postconviction relief?</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">\u00b68 The District Court concluded Swan\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim based on trial counsel\u2019s opposition to his motion to represent himself was barred by \u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA, because the claim could have been raised in Swan\u2019s direct appeal. The court also concluded that Swan failed to establish prejudice with regard to counsel\u2019s alleged deficient performance in failing to move to substitute the trial judge after he requested her to do so. Swan asserts error as to both conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">\u00b69 Swan first argues the District Court erred in concluding that \u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA, barred his claim that trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by opposing his motion to represent himself. Section 46-21-105(2), MCA, provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-7\">[w]hen a petitioner has been afforded the opportunity for a direct appeal of the petitioner\u2019s conviction, grounds for relief that were or could reasonably have been raised on direct appeal may not be raised, considered, or decided in a [postconviction relief] proceeding....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">As stated in <em>State v. White, </em>2001 MT 149, \u00b6 12, 306 Mont. 58, \u00b6 12, 30 P.3d 340, \u00b6 12,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-9\">Where ineffective assistance of counsel claims are based on facts of record in the underlying case, they must be raised in the direct appeal and, conversely, where the allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel cannot be documented from the record in the underlying case, those claims must be raised by petition for pos(conviction relief.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-10\">\u00b6 10 Swan contends he could not have raised this ineffective assistance of counsel claim on direct appeal because the claim is dependent on facts not of record in the underlying criminal proceeding. We disagree. \u00b611 The District Court appointed counsel for Swan in the criminal proceeding. Swan subsequently moved to dismiss his court-appointed counsel and sought permission to proceed <em>pro se. </em>The transcript of the hearing on Swan\u2019s motion reflects that the District Court first questioned Swan regarding his desire to represent himself, and then asked Swan\u2019s counsel to comment. Defense counsel responded that she did not support Swan\u2019s motion because she believed Swan was not capable of representing himself in the deliberate homicide case.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-11\">\u00b612  \u201c[T]he definitive question that distinguishes and decides which [ineffective assistance] actions are record and which are non-record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>[based], is why? In other words, ... does the record fully explain <em>why </em>counsel took the particular course of action?\u201d <em>White, </em>\u00b6 20. Swan claims that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance in opposing his motion to proceed <em>pro se </em>because her duty of loyalty required that she support his motion to represent himself. The transcript from the hearing on this motion clearly establishes that defense counsel opposed Swan\u2019s motion to represent himself and stated why. Consequently, we conclude Swan\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in this regard is based on facts of record and could have been raised on direct appeal. \u00b613  Swan also contends that \u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA, does not bar this claim because he may argue that his appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise the issue in his direct appeal. Swan\u2019s argument, in its entirety, is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-4\">Although [counsel\u2019s] open opposition to self-representation was contained in the record on direct review, this Court has held that unpreserved appellate issues can be raised in the context of a post-conviction relief petition that alleges ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. <em>See Hagen v. State, </em>1999 MT 8, \u00b6\u00b6 40-41, 293 Mont. 60, \u00b6\u00b6 40-41, 973 P.2d 233, \u00b6\u00b6 40-41. Accordingly, the District Court erred when it concluded that Swan\u2019s postconviction argument was barred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Swan\u2019s argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">\u00b614  In <em>Hagen, </em>the petitioner set forth an ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claim. <em>See Hagen, </em>\u00b6 6. Here, as stated above, the only grounds for relief alleged in Swan\u2019s newly amended petition for postconviction relief were that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to move to substitute the District Court judge when he requested her to do so and opposing his motion to proceed <em>pro se. </em>The petition did not raise ineffective assistance of appellate counsel as a basis for postconviction relief. We conclude, therefore, that the District Court did not err in determining Swan\u2019s claim that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by opposing his motion to represent himself was barred by \u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">\u00b615 Swan next asserts error with regard to the denial of his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel based on trial counsel\u2019s failure to move for an automatic substitution of the trial judge. This ineffective assistance claim was not record-based and, as a result, the District Court addressed the claim on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">\u00b616 In analyzing claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, Montana courts apply a two-prong test which requires the defendant to establish that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient; the second prong requires <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>the defendant to establish that the deficient performance prejudiced him or her. To satisfy the prejudice prong, the defendant must demonstrate a reasonable probability that, absent defense counsel\u2019s errors, the outcome of the prosecution would have been different. <em>See State v. Cobell, </em>2004 MT 46, \u00b6 14, 320 Mont. 122, \u00b6 14, 86 P.3d 20, \u00b6 14. Both prongs of the test must be met, and a court is not required to address both prongs where an insufficient showing has been made on one. <em>Cobell, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">\u00b617 We have held that defense counsel\u2019s decision not to move for substitution of a trial judge may constitute ineffective assistance of counsel if the defendant establishes there is a reasonable probability that the outcome of the trial would have been different if counsel had moved for a substitute judge. <em>See Kills on Top v. State </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 32, 52, 901 P.2d 1368, 1381. In <em>Kills on Top, </em>we concluded prejudice had not been established. <em>Kills on Top, </em>273 Mont. at 52, 901 P.2d at 1381. Swan does not contend that he has established the prejudice prong relating to this ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Therefore, <em>Kills on Top </em>is of no assistance to Swan here.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">\u00b618 Swan argues, however, that trial counsel\u2019s failure to move to substitute the trial judge pursuant to \u00a7 3-1-804, MCA, after he requested her to do so constituted both deficient performance and structural error such that prejudice should be presumed. Because we reject Swan\u2019s \u201cpresumed prejudice\u201d argument, we need not address the deficient performance prong of this ineffective assistance claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">\u00b619 Since our decision in <em>Kills on Top, </em>we have clarified the distinction between structural error and trial error. <em>See State v. LaMere, </em>2000 MT 45, 298 Mont. 358, 2 P.3d 204; <em>State v. Van Kirk, </em>2001 MT 184, 306 Mont. 215, 32 P.3d 735. Trial error is error which typically occurs during the presentation of a case to the jury, is not presumptively prejudicial and, therefore, is subject to harmless error review. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 40. Structural error \u201cis typically of constitutional dimensions, precedes the trial, and undermines the fairness of the entire trial proceeding.\u201d <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 38. Structural error affects the very framework within which a trial proceeds and is presumptively prejudicial, requiring automatic reversal. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 38-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">\u00b620 Swan contends that his counsel\u2019s failure to move for substitution of the trial judge constitutes structural error because it occurred prior to the case being presented to the jury, was not evidentiary in nature and affected the very framework in which the trial proceeded. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">\u00b621 We observe at the outset that, while structural errors are those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>errors which typically occur prior to trial, not all pretrial error is deemed structural. We have held, for example, that a district court\u2019s error in denying a defendant his statutory right to plead guilty was trial error-notwithstanding that the error occurred prior to trial-because the error was not of constitutional dimensions and did not undermine the fairness of the trial proceeding. <em>State v. Peplow, </em>2001 MT 253, \u00b6 46, 307 Mont. 172, \u00b6 46, 36 P.3d 922, \u00b6 46. The defendant\u2019s right to plead guilty was conferred by statute, not guaranteed by the constitution. <em>Peplow, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 39 and 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">\u00b622 In contrast, we determined in <em>LaMere </em>that the statutes governing procedures for the random selection of trial jurors secured a defendant\u2019s fundamental constitutional right to an impartial jury. <em>LaMere, </em>\u00b6 38. Consequently, amaterial failure to substantially comply with those statutes was a constitutional error which was structural in nature. <em>See LaMere, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 39-50. In the present case, we conclude that defense counsel\u2019s failure to move for substitution of the trial judge under \u00a7 3-1-804, MCA, is more analogous to the error in <em>Peplow </em>because it was not an error of constitutional dimensions.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">\u00b623 Section 3-1-804(1), MCA, provides that each adverse party in a civil or criminal case is entitled to one substitution of a district judge. As long as the motion for substitution is timely filed pursuant to \u00a7 3-1-804(l)(c), MCA, the moving party is not required to specify a reason for the requested substitution. Alternatively, \u00a7 3-1-805, MCA, provides that a party may move for the disqualification of a judge for cause by filing \u201can affidavit alleging facts showing personal bias or prejudice of the presiding judge ...\u201d at any time prior to 30 days before the date of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">\u00b624  As Swan correctly observes, the lack of an impartial trial judge would be a constitutional error which is structural in nature and subject to automatic reversal. <em>See LaMere, </em>\u00b6 23 (citation omitted). Section 3-1-805, MCA, secures the constitutional right to an impartial trial judge by providing procedures under which a defendant may disqualify a trial judge for bias or prejudice. In this sense, \u00a7 3-1-805, MCA, is akin to the jury procurement statutes at issue in <em>LaMere. </em>Section 3-1-804, MCA, on the other hand, confers a right to an automatic substitution of a trial judge for any reason. It is a right originally conferred by order of this Court and subsequently codified. <em>See In re the Rules on the Disqualification and Substitution of Judges </em>(1987), 227 Mont. 31. Thus, as was the right to plead guilty in <em>Peplow, </em>the right to substitute a judge-for any reason or no reason at all-is not of constitutional dimension.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>\u00b625 As stated above, structural error \u201cis typically of constitutional dimensions, precedes the trial, and undermines the fairness of the entire trial proceeding.\u201d <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 38. These factors establishing structural error are stated in the conjunctive. In other words, if one of these factors is not established, the alleged error is not structural. Here, Swan has failed to establish that the alleged error is of constitutional dimension.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">\u00b626  We conclude that Swan\u2019s counsel\u2019s failure to timely move for an automatic substitution of the trial judge under \u00a7 3-1-804, MCA, did not constitute structural error and is not presumed to be prejudicial. Furthermore, as stated above, Swan has not established-and, indeed, does not contend-that his counsel\u2019s alleged deficient performance in this regard prejudiced him. As a result, we conclude that the District Court did not err in denying Swan\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">\u00b627  We hold that the District Court did not err in denying Swan\u2019s amended petition for postconviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">\u00b628 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b219-7\">JUSTICES COTTER, WARNER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b219-8\">JUSTICE LEAPHART</author>\n<p id=\"A6\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">\u00b629 The Court reaches a result that is inconsistent with our precedent concerning peremptory challenges to jurors. In addition, the Court has, without explanation, elevated an erstwhile \u201ctypical\u201d trait of structural error to the lofty status of a requisite component of structural error. \u00b630 If an error is structural, a defendant need not show prejudice since prejudice is presumed. The Court here, however, concludes that Swan must, pursuant to <em>Strickland, </em>establish that his attorney\u2019s \u201cfailure to move for substitution of the trial judge under \u00a7 3-1-804, MCA,\u201d prejudiced him \u201cbecause it was not an error of constitutional dimensions.\u201d \u00b6 22. The Court distinguishes \u00a7 3-1-804, MCA, which affords either party an opportunity to automatically obtain a substitute trial judge, from \u00a7 3-1-805, MCA, which allows a party to move for the disqualification of a trial judge for cause. The Court acknowledges that the lack of an impartial trial judge constitutes a constitutional error which rises to the level of a structural error, requiring automatic reversal. <em>LaMere, </em>\u00b6 23 (citing <em>Tumey v. Ohio </em>(1927), 273 U.S. 510, 47 S.Ct. 437, 71 L.Ed. 749). In concluding that the right to automatically substitute a trial judge \u201cis not of constitutional dimension,\u201d \u00b6 24, the Court necessarily, albeit implicitly, proposes that the availability or deprivation of this right has no bearing on the impartiality of the trial judge. Our prior holdings regarding a defendant\u2019s right to peremptorily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>challenge jurors, however, undermine this proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">\u00b631 We have held that structural error occurs if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-5\">(1) a district court abuses its discretion by denying a challenge for cause to a prospective juror;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-7\">(2) the defendant uses one of his or her peremptory challenges to remove the disputed juror; and</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">(3) the defendant exhausts all of his or her peremptory challenges. <em>State v. Good, </em>2002 MT 59, \u00b6 62, 309 Mont. 113, \u00b6 62, 43 P.3d 948, \u00b6 62; <em>State v. Freshment, </em>2002 MT 61, \u00b6 14, 309 Mont. 154, \u00b6 14, 43 P.3d 968, \u00b6 14. We reasoned that this effectively deprives the defendant of the right to exercise all of his or her peremptory challenges and concluded that \u201c[w]hen the State has more peremptory challenges than the accused, the State has an unmistakable tactical advantage and <em>the impartiality of the jury is compromised. </em>Errors which affect the impartiality of the jury are, by definition, structural and require reversal.\u201d <em>Good, </em>\u00b6 65 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-10\">\u00b632 A jury\u2019s impartiality is compromised whenever the State retains an opportunity \u2014 which the defendant is effectively denied-to automatically exclude a juror by exercising a peremptory challenge. This imbalance between the number of peremptory challenges compromises the jury\u2019s impartiality in a manner that is impossible to quantify. The impartiality of a judge is likewise compromised when the State, but not the defendant, is afforded the opportunity to automatically substitute a trial judge. The defendant alone is thus denied a means by which to ensure the judge\u2019s neutrality. Here, the inaction of Swan\u2019s counsel effectively deprived him of his statutory right to automatically substitute the trial judge, yet the State retained its right to do the same if it felt in any way disadvantaged by the judge\u2019s participation in the trial. This disparity compromises the impartiality of the judge just as a discrepancy in the number of peremptory challenges available to each party compromises the impartiality of a jury. Accordingly, it constitutes error that is both constitutional and structural and excuses Swan from having to establish prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-11\">\u00b633 Finally, I disagree with the Court that a structural error must be an error \u201cof constitutional dimensions.\u201d The Court correctly notes that a structural error \u201cis <em>typically </em>of constitutional dimensions,\u201d <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 38 (emphasis added), and then concludes that because \u201cSwan has failed to establish that the alleged error is of constitutional dimension,\u201d \u201cthe alleged error is not structural.\u201d \u00b6 25. The Court fails to explain why it has interpreted \u201ctypically\u201d to mean \u201calways.\u201d This strained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>interpretation allows the Court to affirm denial of Swan\u2019s petition without further substantive analysis. Regardless, I would hold that the shadow of partiality cast on the proceedings by Swan\u2019s inability to exercise his right to automatically substitute the judge constitutes structural error.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">\u00b634 I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
