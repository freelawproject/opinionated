After the jury rendered a defense verdict and the court entered a Judgment in favor of the State, Richardson filed a Motion requesting either an amended judgment or a new trial based on the State\u2019s abuse of the discovery process. Alternatively, Richardson sought a new trial based on the District Court\u2019s inconsistent rulings on the admission of evidence and argument regarding subsequent remedial measures. Richardson now appeals from the District Court\u2019s denial of the Motion. We reverse and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>remand for entry of an order vacating the Judgment in favor of the State, and for entry of default judgment against the State on the issue of liability, as a sanction for its abuse of the discovery process. Additionally, we remand for further proceedings to determine damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">\u00b62 While Richardson presents several arguments on appeal, we address only the following issue, which we find dispositive: Did the District Court err in denying Richardson\u2019s Motion to Amend the Judgment based on the State\u2019s conduct during discovery?</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">\u00b63 On October 26, 2001, Richardson attended a water aerobics class conducted in the pool at the Health, Physical Education and Recreation facility (HPER facility) on the campus of the Montana College of Technology located in Butte. Richardson was eighty-four years old at the time, and she attended the class along with other elderly participants. At the conclusion of the class, Richardson entered the women\u2019s locker room of the HPER facility where she fell on the smooth trowelled concrete floor and suffered a severe injury to her hip, requiring surgical reconstruction and months of rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">\u00b64 In the fall of2002, Richardson filed a Complaint against the State, which owns and operates the Montana College of Technology. She alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that the State had left the locker room floor in an \u201cunrepaired, unmarked, dangerous condition,\u201d ignoring the high probability that she would be injured as a result; that the State knew of this danger prior to her fall, but nonetheless failed to provide a warning or correct the danger; that she slipped and fell as a result of the State\u2019s failure to correct this dangerous condition and its failure to provide a warning; and that she suffered a severe injury as a result of the fall. Upon these contentions, Richardson sought recovery for her resulting medical expenses, as well as pain and suffering.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">\u00b65 In April of2003, Richardson served her first discovery requests on the State, seeking information regarding various subjects relevant to the lawsuit. Following the State\u2019s response, Richardson served her second discovery requests on the State on October 2, 2003. This included the discovery requests of primary importance in this appeal-an interrogatory and a request for production seeking information regarding other slip and fall accidents at the HPER facility. The other requests in this second stage of discovery primarily sought information regarding any warnings provided by the State about the floor in \u201cthe area of Plaintiffs fall,\u201d any protective measures which the State may have taken to prevent slip and fall injuries in that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>area, and information regarding the State\u2019s maintenance of the floor and the ventilation system in that area.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">\u00b66 The State refused to answer all ten interrogatories in this second set of discovery requests, repeatedly claiming that Richardson was seeking irrelevant information, that the requests were not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence, and that the requests were vague and ambiguous. Further, the State\u2019s counsel offered no legally recognized response to four of Richardson\u2019s six requests for production. Rather than answering or objecting to these requests, as required by Rule 34(b), M.R.Civ.P., the State simply labeled them as \u201cNot applicable,\u201d providing no further explanation. \u00b67 Richardson then sent a letter to the State, requesting an adequate response. After the State again refused to answer, Richardson filed a Motion to Compel Discovery in February of 2004, asking the District Court to require that the State provide answers, and seeking sanctions against the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">\u00b68 Thereafter, while still withholding the information regarding other falls, the State filed a Motion for Summary Judgment, arguing Richardson could not demonstrate that the State should have anticipated her injury. The State also filed a Motion <em>in Limine </em>seeking to prevent Richardson from making various arguments regarding the State\u2019s installation of \u201cgrip strips\u201d in the HPER facility. In its brief supporting this Motion, the State mentioned that it had begun installing \u201cgrip strips\u201d in the HPER facility \u201cshortly before Richardson\u2019s fall following a reported slip by another patron.\u201d The brief provided no details regarding this incident. Nonetheless, the State\u2019s counsel continued to withhold the information regarding other falls, maintaining, <em>inter alia, </em>that it was not relevant and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">\u00b69 In its brief opposing Richardson\u2019s Motion to Compel Discovery, the State attacked Richardson\u2019s numerous requests seeking information about \u201cthe area of Plaintiffs fall,\u201d asserting that the term \u201carea\u201d rendered the requests too vague and ambiguous to answer. At the hearing on Richardson\u2019s Motion, held on April 12, 2004, the State again argued that the term \u201carea\u201d was ambiguous. Additionally, the State continued to contest Richardson\u2019s requests for information regarding other falls. Eventually, however, the State\u2019s counsel voluntarily conceded during his argument that he could disclose the information regarding other falls in the women\u2019s locker room.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">\u00b610 The District Court stated that Richardson\u2019s requests could have been more specific, but ultimately characterized the conflict as a dispute over \u201clittle nuances\u201d and concluded \u201cAll the questions have to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>be answered. There\u2019s no question about that.\u201d Specifically addressing Richardson\u2019s requests for information regarding other falls in the HPER facility, the court stated that this information was discoverable and reminded counsel that a ruling on the admissibility of such evidence would be made at trial. Finally, in ordering the State to provide answers, the court offered to consider any objections regarding particular requests which the State considered \u201cnot answerable.\u201d Despite its previous claims that Richardson\u2019s requests were \u201cvague and ambiguous,\u201d the State did not respond to this offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">\u00b611 The next day, the District Court issued an Order granting Richardson\u2019s Motion to Compel Discovery, but denying her request for sanctions. This Order required Richardson to re-serve her discovery requests with \u201cmore clarity,\u201d but provided no specific instruction in this regard. Finally, the Order required the State to respond to Richardson\u2019s discovery requests within ten days of service.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">\u00b612 OnApril 19,2004, Richardson re-served her discovery requests on the State. In these requests, Richardson replaced the phrase \u201cthe area of Plaintiffs fall\u201d with \u201cthe women\u2019s locker room.\u201d As for Richardson\u2019s interrogatory and request for production seeking information regarding other falls, she re-served these requests without amending them, in accordance with the District Court\u2019s comments prompting the State to provide the information which Richardson had originally requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">\u00b613 Richardson received the State\u2019s responses on May 7, 2004. This time, the State provided answers to most of Richardson\u2019s requests. However, in direct violation of the District Court\u2019s Order, the State did not answer Richardson\u2019s interrogatory and request for production seeking information regarding other falls in the HPER facility. Once again, Richardson\u2019s counsel contacted the State\u2019s counsel, seeking answers. While still withholding the information regarding other falls, in violation of the court\u2019s Order, the State filed a Motion on May 11, 2004, asking the court to exclude evidence and argument regarding other falls. In its supporting brief, the State asked that the court grant this Motion because, <em>inter alia, </em>Richardson\u2019s expert had not tested the other areas of the locker room floor where other women had fallen. On May 12, 2004, Richardson filed her Preliminary Pre-trial Conference Brief, informing the District Court that the State had not yet responded to her discovery requests regarding other falls.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">\u00b614 Then, on May 13, 2004, over seven months after Richardson\u2019s initial request, over two months after discovery had closed, and a mere eleven days before trial, Richardson finally received a response to her originally submitted interrogatory and request for production <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>regarding other falls at the HPER facility. This response disclosed that in addition to Richardson\u2019s fall, eight other falls had occurred in the HPER facility during the several years previous and subsequent to Richardson\u2019s fall. Five of these falls occurred in the women\u2019s locker room, resulting in hip and back injuries, among others.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">\u00b615 Along with a brief description of these eight other falls and the resulting injuries, the State provided seven incident reports. Richardson informed the District Court that \u201c[t]he documents provided were poor copies, and legible copies had to then be requested of the State further consuming precious days before trial.\u201d The State does not contest this assertion. Moreover, the State\u2019s description of one of the incidents was inaccurate. Dorothy Honeychurch slipped and fell on the smooth trowelled concrete floor of the women\u2019s locker room less than a month before Richardson\u2019s accident. The State reported that Honeychurch claimed to have \u201cslipped on a rubber mat.\u201d However, the incident report states that she \u201cstepped off the mat a couple of steps\u201d before she slipped and fell.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">\u00b616 Another one of the women who slipped and fell in the locker room was Maire Pearson, the instructor of the water aerobics class. Her fall occurred just nine days before Richardson\u2019s fall. As a result, Pearson filled out an incident report explaining the circumstances of her fall and stating that she had injured her back. However, at her deposition Pearson testified that she did not know of any other falls which resulted in injury, other than Richardson\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">\u00b617 The District Court held a four day trial beginning on May 24, 2004. Evidence regarding other falls was admitted and discussed at length. By a vote of eight to four, the jury found that the State was not negligent. After the District Court rendered its Judgment in favor of the State, Richardson filed a Motion requesting that the court amend the Judgment by entering a default judgment on the issue of liability against the State, as a sanction for its discovery abuse. Alternatively, Richardson requested a new trial based on the State\u2019s discovery abuse. Richardson also sought a new trial based on the District Court\u2019s inconsistent rulings on the admission of evidence and argument regarding subsequent remedial measures. The District Court denied Richardson\u2019s Motion in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">\u00b618 On appeal, Richardson argues that the District Court should have granted the Motion by imposing a default judgment against the State. Alternatively, Richardson argues for a new trial with sufficient time for further discovery. Finally, Richardson also argues for a new trial based on the District Court\u2019s inconsistent rulings regarding the issue of subsequent remedial measures. We need not address the latter two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>arguments because, as explained below, the State\u2019s discovery abuses warrant imposition of a default judgment on the issue of liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">\u00b619 Did the District Court err in denying Richardson\u2019s Motion to Amend the Judgment based on the State\u2019s conduct during discovery?</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">\u00b620 Richardson argues that the State\u2019s objections to her discovery requests were without merit and were not made in good faith. Further, Richardson argues that this discovery abuse put her at a severe disadvantage. She notes that when this information was finally disclosed eleven days before trial, her counsel and her experts did not have time to adequately investigate the circumstances surrounding the other falls. As a result, Richardson argues, she was not able to properly prepare for trial and the State unfairly benefited by delaying discovery of this information. Thus, Richardson argues that the State\u2019s conduct was an abuse of the discovery process which warranted the imposition of a default judgment on the issue of liability. In response, the State asks that we defer to the District Court\u2019s ruling, arguing that the court did not abuse its discretion in denying Richardson\u2019s Motion to Amend the Judgment. However, the State provides no explanation as to how its objections to Richardson\u2019s discovery requests could have been proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">\u00b621 We review a district court\u2019s decision regarding the amendment of a judgment, as well as a decision regarding the imposition of sanctions for alleged discovery abuse, to determine whether the court abused its discretion. <em>Estate of Nielsen v. Pardis </em>(1994), 265 Mont. 470, 478, 878 P.2d 234, 238; <em>Schuff v. A.T. Klemens &amp; Son, </em>2000 MT 357, \u00b6 26, 303 Mont. 274, \u00b6 26, 16 P.3d 1002, \u00b6 26. In doing so, we generally defer to the district court because it is in the best position to determine both whether the party in question has disregarded the opponent\u2019s rights, and which sanctions are most appropriate. <em>Delaware v. K-Decorators, Inc., </em>1999 MT 13, \u00b6 86, 293 Mont. 97, \u00b6 86, 973 P.2d 818, \u00b6 86 (citing <em>McKenzie v. Scheeler </em>(1997), 285 Mont. 500, 506, 949 P.2d 1168, 1172). \u00b622 \u201cThe purpose of discovery is to promote the ascertainment of truth and the ultimate disposition of the lawsuit in accordance therewith. Discovery fulfills this purpose by assuring the mutual knowledge of all relevant facts gathered by both parties which are essential to proper litigation.\u201d <em>Massaro v. Dunham </em>(1979), 184 Mont. 400, 405, 603 P.2d 249, 252 (citing <em>Hickman v. Taylor </em>(1947), 329 U.S. 495, 507, 67 S.Ct. 385, 392, 91 L.Ed. 451). Modem instruments of discovery, together <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>with pre-trial procedures, \u201cmake a trial less a game of blindman\u2019s buff and more a fair contest with the basic issues and facts disclosed to the fullest practicable extent.\u201d <em>United States v. Procter &amp; Gamble Co. </em>(1958), 356 U.S. 677, 682, 78 S.Ct. 983, 986-87, 2 L.Ed.2d 1077 (citing <em>Hickman, </em>329 U.S. at 501, 67 S.Ct. at 388-89).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">\u00b623  The record before this Court clearly demonstrates that the State improperly concealed the evidence of other falls until the eve of trial by asserting baseless objections in response to Richardson\u2019s second set of discovery requests. This evidence was highly relevant and probative in the case, and it ultimately became a focal point of the trial. Further compounding this impropriety, the State aggressively pressed the advantage which it gained by this belated disclosure, repeatedly exploiting Richardson\u2019s lack of knowledge regarding the other falls and her inability to properly investigate and develop that evidence for trial. In short, the State\u2019s actions directly contravened the express purpose of discovery and severely undermined the integrity of the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">\u00b624 Rule 26(b)(1), M.R.Civ.P., provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-6\">Parties may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, which is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action, whether it relates to the claim or defense of the party seeking discovery or to the claim or defense of any other party, including the existence, description, nature, custody, condition and location of any books, documents, or other tangible things and the identity and location of persons having knowledge of any discoverable matter. It is not ground for objection that the information sought will be inadmissible at the trial if the information sought appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">Rule 33, M.R.Civ.P., authorizes the use of interrogatories for the purpose of pre-trial discovery from an adverse party. This rule is liberally construed to make <em>all relevant facts </em>available to parties in advance of trial and to reduce the possibilities of surprise and unfair advantage. <em>Perdue v. Gagnon Farms, Inc., </em>2003 MT 47, \u00b6 15, 314 Mont. 303, \u00b6 15, 65 P.3d 570, \u00b6 15 <em>(citing Eagle Ridge Ranch Ltd. Partnership v. Park County </em>(1997), 283 Mont. 62, 66, 938 P.2d 1342, 1344).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">\u00b625 Richardson submitted the following interrogatory in her second discovery requests:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-9\">INTERROGATORY No. 26: Please identify any other falls occurring anywhere in the HPER facility occurring at any time up to the date of these requests, including the date, location, identity of the victim, and injuries sustained in the fall.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>Given the nature of Richardson\u2019s claim against the State, the information she sought regarding other falls was clearly relevant in this case. Her Complaint alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that the State \u201cwas aware of the dangerous condition of the floor in the area where Plaintiff fell but did nothing to warn Plaintiff or correct the known danger.\u201d As the State acknowledged in its Motion for Summary Judgment, one of the primary issues in the case was whether the State should have anticipated her injury. The State quoted our holding in another case involving a slip and fall accident:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-4\">The possessor of the premises is not hable to persons foreseeably upon the premises for physical harm caused to them by any activity or condition on the premises whose danger is known or obvious to them, <em>unless the possessor should anticipate the harm </em>despite such knowledge or obviousness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-5\"><em>Richardson v. Corvallis Pub. School Dist. </em>(1997), 286 Mont. 309, 321, 950 P.2d 748, 755-56 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">\u00b626 Our decision in <em>Kissock v. Butte Convalescent Center, </em>1999 MT 322, 297 Mont. 307, 992 P.2d 1271, another case involving a slip and fall accident, clearly demonstrates that the information Richardson sought regarding other falls was not only relevant, but potentially admissible at trial. In <em>Kissock </em>we observed that \u201calthough evidence of prior accidents is not admissible for the purpose of proving negligence, such evidence is nevertheless admissible to show the existence of a danger or defect and notice or knowledge thereof.\u201d <em>Kissock, </em>\u00b6 15 (citing <em>Runkle v. Burlington Northern </em>(1980), 188 Mont. 286, 292, 613 P.2d 982, 986; <em>Schmidt v. Washington Contractors Group, Inc., </em>1998 MT 194, \u00b6 25, 290 Mont. 276, \u00b6 25, 964 P.2d 34, \u00b6 25). We also stated that \u201c[ejvidence of prior, similar accidents can have significant probative force bearing upon the question of the reasonableness of defendant\u2019s conduct.\u201d <em>Kissock, </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">\u00b627 We note that the State\u2019s counsel in this case also represented the defendant in <em>Kissock, </em>unsuccessfully arguing that the triad court had properly excluded evidence of another slip and fall accident. Despite our holdings in <em>Kissock, </em>counsel refused to disclose the information regarding other falls, claiming, <em>inter alia, </em>that it was \u201cirrelevant and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">\u00b628  Rule 401, M.R.Evid., defines relevant evidence as \u201cevidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d This rule, together <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>with <em>Richardson </em>and <em>Kissock, </em>demonstrates the impropriety of the State\u2019s relevance objection. The evidence of other falls was clearly relevant to the issues of whether a danger did in fact exist, whether the State had knowledge of the danger, whether the State\u2019s conduct was reasonable in light of any such knowledge, and whether the State should have anticipated Richardson\u2019s injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">\u00b629 Even if the State\u2019s counsel believed in good faith that the evidence of other falls would not be admitted at trial, the State was not entitled to conceal it under the guise of a relevance objection and thereby deprive Richardson of the opportunity to evaluate the evidence and determine whether to seek its admission. Moreover, the State was not entitled to preempt the District Court\u2019s discretion regarding the admission of such evidence. Yet, the State attempted to do so, despite the fact that it cited <em>Kissock </em>in a pre-trial Motion for the proposition that district courts have \u201cbroad discretion regarding the admission of evidence of other falls.\u201d <em>See Kissock, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">\u00b630 Rule 26(b)(1), M.R.Civ.P., states \u201c[i]t is not ground for objection that the information sought will be inadmissible at the trial if the information sought appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.\u201d Here, the evidence of other falls clearly could have led to the discovery of admissible evidence-i.e., it would have provided Richardson the identity of other individuals who had fallen and therefore could have provided relevant testimony. We find no merit in the State\u2019s objection that the evidence of other falls was not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">\u00b631 Perhaps the clearest indication of the impropriety of the relevance objection came directly from the State itself. Before the hearing on Richardson\u2019s Motion to Compel Discovery, the State filed a Motion seeking, <em>inter alia, </em>to prevent Richardson from making various arguments regarding the State\u2019s installation of \u201cgrip strips\u201d in the HPER facility. In its supporting brief, the State noted that it had begun installing \u201cgrip strips\u201d in the HPER facility \u201cshortly before Richardson\u2019s fall following a reported slip by another patron.\u201d The brief provided no details regarding this incident. However, the fact that this incident was significant enough to warrant a place in the State\u2019s brief demonstrates both that the evidence of other falls was indeed relevant, and that the State saw the evidence as relevant. Nonetheless, the State continued to withhold the information regarding other falls, maintaining that it was not relevant and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">\u00b632 Given the States voluntary reference to another fall during the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>pre-trial proceedings, together with the State\u2019s acknowledgment that it could be held liable if it should have anticipated Richardson\u2019s injury, as well as counsel\u2019s direct involvement <em>inKissock </em>wherein we held that evidence of other falls is admissible for certain purposes,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we can only conclude that the relevance objection was not asserted in good faith. This conclusion is reinforced by the fact that the State, in its brief before this Court, does not even attempt to justify its objection that the evidence of other falls was \u201cirrelevant and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">\u00b633 In response to four of Richardson\u2019s remaining nine interrogatories, the State asserted this same objection. These interrogatories sought, <em>inter </em>alia, information regarding any protective measures which the State may have taken to prevent slip and fall injuries, and information regarding any changes made to the floor and the ventilation system in the area of Richardson\u2019s fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">\u00b634 For example, Richardson submitted the following interrogatory: \u201cPlease identify any protective measures taken prior to, or after Plaintiffs fall to prevent injuries from slipping on the floor, including the date of commencement of the actions to institute the protective measures, the date of completion of said project, and a detailed description of the actions taken.\u201d In response, the State again refused to provide an answer, claiming that the information sought was \u201cirrelevant and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">\u00b635  Of course, information regarding any protective measures the State may have taken to prevent slip and fall accidents was highly relevant in determining whether the State should have anticipated Richardson\u2019s injury. Indeed, the State\u2019s installation of \u201cgrip strips\u201d in certain areas of the women\u2019s locker room was discussed at length during the trial. We note that the State was entitled to argue against the admission of evidence of subsequent remedial measures at trial pursuant to Rule 407, M.R.Evid., which precludes the use of such evidence for the purpose of proving negligence. However, this rule does not preclude the admission of such evidence when it is offered for other purposes, such as proving the feasibility of precautionary measures. More importantly, this evidentiary rule does not preclude the discovery of subsequent remedial measures. Accordingly, the State was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>entitled to withhold relevant evidence of subsequent remedial measures during discovery pursuant to Rule 407, M.R.Evid.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">\u00b636 We conclude that the State\u2019s repeated claim that the information sought was \u201cirrelevant and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence\u201d was a plain abuse of the discovery process. Moreover, the indefensible nature of these objections is underscored by the fact that the State provides this Court with no explanation as to how any of these objections could have been meritorious.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">\u00b637 In refusing to answer Richardson\u2019s interrogatory seeking information regarding other falls, the State also claimed \u201cthis interrogatory is overly broad, oppressive and burdensome.\u201d We find no support for this objection in the record. When the State finally answered this interrogatory, it provided one page with a few sentences summarizing each of the other falls. As these summaries were merely a brief recitation of the information contained in the incident reports, it appears that the State was not burdened with any extensive investigation or compilation work in providing the information. Further, the State provides no explanation as to how the preparation of these summaries could possibly be considered \u201coppressive and burdensome.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">\u00b638 Nor does the State explain how this interrogatory was \u201coverly broad.\u201d We note that during the hearing on Richardson\u2019s Motion to Compel Discovery the State seemed to suggest that Richardson\u2019s interrogatory was overly broad because it sought information regarding falls throughout the HPER facility, not just falls in the women\u2019s locker room. Of course, the State was entitled to seek exclusion, for certain purposes, of any falls which occurred under circumstances different than those of Richardson\u2019s fall. However, the State was not entitled to withhold the information regarding all slip and fall accidents simply because some of them occurred outside the women\u2019s locker room.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">\u00b639 Finally, the State refused to provide information regarding other falls based on its claim that Richardson had exceeded the number of interrogatories which may be served without leave of the court. The State also asserted this objection in refusing to answer three other interrogatories which sought information regarding any protective measures the State may have taken, any warnings the State may have provided, and any changes made to the floor or ventilation system in the locker room since its original construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">\u00b640 Rule 33(a), M.R.Civ.P., provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-9\">Unless otherwise ordered or stipulated, no party may serve on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>any other party more than 50 interrogatories in the aggregate. Each subpart shall be counted as a separate interrogatory. Additional interrogatories may be submitted for good cause only by leave of court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">In opposing Richardson\u2019s Motion to Compel Discovery, the State asserted that based on the number of subparts in Richardson\u2019s interrogatories, \u2018beginning with Interrogatory No. 23, Richardson had exceeded the fifty interrogatory limitation.\u201d However, the State provided no explanation as to how it had determined the number of subparts in Richardson\u2019s interrogatories. Nor does the State provide any such explanation on appeal. Having examined Richardson\u2019s interrogatories, we find no basis for this objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">\u00b641 Richardson\u2019s first discovery request contained a set of interrogatories which her counsel numbered from one to sixteen. Richardson\u2019s counsel numbered her second set of interrogatories from seventeen to twenty-six. Several of the interrogatories in Richardson\u2019s first discovery requests contained two sentences, while two of these interrogatories contained three sentences. However, even if we count each sentence in all these requests as a separate interrogatory,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Richardson did not exceed fifty interrogatories.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">\u00b642 It appears that the State may have counted separate clauses within the interrogatories as \u201csubparts,\u201d and therefore, separate interrogatories. For example, the State may have counted Richardson\u2019s request for the names of all expert witnesses to be called at trial, the subject matter about which the witnesses would testify, and the literature upon which the experts would rely, as three separate interrogatories. However, this interrogatory was merely one sentence with multiple clauses, as were nearly all of Richardson\u2019s requests. \u00b643 While Rule 33(a), M.R.Civ.P., does not define the term \u201csubpart,\u201d common sense dictates that one sentence containing three clauses does not constitute three separate interrogatories. Moreover, only a selective count of the different clauses in Richardson\u2019s interrogatories would support the State\u2019s objection. Richardson\u2019s first discovery requests included over fifty clauses in roughly her first twelve interrogatories alone. Yet, the State did not assert that she had exceeded fifty interrogatories until the request which she designated as \u201cInterrogatory No. 23.\u201d Needless to say, recipients of interrogatories are not entitled to object based on a selective count of the various <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>clauses contained in the requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">\u00b644 We note that the District Court implicitly rejected the State\u2019s claim that Richardson had exceeded fifty interrogatories. The State asserted this objection in its brief opposing Richardson\u2019s Motion to Compel Discovery. However, the court ordered the State to answer Richardson\u2019s requests without addressing the objection. Similarly, we conclude that the State\u2019s objection was without merit, and was an abuse of discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">\u00b645 In addition to her interrogatory seeking information regarding other falls, Richardson served the State with a request for production seeking any writings documenting these falls. Although possessing at least seven incident reports documenting other falls, the State merely answered \u201cNot applicable,\u201d providing no explanation for this response. The State provided the same response to four of Richardson\u2019s six requests for production. However, the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure do not allow for such a response.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">\u00b646 Rule 34(a), M.R.Civ.P., provides that a party may utilize requests for production to facilitate discovery of documents, in accordance with the scope of discovery as specified in Rule 26(b), M.R.Civ.P. Rule 34(b), M.R.Civ.P., requires that a party served with a request for production must either state that it will accommodate the request, or assert an objection and state the reason therefore. Here, the State did neither. In addition to this violation of Rule 34(b), M.R.Civ.P., the State also violated the District Court\u2019s subsequent Order requiring the State to answer Richardson\u2019s requests. Then, after one more prompting by Richardson\u2019s counsel, the State delayed disclosure again before finally providing the incident reports eleven days before trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">\u00b647 On appeal, the State provides no explanation for its violation of Rule 34(b), M.R.Civ.P. Given the State\u2019s purported belief that Richardson had improperly served more than fifty interrogatories, perhaps the State believed that it could simply stop answering her requests for production as well. However, while parties are limited to serving fifty interrogatories without leave of the court, no such limit applies to requests for production. Given this plain and repeated violation of Rule 34(b), M.R.Civ.P., and the State\u2019s failure to justify these violations, we conclude that the State\u2019s conduct was an abuse of discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">\u00b648 The State did object to one of Richardson\u2019s requests for production. This request stated: \u201cPlease produce a true and correct copy of any maintenance records relating to the area of Plaintiffs fall for the five years prior to Plaintiffs fall.\u201d In response, the State claimed that this request was \u201cvague and ambiguous,\u201d and that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>sought information that was not relevant and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. The State also asserted this \u201cvague and ambiguous\u201d objection in response to six of Richardson\u2019s ten interrogatories, including the following two: (1) \u201cPlease identify any efforts taken to warn patrons or the public of the potential for slip hazards in the area of Plaintiff s fall.\u201d; and (2) \u201cPlease identify any warnings provided at the time of, or after Plaintiffs fall intended to prevent injuries from slipping on the floor in the area of Plaintiffs fall.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">\u00b649 In its brief opposing Richardson\u2019s Motion to Compel Discovery, the State asked the District Court to sustain its \u201cvague and ambiguous\u201d objections, arguing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-5\">The State\u2019s objection was based on its inability to determine whether Richardson intended the word \u201carea\u201d in the discovery requests to be limited to the precise location in the locker room where Richardson allegedly fell, the locker room itself or whether Richardson sought discovery concerning the entire facility. ... [I]f the State interpreted area to mean the entire facility, then the discovery seeks information wholly unrelated to the location of Richardson\u2019s accident and which is not relevant to the issue of whether the floor in the women\u2019s locker room is unreasonably dangerous. Because Richardson did not define the term and because she used it where it could have several different meanings, the State had no choice but to assert its vague and ambiguous objection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">Indeed, the term \u201carea,\u201d standing alone, could have \u201cseveral different meanings.\u201d However, the term was not standing alone in Richardson\u2019s discovery requests. Richardson sought information regarding the \u201carea <em>of Plaintiffs fall.\u201d </em>Further, the phrase \u201carea of Plaintiffs fall\u201d was used in the context of a slip and fall case.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">\u00b650 We wholeheartedly disagree with the State\u2019s claim that it \u201chad no choice but to assert its vague and ambiguous objection.\u201d In reality, the State could have chosen to cooperate and facilitate discovery by reading the term \u201carea\u201d in context. Instead, however, the State inserted artificial ambiguity into the term and thereby refused to provide answers. Moreover, the State\u2019s strained interpretation of the term \u201carea\u201d is clearly disingenuous given that one of the State\u2019s own prior interrogatories served on Richardson sought information regarding the \u201careas\u201d involved in the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">\u00b651 We note that when Richardson re-served her discovery requests on the State following the District Court\u2019s Order granting her Motion to Compel Discovery, she amended them by replacing the phrase \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>area of Plaintiffs fall\u201d with \u201cthe women\u2019s locker room.\u201d We can detect no difference in clarity between the original requests and the amended requests. In fact, the phrase \u201cthe women\u2019s locker room\u201d could be interpreted as a broader area than \u201cthe area of Plaintiff s fall.\u201d Yet, the State answered the amended requests pursuant to the District Court\u2019s Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">\u00b652 We conclude that it was simply unreasonable to interpret Richardson\u2019s requests for information regarding \u201cthe area of Plaintiff s fall\u201d as possibly seeking \u201cinformation wholly unrelated to the location of Richardson\u2019s accident.\u201d Thus, the State was not entitled to withhold relevant evidence based upon this interpretation. When an interrogatory can reasonably be interpreted, in the context of the claims and defenses at issue, as seeking discoverable information, the recipient of the interrogatory must interpret it that way rather than imputing some meaning to the request which would render it vague, ambiguous, or objectionable in some other respect. If litigants were allowed to do otherwise, the discovery process would not serve its purpose. Discovery rules can not possibly be written with the precision necessary to specify what information is discoverable in every type of case. Hence, these rules are written in general terms, imposing a broad duty of disclosure. Moreover, the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure require a good faith effort in serving discovery responses. <em>See </em>Rules 11 and 26(g), M.R.Civ.P.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Simply put, recipients of discovery requests are not entitled to indulge in such unrealistic interpretation as the State did here.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">\u00b653 While the State\u2019s objections to Richardson\u2019s discovery requests were an abuse of discovery, the State\u2019s subsequent conduct was particularly egregious. Prior to the hearing on Richardson\u2019s Motion to Compel Discovery, the State filed a Motion for Summary Judgment. As noted above, the State acknowledged in this Motion that it could be found liable if it should have anticipated Richardson\u2019s injury. However, the State argued that it was entitled to summary judgment because Richardson could not demonstrate that the State should have anticipated her injury. The State was still withholding the evidence of other falls at this point and thus Richardson was forced to defend against the Motion without the benefit of that information. As the evidence of other falls was highly relevant to the issue of whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>State should have anticipated Richardson\u2019s injury, it is clear that the State was exploiting Richardson\u2019s lack of knowledge regarding this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">\u00b654 Thereafter, the State further exploited Richardson\u2019s lack of knowledge regarding the other falls by filing a Motion <em>in Limine </em>seeking to exclude that evidence before ever disclosing it to Richardson. Even worse than this preemptive tactic, however, was the State\u2019s argument, in its brief supporting the Motion, that the evidence of other falls should be excluded because Richardson\u2019s expert had not tested the areas of the locker room floor where other women had fallen. Of course, without the information regarding the other falls, Richardson was denied the opportunity to have her expert investigate them. Incredibly, when it filed this Motion, the State was still in violation of the District Court\u2019s Order granting Richardson\u2019s Motion to Compel Discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">\u00b655 Before discussing the issue of sanctions, we must note that the State\u2019s conduct undermined the chances of settlement. Without the information regarding other falls, Richardson was unable to fully evaluate the merits of her claim. Placing a litigant in this situation substantially reduces the chances of settlement. This is of significant importance because, as we have observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-6\">\u201cThe law favors compromises. This is especially true in tort actions, not only because they relieve the labors of courts, and avoid expense, but also because, where the parties agree between themselves upon a settlement of the claim, the result reached is frequently a more equitable adjustment than is possible to be had in a court of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-7\"><em>Durden v. Hydro Flame Corp., </em>1999 MT 186, \u00b6 20, 295 Mont. 318, \u00b6 20, 983 P.2d 943, \u00b6 20 (quoting <em>Black v. Martin </em>(1930), 88 Mont. 256, 269-70, 292 P. 577, 581). Thus, when the State withheld the evidence of other falls, it undermined the litigation by reducing the chances of settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">\u00b656 This Court strictly adheres to the policy that dilatory discovery actions shall not be dealt with leniently. <em>Morris v. Big Sky Thoroughbred Farms, </em>1998 MT 229, \u00b6 13, 291 Mont. 32, \u00b6 13, 965 P.2d 890, \u00b6 13 (citing <em>Owen v. F.A. Buttrey Co. </em>(1981), 192 Mont. 274, 278, 627 P.2d 1233, 1235). As we have said, the trial courts, and this Court on review, must remain intent upon punishing transgressors rather than patiently encouraging their cooperation. <em>Morris, </em>\u00b6 13 (citing <em>Owen, </em>192 Mont. at 278, 627 P.2d at 1235). Accordingly, the imposition of sanctions for failure to comply with discovery procedures is regarded with favor. <em>Schuff, </em>\u00b6 71 (citing <em>McKenzie, </em>285 Mont. at 506, 949 P.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>at 1172). \u201cIt is, after all, a maxim of our rules of discovery that the price for dishonesty must be made unbearable to thwart the inevitable temptation that zealous advocacy inspires.\u201d <em>Schuff, </em>\u00b6 71 (citing generally <em>Eisenmenger v. Ethicon, Inc. </em>(1994), 264 Mont. 393, 406, 871 P.2d 1313, 1321; <em>Owen, </em>192 Mont. at 280, 627 P.2d at 1236).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">\u00b657 We have adopted this policy of intolerance regarding discovery abuse pursuant to our \u201cconcern over crowded dockets and the need to maintain fair and efficient judicial administration of pending cases.\u201d <em>Delaware, </em>\u00b6 87 (citing <em>McKenzie, </em>285 Mont. at 506, 949 P.2d at 1171). As we have observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-5\">\u201cLitigants who are willful in halting the discovery process act in opposition to the authority of the court and cause impermissible prejudice to their opponents. It is even more important to note, in this era of crowded dockets, that they also deprive other litigants of an opportunity to use the courts as a serious dispute-settlement mechanism.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-6\"><em>First Bank (N.A.)-Billings v. Heidema </em>(1986), 219 Mont. 373, 376, 711 P.2d 1384, 1386 (quoting <em>G-K Properties v. Redevelopment Agency of City of San Jose </em>(9th Cir. 1978), 577 F.2d 645, 647).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">\u00b658 We have held that some discovery abuses warrant imposition of a default judgment on the issue of liability. In <em>Schuff, </em>we affirmed the district court\u2019s imposition of a default judgment against the defendant on the issue of liability, as a sanction for discovery abuses. <em>Schuff, </em>\u00b6 82. In doing so, we noted that the defendant\u2019s inadequate discovery responses prohibited the plaintiff from conducting meaningful follow-up discovery. <em>Schuff, </em>\u00b6 78. In <em>Culbertson Health Care Corp. v. JP Stevens &amp; Co. Inc., </em>2005 MT 254, 329 Mont. 38, 122 P.3d 431, we also affirmed the district court\u2019s imposition of a default judgment against the defendant on the issue of liability, as a sanction for discovery abuse. <em>Culbertson, </em>\u00b6 21. In doing so, we noted that the defendant\u2019s unresponsiveness during discovery prevented the plaintiff from assessing the merits of the proffered defenses and building its case-in-chief, forcing the plaintiff to incur mounting litigation costs while proceeding under a cloud of uncertainty. <em>Culbertson, </em>\u00b6 18 (citing <em>Patterson v. State, Dept. of Justice, </em>2002 MT 97, \u00b6 21, 309 Mont. 381, \u00b6 21, 46 P.3d 642, \u00b6 21) (\u201cCommon sense and fundamental fairness suggest that no party should be forced to proceed under such a \u2018cloud of uncertainty.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">\u00b659 Here, the effects of the State\u2019s conduct were similar to the prejudice which we observed in <em>Schuff </em>and <em>Culbertson. </em>The State\u2019s concealment of the evidence of other falls prevented Richardson from assessing the merits of the State\u2019s proffered defenses and building her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>case-in-chief. Additionally, the State\u2019s belated disclosure prevented Richardson from conducting meaningful follow-up discovery in time for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">\u00b660 The State emphasizes the fact that Richardson did not seek a continuance in order to further prepare, despite the District Court\u2019s offer to postpone the trial for one month. However, it was the State\u2019s improper concealment of evidence which directly caused Richardson\u2019s predicament. As Richardson states, \u201cexpensive plane tickets were purchased, witnesses were located and under subpoena, experts and counsel arranged their calendars months prior to ensure dedicated dates for trial.\u201d Richardson further notes that she \u201cfaced losing thousands of dollars in costs getting ready for trial ... and re-doing expensive, time-consuming discovery due to the State\u2019s previous concealment of obviously discoverable facts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">\u00b661 Richardson was indeed faced with a no-win situation \u2014 i.e., either proceed to trial without fully investigating and developing the evidence of other falls, or incur the needless expense and hassle of continuing the trial and conducting further preparation which could have been achieved earlier with timely disclosure from the State. As the State\u2019s improper conduct was the sole cause of this predicament, the State will not now be heard to criticize Richardson for choosing one of two undesirable options.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">\u00b662  In denying Richardson\u2019s Motion to Amend the Judgment, the District Court concluded that the State did not abuse the discovery process. We conclude, however, that the State\u2019s conduct, as detailed above, was a blatant abuse of discovery. Accordingly, we hold that the District Court abused its discretion in denying Richardson\u2019s Motion. \u00b663 The purpose of the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure is to \u201csecure the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action.\u201d Rule 1, M.R.Civ.P. Here, the State\u2019s discovery abuse directly undermined each of these three objectives. Achieving a just determination is contingent upon full disclosure. As we have stated, \u201c[mjutual knowledge of all the relevant facts gathered by both parties is essential to proper litigation.\u201d <em>State Highway Comm\u2019n v. District Court </em>(1966), 147 Mont. 348, 357, 412 P.2d 832, 837. Achieving a speedy and inexpensive determination is contingent upon timely disclosure, which is thwarted by protracted legal wrangling over semantic nuances and technicalities.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">\u00b664 The first sentence in the Preamble of the Montana Rules of Professional Conduct states that \u201c[a] lawyer shall always pursue the truth.\u201d This case is the poster-child for how that principle is frustrated by abusive discovery tactics. The State asserted objections which were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>without merit, and in many cases hyper-technical and not legally recognized, needlessly increasing the cost of litigation by forcing Richardson to file and orally argue a Motion to Compel Discovery. Further, the State concealed the evidence of other falls until eleven days before trial. Finally, the State sought strategic advantage through its improper concealment by exploiting Richardson\u2019s lack of knowledge regarding the other falls. Indeed, because of the State\u2019s unwillingness to participate in good faith in discovery, countless hours of counsel\u2019s time and judicial resources were wasted. The jury\u2019s function in our civil justice system was effectively nullified. And, most importantly, the Plaintiff was deprived of a meaningful day in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">\u00b665  Generally, it is up to the trial court to decide the proper sanction for discovery abuse. While we continue to adhere to this principle, there are exceptional cases where only one sanction can properly address the conduct at issue. Because the State\u2019s discovery abuse here was so blatant and systematic, and because it undermined the integrity of the entire proceeding, the only proper sanction is a default judgment on the issue of liability, just as we approved in <em>Schuff </em>and <em>Culbertson. </em>Any less severe sanction would be inconsistent with the rule that punishment for discovery abuses must be made unbearable in order to thwart the inevitable temptation which zealous advocacy inspires. <em>See Schuff, </em>\u00b6 71.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">\u00b666 We approved a similar sanction in <em>Jerome v. Pardis </em>(1989), 240 Mont. 187, 783 P.2d 919, a personal injury case where the plaintiff failed to provide correct and complete answers to the defendant\u2019s discovery requests seeking information regarding the plaintiffs medical history. <em>Jerome, </em>240 Mont. at 188-90, 783 P.2d at 920-21. In accordance with our strict policy of non-leniency toward discovery abuse, the district court dismissed Jerome\u2019s case with prejudice. <em>Jerome, </em>240 Mont. at 190, 783 P.2d at 921. In doing so, the court \u201cfound that the discovery tactics pursued by the plaintiff had caused substantial prejudice to defendants that could not be corrected without defendants incurring considerable expense, particularly in re-deposing physicians who had relied on incomplete medical records.\u201d <em>Jerome, </em>240 Mont. at 190, 783 P.2d at 921. We concluded that dismissal with prejudice was an appropriate sanction and stated that the plaintiffs conduct \u201cwould create an unreasonable burden and increased expense to Pardis in re-deposing witnesses whose prior testimony was given without the benefit of the improperly withheld information.\u201d <em>Jerome, </em>240 Mont. at 193, 783 P.2d at 923.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">\u00b667 Similarly here, remanding for a new trial would require Richardson to incur the unnecessary expense of additional discovery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>and trial preparation, including the expense of re-deposing expert witnesses whose prior deposition testimony was given without the benefit of the information regarding other falls. This is an unreasonable burden on any litigant, and it is particularly inappropriate here given Richardson\u2019s advanced age. Moreover, remanding for a new trial would be inconsistent with the policy reason underlying the law\u2019s intolerance toward discovery abuse-i.e., \u201cthe concern over crowded dockets and the need to maintain fair and efficient judicial administration of pending cases.\u201d <em>Delaware, </em>\u00b6 87 (citing <em>McKenzie, </em>285 Mont. at 506, 949 P.2d at 1171). The State has improperly delayed Richardson\u2019s opportunity for a fair resolution of her claim, and any further delays resulting from the State\u2019s discovery abuse would simply be unjust.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">\u00b668  In <em>Schuff, </em>we recognized that the principle of \u201ctrial on the merits\u201d weighs against the imposition of a default judgment. <em>Schuff, </em>\u00b6 81. However, we proceeded to affirm the default judgment because the defendant\u2019s actions outweighed this principle. <em>Schuff, </em>\u00b6 81. Specifically, we noted that the defendant \u201cwillfully and in bad faith shielded Schuff from a clear view of the truth, and simply did not \u2018speak\u2019 the truth itself when required by our rules of discovery.\u201d <em>Schuff, </em>\u00b6 81. Similarly here, we conclude that the State\u2019s pattern of willful and bad faith conduct outweighs the general preference for trial on the merits. Simply put, the State demonstrated clear disregard for a resolution on the merits when it improperly concealed important evidence by asserting frivolous objections, and subsequently sought to gain strategic advantage thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">\u00b669 We reverse the District Court\u2019s Order denying Richardson\u2019s Motion to Amend the Judgment. Further, we remand for the entry of an order vacating the Judgment entered in favor of the State, and for entry of a default judgment against the State on the issue of liability, as well as further proceedings to determine damages.</p>\n<judges id=\"b275-7\">JUSTICES COTTER, WARNER, LEAPHART and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b265-7\"> Of course, we are not suggesting that an attorney may be excused for asserting an improper objection if he or she does not know the relevant law. Rule 26(g), M.R.Civ.P., requires counsel to conduct a reasonable inquiry into the law before objecting to a discovery request.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b267-7\"> We do not reach the issue of whether interrogatories containing more than fifty sentences violate the \u201csuhpart\u201d provision of Rule 33(a), M.R.Civ.P.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b270-6\"> <em>See also </em>Rule 3.4(d) of the Montana Rules of Professional Conduct, stating that a lawyer shall not fail to make reasonably diligent effort to comply with a legally proper discovery request.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
