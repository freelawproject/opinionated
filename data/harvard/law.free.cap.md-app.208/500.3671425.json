The trial court sentenced appellant on July 15, 2011, imposing concurrent sentences of four and five years respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-14\">Appellant filed a timely appeal and presents the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-15\">1. Did the trial court err in denying Appellant\u2019s motion to suppress his statement to police?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>2.

Did the trial court err in permitting the State to play an audiotape of alleged telephone calls from prison by Appellant in the absence of proper authentication?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">For the reasons set forth below, we shall affirm the judgments of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">Background <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">\n<em>Hearing on Motion to Suppress</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b525-10\">Appellant filed a pre-trial motion to suppress pursuant to Md. Rule 4-252. A hearing on this motion was conducted, at which Detective Kevin McConnell of the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department testified.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Detective McConnell testified that on November 4, 2010, members of a drug enforcement task force executed a search warrant at 825 Marcy Avenue in Oxon Hill, and recovered crack cocaine, marijuana and associated paraphernalia.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b525-11\">Appellant gave a statement while in police custody, and the appellant moved to suppress his statement. At the hearing on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>the pre-trial motion to suppress, Detective McConnell\u2019s testimony provided the context in which the statement was given:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-4\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: It says here at 8:24 on November 4th, 8:24 in the morning, Mr. Joyner was advised of his rights. How did you ascertain that that was the time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-5\">[THE WITNESS]: We were in the process of transporting Mr. Joyner to the correctional facility and we were in an unmarked vehicle. My partner, [an] ATF Special Agent ... was driving. Mr. Joyner and I were seated in the back seat. He was handcuffed. And en route, he started the conversation. I stopped him as he began to speak, you know, thinking that he was going to give some information, and I wanted to do things properly. So I stopped him, advised him of his rights and noted the time on my Sprint telephone. So it was approximately 8:24 hours.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Now, there\u2019s an arrest report here in which they report that you are the arresting officer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-7\">[THE WITNESS]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: A Prince George\u2019s County report. And they\u2019re saying the time of the arrest was 8:26 in the morning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-9\">[THE WITNESS]: Okay. Like I said, it was approximate. I wasn\u2019t familiar with the P.G. County computer system that was operating, and I had one of the correctional officers ... that was assisting me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-10\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-11\">THE COURT: I think we moved from the search warrant to the statement. And the issue is what time was the statement given.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-12\">[THE WITNESS]: The statement was given in the car on the way to transporting. The arrest paperwork was filled out at the correctional facility some time later after 8:50 hours, because that\u2019s what time that pretty much the conversation stopped in reference to me advising him of his rights and him making statements to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Now, was there any attempt made to get a written waiver from Mr. Joyner?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-5\">[THE WITNESS]: Like I said, he was handcuffed in a vehicle that was equipped to transport prisoners. It was just a four door unmarked sedan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-6\">And while we were doing the arrest paperwork at the computer terminal, after we set down at the terminal, we had no more contact with Mr. Joyner. He was off being processed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I see. So, basically, did anybody else witness these statements besides you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-8\">[THE WITNESS]: Myself and Special Agent [ ] with the ATF.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: He is not available today, I take it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-10\">[THE WITNESS]: No, he isn\u2019t, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-11\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Now, you have various comments written down here, and some of them that could be termed as incriminating.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-12\">[THE WITNESS]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-13\">On cross-examination by the prosecutor, Detective McConnell explained how appellant was advised:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-14\">Just verbally. I stated to him basically stating the obvious, that he\u2019s in handcuffs, being transported, he\u2019s under arrest. He\u2019s not free to go, and that he had a right to remain silent. Anything he said could be used against him in court. He has a right to an attorney. If he wants to talk to us now and answer questions, he can do so. He can stop answering at any time. Just, you know, just verbally. Also, that if he started answering questions and got to a question that he didn\u2019t want to answer, we would just move on. Or we might not have any questions for him at all and he can just tell me what happened today and what brought him here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-15\">Detective McConnell testified that appellant had no questions about his rights, and that he had never asked to speak <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>with an attorney. Appellant responded affirmatively when the Detective McConnell asked whether he understood everything. The detective also raised the possibility of cooperation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMs\">When I had finished up at approximately 8:50 hours, I told him at some later point in time, if he wanted to get with his attorney and do some work for us, his attorney will get with the State\u2019s Attorney and maybe we could work something out.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">On re-direct examination by defense counsel, Detective McConnell emphasized that his recitation of the Miranda<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> rights \u201ccovered all the major points.\u201d He was certain of this because he\u2019s \u201cread it several times. I know you don\u2019t have to\u2014it doesn\u2019t have to be read verbatim, but you do have to cover all the major points in it. It doesn\u2019t have to be done in any specific order. You just have to cover all the bases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">After the detective\u2019s testimony, defense counsel maintained that the appellant\u2019s statements to the detectives should be suppressed. Defense counsel argued that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-7\">Regarding the statements of Mr. Joyner, Mr. Joyner was not asked to\u2014was not asked at any point in time for any kind of written waiver, although that is the normal course definitely for the authorities in this area, in Prince George\u2019s County. And anybody who would be acting on their behalf, which I\u2019m taking this task force to be acting in their behalf. And that\u2019s the standard that tells us that somebody has intelligently waived their rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-8\">Secondly, the fact is even Detective McConnell admits\u2014I hope I got that right\u2014admits that the statements themselves were not delivered in a classic form that had been approved by authorities but, instead, were given more or less in a more informal manner, perhaps sounding somewhat piecemeal and without any real assurance that they were all given or that Mr. Joyner would have known what exactly he was doing, nor that he would have received a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>warning that would have made him realize that the things he was saying were being recorded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-5\">And I think the fact is the testimony did indicate at some point he talked about contact with President Obama, which indicated the lack of seriousness with which he was holding the conversation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-6\">For that reason, I submit that Mr. Joyner did not have an intelligent waiver of his rights, and we ask the Court to suppress the statements he made that the state now wish to use against him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">Following argument from the prosecutor, defense counsel added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-8\">Your Honor, just that I think the procedural safeguard is really what we\u2019re arguing herein that what Prince George\u2019s County has found to be a proper procedural safeguard was not followed in this case. And basically what we\u2019re saying is that we have to take the word of a person and that proper procedures which would assure us that the protections were provided have not been followed in both cases. Both in the deliverance of any possible Miranda-style warning[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">The motions court denied appellant\u2019s motions to suppress. The court explained its ruling as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-10\">As for the statements made in the back of the police car, while not exactly a blurt, in fact not a blurt, it may have started out that way. Eventually, the advisement to the defendant who apparently was not the first time he heard those words, certainly not on TV, understood clearly what he was saying. And when the police detective began writing it down, he got a little apprehensive and stopped. Outside of that, I see no legal reason whatsoever to grant the motion to suppress at this point.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-11\">\n<em>Trial Testimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b529-12\">Shawn Arthur testified as an agent for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (\u201cBATF\u201d). He was on duty on November 4, 2010 at about 6:00 a.m., participating in the execution of a search warrant at 825 Marcy Avenue, Apart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>ment T-3, in Oxon Hill. Agent Arthur recounted that, upon entering the apartment he encountered appellant and \u201ctook [him] into custody.\u201d The agent then searched the hallway closet and the kitchen area, and recovered $600 in United States currency from the pocket of an Eddie Bauer winter coat. He also located a digital scale on the top right shelf of a kitchen cabinet.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">James Harris testified as an Agent with the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department. Agent Harris also participated in the execution of the search warrant at the apartment where the appellant was arrested. Appellant was the only adult male in the apartment when Agent Harris entered, although there was a woman and children present. He located \u201cmultiple empty Ziploc bags\u201d and discovered an additional Ziploc bag in a breadbox on the top of the refrigerator that contained what Agent Harris thought was a substance that smelled like marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">Officer Jaime Dega testified as a member of the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department. Officer Dega was also involved in the execution of the warrant at the Marcy Avenue. He searched the master bedroom of the house and uncovered a loaded rifle magazine from a drawer in the dresser.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Kevin McConnell testified as a member of the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He participated in the execution of the search warrant on November 4, 2010 at 825 Marcy Avenue. The warrant had been issued for the search for and seizure of marijuana. He first saw appellant when he, along with a Ms. Walker, was coming out of the larger of two bedrooms in the rear of the apartment. There was an infant in a crib in that bedroom, and two other children. Detective McConnell took the infant out of the crib, and returned to that bedroom, where he found a large paper shopping bag sitting on a small table. He testified that the \u201cbag was open\u201d and that it contained a \u201c[g]reen weedish substance wrapped up in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>smaller zips, and a white rock substance and even smaller Zips packaged up.\u201d The small bags contained marijuana and what appeared to be a \u201cwhite rock substance.\u201d There was \u201cmoney on the table\u201d in the larger bedroom and \u201canother Ziploc of green weed substance[.]\u201d According to Detective McConnell, \u201c[i]t was all surrounding the shopping bag with the green weed substance and the Ziplocs and the smaller things.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">The police transported appellant to the police station. Detective McConnell rode with him in an unmarked car and advised appellant of his rights. Appellant made some statements during this interval, and initially admitted that the drugs were his. Detective McConnell testified that when police questioned him in the house, appellant had given them a false name because he \u201chad a probation warrant.\u201d Appellant also admitted to Detective McConnell that he was \u201cjust selling it.\u201d He also acknowledged that the jacket from which the $600 in currency had been recovered, as well as the money, belonged to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">Special Agent William Smith serves with the BATF, and assisted in the execution of the search warrant at the Marcy Road apartment on November 4. He seized what appeared to be marijuana and crack cocaine that was discovered in the apartment. Baggies of marijuana and a brown paper bag that contained marijuana were recovered from a \u201cmaster bedroom TV stand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">The State then called Nicole Edwards to the stand. Ms. Edwards is a senior forensic chemist with the Drug Enforcement Administration. Over objection, Ms. Edwards was accepted as an expert in forensic chemistry. Based on the analyses she performed, Ms. Edwards concluded that the contraband that had been recovered consisted of cocaine base and marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">Officer Christopher Schultz, who was accepted as an expert in \u201cidentification, packaging, valuation, [and] distribution for crack cocaine and marijuana,\u201d also testified. Having reviewed the evidence, he concluded that it \u201cis indicative of possession <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>with the intent to distribute both the marijuana and the crack cocaine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">We shall recite additional facts as appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">Appellant first questions the motions court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress the statement he made to Officer Kevin McConnell. He maintains that the motions court erred because the record does not establish that Officer McConnell advised him that he would be entitled to appointed counsel at no expense. The State counters that appellant has failed to preserve this issue because it had not been raised below. We agree with the State and explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">In <em>Carroll v. State, </em>202 Md.App. 487, 32 A.3d 1090 (2011), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>428 Md. 679, 53 A.3d 1159 (2012), this Court ruled that the defendant in that case, Carroll, had waived his claim that the circuit court erred by refusing to suppress his post-arrest statements. Carroll\u2019s attorney originally filed a pre-trial motion pursuant to Md. Rule 4-252(a), but then withdrew his challenge to the admission of the disputed statements. We declined to review this issue because Carroll had waived it. Our explanation merits extensive quotation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-9\">Pursuant to Md. Rule 4-252(a), a claim regarding \u201c[a]n unlawfully obtained admission, statement, or confession,\u201d \u201cshall be raised by motion\u201d prior to trial, and if not so raised, it is waived, absent a showing of good cause. This Court has explained that a failure to raise a suppression issue below constitutes a waiver in several contexts: (1) if the defendant fails to comply with the time requirements for filing a motion under the rule; (2) if the defendant files a notice but fails to pursue it; and (3) if there is a hearing on the motion, but the defendant fails to present any grounds to support the motion. <em>Jackson v. State, </em>52 Md.App. 327, 331-32, 449 A.2d 438, <em>cert. denied, </em>294 Md. 652 (1982). <em>Accord Perry v. State, </em>344 Md. 204, 227, 686 A.2d 274 (1996) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>(defendant waived suppression issue by failing to raise it prior to trial), <em>cert. denied, </em>520 U.S. 1146, 117 S.Ct. 1318, 137 L.Ed.2d 480 (1997). Neither party cites a case addressing whether plain error review applies in the context of the failure to raise a suppression issue subject to the rule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-4\">In <em>Kohr v. State, </em>40 Md.App. 92, 98, 388 A.2d 1242, <em>cert. denied, </em>283 Md. 735 (1978), this Court stated that the Court of Appeals decided, \u201cas a matter of judicial policy,\u201d to make Rule 736, the predecessor to Rule 4-252, parallel to Rule 12 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure (\u201cFed. R.Crim. P.\u201d). We stated: \u201cBoth rules are identical in that they require that motions to suppress be filed pre-trial and both consider a failure to raise timely objections to the admissibility of unlawfully seized evidence to constitute a waiver.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-5\">Because the Maryland rule is parallel to the federal rule, we look to federal decisions addressing the effect of a failure to raise a suppression issue pursuant to Fed.R.CrimP. 12. Several courts have analyzed in detail whether such a failure constitutes: (1) a forfeiture subject to plain error review; or (2) a waiver that cannot be reviewed absent good cause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-6\"><em>Carroll, </em>202 Md.App. at 509-11, 32 A.3d 1090 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">It is noteworthy that while Carroll had withdrawn his challenge to the admission of the statements in that case, we also concluded in that case that the failure to advance a specific argument before the circuit court would likewise foreclose appellate review. We surveyed several federal cases that interpreted the federal analogue to Rule 4-252(a), Fed. R.CrimP. 12, and concluded that \u201cif a defendant fails to raise a ground seeking suppression of evidence, which is required to be raised pre-trial by Rule 4-252, the defendant has waived his or her right to appellate review of that issue.\u201d <em>Carroll, </em>202 Md.App. at 513, 32 A.3d 1090. We thus made no distinction between waiver or forfeiture of an issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>It is long-established that \u201c[f]orfeiture is the failure to make a timely assertion of a right, whereas waiver is the \u2018intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right.\u2019 \u201d <em>Savoy v. State, </em>420 Md. 232, 240, 22 A.3d 845 (2011) (quoting <em>State v. Rich, </em>415 Md. 567, 580, 3 A.3d 1210 (2010) (in turn quoting <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 733, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993))). In the usual case, a forfeited objection could still be the subject of plain error review, while an issue that had been waived results in procedural default in every instance. Unlike the situation in <em>Carroll, </em>where the defense withdrew a suppression challenge, appellant in this case failed to assert a specific argument that he now advances on appeal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The issue of forfeiture is squarely before this Court, and thus a review of selected authorities that are relevant to this issue is useful.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">In <em>United States v. Rose, </em>538 F.3d 175 (3d Cir.2008), Judge Thomas Ambro introduced the Third Circuit\u2019s discussion of this aspect of procedural default:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-5\">This case raises a procedural issue that has nagged our Court for decades and for which we have unwittingly given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>conflicting answers: whether a criminal defendant who failed to raise a reason to suppress evidence before the District Court may raise the reason on appeal. We conclude that he cannot absent good cause: such a suppression issue is waived under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 12, which trumps Rule 52(b)\u2019s plain error standard in the context of motions to suppress. For this reason and others, we affirm the conviction of Larken Rose for five counts of failure to file personal income tax returns.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-4\"><em>United States v. Rose, </em>588 F.3d 175, 176 (3d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Rose had been convicted of failure to file personal income tax returns. Acting <em>pro se, </em>Rose moved to suppress physical evidence that had been seized during a search of his home, and offered four grounds for his challenge before the district court. Represented by counsel on appeal, Rose advanced different contentions. These theories differed from those urged in the district court, and, as noted by the Third Circuit, \u201c[a]ll of the suppression issues that Rose raises on appeal are new[.]\u201d <em>Rose, </em>538 F.3d at 177. The court of appeals explained why it would not entertain Rose\u2019s new appellate assertions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-6\">In our Court, suppression issues raised for the first time on appeal are waived absent good cause under Rule of Criminal Procedure 12. Although a few of our opinions have inadvertently applied plain error review under Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(b), for the reasons stated below, we do not find these cases to be controlling. Further, the Criminal Rules\u2019 text, their history, and pertinent policy considerations direct a waiver approach. Thus, a suppression issue not raised in the District Court is waived absent good cause, and we accordingly affirm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-7\"><em>Rose, </em>538 F.3d at 177 (citations omitted). The court considered Fed.R.CrimP. 12(b)(3), which, like Md. Rule 4-252(a), lists certain motions that must be made before trial, and Fed.R.CrimP. 12(e), which governs waiver as a consequence for a party\u2019s failure to advance a timely Rule 12(b)(3) mandatory motion. The Third Circuit addressed the tension be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>tween the Rule 12(e) waiver provision and the federal plain error rule, Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b), holding that the specific waiver provision of Rule 12 controls a party\u2019s failure to file a mandatory Rule 12(b)(3) motion <em>or </em>advance an argument below that is congruent with its appellate claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-5\">Though each of Rule 52(b) and Rule 12 appears applicable when read alone, when considered together we believe Rule 12\u2019s waiver provision must prevail. The latter is much more specific than is Rule 52(b); while Rule 52(b) states generally that \u201c[a] plain error that affects substantial rights may be considered even though it was not brought to the court\u2019s attention,\u201d Rule 12(e) singles out motions to suppress, stating that a \u201cparty waives any [suppression] defense, objection, or request not raised by the [pretrial] deadline the court sets.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In this context, \u201cwe apply the well-settled maxim that specific statutory provisions prevail over more general provisions.\u201d <em>Chavarria v. Gonzalez, </em>446 F.3d 508, 517 (3d Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus we avoid \u201capplying a general provision when doing so would undermine limitations created by a more specific provision.\u201d <em>Varity Corp. v. Howe, </em>516 U.S. 489, 511, 116 S.Ct. 1065, 134 L.Ed.2d 130 (1996).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-6\">Rose counters that Rule 12\u2019s use of the term \u201cwaives\u201d is arguably at odds with the Supreme Court\u2019s definition of \u201cwaiver\u201d in Olano\u2014the \u201cintentional relinquishment or abandonment of a right.\u201d <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 733, 113 S.Ct. 1770. Per this argument, failure to comply with Rule 12 could be seen as more akin to a forfeiture\u2014an inadvertent \u201cfailure to make the timely assertion of a right\u201d\u2014that would result in plain error review rather than a waiver. <em>Id. </em>Rule 12\u2019s history, however, indicates that its text means what it says. As previously noted, in 1974 the Rules were changed to require\u2014with an explicit threat of waiver\u2014that motions to suppress be raised prior to trial in accordance with the district court\u2019s desired timetable. In 2002, well after <em>Olano, </em>the waiver provision of section (f) was moved to section (e) and its text was revised, but the Advisory Committee kept the term \u201cwaiver\u201d in place. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 12 advisory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>committee\u2019s note to 2002 amendments. Had the drafters thought that term outdated in light of <em>Olano </em>or other precedent, they could have changed the term to \u201cforfeiture,\u201d but they did not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-4\"><em>United States v. Rose, </em>538 F.3d at 182-83. The court built on this rationale with the recognition that there exist prudential concerns for an application of a waiver analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-5\">Allowing a defendant to raise a suppression issue for the first time on appeal absent good cause carries substantial costs that are not outweighed by any attendant benefits. If a defendant has not raised a suppression issue before the district court, the Government (under an assumption that its proffered evidence was admissible) may plausibly conclude during trial that it does not need to accumulate and introduce additional evidence to prevail. Moreover, on appeal the Government has lost its chance to introduce valuable evidence in opposition to the suppression motion. And we agree with the <em>Chavez-Valencia </em>Court <em>[United States v. Chavez-Valencia, </em>116 F.3d 127 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>522 U.S. 926, 118 S.Ct. 325, 139 L.Ed.2d 252 (1997)] that a choice of plain error review over a waiver approach would do little, if anything, to further the deterrent effect of the exclusionary rule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-6\"><em>Id., </em>538 F.3d at 183.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">In <em>United States v. Burke, </em>633 F.3d 984 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 131 S.Ct. 2130, 179 L.Ed.2d 919 (2011), the Tenth Circuit held that the defendant waived suppression arguments that had not been presented before the district court. Writing for the federal intermediate appellate court, Judge Tymkovich pointed out that the Tenth Circuit has held, on the strength of the waiver provision set forth in Fed. R.CrimP. 12(e), that \u201c[w]hen a motion to suppress evidence is raised for the first time on appeal,\u201d it \u201cmust decline review.\u201d <em>Burke, </em>633 F.3d at 987 (citing <em>United States v. Brooks, </em>438 F.3d 1231, 1240 (10th Cir.2006)). Yet application of the waiver provision was not limited to the failure to file a mandatory motion; a failure to raise a specific argument before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>district court would also preclude appellate review. The Tenth Circuit added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-4\">We have also held \u201cthis waiver provision applies not only to the failure to make a pretrial motion, but also to the failure to include a particular argument in the motion.\u201d <em>United States v. Dewitt, </em>946 F.2d 1497, 1502 (10th Cir.1991); <em>see United States v. Banks, </em>451 F.3d 721, 727 (10th Cir.2006) (explaining the general rule that if a party fails to raise a specific argument in a suppression hearing they waive that argument on appeal); <em>see also United States v. Rose, </em>538 F.3d 175, 185 (3d Cir.2008) (\u201cUnder Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 12, a federal criminal defendant is barred, absent good cause, from raising a reason to suppress evidence for the first time on appeal. This conclusion finds support in the Criminal Rules\u2019 text, their history, our Court\u2019s case law, and the policy underlying Rule 12.\u201d); <em>United States v. Pope, </em>467 F.3d 912, 918-19 (5th Cir.2006) (\u2018We have also held that failure to raise specific issues or arguments in pre-trial suppression proceedings operates as a waiver of those issues or arguments for appeal.\u201d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">In <em>United States v. Walker, </em>665 F.3d 212 (1st Cir.2011), the defendant asserted, for the first time on appeal, that the indictment was defective. The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit ruled that Walker\u2019s challenge was barred. Judge Selya explained for the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-6\">Under the Criminal Rules, a defendant must challenge a perceived defect in an indictment before the commencement of trial. Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(b)(3)(B). A failure to mount such a challenge within the prescribed time frame constitutes a waiver. Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(e). This is not a judicial gloss; Rule 12(e) itself uses that precise terminology.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-7\"><em>United States v. Walker, </em>665 F.3d at 227.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">The First Circuit went on to explain that procedural default in this context differs from the usual waiver-forfeiture distinction, and reached a result that squares with our Court in <em>Carroll:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>To be sure, this is not a typical \u201cwaiver.\u201d Waiver normally involves the intentional relinquishment of a known right. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Carrasco-de-Jes\u00fas, </em>589 F.3d 22, 26 (1st Cir.2009). \u201cForfeiture\u201d is the term that is normally used to describe an unexplained failure to make a timely assertion of a right. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 733, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). This distinction can be important. Waived objections cannot be reviewed on appeal (save for the rare case in which a reviewing court, as a matter solely of its discretion, forgives the waiver), whereas forfeited objections are reviewable for plain error.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-4\">It is an open question in this circuit whether the words \u201cwaiver\u201d and \u201cwaives,\u201d as used in Rule 12(e), should be taken literally. Several other courts of appeals have pondered this question. The majority view is that a party\u2019s failure to raise Rule 12(b)(3) defenses prior to trial\u2014such as a challenge to the form of an indictment\u2014constitutes a waiver in the classic sense and, thus, precludes appellate review of the defaulted challenge. A few circuits, however, have treated such defaults as forfeitures and engaged in plain error review.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-5\">We believe that Rule 12(e) says what it means and means what it says. Great weight must be given to the plain language of the rule, particularly since Congress amended it in 2002 (after the Supreme Court had made the distinction between waiver and forfeiture pellucid) and left the \u201cwaiver\u201d terminology intact. See Fed.R.Crim.P. 12 advisory committee\u2019s notes; <em>see also Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 733, 113 S.Ct. 1770 (explaining waiver/forfeiture distinction). What is more, the matters that fall within the compass of Rule 12(b)(3) (and thus Rule 12(e)) are normally correctable before trial if seasonably brought to the attention of the district court and the government. It strikes us as manifestly unfair for a defendant to sit silently by, take his chances with the jury, and then be allowed to ambush the prosecution through a post-trial attack. Accordingly, we join the majority view and hold that a failure to challenge a defect in an indictment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>before trial, as required by Rule 12(b)(3), results in an unreviewable waiver of that challenge pursuant to Rule 12(e). Because the appellant did not raise either duplicity or multiplicity challenges at any time prior to trial, he has waived those challenges.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-5\"><em>United States v. Walker, </em>665 F.3d at 227-28 (some citations and footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Finally, the First Circuit observed that a defendant may avoid procedural default if \u201cgood cause\u201d can be shown. Both in that case, and in the case before us, neither Walker in that case nor appellant in the present case attempted to justify the failure to advance a necessary challenge or raise a specific argument before the trial court. Indeed, in the case before us, appellant has not attempted to demonstrate \u201cgood cause\u201d in a reply brief, even though alerted by the State\u2019s response that procedural default was at issue. Judge Selya\u2019s conclusion on this point is instructive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-7\">This framework does not risk a miscarriage of justice due to the presence of a key exception: if a defendant can show \u201cgood cause\u201d for a failure to raise a Rule 12(b)(3) challenge prior to trial, that challenge may be entertained by the district court and reviewed on appeal. See Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(e). Here, however, the appellant did not make a good cause argument in the district court at any time, and he has not made a cognizable showing of good cause in this court. Given these circumstances, there is no unfairness in holding him to his waiver.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-8\"><em>United States v. Walker, </em>665 F.3d at 228 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">We reiterate that this Court has explained that a failure to raise a suppression issue at the trial level constitutes a waiver in several contexts: (1) if the defendant fails to comply with the time requirements for filing a motion under the rule; (2) if the defendant files a notice but fails to pursue it; and (3) if there is a hearing on the motion, but the defendant fails to present any grounds to support the motion. <em>Carroll, supra, </em>202 Md.App. at 510 (citing <em>Jackson v. State, </em>52 Md.App. 327, 331-32, 449 A.2d 438, <em>cert. denied, </em>294 Md. 652 (1982)); <em>Perry </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number><em>v.

In fact, it is arduous to discern any grounds or basis for appellant\u2019s motion to suppress from the motions hearing transcript. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s contention is not preserved for appellate review because appellant raises this argument for the first time at the appellate level.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As illustrated by the federal decisions discussed above, and cognizant that their interpretations of Fed.R.CrimJP. 12(e) have informed analyses of Md. Rule 4-252(b), we conclude that appellant\u2019s specific challenge to the admission of his statement has been waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">Appellant next complains of the circuit court\u2019s refusal to permit the defense to present the testimony of appellant\u2019s mother, Shanda Collins. We see no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">Following the close of the State\u2019s case, the trial court asked the defense whether it would put on a case. This issue arose in the following context:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>THE COURT: All right.

I asked the defense do you have any evidence, any witnesses you wish to call and your answer to my question is whom?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-26\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t hear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>THE COURT: Who is it that you intend to call?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I\u2019m calling Ms. Shanda Collins. Her relationship is she\u2019s the mother of the Defendant and is also the person that he lived with in that period of time, lived with prior to his incarceration and lived with for a period of time, and she will be able to rebut that Mr. Joyner was a resident in that household.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-6\">THE COURT: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-7\">[PROSECUTOR]: State is objecting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-8\">THE COURT: Basis?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-9\">[PROSECUTOR]: Improper notice. It\u2019s not just a rebuttal. It\u2019s also\u2014it\u2019s also an alibi witness which I mean</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-10\">THE COURT: He\u2019s not saying that. She\u2019s not an alibi because he\u2019s not saying that the Defendant wasn\u2019t there at the time that all of this happened. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an alibi witness, but go ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-11\">[PROSECUTOR]: In addition, he has not provided State notice of this witness which conforms with the discovery rules which is 30 days prior to the first trial date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-12\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Well, in point of fact, Your Hon- or, had the State not made an argument and an implication that Mr. Joyner was, in fact, a resident of that household, there would have been no need to call Ms. Collins.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-13\">THE COURT: Certainly that\u2019s no surprise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-14\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And, secondly, we feel it is in the interest of justice for her to be able to establish the residence of Mr. Joyner and in point of fact, him being incarcerated and Ms. Collins not having a phone, we really did not have any measure of being able to get ahold of her until she actually came in yesterday.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-15\">[PROSECUTOR]: Your Honor, my understanding is that this witness is the Defendant\u2019s mother. That seems like a witness that\u2019s in his control and that he could have easily accessed by even subpoena to come to the trial date. Even in defense opening, he even mentioned that he did not live there. So the fact is this is not something that\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>this theory is not based on something that the evidence unfolded at trial. He already knew that the issue is whether or not he was there, had knowledge of the substance in that apartment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ahd\">So waiting till the last hour to call this witness is extremely prejudicial to the State. It\u2019s not in the voir dire and the State never got formally a written notice and this is actually the third trial date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And, in fact, in the previous two trial dates, Ms. Collins was not available. Also, Ms. Collins is a resident of the District of Columbia which would make a subpoena something she could ignore if she were so\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-6\">THE COURT: There are certainly ways to serve people in the District of Columbia. Cumbersome I agree, but it\u2019s doable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And, finally, her not having a phone, the Defendant not being sure where she is and the Defendant being incarcerated throughout the entirety of the pretrial, since November 4th and today, we\u2019ve had no ability to contact Ms. Collin\u2014contact Ms. Collins with any sense of a surety that we could. In fact, I have not been able to contact her. She appeared yesterday, came back today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-8\">THE COURT: Is that her in the back of the courtroom?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-10\">THE COURT: That\u2019s not Ms. Coffins?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-11\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-12\">THE COURT: All right. Anything else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-13\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: That\u2019s it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-14\">THE COURT: All right. You didn\u2019t notify them. You concede that you didn\u2019t notify them beforehand, nor was she mentioned in voir dire, so I\u2019m not going to let her testify.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-15\">Following this exchange, appellant testified on his own behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-16\">Appellant insists that the trial court ran afoul of the Court of Appeals\u2019s decisions in <em>Taliaferro v. State, </em>295 Md. 376, 456 A.2d 29 (1983), and <em>Colter v. State, </em>297 Md. 423, 466 A.2d 1286 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>(1983), by applying a \u201chard and fast\u201d rule and failing to consider any alternatives to the strict preclusion of the testimony at issue or address any of the discretionary factors set forth in <em>Taliaferro. </em>The State counters that the trial court acted within its discretion by precluding the testimony of a witness who had not been disclosed as required. We conclude that, assuming the trial court abused its discretion, or even failed to exercise it, any misstep by the trial court was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Maryland Rule 4-263 governs discovery in circuit court.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This Court recently set forth the appropriate standard pertaining to the appellate court\u2019s review of the trial court\u2019s consideration of a discovery violation and its application of a remedy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-6\">We review a trial court\u2019s finding of a discovery violation under the clearly erroneous standard. \u2018When reviewing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>circuit court\u2019s imposition of sanctions for discovery abuse, we are bound to the court\u2019s factual findings unless we find them to be clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Klupt v. Krongard, </em>126 Md.App. 179, 193 [728 A.2d 727] (1999). \u201cOur scope of review is narrow and our function is not to substitute our judgment for that of the fact finder, even if we might have reached a different result.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Instead, we must \u201cdecide only whether there was sufficient evidence to support the trial court\u2019s findings. In making this decision, we must assume the truth of all the evidence, and of all the favorable inferences fairly deducible therefrom, tending to support the factual conclusions of the lower court.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-5\">\u201cWhen considering the actual imposition of discovery sanctions, our review is narrower still.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We review the granting of a motion in limine for discovery sanctions under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Saxon Mortgage. Servs. v. Harrison, </em>186 Md.App. 228, 252, 973 A.2d 841, 854-55 (2009) (citing <em>Lowery v. Smithsburg Emergency Med. Serv., </em>173 Md.App. 662, 674, 920 A.2d 546 (2007)). We entrust trial judges \u201cwith a large measure of discretion in applying sanctions for discovery violations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations omitted). The Court of Appeals has identified five factors <em>(\u201cTaliaferro </em>factors\u201d) that a trial court must consider when exercising its discretion to exclude evidence disclosed in violation of the discovery rules:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-6\">(1) whether the disclosure violation was technical or substantial;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-7\">(2) the timing of the ultimate disclosure;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-8\">(3) the reason, if any, for the violation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-9\">(4) the degree of prejudice to the parties respectively offering and opposing the evidence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-10\">(5) whether any resulting prejudice might be cured by a postponement and, if so, the overall desirability of a continuance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-11\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Taliaferro v.

Little, </em>206 Md.App. 414, 433, 49 A.3d 333 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">The Court\u2019s decision in <em>Colter v. State, </em>297 Md. 423, 466 A.2d 1286 (1983) is instructive. In <em>Colter v. State, </em>the trial judge applied the discovery sanction \u201cas a mandatory rule excluding the testimony of an undisclosed alibi witness upon the failure of the defendant to comply with the notice requirement.\u201d <em>Colter, </em>297 Md. at 430, 466 A.2d 1286. The Court of Appeals expressed concern over the trial court\u2019s actions because it was apparent that the \u201ctrial judge had not exercised the discretion granted him under the [discovery] rule[,]\u201d and awarded Colter a new trial. <em>Id. </em>at 430-31, 466 A.2d 1286.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">In the case before us, the trial court excluded the testimony of Ms. Collins because her name had not been provided to the State and she had not been listed in <em>voir dire. </em>Although the trial court gave more than a passing consideration of the violation and the appropriate remedy, it appears that, on these facts, the trial court did not explicitly discuss all of the <em>Taliaferro </em>factors before excluding the testimony of this defense witness. <em>See Schneider, supra, </em>206 Md.App. at 435-38, 49 A.3d 333. Nevertheless, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">Recently, the Court of Appeals restated the well-established rule for harmless error analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-8\">[W]hen an appellant, in a criminal case, establishes error, unless a reviewing court, upon its own independent review of the record, is able to declare a belief, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error in no way influenced the verdict, such error cannot be deemed \u201charmless\u201d and a reversal is mandated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-9\"><em>Morris v.

In that context, we are satisfied that the evidence that was properly admitted demonstrates a compelling case for the State because it adequately ties appellant to the drugs. In his statement, appellant acknowledged that he sold the marijuana. Even though he joked that the President was his supplier, appellant went into detail by stating that he did not cut the contraband, but merely sold it. Although, in making a motion for judgment of acquittal, appellant argued that the police had to search for the drugs (implying that the State failed to establish any link between appellant and the contraband), officers observed some of the contraband in open view. Appellant sought Ms. Collins\u2019s testimony to prove that appellant did not reside at the Marcy Road apartment, and thus undermine the State\u2019s case. Given the strength of the evidence, including appellant\u2019s concession to Detective McConnell, we are satisfied that the erroneous exclusion of this witness did not affect the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">Appellant next complains of the trial court\u2019s decision to permit the State to present the testimony of an expert witness, Ms. Edwards, whose identity as an expert was disclosed just prior to trial. This issue arose when defense counsel filed a motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude Ms. Edward\u2019s testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Michel Figus on behalf of Mr. Joyner. Your Honor, the defense has a motion in limine at this time. As we look at the witness list that was provided to us today, we see chemist Nicole Edwards listed as a State\u2019s witness. Given while it is listed, we are taking that to indicate that Ms. Edwards is here as an expert witness as a chemist. The only prior notifications <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>that we\u2019ve received regarding any chemist as an expert witness was received by the defense on February 15th, on or about February 15th; and there is a list of chemists that I can read for you if you prefer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-4\">THE COURT: I\u2019m looking. It is filed in the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Pardon me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-6\">THE COURT: It is filed in the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Ms. Edwards is not on the list. I have not received any other notification. I\u2019ve also taken the liberty to look at the file during lunch hour and I didn\u2019t see any amended notification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-8\">Now, I will say for clarification purposes that about a week go I got a CY for Ms. Edwards but really nothing else, nothing else indicating that she was going to be called, particularly no notification to notify the Court as well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-9\">For that reason, I am asking that Ms. Edwards not be allowed to testify in this case due to the lack of notification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-10\">[PROSECUTOR]: Your Honor, actually, I filed a notice of the expert witness Nicole Edwards to be called as a forensic chemist on April 5th, which should be filed with the court. I also had one dropped off to defense counsel during the same time that I actually also sent defense counsel by email the CV, in addition the completed drug report.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-11\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Well, your Honor, I am not going to dispute whether or not\u2014I have no idea whether a notice, an amended notice, was sent or is delivered to our door. It did not reach my desk. What concerns me about it is that not only did it reach my desk, but it appears, if I read the file correctly, didn\u2019t reach the file either.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-12\">THE COURT: Well, it is not in the file.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-13\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: So ... I would again submit that there\u2019s been a lack of prior notification regarding this chemist.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>[PROSECUTOR]: Your Honor, I have a date stamped from the clerk\u2019s office when it was filed on April 5th.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-5\">THE COURT: Well, if you would tend that Madam Clerk so it can get in the file one way or the other.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-6\">[PROSECUTOR]: Thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-7\">THE COURT: All right. Anything else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: We would just submit that the time frame of the notification is insufficient. Under the circumstances ... Ms. Edwards should not be allowed to testify as an expert given the lack of proper notification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-9\">THE COURT: All right. The motion in limine is denied. Assuming we get to the point where she testifies, I\u2019ll note that you have a continuing objection to any testimony that she produces.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-10\">Appellant insists that Md. Rule 4-263 \u201ctwice required disclosure of Ms. Edwards\u2019 identity.\u201d We discern no basis for relief and explain. Maryland Rule 4\u2014263(d)(8) mandates the disclosure of reports or statements of experts and obligates the State to identify the expert.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Rule 4-263(h) requires the State to disclose the identities of its witnesses \u201cwithin 30 days after the earlier of the appearance of counsel or the first appearance of the defendant before the court pursuant to Rule 4-213[.]\u201d The purpose of the discovery rules is to \u201cassist the defendant in preparing his defense, and to protect him from surprise.\u201d <em>Hutchins v. State, </em>339 Md. 466, 473, 663 A.2d 1281 (1995) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>On February 17, 2011, the State\u2019s discovery response was filed with the circuit court and served on appellant\u2019s counsel. At that time, the State listed those forensic chemists the prosecutor thought would analyze and report on the contraband seized. In addition, the State\u2019s discovery included:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAa\">A. Search &amp; Seizures: 55 small pink colored zips that contained crack cocaine with a total weight of 9.8 grams, 135 small bags of marijuana with a total weight of 275.2 grams, SKS or AK-47 style magazine loaded with 24 rounds of 7.62 x 39mm, Wolf ammunition[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">Certainly, the State did not disclose the identity of its expert witness, Ms. Edwards, until the prosecutor attempted to file that information with the circuit court and appellant\u2019s counsel on April 5, eight days prior to trial.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Nevertheless, we conclude that the State fulfilled its \u201ccontinuing duty to disclose\u201d by supplementing its discovery with the name of the DEA chemist. Further, appellant has failed to demonstrate any prejudice that resulted from any delay in disclosing the name of the DEA chemist who would testify or the admission of her report, as soon as her identity was known to the prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">As noted, the prosecution had already provided in discovery access to the marijuana and cocaine that had been seized in time for the defense to subject this evidence to its own analysis. While defense counsel stated that notice that Ms. Edwards would testify may not have \u201creached\u201d his desk, the record establishes that the prosecutor filed with the circuit court a \u201cNotice of Expert Witness (Chemist)\u201d on April 5, 2011, which contains her certification that she served that notice on defense counsel on the same day. We further note that the discovery rules provide that the nature and extent of any sanction lies within the discretion of the trial court. <em>See </em>Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>Rule 4-263(n). The trial court did not abuse its discretion by permitting Ms. Edwards to testify or by admitting her report.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">Appellant last takes issue with the trial court\u2019s decision to permit the State to play portions of recorded telephone conversations, allegedly between appellant and another person while appellant was in jail. On the first day of trial, when the State offered into evidence recordings of these telephone conversations, defense counsel objected. The trial court ruled that the recordings had not been authenticated, \u201cunless [the State] get[s] somebody to identify that that\u2019s his voice.\u201d When the prosecutor suggested that the police officers could identify appellant\u2019s voice on the recordings, defense counsel objected:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, we would object to that____[I]f we sit and play this tapes and let\u2019s say do you recognize that, even if we can demonstrate to your satisfaction, the prejudicial damage of these tapes have already been done.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">During the State\u2019s cross-examination, the prosecutor sought to use the recordings of telephone as impeachment evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-11\">[PROSECUTOR]: Your Honor, at this time the State would like to offer impeachment evidence. The Defendant had stated that he did not live at that address on November 4, 2010. His credibility is at issue. The State at this time would like to move in State\u2019s Exhibit Numbers 32\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-12\">THE COURT: What\u2019s that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-13\">[PROSECUTOR]:\u2014and 31. Those are the jail calls. Now they come in because we have heard\u2014the jury has heard from\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-14\">THE COURT: You still haven\u2019t crossed the threshold of identification in this Court\u2019s mind in terms of identifying him as the person that\u2019s speaking.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-15\">Although the trial court ruled that the State could not introduce the tapes because they had not been authenticated, the court eventually permitted the prosecutor to play portions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>of the recordings and ask appellant whether he could recognize his own voice. Appellant testified that the voice on the recordings was not his.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">On appeal, the appellant urges that the trial court erred by permitting the State to play portions of the recording during cross-examination in an attempt to get appellant to identify a voice on the recordings as his. He asserts that this tactic permitted the State to execute an end run around the trial court\u2019s ruling that the recordings were inadmissible as unauthenticated, and that he was prejudiced because the jury heard the jailhouse telephone conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">The State retorts that appellant has failed to demonstrate any prejudice that followed from the trial court allowing the prosecutor to unsuccessfully attempt to get appellant to identify whether his voice appears on the recording. We are constrained to agree.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We are reluctant to conclude that the trial court abused its discretion so as to prejudice the defense, by permitting the prosecutor to attempt to authenticate the recording by playing portions of the conversations in the presence of the jury, when there is no record of what was played. <em>Cf.

State, 355 </em>Md. 639, 650, 735 A.2d 1122 (1999) (incumbent upon appellant claiming error to produce sufficient factual record for appellate court to determine whether error committed).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">For the reasons stated above, we affirm the judgments of the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED.

As Judge Raker recited in a separate opinion in <em>State v.

Judicial dictum is generally defined as an opinion by a court on a question that is directly involved, briefed, and argued by counsel, and even passed on by the court, but that is not essential to the decision. Statements of judicial dicta are technically 'dicta' because they are not necessary to the holding of a case. They do not, however, implicate to the same degree as ordinary dicta the concern of full consideration, which is one of the rationales for treating dicta and holdings differently. Unlike ordinary dicta, judicial dicta is, by definition, well-reasoned and stated only after the court has investigated an issue with care. Accordingly, courts afford judicial dicta greater deference than ordinary dicta, treating judicial dicta almost like holdings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">(quoting David Coale &amp; Wendy Couture, <em>Loud Rules, </em>34 Pepp. L.Rev. 715, 727-28 (2007)) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b541-9\">.
