KENNEY, III (Retired, Specially Assigned), J.</author>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Appellant, Philip Thane Olson, was charged with multiple offenses arising out of incidents occurring on February 14, March 6,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and May 12, 2009. On January 14, 2010, a jury sitting in the Circuit Court for Washington County convicted appellant of two counts of keeping a disorderly house (February 14, May 12), two counts of disorderly conduct (March 6, May 12), two counts of failure to obey a lawful order of a police officer (March 6, May 12), and one count each of disturbing the peace (May 12) and resisting arrest (May 12). He was sentenced to three years imprisonment for resisting arrest, a concurrent six month sentence for keeping a disorderly house, and three consecutive 60-day sentences for disorderly conduct and for disturbing the peace. In his timely appeal, appellant presents the following questions for our review, which we have revised as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-6\">1. Was there sufficient evidence to support appellant\u2019s conviction for resisting arrest on May 12?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-7\">2. Did the trial court commit plain error in its jury instruction on resisting arrest?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-8\">3. Was there sufficient evidence to support appellant\u2019s convictions for keeping a disorderly house on February 14 and May 12?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-9\">4. Did the trial court err in its jury instruction on keeping a disorderly house?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-10\">For the reasons set forth below, we answer the first question in the affirmative and second and third questions in the negative. Having answered the third question in the negative, we do not address the fourth question.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">Appellant\u2019s apartment, located at 417 South Potomac Street in Hagerstown, Maryland, is directly above the apartment of Michelle and Larry Straitiff. On February 14, 2009, the Straitiffs returned home from work around 5:00 p.m. Mrs. Straitiff testified, \u201cas soon as we walked in the door, the music upstairs at [appellant\u2019s] apartment went up so loud that we couldn\u2019t even hear a conversation between ourselves.\u201d Mr. Straitiff testified that appellant \u201cturned up the music real loud, started jumping up and down on the floor up above us.... I could hear it clean out on the front street.\u201d After an hour of the noise, Mrs. Straitiff called the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Officers R.D. Isaacs and Dwayne White from the Hagerstown City Police Department responded to the call. Officer Isaacs, who arrived first, testified that he was able to hear \u201cloud music or the tv\u201d when he entered the apartment building, and from inside the Straitiffs apartment he could hear that \u201cthe tv was loud and [appellant] was stomping, yelling and using profanity.\u201d The officers went to appellant\u2019s apartment and Officer White \u201cadvised [appellant] why we were there, if I had to come back he was going to get issued a citation for disorderly household,\u201d and Officer Isaacs \u201cadvised him that he needed to turn his music down and keep the noise under control.\u201d Officer White told the Straitiffs to call if the noise returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Mrs. Straitiff testified that as soon as the officers left, \u201cthe music went back up again ... as loud as it was before\u201d and there was \u201cyelling and stomping and things like that.\u201d She called the police and, approximately fifteen minutes after leaving, Officers White and Isaacs returned to the location. Officer White testified that from the first floor of the apartment building he could hear music and \u201cwas able to hear the yelling and the television on and the stomping on the floor\u201d from inside the Straitiffs\u2019 apartment. He specified that \u201cit was all just a lot of yelling\u201d and \u201cpossibly some cursing.\u201d Officer Isaacs testified that he could hear the noise from outside the apartment building.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>The officers went to appellant\u2019s apartment and \u201chad to bang on the door\u201d for \u201ca couple of minutes\u201d before appellant opened the door. According to Officer Isaacs, \u201cwe entered his apartment and we advised him that he needed to turn his music down ... or actually it was the television. And he kept ranting and raving that ... his music is not loud and he wasn\u2019t cussing or doing anything wrong.\u201d The officers entered the apartment, turned down the music, issued a citation for maintaining a disorderly house, and then left.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">According to Officer White, \u201capproximately at 7:57 p.m.\u201d he and Officer Isaacs were \u201cdispatched there again for the same type of complaint coming from the third floor.\u201d Officer White could hear the noise both from the common area of the apartment building and from inside the Straitiffs\u2019 apartment. The officers began \u201cbanging\u201d on appellant\u2019s door, and, although at first \u201che didn\u2019t answer,\u201d he later \u201cstood on the other side of the door and was talking to us.\u201d According to Officer Isaacs, they \u201cwere just advising him he needs to turn it down and he just refused.\u201d Officer White testified that he did not arrest appellant at this time because that would have required \u201ckicking] his door in[.]\u201d Officer White testified that \u201csince he would not answer the door, I went back\u201d to the police station \u201cand filed for a criminal summons\u201d for keeping a disorderly house.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">Mrs. Straitiff testified that, on May 12, 2009 at approximately 11:00 p.m., it was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-7\">the same thing all over again.... [T]he music was always so loud that I could not watch the tv. I couldn\u2019t enjoy ... I couldn\u2019t talk on the phone. I couldn\u2019t have a conversation with anyone in my home.... This day it was really pronounced, again, the stomping, the screaming, the yelling. ... Always profanity. Always bitch, whore, slut, crack whore.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">At approximately 1:00 a.m. the Straitiffs called the police. Officer Langley Dean, who, with Officer Jesse Duffey, responded to the call, testified that \u201c[a]s soon as I got out of my patrol car I could hear loud music coming from the area,\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>from inside the Straitiffs\u2019 apartment \u201c[y]ou could hear loud music and you could hear some thumping on ... the floor.\u201d Officer Duffey testified that he could hear the music from the street when they parked the vehicle, and that \u201cit\u2019s a heavy [sic] populated area with apartments and houses all down that street[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">When Officer Dean knocked on appellant\u2019s door and asked appellant \u201cto open up so we could talk,\u201d appellant yelled through the door, \u201cFuck you, you\u2019re the police. Motherfucker.... Fuck you, I am playing the music all night and Hagerstown City Police, I am recording you.\u201d Officer Dean went to the back window of appellant\u2019s apartment, knocked on it and looked into the apartment. According to the officer, appellant came</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-6\">to the window, opened the blind up. I can clearly see him inside the apartment. Ah, he was holding a laser level. Ah, the beam was protruding from the laser level and he was stating that that was his tape recorder and that he was recording everything that we were doing and what we were saying to him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">According to Officer Dean, \u201cthe whole reason we were there [was] to get [appellant] to turn the music down,\u201d and he specifically asked appellant to turn down the music. In response, appellant \u201cstated that he was going to play his music all night long. Ah, just kept screaming and yelling and wouldn\u2019t let us in, wouldn\u2019t come out to talk to us.\u201d Officer Dean testified that appellant would at times turn down the music, but \u201c[o]nly to scream more profanities\u201d and then \u201c[h]e would turn his music back up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">Officer Dean called his supervisor, Sergeant David Long, to \u201cmake him aware of the situation.\u201d Sergeant Long arrived and attempted to speak with appellant, who yelled profanities at Sergeant Long through his door \u201cloud enough for anybody ... in the apartment building to hear.\u201d According to Officer Dean,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-9\">[w]e made every effort that we could ... to get the music turned down. We ... had dispatch attempt to call the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>landlord so we could gain access---- [A]t times when we couldn\u2019t get him to come to the door, or couldn\u2019t get him to come to the window, we tapped on the air conditioner, trying to get his attention.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-6\">[W]e even made the attempt to have a deputy sent out to ... the landlord\u2019s house ... [a]nd was unable to get an answer at the door.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">According to Officer Dean, after about an hour, \u201cSergeant Long made the decision that we were going to make entry and take [appellant] into custody.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Sergeant Long justified his decision based on the fact that appellant \u201cwas continually causing a disturbance in an apartment building after numerous requests for him to turn down his music, to quiet down ... and he just completely refused.\u201d According to Sergeant Long:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-8\">We were trying to make every attempt ... to get him to calm down. We attempted to bring his level of agitation down. Actually at one point had the officers who were parked out front, told them to move their cruisers out of sight so that if he ... saw the cruisers out front and that was irritating him or whatever was agitating him, to try to defuse that as much as we could.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-9\">Ah, and that was to no avail. Ah, we made phone calls into his residence on the phone. [H]e would either not answer the phone or he would be very belligerent on the phone. We actually had [Mrs. Straitiff] come up to try to talk to him, to reason with him and that was to no avail.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-10\">Officer Dean testified that appellant was advised \u201cthat we were coming in. If he didn\u2019t open the door, we were coming in after him,\u201d and that \u201che was going to be placed under arrest.\u201d Appellant refused to open the door, and responded, \u201cYou cannot come into my house.\u201d Meanwhile, according to Officer Dean, appellant had been seen from the back window <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>by another officer and the police had information that appellant was washing knives and could easily grab them.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">When the order to enter appellant\u2019s apartment was given, the Fire Department \u201cpopped the door\u201d using a hydraulic hand tool. Officer Dean testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Alx\">when the door popped open, I\u2019d say [appellant] was approximately ten feet away from us and as soon as the door popped, he immediately turned, both hands up in the air, charging at the officers going through the door.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">Officer Jesse Duffey testified that appellant approached the officers \u201cwith his hands raised and appeared to be in an aggressive manner as if he was going to punch them or wrestle with [them],\u201d and Sergeant Long testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-7\">as soon as we entered the door, [appellant] immediately turned at us and came running at us with this hands ... in a clenched position. I couldn\u2019t tell if he had anything in his hands or ... at that point but [he was] obviously agitated because we had entered through the door.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">According to Officer David Rizer, who was the first officer to enter, appellant \u201cspun around from the kitchen sink, had both hands in the air and was charging in my direction.\u201d Officer Rizer fired his taser and appellant fell backwards.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">The State rested and appellant moved for judgment of acquittal. For keeping a disorderly house, appellant argued that: (1) the citations he received on February 14, 2009 were \u201cduplicitous\u201d because keeping a disorderly house is an offense predicated on a \u201creoccurring event;\u201d (2) noise alone was insufficient to support the February 14, 2009 and May 12, 2009 charges; and (3) keeping a disorderly house requires offenses by \u201cmultiple people.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-10\">As to resisting arrest, appellant argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-11\">Arrest isn\u2019t that I\u2019m moving towards you and I\u2019m going to taze you. Even if I say, \u201cOh, you\u2019re under arrest.\u201d That\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>not arrest. I actually have to put him physically under arrest or begin to touch him under arrest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-5\">And, so if you look at that it says the offense requires proof that he intentionally made physical contact or he attempted to break lose of that contact. That didn\u2019t occur. There\u2019s no testimony at all that my client at any point was detained. He was just tazed because he made movement toward the door.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">Appellant also argued that, because there were no exceptions to the warrant requirement to support the police entering his home warrantlessly, he was justified in resisting arrest:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-7\">I\u2019m also arguing, in the alternative is that because it was a warrant-less arrest and on a warrant-less arrest that was no consensual entry into the home.... So, if we have non-consensual warrant-less entry into the home, even though the testimony of Sergeant Long was there ... the warrant could have been attained. Now there was the discrepancy on how long it would have taken to be obtained, but it could have been obtained from the Commissioner\u2019s Office, which was, you know, two to three minutes away, that was open.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-8\">Now, with no warrant and no consent to enter then we have to look at two things. There was the exigent circumstances and then there\u2019s the caretaker exception. Caretaker exception I can dismiss in the sense that a caretaker exception, there\u2019s a fire; I\u2019m going to enter in to help the (inaudible). That does not apply.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-9\">Exigent circumstances does not apply, as well.... Once again, exigent circumstances has generally been defined as, \u201cWe\u2019re going in to maintain that there\u2019s evidence there that may be destroyed before we get the search warrant.\u201d Now, my client was in there for an hour and a half. There was no ... there\u2019s no ... none of his charges deal with the destruction of evidence. There was no exigent circumstance to enter into the home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-10\">Noise has never been ... said to be an exigent circumstance that we need to enter. Now, I understand that they probably were annoyed and they wanted to ... to terminate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>this call and perhaps ... allow the community some silence. However, as stated by every officer, there was no one that was allegedly complaining about this except for [Mrs.] Straitiff. So, at this point there simply is no exigent circumstances. They should have went and got a warrant. They didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-4\">Now, under the case law it also says that if they do not get a warrant and they enter into [appellant\u2019s] home he is lawfully in his right to resist that arrest. Because now it\u2019s an unlawful arrest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">The court ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-6\">There is some ... case law, cause right, the disorderly house talks about bawdy houses and houses of gambling, houses where immoral people get together and do immoral things.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-7\">Ah, and at first, some of the definitions seem to indicate that it requires individuals, for instance, you people who are gambling or ... engaging in bawdy house activities would be multiple persons. But there\u2019s other instances where just ... it talks about multiple acts as opposed to multiple people.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-8\">... Now what I imagine ... a nuisance house requires ... is something habitual. Ah, and I don\u2019t know that one instance can be habitual. I think habitual requires at least two instances and for that reasons the motion for judgment of acquittal is granted as to the citation which was issued ... on February fourteenth.... A motion of judgment of acquittal is granted as to that charge because that was the first instance and I don\u2019t think it was habitual at that point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-9\">Later that day ... Officer White seeks an application for a statement of charges.... The motion for judgment of acquittal is denied as to that count.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-10\">And also its denied as to the count of disorderly house ... which allegedly occurred on May twelfth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-11\">I believe that resisting arrest requires the use of force but I never thought it required physical contact. The testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>construed in a light most favorable to the State at this point, ah, particularly that of several of the police officers, including Sergeant Long ... was that [appellant] was told repeatedly that he was arrested, that he would be, ah, arrested, that he should get on the ground, I think the testimony was and instead of submitting to that [appellant] forcefully approached and the word charged was used, the word walked was used, but in all instances the testimony was that [appellant] had his hands up in ... an aggressive manner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-5\">That\u2019s a question for the jury I believe whether or not [appellant] used force to resist arrest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-6\">[T]he police had spent and again, in a light most favorable to the State at this juncture ... an hour, at least, and an hour and a half by some testimony, ah, making reasonable efforts to ... abate this ... problem. Ah, trying to get a hold of the landlord. The landlord wouldn\u2019t answer his phone, wouldn\u2019t answer his door when a deputy was dispatched out there. Ah, knocking on windows, knocking doors, sending, apparently poor Mrs. Straitiff up to try to reason with [appellant] herself. All of those instances had been unsuccessful and an hour had gone by.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-7\">Sergeant Long testified, yeah, they could have gone to the Commissioner\u2019s Office and filled out some paperwork and tried to get a warrant, which it\u2019s reasonable to assume that another significant amount of time would go by.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-8\">The Fourth Amendment protects individuals from unreasonable, ah, searches and seizures. And certainly I find the ... Fourth Amendment fully applies to ... [appellant\u2019s] apartment. It\u2019s his residence and the Fourth Amendment gives him rights of privacy in there and rights to be ... protected from unreasonable searches and seizures.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-9\">In this instance, I\u2019m ruling that what the police did that evening after an hour and a half, considering the extreme disturbance ... to the neighborhood. Now albeit there\u2019s evidence one person complained, but there\u2019s evidence other individuals were ... clearly within earshot and this was as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>[appellant\u2019s counsel] even argued a densely packed residential area. It was reasonable for the police to take reasonable efforts to try to ... abate this problem. And the only option after the landlord wouldn\u2019t help and [appellant] wouldn\u2019t answer the door considering his ... obvious refusal to cooperate with the police at that point, ... I find that Sergeant Long made a reasonable decision ... to use the minimal amount of force and damage necessary to abate this nuisance. And [appellant] was informed that he was under arrest and they yelled that in at him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-5\">[Appellant] knew that the police were coming when he heard the door pop. [Appellant] made aggressive movements towards the door. The police used reasonable force at that point to protect themselves. Officer Eizer said he didn\u2019t have the opportunity to see clearly what was in [appellant\u2019s] hand or what wasn\u2019t in [appellant\u2019s] hand. But he knew from Officer Duffey [that appellant] had been washing at least one knife, if not knives.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-6\">Therefore, I believe that Sergeant Long\u2019s actions that night were reasonable. This was a reasonable ... entry which is not in contravention of the Fourth Amendment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">Appellant requested, <em>inter alia, </em>the following jury instructions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-8\">In order to convict [appellant] of Resisting Arrest, the State must prove:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-9\">(1) that [appellant] was arrested;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-10\">(2) that the arrest was lawful; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-11\">(3) that [appellant] refused to submit to that arrest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-12\">In order to convict [appellant] of Disorderly House, the State must prove:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-13\">(1) that [appellant] kept a house as a place of habitual or common resort of people of evil name and fame, and of dishonest conversation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-14\">(2) that [appellant] kept the house for these people to consort together affording opportunities for and tempta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>tions to the indulgence of their bad habits and passions; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-5\">(3) that the keeping of the house was to the evil example and scandal of the neighborhood.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-6\">The court instructed the jury, in pertinent part:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-7\">In order to convict [appellant] of resisting arrest, the State must prove that [appellant] was arrested; that the arrest was lawful; that [appellant] refused to submit to that arrest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-8\">[I]n order to convict [appellant] of keeping a disorderly house the State must prove that [appellant] was keeping a place where acts prohibited by statute are habitually indulged or permitted. A person is keeping a disorderly house if it is kept as a place where acts prohibited by statute are habitually indulged or permitted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">After instructing the jury, the court asked counsel if there were \u201cany additional requests for jury instructions or objections to the instructions as indicated other than what\u2019s already on the record?\u201d Both the State and appellant\u2019s counsel responded in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-10\">Appellant was convicted of resisting arrest, failure to obey the orders of a police officer, disorderly conduct, keeping a disorderly house, and disturbing the peace.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b350-12\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Acy\">\n<em>Sufficiency of the Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b350-13\">In <em>Moye v. State, </em>369 Md. 2, 796 A.2d 821 (2002), the Court of Appeals explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-14\">The standard of review for appellate review of evidentiary sufficiency is whether any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crimes beyond a reasonable doubt. We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution. We give \u201cdue regard to the [fact finder\u2019s] finding of facts, its resolution of conflicting evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>dence, and, significantly, its opportunity to observe and assess the credibility of witnesses.\u201d Although our analysis does not involve a re-weighing of the evidence, we must determine whether the ... verdict was supported by either direct or circumstantial evidence by which any rational trier of fact could find [the defendant] guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of the ... charges.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 12-13, 796 A.2d 821 (internal citations omitted). \u201cThe limited question before us, therefore, is not whether the evidence <em>should have </em>or <em>probably would have </em>persuaded the majority of fact finders but only whether it <em>possibly could have </em>persuaded any rational fact finder.\u201d <em>Fraidin v. State, </em>85 Md.App. 231, 241, 583 A.2d 1065 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">\n<em>Jury Instruction Error</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">In <em>Smith v. State, </em>403 Md. 659, 663-64, 944 A.2d 505 (2008), the Court of Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-7\">\u201cWe have held that the standard of review for jury instructions is that so long as the law is fairly covered by the jury instructions, reviewing courts should not disturb them.\u201d <em>Farley v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>355 Md. 34, 46, 733 A.2d 1014, 1020 (1999) (citing <em>Jacobson v. Julian, </em>246 Md. 549, 561, 229 A.2d 108, 116 (1967)). <em>See also Boone v. American Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co., </em>150 Md.App. 201, 227, 819 A.2d 1099, 1113 (2003). If, however, the instructions are \u201cambiguous, misleading or confusing\u201d to jurors, those instructions will result in reversal and a remand for a new trial. <em>See Battle v.

[A]n arrest in not effected by a mere statement like \u2018You\u2019re under arrest.\u2019 ... It is clear ... that the court found as a matter of fact that the police had only announced their intention to arrest [appellant] and had not physically touched him in any way when [he] \u2018charged\u2019 at the officers who were bashing in his apartment door. The court accepted as fact that when [appellant] turned from the sink, put his dukes up and was \u2018charging\u2019 the police\u2014 completing all of the acts on which the \u2018resisting\u2019 was based\u2014the police had not seized him, laid a hand on him, grabbed him or touched him in any manner. It was only <em>after </em>he had charged the officers that [appellant] was physically touched, grabbed or subdued, here by being tasered.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-5\">\u2022 \u201cSecond, the entry into [appellant\u2019s] home to effect this warrantless arrest was not justified by exigent circumstances as required by law and hence [appellant] was justified in resisting any such arrest____No one in [appellant\u2019s] apartment was injured. There was no evidence being destroyed. There was no felony being committed. ... There was nothing preventing the officer from taking any part of the over an hour and a half that they waited at the scene to go to the court house only 5 minutes away and obtain an arrest warrant. All the police had here was noise. Noise is not an exigent circumstance authorizing forcible warrantless entry into a person\u2019s home.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ANu\">The State responds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-9\">\u2022 \u201cAlthough the officers had not yet laid hands on [appellant] when he charged at them, they had surrounded his ... apartment before entering.... Officers were sta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>tioned on the publicly accessible back fire escape and spoke to [appellant] through his back window. Additional officers were stationed at [appellant\u2019s] apartment front door and conversed with him through it. Diming this time, moreover, the police informed [appellant] he was under arrest. Under the circumstances, [appellant\u2019s] freedom of movement was limited to his ... apartment, which he could not leave. The officer\u2019s conduct therefore constituted an act that indicated an intention to take appellant into custody that subjected him to the actual control and will of the arresting] officers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-5\">\u2022 \u201c[Appellant] also argues that he was privileged to resist his arrest because, without an arrest warrant, the officers\u2019 entry into the home made the arrest unlawful. But, when it comes to the offense of resisting a <em>warrantless </em>arrest, the lawfulness of the arrest is not assessed against the absence of the warrant\u2014for that is assumed\u2014but rather against the existence of probable cause. [Appellant] cites no Maryland case, and the State\u2019s research reveals none, that assesses the lawfulness of the warrantless arrest based on the manner of the arrest\u2019s effectuation rather than its justification at inception. And, indeed, when it comes to the arrest\u2019s lawfulness, the pattern jury instruction refers to the State\u2019s burden to prove only probable cause.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">To satisfy the first element of resisting arrest, \u00e1 law enforcement officer must \u201carrest[ ] or <em>attempt </em>[ ] <em>to arrest </em>the defendant.\u201d (Emphasis added).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals has said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-7\">It is generally recognized that an arrest is the taking, seizing, or detaining of the person of another (1) by touching or putting hands on him; (2) or by any act that indicates an intention to take him into custody and that subjects him to the actual control and will of the person making the arrest; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>or (3) by the consent of the person to be arrested. It is said that four elements must ordinarily coalesce to constitute a legal arrest: (1) an intent to arrest; (2) under a real or pretended authority; (3) accompanied by a seizure or detention of the person; and (4) which is understood by the person arrested.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-5\">We have defined an arrest in general terms as the detention of a known or suspected offender for the purpose of prosecuting him for a crime. Our cases make clear ... that in ordinary circumstances \u201cthere is a detention only when there is a touching by the arrestor or when the arrestee is told that he is under arrest and submits [but][w]here there is no touching, the intention of the arrestor and the understanding of the arrestee are determinative, for in order for there to be an arrest in such case, there must always be an intent on the part of one to arrest the other and an intent on the part of such other to submit.\u201d Ordinarily, therefore, there can be no arrest where there is no restraint or where the person sought to be arrested is not conscious of any restraint. At least one court has concluded that an unconscious person cannot be subjected to a valid arrest. But, as indicated in Fisher, Laws of Arrest, chapter IY, at 52 (1967), it is only where there is no actual manual seizure of the arrested person that his intention or understanding assumes controlling importance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-6\"><em>Belote v.

The officers testified that they repeatedly asked appellant to reduce the noise, and that he repeatedly refused to comply. Officer Dean testified that the officers \u201cadvised [appellant] that we were coming in. If he didn\u2019t open the door, we were coming in after him,\u201d and that \u201che was going to be placed under arrest.\u201d Although appellant had not been \u201ctouched\u201d by the officers before he charged them, he clearly would have been in the absence of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>submitting to the arrest. That appellant understood that he was being arrested is reflected by the repeated warnings and his charging the officers when they entered. This, in our view, constitutes an <em>attempted </em>arrest that was completed when he was tased.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">The second element of resisting arrest is \u201cthat the officer had probable cause to believe that the defendant had committed a crime, <em>ie., </em>that the arrest was lawful[.]\u201d <em>Rich, </em>205 Md.App. at 240, 44 A.3d 1063. <em>See also </em>Maryland Criminal Pattern Jury Instructions 4:27.1 (\u201cResisting Arrest (Warrantless)\u201d requires \u201cthat the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that the defendant [was committing] [had committed] (crime)[.]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment in <em>Mapp v.

Their purpose <em>vis-a-vis </em>the burglar they may catch is, of course, \u201cinvestigatory.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>With respect, on the other hand, to the presumably innocent victims of possible crimes, where persons and/or property are in apparent danger, the police intervention is \u201cnon-investigatory\u201d in its purpose and the constraints and hesitation that routinely inhibit a criminal investigation are inappropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-5\"><em>Alexander, </em>124 Md.App. at 277 n. 2, 721 A.2d 275 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">In such situations,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-7\"><em>[Cady </em>v.] <em>Dombrowski\u2019s </em>definition of community caretaking as the performance of functions \u201ctotally divorced from [law enforcement]\u201d might imply that police activity fulfilling both a community-caretaking purpose and a law enforcement one would not trigger the exception\u2014neither purpose would be totally divorced from the other. In fact, however, the [Supreme] Court has treated such mixed-motive searches and seizures as community caretaking. In inventory-search cases, for example, the Court has stressed the communitycaretaking purposes of securing valuables, guarding against false claims of theft, and protection of the police from dangerous items in the vehicle, but police are undoubtedly motivated at least in part by the possibility that such searches will yield evidence. Similarly, when considering the constitutionality of sobriety checkpoints, the Court has focused on the community-caretaking purpose of protecting potential victims of drunk driving, but the law-enforcement motivation of catching drunk drivers is manifest. Thus, in an ironic inversion of the language in <em>[Cady </em>], the Court at times appears to apply the community-caretaking doctrine unless the police activity is totally divorced from the protection of the public.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">Dimino, 66 Wash &amp; Lee L.Rev. at 1492-93 (citing <em>People v.

As this Court stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-4\">[e]ven when the person subjected to a Fourth Amendment intrusion is the actual target of the inquiry, if the purpose is not <em>per se </em>to discover evidence of crime but is intended to serve some \u201cspecial need beyond the investigative norm,\u201d what is constitutionally required is simply general reasonableness or articulable suspicion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-5\"><em>Alexander, 124 </em>Md.App. at 277-78, 721 A.2d 275.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">Because of the not infrequent overlap between investigatory and non-investigatory police functions, courts \u201chave validated many community caretaking intrusions ... on the ground that they fall within variously formulated \u2018exigent circumstances/ \u2018emergency/ and \u2018rescue\u2019 exceptions\u201d to the warrant requirement. Livingston, 1998 U Chi Legal <em>F </em>at 276 (citation omitted). Indeed, exigency in community caretaking cases is an \u201cimp\u201d that \u201cbedevils much of Fourth Amendment jurisprudence,\u201d H. Richard Uviller, Virtual Justice 82 (Yale 1996), causing this Court to caution:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-7\">Linguistic or analytic confusion may be avoided if it is carefully noted 1) that exigency is a factor in the emergency aid and protection cases that are part of the community caretaking function, <em>see, e.g., Oken v. State, </em>327 Md. 628, 643-47, 612 A.2d 258 (1992); <em>Lebedun v. State, </em>283 Md. 257, 259-78, 390 A.2d 64 (1978); <em>Davis v. State, </em>236 Md. 389, 395-98, 204 A.2d 76 (1964); and 2) that exigency is also a factor that sometimes justifies warrantless activity in the course of a criminal investigation, <em>see, e.g., Wengert v. State, </em>364 Md. 76, 84-86, 771 A.2d 389 (2001); <em>Carroll v. State, </em>335 Md. 723, 728-39, 646 A.2d 376 (1994); <em>Stackhouse v. State, 298 </em>Md. 203, 468 A.2d 333 (1983); <em>Burks v. State, </em>96 Md.App. 173, 195-98, 624 A.2d 1257 (1993). It may be (we do not here decide) that the measure of exigency is the same in both contexts. Notwithstanding their common use of the term \u201cexigency,\u201d however, it would seem helpful to keep the two contexts scrupulously distinct. As Professor LaFave, op cit at \u00a7 6.6(a), p. 390 n. 5, noted:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>Though this \u201cemergency aid exception\u201d is one of many \u201ccommunity caretaking functions\u201d of the police, it ... must be distinguished from \u201cthe exigent circumstance exception\u201d ... for the former are only invoked when the police are not engaged in crime-solving activities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-5\"><em>State v. Brooks, </em>148 Md.App. 374, 383-84, 812 A.2d 342 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">The community caretaking exception \u201cdoes not have a single meaning, but is rather an umbrella that encompasses at least three other doctrines: (1) the emergency-aid doctrine, (2) the automobile impoundment/inventory doctrine, and (3) the public servant exception.\u201d <em>Wilson v. State, </em>409 Md. 415, 430, 975 A.2d 877 (2009) (footnote omitted). Regarding the public servant exception, the <em>Wilson </em>Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-7\">The caretaking function has been recognized also as a general public welfare rule or what is sometimes known as the \u201cpublic servant\u201d exception. When the police act to protect the public in a manner outside their normal law enforcement function, many courts have applied the doctrine to validate many warrantless searches and seizures, and in a variety of circumstances. <em>[United States v. Garner, </em>416 F.3d 1208 (10th Cir.2005) ] (officer exercised community caretaking function when he told defendant to come back and sit down so that fire department could examine him); <em>[United States v. Miller, </em>589 F.2d 1117 (1st Cir.1978) ] (boarding an abandoned boat and finding evidence of narcotics trafficking was lawful under the community caretaking doctrine because the possible drowning of the boat owner was being investigated); <em>People v. Ray, </em>21 Cal.4th 464, 88 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 981 P.2d 928 (Cal.1999) (officers lawfully entered apartment in response to a call that it was in shambles and its door had been left ajar all day, to check on the welfare of the persons inside the apartment); <em>People v.

Kinzy, </em>141 Wash.2d 373, 5 P.3d 668 (Wash.2000) (community caretaking function extends to officer approaching at risk youth in high narcotics trafficking areas to check on their safety).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-4\">The \u201cpublic safety\u201d doctrine is based upon a recognition that law enforcement officers perform a myriad of functions and responsibilities, the enforcement of criminal laws being only one of them. <em>Williams v. State, </em>962 A.2d 210, 216-17 (Del.2008); 3 WAYNE R. L[A]FAVE, SEARCH AND SEIZURE, \u00a7 5.4(C) (4th ed.2004). The Supreme Court of Delaware, in <em>Williams, </em>described the underpinnings of the doctrine as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-5\">\u201cThe modern police officer is a \u2018jack-of-all-emergencies,\u2019 with complex and multiple tasks to perform in addition to identifying and apprehending persons committing serious criminal offenses; by default or design he [or she] is also expected to aid individuals who are in danger of physical harm, assist those who cannot care for themselves, and provide other services on an emergency basis.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Acf\"><em>Williams, </em>962 A.2d at 216-17 (internal citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-6\">As did the Delaware Supreme Court, as well as the majority of jurisdictions in the country, we find that the public welfare component of the community caretaking function of the police \u201cencompasses a non-investigative, noncriminal role to ensure the safety and welfare of our citizens,\u201d reflecting that principle that the role of the police is not limited to the investigation, detection and prevention of crime in this State. <em>See id. </em>at 218; <em>see also State v.

This Court has also applied the community caretaking doctrine to homes.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\"><em>State v. Alexander, </em>124 Md.App. 258, 721 A.2d 275 (1998), involved \u201cthe lawfulness of the warrantless entry into a home pursuant to the community caretaking function.\u201d <em>Randall v. Peaco, </em>175 Md.App. 320, 335, 927 A.2d 83 (2007). In that case, a man left an anonymous tip with the police on Thanksgiving day \u201cthat his next-door neighbor\u2019s basement door was open and that he believed that the neighbor was away.\u201d <em>Alexander, </em>124 Md.App. at 262, 721 A.2d 275. Corporal Brian Koehn was ordered to respond to a \u201cpossible breaking and entering.\u201d <em>Id. </em>After arriving at the residence,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-8\">Corporal Koehn walked around the house and cheeked all doors and windows. He noticed that the basement door was \u201cwide open,\u201d but observed no signs of a forcible entry. At that point, he advised Deputy Sheriff Ronald Naughton via radio that the residence had an open door and that he was going to await Deputy Naughton\u2019s arrival before attempting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>to enter the residence. At the suppression hearing, he explained that he decided to wait for Naughton because he believed a breaking and entering was in progress and, for his own safety, he did not want to confront any potential burglars alone. When asked at the suppression hearing why he thought that a breaking and entering was in progress, he recited the following reasons: 1) he had been alerted to a possible breaking and entering by the original radio broadcast; 2) he had observed an open basement door; 3) he had been told the homeowners were away; 4) he observed no vehicles in the driveway; and 5) the house was in a residential area that had been the scene of a rash of recent breakings and enterings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-4\">Deputy Naughton testified at the suppression hearing and confirmed Corporal Koehn\u2019s statement that that particular neighborhood had been the scene of many recent breakings and enterings. He further testified that the call he received in the instant case was similar to calls he had received in cases of other recent breakings and enterings and that it was unusual to see any signs of forcible entry into a residence other than an open door. While still waiting for his back-up, Corporal Koehn \u201chollered in the house if anybody is home, Sheriffs Office.\u201d He received no reply. He then walked around to the front of the house, knocked on the door and rang the doorbell. He heard a dog barking inside but otherwise received <em>no </em>reply.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-5\">Shortly thereafter, Deputy Naughton arrived at the scene and also observed the open basement door. The two officers then entered the house through that door and began a sweep of the residence to determine if anyone was inside. They first noticed that the basement was in disarray. While still searching for possible intruders, they opened the door of a walk-in closet in the master bedroom. They there observed marijuana on a shelf in plain view.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-6\">The officers left the narcotics untouched on the shelf while they completed their search for intruders. They then secured the house and obtained a search warrant based on their observation of the marijuana. They subsequently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>executed the warrant and seized the marijuana, along with assorted drug paraphernalia and cash.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-5\"><em>Alexander, </em>124 Md.App. at 263-64, 721 A.2d 275.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">After examining the community caretaking doctrine, we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-7\">the entry by two deputy sheriffs into 11541 Deadwood Drive at approximately 1 P.M. on November 27, 1997, was eminently reasonable.... It was reasonable for them to fear that a burglary had recently taken place and that evidence of it might be found inside. There was a reasonable possibility that a criminal intruder might still be inside the home.... Particularly in circumstances where there is no reason to be skeptical about the police exercise of their caretaking function because of any fear of subterfuge, the conduct of the two officers was exemplary. The [homeowners] were not in any way suspected of being involved in any crime. The officers, who came to the scene only to be of assistance, had reason for being apprehensive that the [homeowners\u2019] home, the [homeowners\u2019] personal property, and possibly even the [homeowners] themselves were in danger. Had the officers walked away from the scene, they would have been derelict in their duty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 280-82, 721 A.2d 275.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">In <em>State v.

There had indeed been a \u201ccitizen complaint\u201d about the malodorous smell permeating the entire study hall, and tbe smell was no less noticeable to Riley when he arrived to investigate. It was therefore reasonable for him to undertake, in his capacity of maintenance supervisor, a \u201cprompt inspection\u201d of the carrel area for the purpose of <em>discovering and abating </em>the nuisance. And inasmuch as the students entitled to use the room had already been disturbed by this offensive odor throughout the preceding day, further delay in suppressing it would have been unjustifiable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-9\"><em>Id., </em>97 Cal.Rptr. 297, 488 P.2d at 628 (emphasis added)</p>\n<p id=\"b372-10\">In <em>State v.

Shortly after the officers arrived on the premises at 1:39 a.m., somewhere between four and eight pajama-clad neighbors emerged from their homes to complain about the noise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-7\">... Officer Clark banged repeatedly on the front door of [Rohrig\u2019s] home, but received no response. While Officer Tucker returned to the squad car in an attempt to obtain the telephone number of the residence, Officer Clark walked around the outside of the two-story residence, all the while tapping to no avail on its first-floor windows. As he walked outside the house, he observed two stereo speakers in the first-floor living room and another pair of speakers in an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>upstairs room, with speaker wire running between the two floors on the outside of the home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-5\">Upon reaching the back door of [Rohrig\u2019s] home, Officer Clark discovered that it was open, with only an unlocked screen door preventing access into the house. He called to Officer Tucker, who abandoned his effort to obtain a telephone number and joined Officer Clark at the back door. The officers knocked and hollered to announce their presence, but again received no answer. They then opened the unlocked screen door, passed through a porch and through the open back door, and emerged into a kitchen____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-7\">A light was on in the kitchen when the officers entered, but the remaining first-floor rooms were dark. The officers then observed another light emerging from an open doorway. Proceeding through this doorway toward the light, they traveled down some stairs and into [Rohrig\u2019s] basement. The officers testified that they went downstairs not because they believed that was the source of the loud music, but because they hoped to find an occupant of the home who could turn the music down. Upon reaching the basement, the officers discovered \u201cwall-to-wall\u201d marijuana plants, as well as fans and running water.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-8\">Having failed to locate anyone in the basement, the officers returned to the first floor, and then traveled upstairs to the second floor, continuing to announce their presence. At the top of the stairs, Officer Clark observed a man lying on the floor of one of the two bedrooms, and also discovered that this room contained the stereo that was the source of the loud music.

Regarding the first element, \u201c[h]ad the officers attempted to secure a warrant, it is clear that the aural assault emanating from [Rohrig\u2019s] home would have continued unabated for a significant period of time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Regarding the second and third elements,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-8\">by entering [Rohrig\u2019s] residence for the limited purpose of locating and abating a nuisance, the officers sought to restore the neighbors\u2019 peaceful enjoyment of their homes and neighborhood. In view of the importance of preserving our communities, we do not think that this interest is so insignificant that it can never serve as justification for a warrantless entry into a home.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-9\"><em>Id. </em>The <em>Rohrig </em>court stated that <em>Welsh v. Wisconsin, </em>466 U.S. 740, 104 S.Ct. 2091, 80 L.Ed.2d 732 (1984) \u201cteaches that the weight of a governmental interest should be measured in part by the severity of the offense being investigated,\u201d but opined that \u201cthe <em>Welsh </em>analysis has less relevance as one moves away <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>from traditional law enforcement functions and toward ... \u2018community caretaking functions.\u2019\u201d <em>Rohrig, </em>98 F.3d at 1521 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Therefore,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-6\">the governmental interest in immediately abating an ongoing nuisance by quelling loud and disruptive noise in a residential neighborhood is sufficiently compelling to justify warrantless intrusions under some circumstances.... In particular, a compelling governmental interest supports warrantless entries where, as here, strict adherence to the warrant requirement would subject the community to a continuing and noxious disturbance for an extended period of time without serving any apparent purpose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-7\">Moreover, as discussed earlier, <em>[Camara v. Municipal Court, </em>387 U.S. 523, 87 S.Ct. 1727, 18 L.Ed.2d 930 (1967) ] and its progeny instruct us to balance the governmental interest being served against the individual\u2019s interest in remaining free from governmental intrusions. In light of [Rohrig\u2019s] course of conduct, we find that he cannot claim the degree of privacy protection that generally attaches to private dwellings. <em>See [Katz v. United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 351, 88 S.Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967)] (\u201cThe Fourth Amendment protects people, not places. What a person knowingly exposes to the public, even in his own home or office, is not a subject of Fourth Amendment protection.\u201d). Just as one\u2019s expectation of privacy diminishes as he ventures beyond his doorway, <em>see [United States v. Santana, </em>427 U.S. 38, 42, 96 S.Ct. 2406, 49 L.Ed.2d 300 (1976)], [Rohrig] here undermined his right to be left alone by projecting loud noises into the neighborhood in the wee hours of the morning, thereby significantly disrupting his neighbors\u2019 peace. Indeed, in this case, we cannot protect [Rohrig\u2019s] interest in maintaining the privacy of his home without diminishing his neighbors\u2019 interests in maintaining the privacy of their homes. Accordingly, we find that the governmental interest in preserving a peaceful community is all the more compelling when balanced against [Rohrig\u2019s] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>substantially weakened interest in maintaining the privacy of his home.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 1522.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">\u201cHaving found that an important \u2018community caretaking\u2019 interest motivated the officers\u2019 entry in this case,\u201d the <em>Rohrig </em>court held that the officers\u2019 \u201cfailure to obtain a warrant does not render that entry unlawful.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1523. \u201cQuite simply, we find nothing in the Fourth Amendment that leads us to disapprove of the officers\u2019 chosen course of action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1525.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">In <em>People v.

A large party was occurring at the residence, and the officers knocked on the door. \u2018Within a minute, an unidentified male opened the door to allow the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>officers entry, but walked away before the officers could speak with him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 530, 22 A.3d 77.

Although police entry into the dwelling was initially justified [by consent], their subsequent action in fanning out and conducting, in essence, a full-blown search of the home was neither reasonably related in scope to the circumstances that justified the entry in the first place nor carried out in a manner consistent with the factors supporting the entry\u2019s initial legitimacy. Indeed, unlike <em>Rohtig, </em>the objective of noise abatement could have been achieved well short of the full-scale search engaged in by the officers in this matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-6\">... Unlike <em>Rohrig, </em>where the sole occupant in the home was sleeping and thus the police were unable to locate the source of the loud music and turn down the volume, here the offending noise emanated from the crowd itself, which the police could easily have dispersed or otherwise brought under control given the number of officers present.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 544-45, 22 A.3d 77.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">In the case now before us, the police had probable cause to believe that appellant had committed and was intend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>ing to commit the crime of disturbing the peace, which, as defined by \u00a7 10-201(c)(5)(i) of the Criminal Law Article, states that \u201c[a] person from any location may not, by making an unreasonably loud noise, willfully disturb the peace of another ... on the other\u2019s land or premises[.]\u201d But this does not end our inquiry, for probable cause alone does not support a warrantless entry. <em>See Payton v. New York, </em>445 U.S. 573, 587-88, 100 S.Ct. 1371, 63 L.Ed.2d 639 (1980). Rather, in this context we must determine whether the subsequent entry and appellant\u2019s arrest were \u201creasonable\u201d under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">In denying appellant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal, the trial court found that, after spending more than an hour trying various ways to reason with appellant and moderate the noise, the police \u201cmade a reasonable decision ... to use the minimal amount of force and damage necessary to abate this nuisance,\u201d which was occurring \u201cwithin earshot\u201d of neighbors in a \u201cdensely packed residential area.\u201d According to the court, the police could have sought a warrant, but \u201cit\u2019s reasonable to assume that another significant amount of time would go by.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">According to the testimony of various police officers, when the decision was made to enter appellant\u2019s apartment without consent and to arrest appellant, they were functioning with both a caretaking (abate the nuisance) and investigatory (arrest appellant) purpose. As to \u201cWhat came first?,\u201d the decision to enter and arrest appellant came only after an extended but unsuccessful effort to abate the noise and diffuse the situation. In light of these dual purposes and guided by the previous discussion, we will analyze the entry and arrest under the more traditional exigent circumstances exception and the community caretaking exception. In consideration of the former, we will address the right to enter and arrest where a crime is committed in the presence of a police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">While the Court of Appeals has cautioned that, in the case of traditional law enforcement functions, \u201cthe exigent circumstances [exception] is to be construed narrowly,\u201d <em>Stackhouse v. State, </em>298 Md. 203, 215-16, 468 A.2d 333 (1983), it may be\u2014 but we need not decide\u2014that the circumstances here qualify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>as \u201cexigent\u201d and would justify the forceful entry into appellant\u2019s apartment if the sole purpose of the entry was to arrest him based on a crime that was being committed in the officers\u2019 presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">In the more traditional view of exigent circumstances, the facts of this case do not present a situation where life<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> or property was at risk, evidence was being compromised or destroyed, or appellant was fleeing, or in a position to flee, to avoid arrest while a warrant was obtained. <em>See, e.g., Brigham, City v. Stuart, </em>547 U.S. 398, 403, 126 S.Ct. 1943, 164 L.Ed.2d 650 (2006) (Exigent circumstances include when there is an imminent risk of death or serious injury, or danger that evidence will be immediately destroyed, or that a suspect will escape). But the \u201cendangerfing]\u201d of \u201cthe peace and good order of the community\u201d may also create exigent circumstances, <em>McDonald v. United States, </em>335 U.S. 451, 459, 69 S.Ct. 191, 93 L.Ed. 153 (1948) (Jackson, J., concurring), and the Court of Appeals has recognized that, in some cases, \u201cthe mere observation of a crime may provide its own exigency\u201d when the police, as they did here, \u201cobserve the perpetrator actively so engaged\u201d in the commission of that crime. <em>Dunnuck v.

We recognize that this \u201cnighttime intrusion\u201d was a \u201csevere invasion of privacy,\u201d <em>Jones v. United States, </em>357 U.S. 493, 498, 78 S.Ct. 1253, 2 L.Ed.2d 1514 (1958), and any entry \u201cof a residence at night is of an order of magnitude greater than that\u201d resulting from a daytime search or seizure. <em>Gooding v. United States, </em>416 U.S. 430, 463, 94 S.Ct. 1780, 40 L.Ed.2d 250 (1974). On the other hand, we recognize that community caretaking actions are intended \u201cto assist the general public or a specific person or persons other than the one whose rights are implicated by the search or seizure.\u201d Michael R. Dimino, Sr., <em>Police Paternalism: Community Caretaking, Assistance Searches, and Fourth Amendment Reasonableness, </em>66 Wash &amp; Lee L.Rev. 1485, 1541 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Although his Fourth Amendment rights would ordinarily be at their zenith when he is home at night, appellant \u201cundermined\u201d his right to privacy \u201cby projecting loud noises into the neighborhood in the wee hours of the morning, thereby significantly disrupting his neighbors\u2019 peace.\u201d <em>United States v.

But appellant should not be rewarded\u2014and the neighborhood penalized\u2014for the extended period of police patience and restraint. <em>See </em>3 Wayne R. LaFave, A Treatise on the Fourth Amendment, \u00a7 5.1(b), p. 18 (4th ed. 2004) (\u201cWarrantless arrests have been upheld even when it appeared that there was ample time to obtain an arrest warrant beforehand.\u201d); <em>Trupiano v. United States, </em>334 U.S. 699, 705, 68 S.Ct. 1229, 92 L.Ed. 1663 (1948) (\u201cThe absence of a warrant of arrest, even though there was sufficient time to obtain one, does not [necessarily] destroy the validity of an arrest[.]\u201d). It was, in our view, reasonable not to wait another hour or more before entering the apartment to abate the noise and, in doing so, to arrest appellant, because cessation of the noise could not be ensured if appellant remained in his apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">In sum, we hold that the entry into appellant\u2019s apartment and his warrantless arrest were lawful, and that the evidence was sufficient to support appellant\u2019s conviction for resisting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>that arrest.

Here, it was an ongoing late-at-night assault on the peace and good order of the community that excused the warrant requirement and permitted a forceful entry into the apartment to abate the disturbance that brought the police to the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">\n<em>Jury Instruction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">\u201cThe court shall give instructions to the jury at the conclusion of all the evidence and before closing arguments.\u201d Md.

It follows, therefore, that when the instructions are lacking in some vital detail or convey some prejudicial or confusing message, however inadvertently, the ability of the jury to discharge its duty of returning a true verdict based on the evidence is impaired.

We therefore find that a drug addict who uses premises which he himself occupies as a residence, to store and conceal drugs for his own exclusive use, and does not use those premises to store or conceal drugs used or to be used by others, is not guilty of maintaining a common nuisance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 48, 308 A.2d 696. Similarly, David E.
