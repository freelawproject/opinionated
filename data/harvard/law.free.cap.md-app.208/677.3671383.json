Appellant\u2019s trial began on August 12, 2010. In his opening statement, defense counsel disclosed that appellant had offered to take a lie detector test. The court sustained the State\u2019s objection and gave a curative instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-10\">Two days later, after the State\u2019s presentation of four witnesses, the prosecutor moved for a mistrial based on defense counsel\u2019s opening statement disclosing appellant\u2019s offer to take a lie detector test. The court granted the State\u2019s motion and declared a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>Appellant subsequently filed a motion to dismiss the charges against him, arguing that a retrial was barred by double jeopardy principles. The court denied appellant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">On appeal,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appellant raises the following question for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-6\">Did the trial court err when it denied appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss when there was no manifest necessity for the mistrial?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">For the reasons that follow, we answer that question in the negative, and we shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b703-10\">Because appellant raises only an issue of procedural error, we need not set forth all the facts adduced at trial. <em>See Washington v. State, </em>190 Md.App. 168, 171, 988 A.2d 61 (2010). Rather, we will briefly state the nature of the case and the facts pertinent to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-11\">The charges against appellant arose from the July 1, 2009, shooting of Mr. Christopher Wright outside his apartment. Mr. Wright\u2019s death followed an altercation between appellant and Mr. Wright\u2019s roommate, Mr. Razaq Sarumi, during which appellant shot Mr. Sarumi, injuring his leg.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-12\">After Mr. Sarumi spit outside a window overlooking the front entrance to the apartment building, which caused appellant to become angry, appellant and Mr. Sarumi argued. Appellant ultimately pulled out a gun and began \u201crubbing\u201d it. He then went into an apartment on the first floor. Appellant came back out with the gun and fired one shot, which grazed Mr. Sarumi\u2019s leg. At that time, Mr. Wright was standing in front of a nearby apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-13\">Mr. Sarumi ran toward the road. Before he reached the median, he heard a couple of shots in the building. When he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>turned around, he saw appellant coming out of the building. Appellant then fired a shot from the sidewalk. After that shot, Mr. Sarumi ran across New Hampshire Avenue and saw appellant and appellant\u2019s girlfriend running toward University Boulevard. Mr. Sarumi called 911.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">On July 3, 2009, Mr. Sarumi viewed a photo array. He identified appellant as the person who shot him and who had the gun prior to the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">Officer Ricky Serrano, a member of the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department, responded to the apartment building at 9:47 p.m. When he arrived, he saw drops of blood on the steps leading to the door of Apartment 101. On the steps leading to the second floor, he found a black male face down with a gunshot wound to his back. The man was not conscious or responsive.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">Prior to trial, appellant filed a motion to suppress the statement he had given to the police after he was arrested, arguing that the statement was made involuntarily. After a hearing, the circuit court denied appellant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">During opening statement, appellant\u2019s attorney asserted that, following his arrest, appellant was mistreated by the police and tricked into making an involuntary statement. Defense counsel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: You will hear that when my client was arrested, he was held for ten hours in a frigid interrogation room. He was given no food. He was allowed to make no phone calls. He had no grandmother or paid lawyers rushing down to help him. He was entirely alone. And a rotation of experienced homicide detectives tried every trick in the book to try to get Stephen Simmons to admit that he had shot Christopher Wright.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-10\">They even lied to him. They told Stephen Simmons that Christopher Wright had survived and had identified him as the shooter. But even though he was shivering cold, he was exhausted and utterly alone, Stephen Simmons had one thing on his side that protected him. He was actually innocent of the death\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>[PROSECUTOR]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-4\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]:\u2014of Christopher Wright.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-5\">THE COURT: The objection is sustained as to innocence. The State\u2019s burden is to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. That\u2019s a factual issue for you. The assertions by the attorneys are to be ignored in that regard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-6\">You may continue, counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Thank you, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-8\">You will hear him protest his innocence through the long hours of questioning, tell the detectives over and over again the one thing that he knew to be true, \u201cI did not shoot that man.... \u201d Stephen Simmons offered to take a lie detector test.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-9\">[PROSECUTOR]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-10\">THE COURT: The objection is sustained. Let me just tell you jurors when all the evidence begins, you\u2019re going to have to consider the evidence as opposed to what counsel says, what the State says, and what the defense says. But I sustained the objection with regard to the lie detector test. That\u2019s not something you can consider. It\u2019s not something you can be permitted to consider.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-11\">The State then began the presentation of its case against appellant. The next day, the court recessed early to consider the admissibility of the testimony of the State\u2019s firearms expert, which the court ultimately determined was not admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-12\">The following day, the prosecutor requested that the court declare a mistrial based on defense counsel\u2019s opening statement that appellant \u201coffered to take a lie detector test.\u201d In making his motion, the prosecutor asserted that he was very aware that, if the State\u2019s motion for a mistrial was granted, appellant would argue that retrial was barred based on double jeopardy. He indicated that he did not make this request lightly, stating that he \u201cspent all night thinking about whether to make this motion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>The prosecution argued that defense counsel\u2019s comment in opening statement left the State in an untenable position because it was prohibited from introducing any evidence regarding polygraph examinations. Specifically, he asserted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-5\">[W]e\u2019re in a position where prior to the State introducing any evidence, defense counsel has told the petit jury, who has absolutely no instructions, no law, they have no information about the case, that his belief was there would be evidence that the defendant offered to take a lie detector test. Now, the State has absolutely no way to confront the defendant on that, no way to present evidence as to the voracity [sic] of that, or present evidence to deal with that issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">The prosecutor relied on <em>Kosmas v. State, </em>316 Md. 587, 592, 597-98, 560 A.2d 1137 (1989), where a witness disclosed that the defendant had declined to take a lie detector test, and the Court of Appeals determined that some references to polygraph examinations are so prejudicial that they cannot be addressed solely through the court\u2019s curative instructions. The Court stated that such a statement \u201cis akin to the placing of a nail in a board. The nail can be pulled out, but the hole made by the nail cannot be removed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 598, 560 A.2d 1137.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">According to the prosecutor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-8\">That\u2019s the exact situation we\u2019re in here. There is no argument that defense counsel can offer to the Court that that nail that went into every single juror\u2019s brain about defendant offering to take a lie detector test, although it can be removed by you sustaining the objection, giving a curative instruction, the hole is still there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-9\">I can\u2019t confront the defendant about it because he has a constitutional right to remain silent. I can\u2019t admit evidence concerning the voracity [sic] of that statement or confront that statement. So I\u2019m left starting out with a petit jury, despite whatever evidence I introduce, that already has an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>impact that I cannot address. If that\u2019s not manifest necessity, I don\u2019t know what is.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">The prosecutor concluded by arguing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-6\">The State cannot be assured, based on that comment and despite the Court\u2019s immediate curative instruction, that I\u2019m not sitting there with one, two, three, or more jurors who will consider that fact, because it is such a powerful piece of information that cannot be addressed, that manifest necessity requires the Court to grant a mistrial and we start anew. The State deserves a fair trial just as much as the defendant, and the moment those words were uttered, that nail was nailed, that hole was made, and although you can pull out the nail, you cannot fill in that hole.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">Appellant\u2019s attorney responded that his statement was \u201cin the context of addressing a statement that the State had made every indication was going to be admitted by them at trial.\u201d He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-8\">I would remind the Court that we had a suppression hearing in which I was opposing the admission of my client\u2019s statement, a recorded statement, that I had had the opportunity to hear ten hours[ ] worth of, and never at any point did the State indicate to me that they were interested in only part of the statement. And when I made my opposition known, I asked to have the statement suppressed both on the entirety and the final two hours, which occurred after more events of constitutional dimension, the State argued for every part of the statement to come in, that they intended to use it in their case in chief.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-9\">Counsel contended that the State had not indicated that it intended to use only a portion of appellant\u2019s statement during the trial; therefore, assuming that the State was going to present appellant\u2019s whole statement to the jury, defense counsel commented during his opening statement upon those parts of the statement that were favorable to appellant. He described the statement about the lie detector test as \u201ca fleeting reference,\u201d which was made during opening statement and not by a witness as evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>Defense counsel further argued that any misstatement so prejudicial as to justify a mistrial under the manifest necessity standard would be so immediately obvious as to engender an immediate request for a mistrial. Here, however, the request was not made until two days later, \u201cafter a number of State\u2019s witnesses [had] testified,\u201d and the \u201cState has had an opportunity to make an assessment of whether they\u2019ve been effective witnesses or not.\u201d Appellant\u2019s attorney suggested that the State\u2019s failure to request a mistrial immediately after he made the improper statement indicated that the prosecutor had a different motive for his tardy motion for a mistrial. He argued that the motion was motivated more by the trial court\u2019s exclusion of the expert testimony of the State\u2019s firearms examiner than by any fear that the jury was prejudiced by defense counsel\u2019s \u201cfleeting\u201d reference to appellant\u2019s offer to take a lie detector test, which was promptly addressed by the court through a curative instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">The prosecution disputed the assertion that the motion for mistrial was motivated by the exclusion of the firearms examiner, as opposed to the prejudice from defense counsel\u2019s statement. Noting that the firearms examiner \u201chad a very limited opinion,\u201d which was \u201cthat a fragment of a bullet or casing that was found at the crime scene and the slug or the cartridge that was taken out of the body of Christopher Wright, had similar class characteristics,\u201d the prosecutor explained that the firearms evidence \u201chad no direct relation to the defendant\u201d and \u201cvery little impact on proving the defendant\u2019s guilt. It was simply for corroboration purposes and to show that the State had done what should be done in cases, which is to adequately investigat[e] them and all the evidence related to them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">The circuit court credited the State\u2019s explanation, stating that it did \u201cnot question the motive of the State in filing a motion for mistrial at this point in time.\u201d The court\u2019s assessment of the importance <em>of the </em>firearms expert\u2019s testimony was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-7\">It really is not powerful evidence [in] the Court\u2019s opinion and the prosecution of this case[,] within the Court\u2019s assess<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>ment so far from opening statements and what [it\u2019s] observed and the observation of the videotaped interrogation^] is that this case is going to rise and fall upon whether or not the jury believes the testimony of Mr. Sarumi and/or other persons who will testify.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">The Court found that the delay in making the motion for a mistrial was not evidence of an improper motive, stating that it did not see \u201cany reason for the State to be trying to make a runaround the evidence that has been allowed or not allowed and to seek refuge in an opportunity to get those things in by virtue of the declaration of a mistrial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">Noting that the State had made a timely objection to the comment defense counsel made in opening statement, it characterized its response \u201cto be somewhat of a blurt, so to speak, in an effort to cure what the [c]ourt accepts as an absolute transgression as to presenting to a jury the notion that that which is inadmissible might be considered.\u201d The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-7\">An opening statement is a powerful setting when counsel has the opportunity to introduce into the minds of the jury what will and what will not be presented to them in determining the issues in the case. The Court would accept that a lot of flourish is allowed with regard to opening statements and closing arguments, but the Court believes that each counsel is charged with respecting and appreciating certain limits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-8\">In this particular instance, we\u2019re dealing with a statement not made by a witness, not unexpectedly presented by a witness, but a statement carefully made as part of a preview of the evidence to the jury. Indeed, considering that the jury has no right to expect that Mr. Simmons would testify, and that even if he were to testify, his testimony would be, \u201cI did not shoot anyone,\u201d the statement, in effect, constituted a substitute for the defendant\u2019s testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-9\">The Court, especially upon the cross-examination quite skillful of Mr. Sarumi, is satisfied that credibility is central to the prosecution of this case. It\u2019s central to the defense of the case. The Court considers the motion to be timely. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>The Court believes that the prejudice to the State\u2019s ability to have a fair trial is clear, because in a case so close as this, that relies upon the credibility of witnesses, there is no way to erase the potential infection of the jurors\u2019 minds as to, well, he offered to take a lie detector test. That satisfies it for me. It may not be articulated, but that might be the determining factor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-5\">The Court finds that as a matter of manifest necessity, a mistrial must be declared to ensure that the State is not deprived of a fair trial, and to ensure that the jurors are not permitted to allow knowledge that there was an offer of a lie detector test to cause them to find that the State was not able to meet its burden.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">A mistrial is declared.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">On August 26, 2010, appellant filed a Motion to Dismiss Charges Due to Violation of Double Jeopardy. Appellant argued that there was no manifest necessity warranting a mistrial. By order filed on August 27, 2010, the circuit court denied appellant\u2019s motion. On September 13, 2010, appellant filed a timely Notice of Appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b710-9\">Appellant asserts that the circuit court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the charges against him. Noting that double jeopardy principles prohibit a retrial if a court grants a mistrial over the defendant\u2019s objection and there is no manifest necessity for a mistrial, appellant contends that the trial court here abused its discretion in finding manifest necessity to support a mistrial. He argues that the reference in open<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>ing statement to his offer to take a lie detector was isolated, his credibility was not at issue, the evidence against him \u201cappeared strong at the point the mistrial was declared,\u201d no inference could be drawn as to the results of the test, and it was irrelevant that defense counsel made the remark. Attacking the motives of the prosecutor, he asserts that, \u201c[g'liven both the delay in making the motion and the timing of when it was made,\u201d it can be inferred \u201cthat the prosecutor sought the mistrial because he perceived his case was going poorly and not because he perceived he had been unfairly prejudiced by one sentence in an opening statement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">The State contends that the circuit court correctly denied appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss because manifest necessity required the grant of a mistrial. It asserts that appellant\u2019s counsel \u201cplaced highly prejudicial, inadmissible information before the jury.\u201d By stating that appellant \u201coffered to take a polygraph examination as evidence that he was actually innocent,\u201d this statement was made \u201cin a fashion that was tantamount to improper vouching.\u201d The State further argues that the trial court properly found that the prosecution moved for a mistrial \u201cbecause of the damage done by defense counsel\u2019s improper opening remarks, not for an improper purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">Generally, the State is afforded only a single opportunity to require a defendant to stand trial. <em>Arizona v. Washington, </em>434 U.S. 497, 505, 98 S.Ct. 824, 54 L.Ed.2d 717 (1978). The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, made applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, \u201cprotects individuals from being tried for the same offense more than once,\u201d providing, in pertinent part: \u201c \u2018nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\u2019 \u201d <em>Taylor v. State, </em>381 Md. 602, 610, 851 A.2d 551 (2004) (quoting U.S. Const. amend. V).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">Where, as in the instant case, the jury has been empaneled and sworn, the protection of the Double Jeopardy Clause has attached. <em>Hubbard v. State, </em>395 Md. 73, 90, 909 A.2d 270 (2006). Once jeopardy attaches, the State is prohibited from retrying the accused if the trial court declares a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>mistrial without the defendant\u2019s consent, \u201c \u2018unless there is a showing of \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d to declare the mistrial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Taylor, </em>381 Md. at 611, 851 A.2d 551 (quoting <em>State v. Woodson, </em>338 Md. 322, 329, 658 A.2d 272 (1995)). The \u201c \u2018manifest necessity* \u201d standard has been interpreted as meaning that \u201ca mistrial is appropriate when there is a \u2018high degree\u2019 of necessity.\u201d <em>Renico v. Lett, </em>559 U.S. 766, 130 S.Ct. 1855, 1863, 176 L.Ed.2d 678 (2010) (quoting <em>Washington, </em>434 U.S. at 506, 98 S.Ct. 824).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">\u201cA trial judge shall declare a mistrial only under extraordinary circumstances and \u2018where there is [] manifest necessity\u2019 to do so.\u201d <em>Benjamin v. State, </em>131 Md.App. 527, 541, 749 A.2d 273 (2000) (quoting <em>Wilhelm v. State, </em>272 Md. 404, 429, 430, 326 A.2d 707 (1974)). \u201cThe declaration of a mistrial is an extraordinary act which should only be granted if necessary to serve the ends of justice.\u201d <em>Braxton v. State, </em>123 Md.App. 599, 666-67, 720 A.2d 27 (1998). \u201cWhether manifest necessity to declare a mistrial and avoid double jeopardy exists is based upon the unique facts and circumstances of each case.\u201d <em>Hubbard, </em>395 Md. at 90, 909 A.2d 270. The State must demonstrate that there is \u201cno reasonable alternative to the declaration of a mistrial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 91, 909 A.2d 270. A trial court\u2019s decision to declare a mistrial based on its assessment of the prejudicial impact of improper argument is entitled to great deference, and it shall be reversed only for an abuse of discretion. <em>Washington, </em>434 U.S. at 514, 98 S.Ct. 824. <em>Miles v. State, </em>365 Md. 488, 569-70, 781 A.2d 787 (2001), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 1163, 122 S.Ct. 1175, 152 L.Ed.2d 118 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">A ruling generally will not be deemed to be an abuse of discretion unless it is \u201c \u2018well removed from any center mark imagined by the reviewing court and is beyond the fringe of what that court deems minimally acceptable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Moreland v. State, </em>207 Md.App. 563, 569, 53 A.3d 449 (2012) (quoting <em>Gray v. State, </em>388 Md. 366, 383, 879 A.2d 1064 (2005)). <em>Accord Morris v. State, </em>204 Md.App. 487, 492, 42 A.3d 83 (2012) (This Court will find an abuse of discretion only \u201c \u2018where no reasonable person would take the view adopted by the [trial] court.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>King v. State, </em>407 Md. 682, 697, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>967 A.2d 790 (2009)). In reviewing a trial court\u2019s ruling in this regard, we observe that the trial court \u201cis ordinarily in a uniquely superior position to gauge the potential for prejudice in a particular case.\u201d <em>Watters v. State, </em>328 Md. 38, 50, 612 A.2d 1288 (1992), <em>cert. denied, </em>507 U.S. 1024, 113 S.Ct. 1832, 123 L.Ed.2d 460 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">In <em>Washington, </em>434 U.S. at 498-99, 98 S.Ct. 824 the United States Supreme Court considered a factually analogous case, where the trial court granted the State\u2019s request for a mistrial after defense counsel made improper remarks during opening statement. Washington was being tried for a second time because the prosecutor had withheld exculpatory evidence from the defense at his first trial. <em>Id. </em>at 498, 98 S.Ct. 824. During opening statement, defense counsel improperly disclosed that the prosecution had purposely withheld evidence in the previous trial and a new trial was granted because of the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct. <em>Id. </em>at 499, 98 S.Ct. 824.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">In upholding the trial court\u2019s determination that manifest necessity existed for a mistrial, the Supreme Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AsD\">An improper opening statement unquestionably tends to frustrate the public interest in having a just judgment reached by an impartial tribunal. Indeed, such statements create a risk, often not present in the individual juror bias situation, that the entire panel may be tainted. The trial judge, of course, may instruct the jury to disregard the improper comment. In extreme cases, he may discipline counsel, or even remove him from the trial.... Those actions, however, will not necessarily remove the risk of bias that may be created by improper argument .... the trial judge must have the power to declare a mistrial in appropriate cases. The interest in orderly, impartial procedure would be impaired if he were deterred from exercising that power by a concern that anytime a reviewing court disagreed with his assessment of the trial situation a retrial would automatically be barred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 512-13, 98 S.Ct. 824 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">The Court stated that \u201cthe overriding interest in the evenhanded administration of justice requires that we accord the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>highest degree of respect to the trial judge\u2019s evaluation of the likelihood that the impartiality of one or more jurors may have been affected by the improper comment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 511, 98 S.Ct. 824. While recognizing \u201cthat the extent of the possible bias cannot be measured,\u201d and \u201cthat some trial judges might have proceeded with the trial after giving the jury appropriate cautionary instructions,\u201d the Supreme Court upheld the trial court\u2019s decision that manifest necessity existed for the mistrial. <em>Id. </em>at 511, 516, 98 S.Ct. 824. In so holding, the Court declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-4\">Neither party has a right to have his case decided by a jury which may be tainted by bias; in these circumstances, the public\u2019s interest in fair trials designed to end in just judgments must prevail over the defendant\u2019s valued right to have his trial concluded before the first jury impaneled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 516, 98 S.Ct. 824 (footnotes omitted) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">Here, defense counsel\u2019s comment in opening statement, that appellant had offered to take a lie detector test to prove his innocence, was improper. As the Court of Appeals has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-7\">\u201c[I]t is universally held that evidence of the defendant\u2019s willingness or unwillingness to submit to a lie detector examination is inadmissible.\u201d \u201cWe have resisted exhortations to admit evidence regarding polygraph tests.\u201d The reliability of such tests has not been established to our satisfaction, and we have consistently refused to permit evidence with regard to them. In our system of criminal justice, the trier of fact is the lie detector, and we have been steadfast in disallowing that function to be usurped by a process we have not found to be trustworthy. Mention at a criminal trial of the results of a polygraph test, or the taking of the test, or the willingness or unwillingness to take the test, raises the specter of reversal. In criminal prosecutions, the polygraph test is a pariah; \u201cpolygraph\u201d is a dirty word.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number><em>State v. Hawkins, </em>326 Md. 270, 275, 604 A.2d 489 (1992) (citations omitted). <em>Accord Pantazes v. State, </em>141 Md.App. 422, 436, 785 A.2d 865 (2001), <em>cert. denied, </em>368 Md. 241, 792 A.2d 1178 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">The circuit court found that defense counsel\u2019s use of the \u201cdirty word\u201d here was an \u201cabsolute transgression\u201d of the rule precluding references concerning polygraph examinations for the consideration of the jury. The question for this Court is whether defense counsel\u2019s disclosure was so prejudicial that the trial court properly exercised its discretion in determining that manifest necessity existed to declare a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">When reference is made to a witness\u2019 willingness to take a lie detector test, several factors \u201cshould be considered in determining whether the evidence was so prejudicial that it denied [a party] a fair trial.\u201d <em>Kosmas, </em>316 Md. at 594, 560 A.2d 1137. These factors include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-7\">\u201cwhether the reference to a lie detector was repeated or whether it was a single, isolated statement; whether the reference was solicited by counsel, or was an inadvertent and unresponsive statement; whether the witness making the reference is the principal witness upon whom the entire prosecution depends; whether credibility is a crucial issue; whether a great deal of other evidence exists; and, whether an inference as to the result of the test can be drawn.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZP\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Guesfeird v. State, </em>300 Md. 653, 659, 480 A.2d 800 (1984)). \u201cNo single factor is determinative in any case. The factors themselves are not the test, but rather, they help to evaluate whether the defendant was prejudiced.\u201d <em>Guesfeird, </em>300 Md. at 659, 480 A.2d 800.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">Applying these factors to the present case, we agree with the circuit court that the statement by defense counsel was so prejudicial that a mistrial was warranted. To be sure, defense counsel\u2019s disclosure of appellant\u2019s offer to take a he detector test was an isolated statement. As the trial court noted, however, the prejudicial comment was \u201cnot unexpectedly presented by a witness,\u201d but rather, it was an assertion by appellant\u2019s attorney in the \u201cpowerful setting\u201d of opening state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>ment, where defense counsel had the \u201copportunity to introduce into the minds of the jury\u201d his theory of the case. As the prosecutor noted, opening statements can \u201chave major impacts on juries.\u201d Defense counsel\u2019s remarks in this case were an effort to establish the credibility of appellant\u2019s claims of innocence, even without any assurance that appellant would take the stand and expose his claims to cross-examination. As the trial court observed, defense counsel\u2019s remark, \u201cin effect, constituted a substitute for the defendant\u2019s testimony.\u201d Because appellant\u2019s willingness to take a lie detector exam was offered by defense counsel as proof that his protestations of innocence to the police were genuine, i.e., that he was not the shooter, it impacted the central issue at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Compounding the prejudice accruing to the State is that there was no way for the State to explain or otherwise mitigate defense counsel\u2019s disclosure. Because the law prohibits mention of polygraph examinations, the State could not address defense counsel\u2019s improper disclosure or his implied assertion of appellant\u2019s innocence in any meaningful way.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">The circuit court concluded that, given that this was a close case that relied on the credibility of witnesses, \u201cthere is no way to erase the potential infection of the jurors\u2019 minds\u201d caused by defense counsel\u2019s improper disclosure. The court, therefore, concluded that the prejudice to the State\u2019s ability to have a fair trial was clear, that the motion for a mistrial was based on that prejudice, and not a perception that the State\u2019s case was going poorly, and that there was manifest necessity for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">There was substantial evidence to support the trial court\u2019s factual findings in this regard. The circuit court did not abuse its discretion in determining that manifest necessity existed. <em>See United States v. Gantley, </em>172 F.3d 422, 427-28 (6th Cir.1999) (mistrial manifestly necessary where defendant disclosed during cross-examination that he had taken a lie detector test); <em>Pettigrew v. Hardy, </em>403 F.Supp. 869, 870 (D.Ariz.1975) (affirming, on habeas review, state court\u2019s conclusion that a mistrial was necessary after the defendant testified that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>he passed a lie detector test); <em>Ferby v. Blankenship, </em>501 F.Supp. 89, 92 (E.D.Va.1980) (affirming, on habeas review, state court\u2019s conclusion that, after a witness testified that the defendant was willing to take a lie detector test, a mistrial was appropriate because \u201c[curative] instructions could not preserve the integrity of the verdict\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Because there was manifest necessity to declare a mistrial, double jeopardy principles do not prevent a retrial. Accordingly, the circuit court did not err in denying appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss the charges against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY AFFIRMED.
