Appellants raise four issues, which we rephrase and reorder as follows:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-5\">I. Whether the circuit court erred in entering judgment in favor of appellees as to the direct claim for fraudulent inducement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-6\">II. Whether the circuit court erred in finding that appellees had standing to bring derivative claims on Moutiny\u2019s behalf against appellants?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-7\">III. Whether the circuit court erred in exercising personal jurisdiction over Dynacorp and Fadul as to the seven derivative claims?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-8\">IV. Whether the circuit court erred in entering judgment in favor of appellees as to the seven derivative claims?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">For the reasons set forth below, we answer the first three questions in the negative. We answer the fourth question in the affirmative. We, therefore, affirm the judgment of the circuit court as to Count I, fraudulent inducement, and affirm the award of $45,089,392.81, plus interest. We vacate the judgments of the circuit court as to Count II through Count VIII, the derivative claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">Because our resolution of question I involves the legal sufficiency of the evidence, we must set forth the lengthy and detailed facts of the case. The facts set forth below are summarized from testimony and exhibits introduced at trial, and the pleadings and motions filed in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">In 2003, after the United States invaded Iraq, much of Iraq\u2019s infrastructure, including Iraq\u2019s wireless telecommunications network, was damaged, destroyed, or obsolete. Fadul\u2014 who had been born and educated in Iraq, but immigrated to the United States in 1981\u2014saw an opportunity to make money and \u201chelp Iraqis\u201d by providing telecommunications. As a result, Fadul traveled to Iraq to set up a telecommunications company and work with the Ministry of Communications of Iraq (the \u201cMOC\u201d) to operate a wireless local loop (\u201cWLL\u201d) network.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In 2004, with the help of Niran Al-Hadethy, an Iraqi attorney, Fadul organized and incorporated an Iraqi company whose English name was \u201cVitalTel\u201d and whose Arabic name was \u201cAl Khat Al Hayawi.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For at least two years, Fadul and his staff engaged in discussions with the Minister of Telecommunications of the MOC to establish a contract between VitalTel and the Iraqi Telecommunications and Post Company (the \u201cITPC\u201d)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> for the license necessary to provide telecommunications in Iraq through a WLL network.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">(1) The VitalTel License</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">On November 27, 2005, VitalTel and the ITPC entered into a WLL Operations and Management Agreement (the \u201cLi~ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>cense\u201d), which permitted VitalTel to provide wireless telephone services in ten provinces in Iraq<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> for eight years with the option to renew the license for an additional eight years. Under the License, VitalTel agreed to \u201cmake investments, provide and install equipment, set up, operate and maintain the access network and provide Services in Iraq based on a WLL[ ] system!.]\u201d VitalTel expended $2,600,000 to obtain the License, and valued the License at $75,000,000. According to Fadul, at the time VitalTel obtained the License, VitalTel lacked the funds to build the required network. As a result, Fadul began to search for investors to finance the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">(2) The Joint Venture</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">Salkini is: (1) the CEO and owner of Tecore, Inc. (\u201cTe-core\u201d), a telecommunications company headquartered in Columbia, Maryland, (2) the managing director and owner of TWS, a company based in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, responsible for telecommunications projects in the Middle East and Africa,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and (3) the director of Aramtel, a United Arab Emirates holding company that is owned by Salkini\u2019s brother and invests in telecommunications operations. In 2005, Salkini began negotiations with Fadul to invest in Vital-Tel. On December 14, 2005, Fadul sent Salkini an e-mail, attaching a document concerning VitalTel titled the \u201cEight Year Financial Plan\u201d (the \u201cPlan\u201d). The Plan contained no restrictions or disclaimers, and projected large profits for VitalTel over the course of eight years. On December 22, 2005, Fadul sent Salkini an e-mail, attaching a document titled \u201cBusiness Plan and Fiscal Infusion Analysis\u201d (the \u201cbusiness model\u201d). The business model stated that \u201cVitalTel [was] positioned to become [t]he Verizon of Iraq[,]\u201d and projected a net profit in excess of $1,000,000,000 by VitalTel\u2019s fifth year.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>On or around January 30, 2006, Fadul sent Salkini a document, titled the \u201cVitelTel Summary Proposal\u201d (the \u201cProposal\u201d), that outlined a business plan for VitalTel. The Proposal contained a disclaimer on the cover, stating: \u201cThis document is not meant to be relied upon by investors.\u201d The Proposal touted that \u201cVitalTel [was] positioned to become [t]he Verizon of Iraq by installing and operating a national wireless telephone and data network in Iraq\u201d and projected profits of over $1,000,000,000 by VitalTel\u2019s eighth year.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">On February 1, 2006, Fadul sent Salkini an e-mail, stating: \u201cAttached please find VitalTel\u2019s article of [injcorporation [from] Iraq[,]\u201d and attached a document titled \u201c[V]it[a]l[T]el [CJontract.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The document\u2019s first page displayed the name \u201cVitalTel\u201d in English and VitalTel\u2019s logo and telephone number, but was otherwise in Arabic. An English translation of the document attached to Fadul\u2019s February 1, 2006, e-mail states that: (1) Fadul is the sole owner and founder of \u201cAlKhat Al-Hayawi,\u201d (2) the name of the company is \u201c Al-Khat Al-Hayawi\u2019 (VitalTel),\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and (3) the company is headquartered in Baghdad, Iraq.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">(a) March 2006 Moutiny Operating Agreement (\u201cMarch Operating Agreement\u201d) and Creation of Moutiny</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">On March 16, 2006, Aramtel and VitalTel entered into an agreement titled the \u201cMoutiny Limited Operating Agreement\u201d (the \u201cMarch Operating Agreement\u201d), in which the parties agreed to authorize the formation of a company known as Moutiny,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> incorporated in the United Arab Emirates. Fadul was to serve as Moutiny\u2019s managing member and chief executive officer. Salkini signed the March Operating Agreement on behalf of Aramtel, as director, and Fadul signed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>agreement on behalf of VitalTel, as chief executive officer. Fadul signed the March Operating Agreement for VitalTel and TeckTel<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> for the purpose of binding VitalTel and TeckTel. Salkini signed the March Operating Agreement for TWS for the purpose of binding TWS. The March Operating Agreement identified Moutiny\u2019s purposes, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-5\">(i) to provide [WLL] and other telecommunication services in the Republic of Iraq and elsewhere;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-6\">(ii) to acquire, develop, exploit, sublicense, and otherwise deal in licenses, permits, and all manner of rights to provide wireless telecommunications serviees[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">The March Operating Agreement contained the following language in Section 1.8:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-8\">Enforceability of the terms of this Agreement under the laws of any Jurisdiction and the transfer of any Equipment Funds or Operating Funds (as set forth in Section 3.8(ii)) is subject to the approval of this Agreement and TWS as equipment supplier by the Republic of Iraq Ministry of Communications.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">As part of the March Operating Agreement, Aramtel agreed to contribute $500,000 in cash and VitelTel agreed to contribute the License, which was valued by the parties at $500,000 and described as \u201cthat certain WLL O &amp; M Agreement by and between [ITPC] and VitelTel, dated November 27, 2005.\u201d Aramtel agreed to lend Moutiny up to $25,000,000 to purchase telecommunications equipment from TWS and an additional $5,000,000 for operating expenses. Both Aramtel and VitalTel were to own 50% of Moutiny. Section 14.5 of the March Operating Agreement provided: \u201cIrrespective of the place of execution or performance, this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>Arab Emirates, exclusive of any conflicts of laws principles.\u201d On March 16, 2006, the same day on which the March Operating Agreement was signed, TWS and Moutiny entered into a \u201cWireless System Supply Purchase Agreement\u201d (the \u201cMarch Purchase Agreement\u201d), in which TWS agreed to sell Moutiny the equipment necessary to set up the \u201csystem.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">According to Fadul, in March 2006, the ITPC declined to approve the transfer of the License from VitalTel to Moutiny and to agree to the use of TWS equipment, and the March Operating Agreement lapsed as anticipated by Section 1.8 of the March Operating Agreement. Nonetheless, Fadul and Salkini continued discussions about reaching a new agreement. On April 7, 2006, Fadul and Salkini met at Fadul\u2019s office in Virginia to discuss \u201cgetting the deal back on track[.]\u201d At that meeting, the parties discussed the terms of a potential new operating agreement for Moutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">(b) April 2006 Operating Agreement (\u201cApril Operating Agreement\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">On April 12, 2006, in Columbia, Maryland, Aramtel and Dynacorp\u2014a company owned solely by Fadul\u2014entered into an agreement titled the \u201cMoutiny Limited Operating Agreement\u201d (the \u201cApril Operating Agreement\u201d), in which the parties again agreed upon the organization of Moutiny. Salkini signed the April Operating Agreement on behalf of Aramtel, as director, and Fadul signed the agreement on behalf of Dynacorp, as director. Salkini signed the April Operating Agreement for TWS, for the purpose of binding TWS. Fadul signed the April Operating Agreement for TeckTel, for the purpose of binding TeckTel, and providing ownership of Dynacorp. As in the March Operating Agreement, Fadul was to serve as the managing member of Moutiny as well as the chief executive officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">The April Operating Agreement provided that \u201cthe parties [ ] organized Moutiny Limited to own 100% of the ownership interests in Vit[a]lTel\u201d and that \u201cthe parties desire to set forth and agree upon the terms and conditions governing the operation of Moutiny!.]\u201d In Section 1.3 of the April Operating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>Agreement, Moutiny\u2019s purposes are identified, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-4\">(i) to own 100% of the ownership interests in Vit[a]lTel, which shall be engaged in the business of providing [WLL] and other telecommunication services in the Republic of Iraq and elsewhere; Vit[a]lTel\u2019s responsibilities shall include, but shall not be limited to, the installation, commissioning, and provisioning of all systems, operations and maintenance of all systems, and sales and marketing of [WLL] Services;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-5\">The parties acknowledge and agree that the primary purpose and function of [Moutiny] is to serve as a \u201cholding-company\u201d to own all of the ownership interests in Vit[a]lTel, and that Vit[a]lTel (and not the company) shall conduct business operations to carry out the activities specified in clause (i), above.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">As to initial capital contributions, in Section 3.1 of the April Operating Agreement, Aramtel agreed to contribute $500,000 in cash.

The March Operating Agreement was between Aramtel and VitalTel, and provided that VitalTel would transfer to Moutiny the License, which Moutiny would use to provide WLL and other telecommunication services in Iraq. In contrast, the April Operating Agreement was between Aramtel and Dynacorp, and provided that Moutiny would solely own VitalTel\u2014the company that would provide WLL and other telecommunication services in Iraq. In the March Operating Agreement, Aramtel and Vital-Tel each owned 50% of Moutiny, but in the April Operating Agreement, Aramtel and Dynacorp each owned 50% of Moutiny. The March Operating Agreement was contingent upon the MOC\u2019s approval of TWS as equipment supplier, as outlined in Section 1.8, whereas the April Operating Agreement contained no such contingency.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">The March Operating Agreement provided that the agreement be \u201cgoverned by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United Arab Emirates,\u201d whereas the April Operating Agreement provided that the agreement be \u201cgoverned by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland,\u201d and significantly also provided that the agreement had been executed in Maryland and that the parties specifically \u201cagree[d] to resolve any disputes arising hereunder in a court of competent jurisdiction located within the State of Maryland.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>On April 12, 2006, Salkini and Fadul also executed a \u201cSecurity Agreement\u201d on behalf of Aramtel and Moutiny, respectively, with Aramtel agreeing to lend Moutiny and VitalTel $30,000,000.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Fadul executed a \u201cLoan Promissory Note\u201d (the \u201cNote\u201d), on behalf of Moutiny and VitalTel, promising to pay Aramtel $30,000,000, plus interest. Moutiny and VitalTel granted Aramtel a security interest in the following: (1) the License; (2) any other license that Moutiny or VitalTel obtained; (3) all of Moutiny\u2019s and VitalTel\u2019s equipment; (4) all related records; and (5) \u201cany substitutes for and any proceeds of any of the foregoing, including insurance proceeds thereof!;.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">On the same day, the parties signed a \u201cWireless System Supply Purchase Agreement\u201d (the \u201cApril Purchase Agreement\u201d). Salkini signed the April Purchase Agreement on behalf of TWS, as managing director, and Fadul signed the agreement on behalf of Moutiny and VitalTel, as chief executive officer. After the April Operating Agreement, the Security Agreement, and the April Purchase Agreement were signed, Aramtel made the required capital contribution of $500,000 and began lending money to Moutiny for operating expenses and the purchase of equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">(c) The Purported Transfer of VitalTel to Moutiny and Suspension of VitalTel\u2019s License</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">After the signing of the April Operating Agreement, the following events transpired with respect to Fadul\u2019s transfer of VitalTel to Moutiny. On May 12, 2006, Salkini sent an e-mail to Fadul informing him that he had signed and forwarded two Arabic documents to Fadul\u2014one titled \u201cContract to Sell Shares\u201d and another titled \u201cAuthorization.\u201d The Contract to Sell Shares provided that Fadul agreed to sell all of his shares of VitalTel to Moutiny. The Authorization, which Salkini signed on behalf of Moutiny, stated that Moutiny authorized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>Al-Hadethy, the legal representative of VitalTel, to sign on behalf of Moutiny \u201cto purchase all the shares in VitalTel[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">On May 20, 2006, Fadul sent Salkini an e-mail in which he stated that Al-Hadethy \u201cshould complete the transaction papers of Moutiny [to VitalTel] by this week\u201d and that she \u201cplans to have them authenticated from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs before we FedEx them to you.\u201d On May 22, 2006, Fadul sent Salkini another e-mail with an update, stating: \u201cI spoke today with [Al-Hadethy] and she thinks she will pick up today the completed papers from the government entity, which registers company\u2019s transactions. She also told me that she intends to take the completed paper work to the Iraqi Foreign ministry for their ratification tomorrow.\u201d On May 30, 2006, Salkini sent an e-mail to Fadul requesting an update on the \u201cstatus of the share transfer of VitalTel\u201d to Moutiny. On June 2, 2006, Fadul sent an e-mail to Salkini attaching a \u201cVital[T]el Document 2,\u201d which he received from Al-Hadethy. The attached document was in Arabic. The record contains no translation of the document.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">A month later, on July 4, 2006, Fadul sent an e-mail to Salkini and stated: \u201cBy the way I was informed Moutiny papers were completed by the Iraqi Foreign Affairs. Where would you like me to sen[d] them to?\u201d Salkini replied, and Fadul responded that he would have Al-Hadethy send the papers via DHL to Salkini at the Tecore address in Dubai.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">On July 16, 2006, Salkini sent an e-mail to Fadul, which stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-8\">We are very concerned that the documents for Moutiny shares transfer [from VitalTel] are still not completed. It now has been several months, and we have committed a very large amount of funding as you know. We need to have all documents by no later than July 18. Please let me know the status, and give me a call to discuss.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">On July 16, 2006, Fadul responded to Salkini via e-mail:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-10\">The papers were completed and ratified by the [Department of [C]ommerce and sent to you.

Moutinyt\u2019s] attorney is following up on them and as soon as I hear any[ ]thing I will let you know.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AHu\">Two days later, on July 19, 2006, Salkini received an e-mail from someone named Nazih Poulos in Dubai, in which he was informed that the \u201cMoutiny Dubai papers\u201d had been received. On July 20, 2006, Salkini received an e-mail from Poulos with an attachment labeled \u201cVitalTel Doe06.\u201d The attached documents were written in Arabic, but displayed the name \u201cVitalTel\u201d in various locations.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> English translations of the documents, introduced into evidence as defense exhibit 34B, demonstrate that the attachment contained the following four documents: (1) \u201cEstablishment of Al-Khat Al-Hayawi (Vital Tel) For telecommunications Services, Ltd.,\u201d in which Al-Hadethy purported to submit an application to the Iraqi Business Registrar \u201cfor the purpose of registering a company in the name of \u2018AI-Khat Al-Hayawi\u2019 (2) \u201cCompletion of Process,\u201d a document from the Iraqi Ministry of Trade which certified that \u201cthe process ha[d] been completed for finalizing the sale of company shares of Al-Hayawi (VitalTel) ... to [ ]Moutiny ... in accordance with Corporate Law # 21\u201d; (3) \u201cBusiness Registration Certificate,\u201d a document from the Company Registrar which reflected that Moutiny owned \u201c100%\u201d of the shares of a company; and (4) a letter from the Iraqi Ministry of Trade to the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs with a subject line titled \u201cConfirmation,\u201d which certi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>fied that a company named \u201cAl-Khat Al-Hayawi\u201d was registered as an Iraqi company.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">In a motion <em>in limine </em>filed by appellants pre-trial, appellants sought to exclude the transfer documentation Salkini received on July 20, 2006, at trial, and argued as follows: \u201c[Appellees] seek to introduce the Transfer document ... as proof that ownership of a company known as \u2018VitalTel/Al Khat Al Hayawi\u2019 was transferred to Moutiny Ltd. However, the Iraqi Corporation Registration Office has already advised ... that [the Transfer document] is a forgery.\u201d In the motion <em>in limine, </em>appellants represented that Fadul would \u201ctestify that the actual transfer of ownership document, from VitalTel to Moutiny\u201d was a document attached to the <em>in limine </em>motion \u201cbearing bates-stamp FADUL000779 [defense exhibit 49].\u201d An English translation of the document bearing bates-stamp FADUL000779 (defense exhibit 49) attached to the motion stated that Fadul, as the \u201cauthorized manager\u201d of VitalTel, sold one million shares of VitalTel to Moutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">At trial, however, when asked on cross-examination whether he signed the document introduced into evidence as defense exhibit 49, Fadul testified that the signature on the document did not \u201cresemble\u201d his signature, and that, although the signature on the document was in Arabic, he had not signed anything in Arabic since 1980, and had not given permission to anyone to sign on his behalf. When asked on cross-examination about defense exhibit 34A, the documents sent via DHL on July 20, 2006, Fadul testified: \u201cI do not know that they were these papers included, because I wasn\u2019t there, I instructed to complete certain papers and send them to Dubai. If these papers were in the DHL, I cannot tell you if they were or they were not.\u201d When asked if he received a copy of the papers, Fadul testified that he did not recall seeing the papers, but he discussed them\u2014at some later point in time\u2014 with Al-Hadethy and \u201cshe did not think these were the same papers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">In a letter dated August 7, 2006, the MOC notified VitalTel that the WLL License issued to VitalTel on November 27, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>2005, was no longer valid. In the letter, which was addressed to several different companies that had been granted WLL licenses-including VitalTel\u2014the Minister of the MOC stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AlY\">Reference to the (previous) contracts signed with you, and based on the directions of the Cabinet of Ministers for the need to first obtain their approval of these contracts, and since this approval is not present until now, these contracts are not considered valid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-5\">Therefore, it is not allowed at the moment to implement any article in the contract related to establishment, operation, etc. until these contracts are reviewed and until we obtain the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers on that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">According to Salkini, despite the letter of August 7, 2006, Aramtel continued to make payments to Moutiny pursuant to the April Operating Agreement, and TWS continued to deliver equipment pursuant to the April Purchase Agreement. Salkini testified that he \u201chad assurances from the Minister [of the MOC] and from Fadul specifically that the [L]icense [was] going to be reinstated, that it [was] just in suspension status, and that all the provinces that were assigned to th[e L]icense [were] going to be reinstated.\u201d According to invoices submitted to Moutiny by TWS from November 2006 to March 2007, after the License was suspended, Aramtel made payments in the amount of $9,044,712.91 on behalf of Moutiny for the equipment that was provided to Moutiny by TWS pursuant to April Purchase Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">On September 17, 2006, Fadul sent an e-mail to Salkini advising that the launching date for the wireless network was estimated to be on or about January 1, 2007, and that \u201cthere [was] a need to have $500,000 in [Moutiny\u2019s] account in Iraq to cover the on[ ]going expenses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">On December 12, 2006, Fadul sent an e-mail to Salkini attaching a status report on Moutiny. In the status report, Fadul provided the following information:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-9\">The [April] Operating Agreement ... specified that Aramtel [ ] ... was to provide an aggregate of USD $5,500,000 in operating capital. To date, Moutiny has received USD <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>$3,500,000 in operating capital from Aramtel []. An additional USD $500,000 is in transit. The remaining USD $1,500,000 has yet to be provided. A report was requested by [ ] Salkini ... before additional funds are to be made available[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">As to the business plan and budget update, Fadul wrote: \u201cThe original business plan specified that Moutiny\u2019s WLL services would be launched in Iraq on October 1, 2006. This self imposed deadline was impossible to meet due to the license suspension letter we received from the [MOC] in August 2006---- The ensuing delay forced me to dramatically conserve operating funds.\u201d Fadul concluded the status report as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-6\">I [Fadul] am sensitive to the fact that the MOC breached its legally written commitment by their letter in August. As a result, I have done everything in my power to restore the [L]icense and make this project a success....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-7\">That said, it is my belief that as soon as the amendment to the [License is executed, fairness requires [Aramtel] and you [Salkini] to commit the funds necessary to fully deploy a 200,000 subscriber network.... In addition, such funding makes good business sense [ ] because it will allow Moutiny to deploy its services more quickly and be the first to render services in many areas ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-8\">Regardless of whatever budget is made available, no efforts will be spared to have Moutiny succeed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">On December 20, 2006, Fadul sent an e-mail to Salkini, stating that, \u201c[a]s far as the [License is concerned,\u201d the Minister of the MOC had met with the Iraqi Prime Minister and he (Fadul) \u201cwas told everything was sorted out fine to approve the amendments of all WLL licenses. It is my understanding that the approval papers were left with the prime minister[\u2019s] office to sign and to then be mailed to the\u201d MOC. On January 12, 2007, Fadul sent another e-mail to Salkini, stating: \u201cI was advised that the prime minister[\u2019s] office has signed our papers; however, I did not get solid assurance yet. I am still not worried about this subject.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>In December 2006 and January 2007, VitalTel/Moutiny\u2019s Quickbook accounts, introduced into evidence as defense exhibit 99A, demonstrate that on four occasions\u2014December 18, 2006, and January 16, 21, and 28, 2007\u2014Fadul withdrew money for \u201cCash on Hand\u201d in the amounts of $90,000, $50,000, $50,000, and $100,000, respectively, without authorization from Aramtel.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">On March 8, 2007, Moutiny held a meeting,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> which was attended by Fadul and Salkini. The meeting\u2019s minutes state that Fadul provided an update on the status of the License and that the amended License \u201cstill ha[d] not been officially released to Moutiny.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">On March 14, 2007, Fadul, representing Dynacorp, and Salkini, representing Aramtel, held a \u201cspecial meeting\u201d of Moutiny in Baltimore, Maryland. Also in attendance at the special meeting were Shiblie Shiblie (on behalf of TWS), and counsel for Aramtel and Dynacorp. The minutes of the special meeting reflect the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-7\">[ ] Salkini was concerned that the [MOC] had rescinded the November 2005 license agreement between the [ITPC] and Vit[a]lTel. [ ] Fadul noted that MOC authorizes activities one day and then rescinds its authority the next week. He is lobbying within Iraq to get an amendment reinstating the [LJicense so that the network deployment can proceed. [ ] Salkini also expressed significant concern that additional costs are being incurred to build sites.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">During the special meeting, the parties scheduled a date for the next progress meeting, to be held on June 1, 2007, at the Center Club in Baltimore, Maryland.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>On May 6, 2007, the MOC sent VitalTel a letter which stated: \u201cWe would like to inform you that the old contract regarding the extending of WLL service signed with your company has been cancelled.\u201d At some point after receiving the letter, in early May, Fadul told Salkini, during a telephone conversation, that he was not going to continue working with him and that if Salkini wanted to \u201ccontinue this project, [ ] go ahead. Do it on your own. I\u2019m out of this.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">Over the weekend of May 19, 2007, Salkini met with the Iraqi Minister of Communications in Washington, D.C. At that time, the Minister told Salkini that the License issued to VitalTel \u201cwas valid and was in the process of being reinstated.\u201d On May 22, 2007, Salkini spoke with the Director General of the ITPC and was informed that the revised License \u201cwas finalized and [that] the corresponding license had been issued by the ITPC approximately ten (10) days earlier, but that it was issued to another entity or person at the direction of [ ] Fadul.\u201d (Emphasis omitted)</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">(d) Al-Shams and Al Nakheel</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">On October 11, 2006\u2014while Moutiny was still operating<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>\u2014 unbeknownst to Salkini, Fadul and another man, Aref Kamel Abdul Ameer (also known as Aref A1 Bahash) (\u201cAl Bahash\u201d), presented a \u201cResolution license to establish a company\u201d to the Companies Registration Department of the Ministry of Trade of Iraq. In the resolution, which was admitted into evidence at trial as Meuse exhibit 41, Fadul and Al Bahash requested the establishment of a company named \u201cA[l-]Shams for wireless communications services Ltd.\u201d (\u201cAl-Shams\u201d). On the same day, October 11, 2006, a Company Registrar of Iraq issued a \u201cCertificate of establishment [of] a company,\u201d confirming the establishment of Al-Shams. The certificate was signed by AlHadethy, Moutiny\u2019s attorney. On November 10, 2006, an application for the establishment of Al-Shams was filed with the Ministry of Trade.

On May 14, 2009, appellants filed a motion to dismiss Aramtel\u2019s counterclaim for fraud in the inducement and a motion for summary judgment as to Aramtel\u2019s counterclaims for fraud, constructive fraud, and negligent misrepresentation. In the motion, appellants argued, in part, that Aramtel\u2019s counterclaims for fraud; constructive fraud, and negligent misrepresentation failed as a matter of law because they were direct actions for injuries rather than derivative actions on behalf of Moutiny. On June 1, 2009, appellees filed an opposition to the motion to dismiss and motion for summary judgment. On June 3, 2009, the circuit court denied appellants\u2019 motion to dismiss and motion for summary judgment as to Aramtel\u2019s counterclaims.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>(c) The First Amended Counterclaim and Third-Party Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">On May 28, 2009, Aramtel, individually and in a derivative capacity on Moutiny\u2019s behalf, filed a first amended counterclaim against Fadul and Dynacorp and a third-party complaint against TeckTel, asserting a direct claim for fraudulent inducement as Count I (against Fadul, Dynacorp, and TeckTel), and seven derivative claims, including: Count II\u2014breach of contract, Count III\u2014fraud, Count IV\u2014constructive fraud, Count V\u2014negligent misrepresentation, Count VI\u2014breach of fiduciary duty, Count VII\u2014conversion, and Count VIII\u2014 usurpation of corporate opportunity and corporate waste (against Fadul, Dynacorp, and TeckTel).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">In Count I, fraudulent inducement, Aramtel alleged that Fadul, Dynacorp, and TeckTel falsely represented that Vital-Tel had been incorporated in Iraq as a public limited company, and that they \u201c[w]ould take no actions which would make it impossible to carry on the ordinary business of Moutiny and/or Vit[a]lTel.\u201d Aramtel alleged that Fadul, Dynacorp, and TeckTel \u201cmade ... other false and misleading statements in order to defraud Aramtel and entice it into ... entering into the [April] Operating Agreement, the Promissory Note, and related agreements.\u201d Aramtel alleged that it relied on Fadul\u2019s, Dynacorp\u2019s, and TeckTel\u2019s representations to its detriment, and that had it known the statements were false, it would not have conducted business with Fadul, Dynacorp, and TeckTel. As a result, Aramtel sought damages in the amount of $34,047,801.18.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">As to Count II, breach of contract, Aramtel alleged that Fadul, Dynacorp, and TeckTel breached the April Operating Agreement, which obligated \u201ceach to engage in certain activities for the advancement of the business interests of Moutiny and Vit[a]lTel/Al Khat Hayawi and prohibited] each of them from engaging in certain activities that would impede those business interests.\u201d As to Count III, fraud, Aramtel alleged that Fadul failed to disclose several pieces of key information to Aramtel and Moutiny, and that Fadul, Dynacorp, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>TeckTel knew and made false and misleading representations for the purpose of defrauding Moutiny and Aramtel. As to Count IV, constructive fraud, Aramtel alleged that Dynacorp and Fadul owed legal, equitable, and fiduciary duties to Moutiny and Aramtel that were breached. As to Count V, negligent misrepresentation, Aramtel alleged that Fadul, Dynacorp, and TeckTel made false representations of material fact to Moutiny and Aramtel and failed to disclose other material facts. As to Count VI, breach of fiduciary duty, Aramtel alleged that Fadul, as Moutiny\u2019s Managing Member and chief executive officer, was in a fiduciary relationship with Moutiny and owed Moutiny fiduciary duties, which he breached \u201cby failing to perform his duties with the utmost good faith and loyalty; by engaging in self-dealing to the detriment of Moutiny and its interest holders and creditors; by failing to perform his duties in a manner that was in the best interest of Moutiny; and by failing to perform his duties with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances.\u201d As to Count VII, conversion, Aramtel alleged that Fadul improperly conveyed or transferred the License from VitalTel to Al Nakheel, \u201cwithout permission or justification,\u201d and that the License had a value of at least $75,000,000. As to Count VIII, usurpation of corporate opportunity and corporate waste, Aramtel alleged that Fadul\u2019s, Dynacorp\u2019s, and TeckTel\u2019s \u201cwrongful conduct\u201d constituted usurpation of corporate opportunity and corporate waste which caused \u201clegal injury[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">(d) The Motions to Dismiss First Amended Counterclaim and Third-Party Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">On June 12, 2009, Dynacorp filed a motion to dismiss the first amended counterclaim and accompanying memorandum, arguing that the first amended counterclaim failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted and failed to allege any facts \u201cupon which Dynacorp could be held liable for any action it took independent of [ ] Fadul ... [or] for [ ] Fadul\u2019s actions.\u201d On the same day, June 12, 2009, TeckTel filed a motion to strike, or in the alternative, dismiss the third-party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>complaint and accompanying memorandum in support, arguing, in part, that it was \u201cnot subject to the jurisdiction\u201d of the circuit court because it is an Iraq-based company with a branch in Virginia. Also on June 12, 2009, Fadul and Moutiny filed a motion to dismiss the first amended counterclaim, or in the alternative, a motion for summary judgment and accompanying memorandum of law, arguing, in part, that the first amended counterclaim failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, that Aramtel was contractually precluded from pursuing derivative claims, and that the circuit court lacked jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">On June 30, 2009, appellees filed an opposition to TeckTel\u2019s motion to strike or dismiss. On July 7, 2009, appellees filed an opposition to the motion to dismiss filed by Fadul and Moutiny. On July 8, 2009, the circuit court issued an order denying the motions filed by Dynacorp, TeckTel, Fadul, and Moutiny. On July 27, 2009, appellants filed an answer to the first amended counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">(e) The Second Amended Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">On June 10, 2009, appellants filed a second amended complaint. As to Count I for breach of contract regarding the April Operating Agreement, appellants modified the count to reflect that Moutiny alleged a breach of contract by Aramtel and TWS, noting that Dynacorp withdrew its claim, and that the claim against Salkini was dismissed by the circuit court. As to Count II for breach of contract regarding the Note, appellants modified the count to reflect that Moutiny alleged a breach of contract by Aramtel only, noting that the circuit court dismissed claims against Salkini and TWS. As to Count III for breach of contract regarding the April Purchasing Agreement, appellants modified the count to reflect that Moutiny alleged a breach of contract by TWS only, noting that the claim against Aramtel was withdrawn. Appellants withdrew Moutiny\u2019s claim against Aramtel for breach of contract regarding the Security Agreement contained within Count IV. Fadul\u2019s claim for tortious interference with business relationship, Count V, against all appellees remained unchanged, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>did Dynacorp\u2019s claim for fraud in the inducement, Count VI, against all appellees. Appellants noted that the circuit court dismissed Count VII for declaratory judgment for Dynaeorp and Moutiny against all appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">In the second amended complaint, appellants added three counts: (1) Count VIII, Fadul\u2019s claim against Salkini for breach of contract and fiduciary duty; (2) Count IX, Moutiny\u2019s claim against Salkini for breach of fiduciary duty; and (3) Count X, Fadul\u2019s claim against Salkini and Aramtel for defamation. On June 30, 2009, appellees filed a motion to strike the second amended complaint or, in the alternative, motion to dismiss or for summary judgment on Counts I\u2014III, V, and VIII-X. On July 16, 2009, appellants filed an opposition to the motion to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">(4) Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">From August 3, 2009, to August 7, 2009; August 10, 2009, to August 14, 2009; November 23, 2009, to November 25, 2009; and January 14, 15, and 19, 2010, the circuit court held a sixteen-day bench trial. On August 3, 2009, after hearing argument from the parties as to the motion to strike the second amended complaint, the circuit court ruled from the bench, granting appellees\u2019 motion to strike and dismiss Count V (Fadul\u2019s claim against all appellees for tortious interference with business relationship), Count VIII (Fadul\u2019s claim against Salkini for breach of contract and fiduciary duty), Count IX (Moutiny\u2019s claim against Salkini for breach of fiduciary duty), and Count X (Fadul\u2019s claim against Salkini and Aramtel for defamation) of the second amended complaint, and denying appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment as to Counts I\u2014III. On the same day, August 3, 2009, the circuit court denied appellants\u2019 oral motion for summary judgment as to Counts II-VIII of the first amended counterclaim. On August 11, 2009, at the conclusion of appellants\u2019 case, appellees orally moved for judgment. The circuit court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">On November 25, 2009, the circuit court denied appellants\u2019 motion for judgment as to the first amended counterclaim and reserved ruling on appellees\u2019 motion for judgment. On Janu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>ary 19, 2010, at the conclusion of all of the evidence in the case, appellants moved for judgment and appellees renewed their motion for judgment. The circuit court denied both motions. The circuit court instructed counsel for the parties to submit closing arguments in writing within sixty days.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">On April 27, 2010, appellees filed \u201cProposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law\u201d and a \u201cBrief in Support of Their Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law.\u201d On the same day, appellants filed a \u201cJoint Post Trial Memorandum\u201d accompanied by \u201cProposed Findings of Fact\u201d and \u201cProposed Conclusions of Law.\u201d On May 27, 2010, appellees filed a rebuttal to appellants\u2019 proposed findings of fact and a \u201cRebuttal Brief in Support of Their Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law.\u201d On the same day, appellants filed a \u201cJoint Post Trial Memorandum Replying to and Rebutting Memorandum of [Appellees]\u201d and supplemental proposed findings of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">(5) The Circuit Court\u2019s Order and Memorandum Opinion</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">On June 21, 2011, approximately thirteen months after receipt of the last post-trial filing, the circuit court issued a Memorandum Opinion and Order finding against appellants as to each of their claims, finding in favor of appellees to each of its claims, and ordering appellants to pay appellees damages in the amount of $41,637,099.46. In the Memorandum Opinion, the circuit court ruled, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AF6\">JURISDICTION</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-8\">The Court finds that Aramtel\u2019s shareholder derivative claims are properly within the Court\u2019s jurisdiction. [Appellants] raise the issue of jurisdiction for [the] first time in their post-trial memorandum. Specifically, [appellants] assert that this Court does not have personal jurisdiction over Fadul and Dynacorp regarding Aramtel\u2019s derivative claims brought on behalf of Moutiny. [Appellants] propose this argument even after initiating the instant suit in the Howard County Circuit Court. This Court finds that [appellants] waived the defense of lack of personal jurisdiction, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>and that the exercise of personal jurisdiction over [appellants] is constitutionally reasonable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-5\">Pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-322, the defense of lack of jurisdiction over the person \u201cshall be made by motion to dismiss filed before the answer, if an answer is required.\u201d The rule definitively states that if this defense is not raised in a motion to dismiss, and instead an answer is filed, the defens'e is waived. Maryland Rule 2-322. While Fadul and Dynacorp filed a Motion to Dismiss on other grounds, they failed to raise the defense of lack of personal jurisdiction. TeckTel raised the defense of lack of personal jurisdiction in a Motion to Dismiss on July 8, 2009, but this Court denied TeckTel\u2019s motion, finding that this Court did have personal jurisdiction over Tecktel. Because [appellants] failed to file a Motion to Dismiss asserting lack of jurisdiction over the person, and instead filed an Answer, [appellants] waived this defense. Furthermore, [appellants] initiated the instant lawsuit in Maryland and therefore cannot avoid the jurisdiction of this Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-6\">Fadul, Dynacorp and Tecktel contractually consented to the jurisdiction of this Court. According to Section 14.5 of the Operating Agreement:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-7\">\u201cThis Agreement has been executed in the State of Maryland, U.S.A., and the parties hereto hereby agree to resolve any disputes arising hereunder in a court of competent jurisdiction located within the State of Maryland. Each party agrees to submit to the personal jurisdiction of such court, and further agrees that any judgment issued by any such court shall be fully enforceable in the courts or other judicial bodies of any other Jurisdiction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-8\">[Appellants] argue that because Moutiny did not enter into the contract, Moutiny cannot be subject to personal jurisdiction in Maryland. However, this Court finds that because Moutiny was created as a result of the Operating Agreement, it is bound by its terms.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-9\">This Court further finds that even if Fadul, Dynacorp and Tecktel had never contractually consented to the jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>tion of this Court, this Court would still have personal jurisdiction over them under a constitutional analysis. The Court must engage in a two-step analysis to determine whether it has personal jurisdiction over a party. The court must consider whether personal jurisdiction is permissible under the State\u2019s long-arm statute, and whether personal jurisdiction complies with due process under the federal constitution. <em>Beyond Systems, Inc. v. Realtime Gaming Holding Co., </em>388 Md. 1, 14-15 [878 A.2d 567] (2005).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-5\">In this case, Fadul, Dynacorp and Tecktel signed two separate operating agreements in Maryland involving the telecommunications project in Iraq. Both operating agreements state that these agreements were executed in the state of Maryland. Throughout the negotiation process Fadul frequently corresponded with [ ] Salkini, David Claburn, Shiblie Shiblie and Haider Thamir, who were living in Maryland at the time. Fadul also attended numerous meetings in Maryland to discuss the joint venture. Based on the frequent contacts that Fadul had in the state of Maryland, this Court finds that [appellants] had the requisite minimum contacts to justify personal jurisdiction in Maryland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-6\">STANDING</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-7\">This Court also finds that Fadul lacks standing to bring claims on behalf of Moutiny in this lawsuit. Pursuant to the operating agreement, Fadul was the managing member of Moutiny, and was in charge of overseeing the day-to-day management. However, during the hearing on March 27, 2008, Fadul testified that he had withdrawn as managing member of Moutiny[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-8\">Because Fadul is no longer the managing member of Moutiny, he lacks the authority to act on its behalf, and therefore has no standing to authorize Moutiny to bring claims in this lawsuit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>Fadul has also lost his status as managing member of Moutiny because he was concurrently serving as the CEO of a competing company, Al Nakheel, beginning in February 2008.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-5\">Dynacorp also does not have standing to authorize Moutiny to bring claims in this case. According to the Operating Agreement, any action required consent of the majority of the members, which was defined as members that own 75% of the interest in the company. The Operating Agreement set out that Dynacorp owned 50% of Moutiny and Aramtel owned the other 50%. Because Dynacorp has less than 75% interest in Moutiny, it does not have the authority to take action without AramteFs consent. Aramtel did not consent to Moutiny bringing claims against it in the instant lawsuit, and therefore Dynacorp does not have standing to assert claims on behalf of Moutiny.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-6\">No authority exists under Maryland Corporate law that authorizes Moutiny to pursue this litigation unilaterally, without consent of the majority of members. According to Maryland law, a director may not act on behalf of a corporation without authority from the rest of the board.... Because Fadul and Dynacorp did not act on behalf of Moutiny without approval from Aramtel, Moutiny does not have standing to bring the claims asserted in the instant lawsuit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-7\">ANALYSIS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-8\">\n<em>II. Claims Asserted by [] Aramtel and Salkini</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-9\">\n<em>B. Aramtel\u2019s Derivative Claim for Fraud and Intentional Misrepresentation and Concealment/Norir-Disclosure</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-10\">This Court notes that [appellants] failed to call Ms. Niran Al-Hadethy as a witness at trial. Ms. Hadethy was legal counsel for Fadul, TeekTel, Moutiny, VitalTel, Al Khat A1 Hayawi, and Al[-]Shams, and continues to serve in such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>capacity for A1 Nakheel. Ms. Hadethy\u2019s testimony would have been material to this case and may have resolved many of the issues in dispute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-6\">Given [appellants\u2019] failure to offer this critical witness [Al-Hadethy] at trial, the Court can reasonably infer that Ms. Hadethy would testify to the following: ... (3) VitalTel and Al Khat A1 Hayawi are not different companies, but are, in fact, the same company\u2014VitalTel being the company\u2019s English name and Al Khat A1 Hayawi being the company\u2019s Arabic name; (4) After the April Operating Agreement was executed, she was asked by Fadul to effectuate the transfer of all of the shares of VitalTel (Al Khat A1 Hayawi) to Moutiny; (5) The documents that comprise [Defense Exhibit] # 34A are the documents that were sent to Salkini ... to establish that 100% of the shares of VitalTel (Al Khat A1 Hayawi) has been successfully transferred to Moutiny and that Moutiny was the sole owner of VitalTel[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-7\">This Court finds that Moutiny and Aramtel relied on Fadul\u2019s false misrepresentations and material omissions. Based on Fadul\u2019s representations that VitalTel and its license had been transferred to Moutiny, Aramtel continued to loan significant sums to Moutiny and Moutiny continued to incur significant debt. Fadul failed to offer into evidence any document demonstrating that VitalTel was transferred to Moutiny in accordance with the April Operating Agreement. It can reasonably be inferred that Aramtel would have stopped loaning money to Moutiny if Fadul [had] not sent the allegedly fraudulent share transfer documents....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-8\">This Court draws negative inferences from Fadul\u2019s failure to introduce documents into evidence that would have supposedly existed if Fadul\u2019s version of the events were truthful. This Court finds that the following documents are conspicuously missing from the Court record: (1) Articles of [I]ncorporation or other documents from Al Khat A1 Hayawi; (2) documents from the Iraqi Company Regis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>trar for VitalTel or Al Khat A1 Hayawi; (3) Any documents showing that VitalTel was transferred to Moutiny; (4) Correspondence from the Company Registrar informing VitalTel that it was not properly registered; (5) Any of the license applications that Fadul prepared that would demonstrate that Al Khat A1 Hayawi and VitalTel are different entities; (6) Any of the licenses under which Al Nakheel is operating, including the license received by Al Khat A1 Hayawi; (7) The power of attorney that [Fadul] gave to Ms. Hadethy; and (8) Any record of communications that Fadul had with Ms. Hadethy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-6\"><em>H. </em>Arambel\u2019s <em>Direct Claim for Fraud in the Inducement</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-7\">This Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that Fadul perpetrated a fraud on Moutiny. On February 1, 2006, Fadul sent an e-mail to Salkini with a copy of Vital-Tel/Al Khat Al Hayawi\u2019s formation papers. Fadul specifically stated: \u201cAttached please find VitalTel\u2019s articles of [incorporation\u201d from Iraq.[ ] The attachment to the email included several formation documents that led Salkini to believe that VitalTel had been properly formed and incorporated under its Arabic name, Al Khat A1 Hayawi. While this Court does believe that Fadul planned to set up the joint venture in good faith from the beginning, this Court ultimately finds that Fadul committed a fraud in the inducement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-8\">DAMAGES</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-9\">This Court finds that Aramtel initially invested five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000.00) in Moutiny and then promised to loan five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) to be used for operating expenses. Aramtel then loaned Moutiny twenty-five million dollars ($25,000,000.00) to be used to fund the purchase of telecommunications equipment from TWS. This Court therefore finds that Aramtel suffered $30,500,000.00 in damages, and Orders Fadul to compensate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>Aramtel for its investment by repaying this amount plus interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-4\">In determining the proper measure of damages in fraud and deceit cases, Maryland applies the \u201cflexibility theory.\u201d ... Under this \u201cflexibility theory\u201d, a victim of fraudulent or negligent misrepresentation may elect to recover \u201cout-of-pocket\u201d expenses or \u201cbenefit-of-the-bargain\u201d damages. Moutiny was deprived the benefit of its bargain as a result of Fadul\u2019s fraudulent scheme and many violations of his contractual and fiduciary duties. Because the future profits of Moutiny are unknown, this Court will not [ojrder damages based on the loss of ownership of the WLL license, the lost profits or the benefits Fadul received from the A1 Nakheel opportunity. While Moutiny may have successfully deployed the WLL network in Iraq if it had the WLL license, it still may have failed for numerous other reasons. Because [appellees] cannot prove Moutiny\u2019s profits with certainty, this Court cannot make a determination as to the potential damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-5\">The section titled \u201cInterest\u201d of the Loan Promissory Note provides that interest accrues on the outstanding unpaid balance of the loans at \u201ca per annum rate of twelve percent (12%)\u201d and that such interest \u201cshall be computed on the basis of a 365-day year and the actual number of days elapsed.[\u201d] The preamble to the note states that the outstanding principle of the loan \u201cshall be due and payable on January 2, 2013\u201d and that interest on the outstanding balance \u201cshall be due and payable on the first day of each calendar quarter beginning on January 1, 2008 and ending on January 1, 2013[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-6\">At the March 2007 Members\u2019 Meeting, the parties agreed that interest on the operating expense loan would be calculated \u201cfrom the day funds are paid by Aramtel to Moutiny\u201d which date \u201cwill be deemed to be the day the funds arrived in an account in Moutiny\u2019s name.\u201d Based on this information, this Court orders [appellants to] pay [appellees] $11,137,099.46 in interest in addition to the $30,500,000.00, resulting in a total of $41,637,099.46.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>CONCLUSION</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-5\">This Court finds that [ ] Dynacorp and Moutiny have not met their burden in proving that [appellees] are liable on any of the four remaining counts of [appellants\u2019] Second Amended Complaint. This Court finds [appellees]\u2019 claims to have merit, and Orders that [appellants] pay [appellees] $41,637,099.46 in damages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">(6) Post-Trial Motions</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">On July 5, 2011, appellees filed a motion to amend judgment, requesting that the circuit court amend the judgment to include interest through the date that the circuit court\u2019s order is paid in full. According to appellees, in calculating the judgment, the circuit court failed to account for the accrual of daily interest at the rate of $8,161.45 between April 27, 2010, the last day for which interest was awarded in the circuit court\u2019s order, and June 24, 2011, the date of the circuit court order. As such, appellees requested that an additional $3,452,293.35 be added to the judgment, and that the judgment be amended to include an award of $8,161.45 for each day that the judgment amount is unpaid. On July 20, 2011, appellants filed an opposition to the motion to amend judgment. On the same day, appellants\u2014Fadul, Dynacorp, and Moutiny\u2014noted an appeal of the judgment in the amount of $41,637,099.46. TeckTel was not named as an appellant in the notice. On August 12, 2011, the circuit court granted appellees\u2019 motion to amend and issued an amended order\u2014increasing the amount of the judgment to $45,089,392.81, plus interest at a per diem rate of $8,161.45 beginning June 24, 2011. On August 25, 2011, appellants\u2014Fadul, Dynacorp, and Moutiny\u2014 noted an appeal of the judgment in the amount of $45,089,392.81. TeckTel was not named as an appellant in the notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">On August 26, 2011, appellees filed a \u201cMotion to Revise Judgment Pursuant to M[aryland] Rule 2-534\u201d and accompanying memorandum seeking: (1) an award of attorneys\u2019 fees; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>(2) punitive damages; (3) that Fadul be required to disgorge his ownership interest in AI Nakheel and any other benefits he received as a result of stealing Moutiny\u2019s corporate opportunity; and (4) compensatory damages equal to the value of the License.

Appellants argue that the \u201cevidence was insufficient as a matter of law to satisfy each of the necessary elements\u201d of fraudulent inducement. As to the element of false representation, appellants assert that \u201cthere [was] no basis to find that [ ] Fadul\u2019s February 1, 2006 representation to Aramtel regarding the corporate formation of VitalTel was false.\u201d Appellants argue that the circuit court expressly found that \u201cthe documents attached to [ ] Fadul\u2019s February 1, 2006 e[-]mail were, in fact, YitalTel\u2019s actual formation papers and correctly reflect that the company\u2019s Arabic name is Al Khat A1 Hayawi.\u201d As to the elements of knowledge of falsity, the purpose of defrauding, and reliance, appellants maintain that the circuit court failed to make specific findings. As to the element of reliance, and the right to rely on the false representation, appellants assert that \u201cthe [circuit [c]ourt\u2019s finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>that [ ] Fadul committed a [fraudulent] inducement is inconsistent with its finding that Section 14.2 of the April [Operating] Agreement\u2014the \u2018integration clause\u2019\u2014precluded a party from relying on representations that were not incorporated into the written April Agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">As to causation of actual damages, appellants maintain that \u201cAramtel did not suffer compensable injury as a result of [ ] Fadul\u2019s alleged misrepresentation.\u201d Appellants argue that \u201cthe [c]ircuit [c]ourt erroneously ordered [ ] Fadul to \u2018repay\u2019 mon[ies] ... loaned by Aramtel to Moutiny and VitalTel, [ ] where Aramtel expressly agreed that, as a condition to get [ ] Fadul to sign the April Agreement, [] Fadul would not be liable on the up to $30 million loan[.]\u201d (Emphasis omitted). Appellants assert that \u201cAramtel has not suffered a compensable injury due to [ ] Fadul\u2019s alleged misrepresentation because the [e]ircuit [c]ourt found Moutiny \u2018may have failed for numerous other reasons.\u2019 \u201d (Footnote omitted).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">Appellees respond that they \u201cpresented clear and convincing evidence that [appellants] fraudulently induced [appellees] into entering the [April] Operating Agreement.\u201d Appellees contend that appellants knowingly made false representations to them for the purpose of defrauding appellees. Specifically, appellees argue that \u201cAramtel presented sufficient evidence from which the [c]ircuit [c]ourt was able to infer either that Fadul actually knew that VitalTel/Al Khat Al Hayawi was not properly incorporated prior to entering into the Operating Agreement, or that Fadul made the statements regarding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>VitalTel\u2019s proper formation with reckless indifference to their truth.\u201d Appellees maintain that judicial estoppel and equitable estoppel prevent appellants from contending on appeal that VitalTel and Al Khat A1 Hayawi were the same company after contending in the circuit court that VitalTel and Al Khat A1 Hayawi were two different companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">In a reply brief, appellants contend that judicial estoppel does not apply because the circuit court did not accept appellants\u2019 position that VitalTel and Al Khat A1 Hayawi were two different companies. Appellants argue that equitable estoppel does not apply because appellees did not rely on, but rather disputed, appellants\u2019 position.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">(2) Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">An appellate court reviews a trial court\u2019s factual findings for clear error, and reviews the trial court\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de novo.

Although we rejected the plaintiffs contention on appeal, concluding that the defendant had engaged in \u201cmeaningful partial performance\u201d and that a \u201csignificant change in circumstances\u201d occurred after signing the contract, we discussed the breach of contract and subsequent conduct as evidence of fraudulent intent as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-6\">A fraudulent pre-existing intent not to perform a promise made cannot be inferred from the failure to perform the promise alone. But, it may be considered with the subsequent conduct of the promisor and the other circumstances surrounding the transaction in sustaining such an inference.

The email read, in pertinent part: \u201cAttached please find VitalTel\u2019s article of [injcorporation [from] Iraq.\u201d One of the e-mail\u2019s attachments\u2014which has since been translated into English\u2014 reads, in pertinent part: \u201cI, company registrar, certify herein that on [June 13, 2004], [Al-Khat Al-Hayawi Telecommunications Services, Ltd.] was registered in our books[.]\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">At trial, Fadul contended that VitalTel and Al Khat A1 Hayawi were two different companies\u2014thus, Fadul could convey \u201cVitalTel\u201d to Moutiny and \u201cAl Khat A1 Hayawi\u201d to A1 Bahash. The circuit court found that Fadul was not a credible witness. The circuit court rejected Fadul\u2019s contention and concluded that \u201cVitalTel\u201d and \u201cAl Khat A1 Hayawi\u201d were the same company\u2014which Fadul purported to convey to Moutiny, when in fact he actually conveyed VitalTel to A1 Bahash. We agree with these conclusions by the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">The conclusion that VitalTel and Al Khat A1 Hayawi were the same company, however, means that Fadul did not make a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>false representation in purporting to attach VitalTel\u2019s incorporation papers to Fadul\u2019s February 1, 2006, e-mail to Salkini. It is undisputed that VitalTel was properly incorporated under the Arabic name \u201cAl Khat A1 Hayawi.\u201d Fadul, however, testified that \u201cVitalTel\u201d and \u201cAl Khat A1 Hayawi\u201d were two different companies. Thus, in Fadul\u2019s February 1, 2006, email to Salkini, Fadul made a representation\u2014that VitalTel and Al Khat A1 Hayawi were the same company\u2014about which he later testified differently. Yet, the representation was actually true.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Within this litigation, appellants have taken inconsistent positions as to whether or not \u201cVitalTel\u201d and \u201cAl Khat A1 Hayawi\u201d were two different companies. At trial, appellants contended that \u201cVitalTel\u201d and \u201cAl Khat A1 Hayawi\u201d were two different companies. Fadul did so to argue that Moutiny did not own \u201cAl Khat A1 Hayawi,\u201d which he could thus convey to Al Bahash. On appeal, appellants contend that \u201cVitalTel\u201d and \u201cAl Khat A1 Hawayi\u201d were the same company. Appellants do so to argue that Fadul\u2019s representation to Salkini via the February 1, 2006, e-mail\u2014that VitalTel was incorporated under the Arabic name \u201cAl Khat A1 Hawayi\u201d\u2014was true.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">In the interests of justice, although Fadul should not benefit from his own disingenuousness, we need not reach the parties\u2019 contentions regarding the applicability of the principles of equitable estoppel or judicial estoppel. We find sufficient evidence of fraudulent inducement on grounds that differ the circuit court\u2019s. We conclude that Fadul\u2019s false representation was his promise in the April Operating Agreement to convey VitalTel to Moutiny\u2014which the evidence established he not only failed to do, but also never intended to <em>do\u2014not </em>his representation to Salkini via the February 1, 2006, e-mail that VitalTel was incorporated under the Arabic name \u201cAl Khat A1 Hayawi.\u201d We address the five elements of fraudulent inducement, and conclude that the evidence establishes that Fadul fraudulently induced appellees to invest $500,000 in, and loan $30,000,000 to, Moutiny by falsely representing that Fadul would convey VitalTel to Moutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>(b) The Five Elements of Fraudulent Inducement</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">(i) False Representation and Knowledge of Falsity or Reckless Indifference to Truth</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">The falsity of Fadul\u2019s <em>representation\u2014ie. </em>that he would convey ownership of VitalTel to Moutiny\u2014and his preexisting fraudulent intent are demonstrated by Fadul\u2019s conduct both prior to executing the April Operating Agreement and his subsequent conduct in failing or refusing to perform under the agreement. <em>See First Union Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>154 Md.App. at 149, 838 A.2d 404 (\u201cA fraudulent, pre-existing intent not to perform a promise ... may be considered with the subsequent conduct of the promisor and the other circumstances surrounding the transaction ... [including] a failure or refusal to perform[.]\u201d (Citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Key differences in the March and April Operating Agreements provide circumstantial evidence of the falsity of Fadul\u2019s representation and intent that he would transfer ownership of VitalTel to Moutiny. The March Operating Agreement provided that VitalTel would transfer ownership of the License directly to Moutiny and contained no mention of Dynacorp. In contrast, the April Operating Agreement provided that Dynacorp and/or Fadul would transfer ownership of VitalTel to Moutiny. Thus, the parties agreed that the License would not be directly transferred to Moutiny, but rather ownership of a company, known by Fadul to exist under two names-VitalTel in the United States and Al Khat A1 Hayawi in Iraq-would ostensibly be transferred to Moutiny. With the April Operating Agreement, a new agreement was created that permitted Fadul to identify VitalTel and Al Khat A1 Hayawi as the same company to Salkini but, unbeknownst to Salkini, transfer ownership of Al Khat A1 Hayawi and the License to A1 Nakheel. This outcome would not have been possible under the March Operating Agreement.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>the record is devoid of explicit information that Fadul insisted on the changes in the April Operating Agreement, as appellants acknowledged at oral argument, the agreement was the product of negotiations between Fadul and Salkini, and the April Operating Agreement culminated in far more favorable terms to Fadul and Dynacorp than to appellees. A plaintiff satisfies the elements of false representation and knowledge of falsity where circumstantial evidence establishes that a defendant makes a promise without intending to perform. <em>See First Union Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>154 Md.App. at 159, 838 A.2d 404 (\u201c[Fraudulent intent can be inferred from circumstantial evidence[.]\u201d (Citations omitted)); <em>id. </em>at 134, 838 A.2d 404 (\u201c[A] person may commit fraud if he or she enters an agreement to do something, without the present intention of performing[.]\u201d (Citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">In this ease, the requirement that Fadul transfer ownership of VitalTel to Moutiny was not ambiguous. On April 12, 2006, pursuant to Section 3.1(ii) of the April Operating Agreement, Dynacorp and/or Fadul agreed to contribute to Moutiny \u201c100% of all of the ownership interests in Vit[a]lTel.\u201d VitalTel was the only asset that Fadul was to invest in Moutiny. An examination of the April Operating Agreement, and the requirement in Section 3.1(ii) that ownership of VitalTel be transferred to Moutiny, demonstrates the significance of the requirement. The third paragraph of April Operating Agreement clearly provides: \u201cWHEREAS, the parties have organized Moutiny [ ] to own 100% of the ownership interests in Vit[a]lTel, an Iraq public limited company[.]\u201d (Emphasis in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>original). In Section 3.1 of the April Operating Agreement, Fadul and Dynacorp, jointly and severally, represented and warranted that they owned or controlled 100% of VitalTel and had \u201cthe full power, capacity and authority to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby,\u201d <em>ie. </em>transfer of ownership of VitalTel to Moutiny. <em>Compare First Union Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>154 Md.App. at 141-43, 838 A.2d 404 (We concluded that the best efforts clause was subject to differing interpretations, that the parties had not discussed what the \u201cbest efforts\u201d clause meant, and that the contract itself did not provide a definition of terms within the clause.).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">In May 2006, just five weeks after signing the April Operating Agreement, Fadul began a period of delay and false assurances in providing Salkini documentation of the alleged transfer of VitalTel to Moutiny. On May 20, 2006, Fadul emailed Salkini that the Iraqi attorney, Al-Hadethy, would complete the transaction papers \u201cthis week\u201d transferring VitalTel to Moutiny, but that the paperwork needed to be authenticated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Iraq. On May 22, 2006, Fadul e-mailed Salkini that Al-Hadethy would pick up the completed papers \u201ctoday\u201d from the government entity. On July 19, 2006, after a period of two months\u2019 delay from Fadul\u2019s May 22, 2006, e-mail informing Salkini that AlHadethy would retrieve the documentation from the government \u201ctoday,\u201d Fadul forwarded documents to Salkini purporting to confirm the transfer of ownership of VitalTel to Moutiny. The documents were written in Arabic but displayed the name VitalTel in various places. At trial, Salkini introduced into evidence English translations of the documents as Defense Exhibit 34B. According to Salkini\u2019s translated document, titled \u201cCompletion of Process,\u201d the Iraqi Ministry of Trade purportedly certified that the process of selling one million shares of \u201cAl-Hayawi (VitalTel)\u201d to \u201cMoutiny ... in accordance with Corporate Law # 21\u201d had been completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">The circuit court drew a negative inference against Fadul with respect to whether VitalTel was transferred to Moutinyobserving that \u201cFadul failed to offer into evidence any docu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>ment demonstrating that VitalTel was transferred to Moutiny in accordance with the April Operating Agreement[,]\u201d and finding, in essence, that the transfer did not occur.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Simply put, we agree. No documents were introduced into evidence, at trial, verifying that VitalTel was actually transferred to Moutiny as purported by the document Fadul sent to Salkini. Indeed, at trial, Fadul failed to positively identify either defense exhibit 49 or defense exhibit 34A as the documents transferring ownership of VitalTel to Moutiny, stating that defense exhibit 49 contained a signature that did not \u201cresemble\u201d his signature, and that defense exhibit 34A\u2014which he could not recall previously viewing-contained documents which were not the \u201csame papers.\u201d In its Memorandum Opinion, the circuit court explicitly found that documents \u201cshowing that VitalTel was transferred to Moutiny\u201d were \u201cconspicuously missing from the Court record[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">On October 11, 2006, despite having entered into the April Operating Agreement in which he represented that he would convey VitalTel to Moutiny and not engage in any competitive business ventures, Fadul and Al Bahash created Al-Shams, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>company set up to provide wireless telecommunication services in Iraq. Although the record does not contain a specific date on which Fadul began to negotiate with Al Bahash to create Al-Shams, logic dictates that Fadul\u2019s creation of Al-Shams was conceived prior to the October 11, 2006, filing of the \u201cResolution license to establish a company.\u201d Within six months, after representing in the April Operating Agreement that he would convey VitalTel to Moutiny for purposes of establishing a wireless telecommunications network in Iraq, Fadul started another business entity for the same purpose and did not disclose this to Salkini.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>In March 2007, with Al-Shams already having been created, Fadul held two meetings\u2014one, on March 8, 2007, and the other a special meeting, on March 14, 2007\u2014with Salkini and others purportedly to discuss the progress of the reinstatement of VitalTel\u2019s License. The March 14, 2007, special meeting ended with Fadul\u2019s promise to provide a progress report on June 1, 2007, on the procurement of VitalTel\u2019s License. In May, 2007, Fadul told Salkini that VitalTel\u2019s License would not be reissued. In a letter introduced into evidence at trial as defense exhibit 55, the Director General of the Legal Department for the Ministry of Telecommunication for the Republic of Iraq, wrote that, on May 15, 2007, the VitalTel License was reissued to AI Khat A1 Hayawi, \u201cwhich is considered the same company\u201d as VitalTel \u201caccording to the official letters and correspondence with it[.]\u201d It is clear that at the time Fadul told Salkini that the License would not be reissued to VitalTel, he was aware that the License was in the process of being reissued to VitalTel under its Arabic name, A1 Khat A1 Hayawi.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">On June 16, 2007, despite his representation to appellees in the April Operating Agreement\u2014that VitalTel would be conveyed to Moutiny\u2014and despite his subsequent representation to appellees\u2014that VitalTel had been conveyed to Moutiny\u2014 Fadul actually conveyed VitalTel under the name Al Khat A1 Hayawi to AI Bahash, not Moutiny. On October 10, 2007, the Company Registrar of Iraq issued a document titled \u201cDecision to merge limited companies,\u201d documenting the merger of both Al Khat Al Hayawi and Al-Shams into Al Nakheel by resolutions dated October 1, 2007, from the general assemblies of each company. In February 2008, Fadul become chief executive officer of Al Nakheel. Fadul never disclosed to appellees the conveyance of VitalTel to Al Bahash.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">Using VitalTel\u2019s license, Al Nakheel has essentially taken Moutiny\u2019s place. Al Nakheel now operates in several of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>Iraqi provinces in which VitalTel had been licensed to operate.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> A1 Nakheel uses the four-digit network code that had been assigned to VitalTel and the radio frequencies that had been assigned to Moutiny. A1 Nakheel now employs at least six former Moutiny employees, including Al-Hadethy, Fadul\u2019s personal counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">The evidence discussed above establishes that, in the April Operating Agreement, Fadul falsely represented to appellees that he would convey VitalTel to Mioutiny when, in fact, Fadul intended to convey VitalTel under its Arabic name, Al Khat Al Hayawi, to Al Bahash. The evidence clearly and convincingly demonstrates that, in the April Operating Agreement, Fadul falsely represented that he would transfer VitalTel to Moutiny with knowledge of the falsity or reckless indifference to the truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">(ii) Purpose of Defrauding</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">The purpose of the fraudulent misrepresentation was to induce appellees to invest in Moutiny. As a result of the April Operating Agreement and accompanying Note, appellees invested $500,000 in Moutiny and loaned $30,000,000 to Moutiny. VitalTel/Moutiny\u2019s Quickbook accounts, introduced into evidence as defense exhibit 99A, demonstrate that on December 18, 2006, January 16, 21, and 28, 2007, Fadul withdrew money for \u201cCash on Hand\u201d in the amounts of $90,000, $50,000, $50,000, ami $100,000, respectively, without authorization from Aramtel. A plaintiff satisfies fraudulent inducement\u2019s element of a purpose of defrauding where circumstantial evidence establishes that a defendant had an ulterior motive for making the false representation to the plaintiff. <em>See First Union Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>154 Md.App. at 159, 838 A.2d 404. We are satisfied that the evidence established that Fadul made his false representation for the purpose of taking at least some of Moutiny\u2019s funding for himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>(iii) Reliance, and Right to Rely, on False Representation</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">VitalTel was the only asset that Fadul was obligated to contribute to Moutiny. Absent this critical representation, appellees had no reason to enter into the April Operating Agreement or Note. As the circuit court concluded, \u201cAramtel relied on Fadul\u2019s false [ Representations.... Based on Fadul\u2019s representations that VitalTel and its license had been [conveyed to Moutiny, Aramtel continued to loan significant sums to Moutiny[.]\u201d A plaintiff satisfies fraudulent inducement\u2019s element of reliance, and the right to rely, on a false representation where the evidence establishes that the plaintiff would have acted differently but for the representation. <em>Id. </em>at 134, 838 A.2d 404. In lending money to Moutiny, appellees relied on Fadul\u2019s representation\u2014that he would convey VitalTel to Moutiny\u2014and appellees had the right to rely on Fadul\u2019s false representation because Fadul\u2019s false representation was part of the April Operating Agreement, a written contract that was signed by both parties and stated in no uncertain terms that Fadul was to contribute to Moutiny \u201c100% of all of the ownership interests in Vit[a]lTel.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">(iv) Causation of Actual Damages</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">As a result of the April Operating Agreement and Note, appellees invested $500,000 in Moutiny and loaned $30,000,000 to Aramtel. The circuit court detailed the damages incurred by Aramtel in the Memorandum Opinion as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-8\">This Court finds that Aramtel initially invested five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000.00) in Moutiny and then promised to loan five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) to be used for operating expenses. Aramtel then loaned Moutiny twenty-five million dollars ($25,000,000.00) to be used to fund the purchase of telecommunications equipment from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>TWS. This Court therefore finds that Aramtel suffered $30,500,000.00 in damages, and [ojrders Fadul to compensate Aramtel for its investment by repaying this amount plus interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">A plaintiff satisfies fraudulent inducement\u2019s element of causation of actual damages where the evidence establishes that the plaintiff lost assets as a result of the false representation. <em>See First Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>154 Md.App. at 134, 838 A.2d 404 (To establish fraudulent inducement, a plaintiff must prove \u201cthat he [or she] actually suffered damage directly resulting from such fraudulent misrepresentation.\u201d (Citation omitted)). In this case, appellees suffered monetary losses\u2014ie. actual damages-as a result of Fadul\u2019s false representation.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">As to the damages Aramtel incurred as a result of entering and signing the April Operating Agreement and Note\u2014 $500,000 capital contribution, $5,000,000 loan for operating expenses, and $25,000,000 separate loan for the purchase of equipment\u2014we find no merit in appellants\u2019 contention that Fadul may not be held personally liable. Aramtel\u2019s claim for fraudulent inducement was not a claim for damages or repay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>ment under the agreement or the note, but rather a claim alleging fraud by Fadul. Section 12.3 of the April Operating Agreement contemplated circumstances in which the Managing Member\u2014Fadul\u2014could be \u201cliable, responsible or accountable in damages or otherwise to ... any Interest Holder\u201d for acts or omissions \u201cmade criminally, fraudulently or in bad faith[.]\u201d (Emphasis added). Aramtel, as a Member of Moutiny and a lender of large sums of money to Moutiny, was, by the very terms of the April Operating Agreement, an \u201cInterest Holder,\u201d <em>i.e. </em>a \u201cPerson who [held] an Interest\u201d in Moutiny. Under the April Operating Agreement, Fadul\u2019s fraudulent inducement and accompanying conduct constitute circumstances for which he could be held personally liable for damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">In addition to the terms of the April Operating Agreement not shielding Fadul from personal liability, the \u201ccorporate veil\u201d offers no protection. Proof of fraud by clear, specific acts warrants piercing the corporate veil and imposing liability. <em>See Ramlall, </em>202 Md.App. at 30, 30 A.3d 1003 (\u201cThe ... rule in Maryland is that although courts will, in a proper case, disregard the corporate entity and deal with substance rather than form, as though a corporation did not exist, shareholders generally are not held individually liable for debts or obligations of a corporation except where it is necessary to prevent fraud or enforce a paramount equity.\u201d (Citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">For the reasons above, we are satisfied that, evaluated in its entirety, the evidence established that Fadul fraudulently induced Aramtel to invest $500,000 in, and loan at least $30,000,000 to, Moutiny, and that the circuit court properly awarded damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">Standing to Bring Derivative Claims</p>\n<p id=\"AgXQ\">(1) Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">Appellants contend that the circuit court erred in holding that Aramtel had standing to bring the derivative claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>against appellants.

Appellants assert that the circuit court held that \u201cDynacorp [ ] lacked authority to pursue its causes of action [on Moutiny\u2019s behalf] against Aramtel and TWS[,]\u201d but failed to address appellants\u2019 \u201cparallel argument that, if Dynacorp was without authority to have Moutiny bring causes of action, Aramtel similarly lacked authority to have Moutiny bring causes of action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">Appellees respond that the circuit court properly held that Aramtel had standing to bring derivative claims on Moutiny\u2019s behalf. Appellees point out that, in the separate action that Aramtel filed against appellants, upon motion by appellants, the circuit court concluded \u201cthat claims involving posi-Operating Agreement conduct <em>must </em>be pursued by Aramtel as derivative claims, not direct claims.\u201d (Emphasis in original). Appellees contend that Section 4.1 of the April Operating Agreement addresses Moutiny\u2019s day-to-day management, and does not \u201cprohibit, and should not be interpreted to prohibit, Aramtel from pursing a derivative action to enforce a right of Moutiny as one of its members.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">As to appellants\u2019 contention that the circuit court applied Section 4.1 inconsistently, appellees maintain that \u201c[ajppellants completely ignore the fact that Fadul and Dynacorp were not attempting to bring <em>derivative </em>claims on behalf of Moutiny, but rather Fadul initiated direct claims <em>in Moutiny\u2019s name </em>against Aramtel[.]\u201d (Emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">In a reply brief, appellants contend that Section 4.1 of the April Operating Agreement prevents a derivative action, and that, had any member of Moutiny \u201cwanted to except a Member\u2019s right to bring a shareholder derivative suit in Moutiny\u2019s name from Section 4.1\u2019s absolute prohibition against any \u2018act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>for or bindfrng]\u2019 Moutiny, they could have included such a[n] exception in the April [Operating] Agreement\u2019s language.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">(2) Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">An appellate court reviews <em>de novo </em>a trial court\u2019s legal conclusion as to a contract\u2019s interpretation. <em>See Weichert Co. of Md. v.

When interpreting a contract to determine its meaning, appellate courts focus \u201con the four corners of the agreement[,]\u201d <em>Cochran v.

Under the objective approach to contract interpretation, an appellate court does not consider the subjective interpretations and intent of the parties, but rather \u201clook[s] at what a reasonably prudent person in the same position would have understood as to the meaning of the agreement.\u201d <em>Cochran, </em>398 Md. at 17, 919 A.2d 700 (citation omitted).

The Court of Appeals has also noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-5\">\u201cA recognized rule of construction in ascertaining the true meaning of a contract is that the contract must be construed in its entirety and, if reasonably possible, effect must be given to each clause so that a court will not find an interpretation which casts out or disregards a meaningful part of the language of the writing unless no other course can be sensibly and reasonably followed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-6\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Sagner v.

Boland, </em>423 Md. 296, 316, 31 A.3d 529 (2011), the Court of Appeals explained the distinction between a direct claim and a derivative claim, stating that Maryland courts look to \u201cthe nature of the right claimed to be violated, and the remedy sought\u201d as guidance. Where a claim is based on a breach of duty owed directly to the shareholder and the injury is suffered only by the shareholder and not the corporate entity as a whole, then the claim is a direct claim. <em>Id. </em>In contrast, a derivative claim \u201cinvolves a <em>corporate right </em>\u201d brought on behalf of the corporate entity, rather than the shareholder. <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original) (citation omitted).

Laureate Educ., Inc., </em>411 Md. 317, 344, 983 A.2d 408 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">(4) Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">We begin our analysis by noting that, on appeal, the issue before this Court is whether Aramtel had standing under the April Operating Agreement to bring derivative claims on Moutiny\u2019s behalf against Fadul, Dynacorp, and TeckTel. The parties do not raise, and we do not address, any issue as to legal standing to bring suit.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">(a) Judicial Estoppel</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">Although the parties do not raise the issue of judicial estoppel as to standing to bring derivative claims, upon <em>de novo </em>review, we conclude that appellants are judicially estopped from contending that appellees are prohibited from bringing derivative claims on Moutiny\u2019s behalf. In Aramtel\u2019s original action against <em>appellants\u2014Aramtel, Ltd. v. Fadul, et. al, </em>Case No. 13-C-07-69958 in the circuit court-appellants contended that Aramtel was required to bring derivative claims, not direct claims, on Moutiny\u2019s behalf. The circuit court agreed and entered summary judgment in appellants\u2019 favor.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Via counterclaims in the instant <em>case\u2014Dynacorp, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number><em>Ltd., et al. v. Aramtel, Ltd., et al., </em>Case No. 13-C-08-072145 CN in the circuit court\u2014-Aramtel brought derivative claims on Moutiny\u2019s behalf. In the instant case, contrary to their earlier assertion, appellants contend that Aramtel is not permitted to bring derivative claims on Moutiny\u2019s behalf. Judicial estoppel prevents a party from taking a position in a litigation where: (1) the party took an inconsistent position\u2014either legal or factual\u2014in an earlier litigation, (2) a court accepted the earlier inconsistent position, and (3) the party intentionally misled the court to gain an unfair advantage. <em>Mona, </em>176 Md.App. at 726, 934 A.2d 450; <em>Chaney Enters. Ltd. P\u2019ship., </em>158 Md.App. at 45, 43, 854 A.2d 233 (This Court held that judicial estoppel applies to legal positions.). Based on all of the above, we are satisfied that appellants are judicially estopped from contending that appellees cannot bring derivative claims on Moutiny\u2019s behalf because: (1) appellants took an inconsistent position in Aramtel\u2019s original action against appellants, (2) the circuit court accepted appellants\u2019 earlier inconsistent position by granting summary judgment against Aramtel, and (3) appellants intentionally misled the circuit court so that summary judgment would be granted, while appellants intended all along to contend in the instant case that Aramtel could not bring derivative claims on Moutiny\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">(b) The Contract Language</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">Although we determine that appellants are judicially estopped from contending that appellees cannot pursue derivative claims, we, nonetheless, conclude that the plain language of the April Operating Agreement does not preclude appellees\u2019 derivative claims. Section 4.1 states, in its entirety:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-7\">Section 4.1. <em>No Management Power. </em>No Member solely by virtue of being a Member may take part in the management, conduct or control of the business of the Company or have any right or authority to act for or bind the Company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>as a Member, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">Upon review of the plain language of Section 4. 1, we conclude that the plain meaning of the section is clear\u2014Members, clearly defined by the April Operating Agreement to be Aramtel and Dynacorp, may not take part in conducting, managing, or controlling the operations of Moutiny, as a Member, unless otherwise authorized to do so in the April Operating Agreement. Presumably appellants rely on the language stating no member shall have any right \u201cto act for or bind\u201d the company except otherwise provided in the agreement to reach the conclusion that a member may not bring a derivative action unless the agreement so provides. This reliance is misplaced. Article IV titled \u201cManagement\u201d contains six sections which set forth the management responsibilities and structure of the company. The six sections of Article IV are titled: 4.1\u2014No Management Power; 4.2\u2014Manage-ment by Managing Member; 4.3\u2014Restrictions on Authority; 4.4\u2014Officers; 4.5\u2014Board of Directors; and 4.6\u2014Non-Com-pete Restrictions. None of the sections address in any manner a member\u2019s ability to bring legal action.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">Section 4.2 of the April Operating Agreement states in clear and simple language that the Managing Member, defined in Article II to be Fadul, was to manage the day-to-day operations of Moutiny and VitalTel and \u201cdo any and all other things ... deem[ed] necessary or desirable in connection with the conduct of the business and affairs of [Moutiny] and/or Vit[a]lTel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">Section 4.3 restricts the authority granted to the Managing Member, and provides in subsection (i) that the Managing Member shall not have authority, prior to the satisfaction of the Note, to enter into a contract or obligation on behalf of Moutiny or VitalTel in excess of $50,000 \u201cexcept with the consent of the Majority of Members[.]\u201d Section 4.4 provides that the Managing Member shall serve as the chief executive officer of Moutiny and VitalTel for at least two years, and that officers who are not Members may be removed at any time by the Managing Member. Section 4.5 provides that, by a vote of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>the Majority of the Members, the Members may establish a board of directors as well as the responsibilities and powers of the board. Section 4.6 provides that Fadul, Dynacorp, and TeckTel may not engage in competitive wireless telecommunication business activities in Iraq and that they must present any wireless telecommunication business activities to Moutiny and VitalTel. By a plain reading, Section 4.1 of Article IV of the April Operating Agreement, and the other five sections of Article IV\u20144.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, and 4.6\u2014pertain to management and operation of the company, and provide that a Managing Member would be responsible for day-to-day management of the company and its business affairs, and that members must not engage in undisclosed competitive business activities. In neither Section 4.1 nor any other section within the agreement did the parties agree that consent was a prerequisite for filing a derivative action on behalf of Moutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">\u201cUnder the objective approach to contract interpretation, the inquiry as to the meaning of the language of the contract is restricted to the four corners of the agreement, and as such, the customary, ordinary, and accepted meaning of the language of the contract is assigned to it.\u201d <em>AECOM Srvcs., </em>200 Md.App. at 403, 28 A.3d 11 (citation omitted). Here, the plain meaning of the April Operating Agreement is clear\u2014despite appellants\u2019 contention to the contrary\u2014when viewed from the perspective of a reasonable person in the parties\u2019 position.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">Although we conclude that the meaning of Section 4.1 of the April Operating Agreement is plain, we shall, nevertheless, briefly address the parties\u2019 intent. It is evident that it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>not the intent of the parties to prohibit one another from bringing a derivative action on behalf of the joint venture, Moutiny. There is no information in the record that suggests the parties intended to lend to Section 4.1 the meaning that appellants attach to the section. To conclude otherwise would provide both Aramtel and Dynacorp with no recourse for circumstances such as those alleged in the instant <em>case\u2014ie. </em>the company failing, in part or in whole, due to the fraudulent conduct of its Managing Member.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">Personal Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"AGP\">(1) Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">Appellants contend that the circuit court lacked specific personal jurisdiction over Fadul, Dynacorp, and TeckTel as to the derivative claims because \u201cthe causes of action brought on Moutiny\u2019s behalf ... neither arise out of, nor are directly related to, the conduct of [] Fadul, Dynacorp or TeckTel within Maryland.\u201d Appellants argue that the circuit court lacked general personal jurisdiction over Fadul, Dynacorp, or TeckTel because \u201cthere is no evidence that they engaged in continuous and systematic activities in Maryland[,]\u201d including doing or soliciting business, performing work or services, maintaining an office, advertising, or making trips to Maryland related to Moutiny\u2019s causes of action. Appellants maintain that correspondence between Fadul, Salkini, and TWS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>\u201cdoes not demonstrate a persistent course of conduct in Maryland.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">Appellants contend that Section 14.5 of the April Operating Agreement, the consent provision, \u201crelates solely to disputes between the \u2018parties\u2019 to the April [Operating] Agreement, ... and relates only to claims arising under the Agreement[.]\u201d Appellants argue that Moutiny, as a non-party, had no contractual basis to assert that the circuit court had personal jurisdiction over Fadul, Dynacorp, or TeckTel. Appellants maintain that the derivative claims did not arise under the April Operating Agreement because neither Fadul, Dynacorp, nor TeckTel owed an obligation to Moutiny under the agreement because Moutiny was not a party to the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">Appellants contend that the circuit court erred in finding that Fadul, Dynacorp, and TeckTel waived the defense of lack of personal jurisdiction as to the derivative claims. According to appellants, the defense of lack of personal jurisdiction was raised in TeckTel\u2019s motion to strike and in appellants\u2019 motion to dismiss. Appellants argue that the circuit court erroneously concluded that, because Fadul and Dynacorp initiated the lawsuit by filing the complaint in the circuit court, they submitted to the jurisdiction of the circuit court. Appellants assert that, because Moutiny was not a defendant in the second amended complaint, the second amended complaint \u201ccannot be used to hold them to the personal jurisdiction of the [c]ircuit [c]ourt with respect to Moutiny\u2019s counterclaims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">Appellees respond that the circuit court properly exercised personal jurisdiction over Fadul, Dynacorp, and TeckTel as to the derivative claims. Initially, appellees contend that Fadul and Dynacorp waived the defense of lack of personal jurisdiction by not raising the defense pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-322 in a motion to dismiss filed before an answer. Accordingly, appellees argue that the \u201cjurisdiction issue is not reviewable by this Court as to Fadul and Dynacorp.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">Alternatively, appellees contend that the circuit court correctly found that Fadul, Dynacorp, and TeckTel contractually consented to the jurisdiction of the circuit court pursuant to</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>Section 14.5 of the April Operating Agreement. Appellees assert that Section 14.5 provides that any claim arising under the agreement shall be tried in Maryland, and that each \u201cderivative claim is undoubtedly related to, and thus arises under, the [April] Operating Agreement.\u201d Appellees argue that, although Moutiny is not a \u201csignatory to the [April] Operating Agreement[,]\u201d Moutiny is bound and governed by the terms of the agreement, and \u201cthus required to bring suit in Maryland against other parties bound by [the] terms [of the agreement].\u201d Appellees contend that \u201cthe trial record is replete with evidence that [a]ppellants \u2018transacted business\u2019 in Maryland\u201d such that the exercise of specific jurisdiction was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">(2) Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">An appellate court reviews <em>de novo </em>a trial court\u2019s legal conclusion as to whether or not the trial court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant. <em>Himes </em>As<em>socs., Ltd. v.

In <em>Bahn v. Chicago Motor Club Ins.

(Citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">General personal jurisdiction cases, in contrast, \u201carise from the defendant\u2019s general, more persistent contacts with the State\u201d rather than from the cause of action arising out of the defendant\u2019s contacts in the State. <em>Beyond Sys., Inc., </em>388 Md. at 22, 878 A.2d 567; <em>CSR, </em>411 Md. at 477, 983 A.2d 492. In <em>CSR, </em>411 Md. at 477, 983 A.2d 492, the Court of Appeals stated: \u201cTo justify the exercise of general jurisdiction, the defendant\u2019s contacts with the forum state must be continuous and systematic.\u201d (Citations omitted). As with specific personal jurisdiction cases, in general personal jurisdiction cases, an appellate court must consider \u201cwhether the defendant \u2018purposefully availed itself of the privilege of conducting activities in the State,\u2019 and \u2018whether the exercise of personal jurisdiction would be constitutionally reasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 478, 983 A.2d 492 (quoting <em>Beyond Sys., Inc., </em>388 Md. at 26, 878 A.2d 567). In <em>Camelback, </em>312 Md. at 339, 539 A.2d 1107, the Court of Appeals cautioned, however, against strict distinction between specific personal jurisdiction and general personal jurisdiction cases, observing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-6\">The concept of specific and general [personal] jurisdiction is a useful tool in the sometimes difficult task of detecting how much contact is enough, and most cases will fit nicely into one category or the other. If, however, the facts of a given case do not naturally place it at either end of the spectrum, there is no need to jettison the concept, or to force-fit the case. In that instance, the proper approach is to identify the approximate position of the case on the continuum that exists between the two extremes, and apply the corresponding standard, recognizing that the quantum of required contacts increases as the nexus between the contacts and the cause of action decreases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">The Court of Appeals has held that a key part of a court\u2019s analysis in either a specific personal jurisdiction or a general personal jurisdiction case is determining whether or not the defendant has purposefully availed itself of the privi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>lege of conducting activities within the forum State, \u201cthus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.\u201d <em>CSR, </em>411 Md. at 479, 983 A.2d 492. As the Court of Appeals observed, \u201cthe absence of any purposeful availment by the defendant stands as an obstacle to whether the defendant\u2019s contacts with the forum state amount to the sufficient minimum contacts necessary to confer jurisdiction[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>In <em>Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, </em>471 U.S. 462, 475-76, 105 S.Ct. 2174, 85 L.Ed.2d 528 (1985), the Supreme Court described why purposeful availment is important to a personal jurisdiction analysis, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-5\">T[he] \u201cpurposeful availment\u201d requirement ensures that a defendant will not be haled into a jurisdiction solely as a result of \u201crandom,\u201d \u201cfortuitous,\u201d or \u201cattenuated\u201d contacts, or of the \u201cunilateral activity of another party of a third person[.]\u201d Jurisdiction is proper, however, where the contacts proximately result from actions by the defendant [itjself that create a \u201csubstantial connection\u201d with the forum State. Thus where the defendant \u201cdeliberately\u201d has engaged in significant activities within a State, or has created \u201ccontinuing obligations\u201d between [itjself and residents of the forum, [it] manifestly has availed [itjself of the privilege of conducting business there, and because [its] activities are shielded by \u201cthe benefits and protections\u201d of the forum\u2019s laws it is presumptively not unreasonable to require [it] to submit to the burdens of litigation in that forum as well.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">(Citations, emphasis, and footnotes omitted). A factor related to purposeful availment is \u201cforeseeability\u201d or \u201cnotice,\u201d <em>i.e. </em>that the defendant, in purposefully availing itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State, could reasonably expect or has notice that it could be subjected to suit in the forum State as a result of its conduct and connection with the forum State. <em>World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v.

If, by signing the April Operating Agreement, Aramtel contractually consented to personal jurisdiction over it by the circuit court, then\u2014at a minimum\u2014Fadul and Dynacorp also contractually consented to personal jurisdiction by the circuit court. To conclude otherwise would strain the bounds of reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">We are unpersuaded by appellants\u2019 contention that Moutiny, a \u201cnon-party\u201d to the April Operating Agreement, had no contractual basis to assert that the circuit court had personal jurisdiction over Fadul or Dynacorp. Although Moutiny was not a signatory to the April Operating Agreement, Moutiny was created and governed by the April Operating Agreement, and it, too, was bound to bring suit in Maryland pursuant to Section 14.5. Indeed, as explained above, appellants\u2014Fadul, Dynacorp, and Moutiny\u2014brought suit in Maryland against appellees, asserting a contractual basis for personal jurisdiction over Aramtel, as evidenced by the verified amended complaint. Thus, what appellants argue before this Court\u2014 that Moutiny has no contractual basis upon which to assert the circuit court\u2019s personal jurisdiction\u2014is directly contradictory to the position that they took before the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-9\">Appellants\u2019 contention that the derivative claims brought by Aramtel on Moutiny\u2019s behalf did not \u201carise under\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>the April Operating Agreement and, thus, could not provide a basis for the exercise of personal jurisdiction over Fadul and Dynacorp, is without merit. In Section 12.3 of the April Operating Agreement, the parties agreed that Fadul, as Managing Member, would not be liable to Moutiny or any other \u201cInterest Holder\u201d unless his actions or omissions were \u201cmade criminally, fraudulently or in bad faith, or unless such action or omission constituted gross negligence or an intentional breach of this Agreement.\u201d By its plain language, the April Operating Agreement: (1) set forth circumstances under which Moutiny could seek damages from Fadul pursuant to the agreement; and (2) established a duty owed by Fadul to Moutiny and other Interest Holders to refrain from fraudulent and other acts and omissions described in Section 12.3\u2014 exactly the types of acts alleged in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">(b) Specific Personal Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">Although we conclude, <em>supra, </em>that appellants consented under the April Operating Agreement to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the circuit court, we shall nonetheless address whether or not the circuit court erred in exercising personal jurisdiction over Fadul and Dynacorp<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> as to the derivative claims brought on behalf of Moutiny. Upon examination of the record, we conclude that Fadul and Dynacorp transacted business in the State within the meaning of C.J.P. \u00a7 6\u2014103(b)(1) and that the circuit court did not err in its exercise of personal jurisdiction over them. We shall examine each of the three factors set forth by the Court of Appeals in <em>Beyond Sys., Inc., </em>388 Md. at 26, 878 A.2d 567.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">(i) Purposeful Availment</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">As to the first prong of the specific personal jurisdiction analysis set forth by the Court of Appeals in <em>Beyond Sys., Inc., </em>the record in the instant case reflects that Fadul-\u2014a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>Virginia resident, representing himself, Dynacorp, and Vital-Tel\u2014entered into a contract, the April Operating Agreement, in Maryland, with Salkini\u2014a Maryland resident, who represented Aramtel and TWS. Prior to signing the April Operating Agreement, Fadul engaged in extensive negotiations by sending e-mails to Salkini in Maryland over the course of several months, and signing the earlier agreement\u2014the March Operating Agreement\u2014in Maryland. After signing the April Operating Agreement, Fadul participated in meetings of Moutiny in Maryland and continued to correspond frequently with Salkini in Maryland and to provide updates concerning Moutiny. Salkini, the other party to the agreement, performed duties under the April Operating Agreement on behalf of himself, Aramtel, and TWS in Maryland, including participating in and attending meetings of Moutiny\u2019s members in Maryland. When the relationship between the parties soured, Fadul and Dynacorp sued appellees in a circuit court in Maryland. Accordingly, Fadul and Dynacorp purposefully availed themselves of a contractual business relationship with a Maryland resident and a corporate entity with Maryland headquarters such that they could have reasonably expected that their conduct could subject them to suit within Maryland. <em>See World-Wide Volkswagen, </em>444 U.S. at 297, 100 S.Ct. 559 (\u201cWhen a [defendant] \u2018purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State,\u2019 it has clear notice that it is subject to suit there[.]\u201d (Citation omitted)). Fadul and Dynacorp, by bringing suit against appellees in Maryland, clearly and purposefully \u201cinvok[ed] the benefits and protections\u201d of Maryland law. <em>CSR, </em>411 Md. at 479, 983 A.2d 492. To conclude that Fadul and Dynacorp could sue, and assert claims on Moutiny\u2019s behalf, in Maryland, but not be subject to suit in return, would be contrary to the rule of logic.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">(ii) Claims Arising Out of Activities Directed at Maryland</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">As to the second prong set forth in <em>Beyond Sys., Inc., </em>the issue is whether Fadul\u2019s and Dynacorp\u2019s actions\u2014in breaching duties owed to Moutiny and committing other wrongs against Moutiny under the April Operating Agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>ment, as alleged in the first amended counterclaim\u2014were substantively connected to Maryland. Moutiny, the joint venture, was created by the April Operating Agreement\u2014signed in Maryland\u2014and the parties\u2019 conduct and any dispute concerning Moutiny were to be governed by Maryland law pursuant to Section 14.5 of the April Operating Agreement. Meetings of Moutiny occurred and were scheduled to occur in Maryland. Status updates concerning Moutiny and Fadul\u2019s actions regarding Moutiny\u2014or lack thereof\u2014as well as requests for additional funds for Moutiny, were e-mailed to Salkini in Maryland and provided in person by Fadul at Moutiny\u2019s meeting in Maryland. In total, Fadul and Dynacorp purposefully availed themselves of the privilege of doing business in Maryland, and the causes of action brought on Moutiny\u2019s behalf against Fadul and Dynacorp arose out of the April Operating Agreement, which was negotiated, signed, and performed, at least in part, in Maryland. We observe that it is disingenuous on appellants\u2019 part to bring claims in a circuit court in Maryland directly in Moutiny\u2019s name in the second amended complaint\u2014the substance of which is similar to the substance of the claims appellees asserted on Moutiny\u2019s behalf in the first amended counterclaim\u2014and yet argue before this Court that such claims are not related to or arising from the parties\u2019 conduct within Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">(iii) Whether the Exercise of Personal Jurisdiction Would be Constitutionally Reasonable</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Turning to the third prong of a specific personal jurisdiction analysis, we are satisfied that the circuit court\u2019s exercise of personal jurisdiction over Fadul and Dynacorp was constitutionally reasonable. A review of the record demonstrates that the burden on Fadul and Dynacorp to defend against the counterclaims was minimal, as they had already initiated suit in Maryland against appellees, and the claims mostly involved the same parties and the same factual background. Maryland, appellants\u2019 chosen forum State, clearly has an interest in efficiently resolving the controversy and claims between the parties related to the April Operating Agreement in one lawsuit. Maryland also \u201chas a significant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>interest in protecting the rights of its residents[,]\u201d <em>Himes, </em>178 Md.App. at 532, 943 A.2d 30, and in resolving disputes related to a contract signed in Maryland, performed\u2014at least in part\u2014in Maryland, and by its very terms, governed by Maryland law (as set forth in Section 14.5 of the April Operating Agreement).

As to Count VI, appellees argue that Maryland recognizes the claim of breach of fiduciary duty and that Fadul, who owed a duty to Moutiny by virtue of being the Managing Member, breached his duty. As to Count VII, appellees assert that the record supports the circuit court\u2019s award for damages for conversion, because Fadul placed a value of $75,000,000 on the License. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>As to Count VIII, appellees maintain that the circuit court found that Moutiny was harmed by Fadul\u2019s failure to inform the company of the \u201cAl Nakheel opportunity,\u201d and by Fadul\u2019s taking the opportunity for himself and allowing Moutiny to continue to incur debt after the License was gone.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">In a reply brief, as to Counts III through VIII, appellants argue that the circuit court did not award any damages for the derivative claims, and that the circuit court \u201cerred [in] entering] judgment in Aramtel\u2019s favor on its derivative claims\u201d without finding damages. As to Count II, appellants contend that the circuit court failed to award even \u201cnominal contract damages\u201d to Moutiny. Appellants assert that the \u201cplain words and the structure\u201d of the Memorandum Opinion, and specifically the section titled \u201cDamages,\u201d demonstrates that the circuit court failed to find that Moutiny suffered any damages. Appellants maintain that, contrary to appellees\u2019 contention, the circuit court did not implicitly award out-of-pocket damages, \u201cbecause even assuming Moutiny incurred out-of-pocket damages, such damages were impermissibly speculative.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">(2) Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">An appellate court reviews a trial court\u2019s factual findings for clear error, and reviews the trial court\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de novo.

Under that theory, a victim of fraudulent or negligent misrepresentation may elect to recover either out-of-pocket expenses or benefit-of-the-bargain damages. The former will permit the plaintiff to recover his or her actual losses; the latter puts the defrauded party in the same financial position as if the fraudulent representations had in fact been true, by awarding as damages the difference between the actual value of the property at the time of making the contract and the value that it would have possessed if the representations had been true.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">(Citations and internal quotation marks omitted). The flexibility theory, in turn, is based on the following four \u201cconclusions\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-7\">(1) If the defrauded party is content with the recovery of only the amount that he actually lost, his damages will be measured under that rule;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-8\">(2) if the fraudulent representation also amounted to a warranty, recovery may be had for loss of the bargain because a fraud accompanied by a broken promise should cost the wrongdoer as much as the latter alone;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-9\">(3) where the circumstances disclosed by the proof are so vague as to cast virtually no light upon the value of the property had it conformed to the representations, the court will award damages equal only to the loss sustained; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-10\">(4) where ... the damages under the benefit-of-the-bargain rule are proved with sufficient certainty, that rule will be employed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 423, 859 A.2d 313 (citation, footnote, and internal quotation marks omitted) (omission in original).

It is ... any distinct act of ownership or dominion exerted by one person <em>[ie. </em>the defendant] over the personal property of another <em>[ie. </em>the plaintiff] in denial of his [or her] right or inconsistent with it. The act of ownership for conversion can occur either by initially acquiring the property or by retaining it longer than the rightful possessor <em>[ie. </em>the plaintiff] permits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">(Citations and internal quotation marks omitted).

Damages must be proven \"with reasonable certainty, or some degree of specificity, and may not be based on mere speculation or conjecture.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">As to the degree of certainty required, the Court of Appeals has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-7\">Courts have modified the \u201ccertainty\u201d rule into a more flexible one of \u201creasonable certainty.\u201d In such instances, recovery may often be based on opinion evidence, in the legal sense of that term, from which liberal inferences may be drawn.

If so, the director or officer may not appropriate it and thereby frustrate the corporate purpose. If the opportunity is a corporate one, then the director or officer to whom it is presented or who becomes aware of it must first present it to the corporation, before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>pursuing it himself [or herself].... Only if the corporation rejects the opportunity may a director or officer exploit it for his [or her] own benefit. When an officer or director breaches his [or her] duty of loyalty to the corporation by usurping a corporate opportunity for his [or her] personal benefit, the corporation may claim all of the benefits of the transaction for itself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">(Omission in original) (citations and some internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">In <em>Werbowsky v. Collomb, </em>362 Md. 581, 610, 766 A.2d 123 (2001), the Court of Appeals described corporate waste as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-7\">With respect to allegations of corporate waste, the test ... is whether [or not] what the corporation has received is so inadequate in value that no person of ordinary, sound business judgment would deem it worth that which the corporation has paid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">(Citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">(4) Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b518-10\">Returning to the instant case, after careful review of the record, we conclude that the circuit court erred in granting judgment in appellees\u2019 favor as to the derivative claims brought on Moutiny\u2019s behalf.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> In its Memorandum Opinion, the circuit court concluded that Aramtel had proven the derivative claims brought on Moutiny\u2019s behalf, Count II through Count VIII, in addition to having proven its direct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>claim for fraudulent inducement, Count I. In assessing damages, however, the circuit court ruled that, although Aramtel had proven its damages, Aramtel failed to prove damages on Moutiny\u2019s behalf, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-5\">In determining the proper measure of damages in fraud and deceit cases, Maryland applies the \u201cflexibility theory.\u201d ... Under this \u201cflexibility theory\u201d, a victim of fraudulent or negligent misrepresentation may elect to recover \u201cout-of-pocket\u201d expenses or \u201cbenefit-of-the-bargain\u201d damages. Moutiny was deprived the benefit of its bargain as a result of Fadul\u2019s fraudulent scheme and many violations of his contractual and fiduciary duties. Because the future profits of Moutiny are unknown, this Court will not [ojrder damages based on the loss of ownership of the WLL license, the lost profits or the benefits Fadul received from the A1 Nakheel opportunity. While Moutiny may have successfully deployed the WLL network in Iraq if it had the WLL license, it still may have failed for numerous other reasons. Because [appellees] cannot prove Moutiny\u2019s profits with certainty, this Court cannot make a determination as to the potential damages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">(Emphasis added). The circuit court erred in entering judgment in appellees\u2019 favor as to the derivative claims without finding damages, a required element for all of the causes of action alleged as derivative claims on Moutiny\u2019s behalf in appellees\u2019 first amended counterclaim. <em>See, e.g., Rozen, </em>165 Md.App. at 675, 886 A.2d 924 (An element of fraud is that the plaintiff suffered compensable injury as a result of the misrepresentation.); <em>Brass Metal Prods. v. E-J Enters., </em>189 Md.App. 310, 360, 984 A.2d 361 (2009) (\u201cConstructive fraud ... injure[s] ... interests.\u201d (Citation omitted)); <em>Katz, </em>361 Md. at 657, 762 A.2d 582 (Negligent misrepresentation requires that \u201cthe plaintiff suffer[ ] damage proximately caused by the defendant\u2019s negligence.\u201d); <em>Vaughn, </em>146 Md.App. at 277, 806 A.2d 787 (Damages for conversion are measured by \u201cthe fair market value of the property at the time and place of the conversion.\u201d); <em>Shapiro, </em>136 Md.App. at 16, 764 A.2d 270 (Where an officer or director usurps a corporate opportunity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>for his or her personal benefit, \u201cthe corporation may claim all of the benefits of the transaction for itself\u2019 as damages.); <em>Werbowsky, </em>362 Md. at 610, 766 A.2d 123 (Corporate waste, by definition, results from an amount \u201cwhich the corporation has paid.\u201d (Citation and internal quotation marks omitted)).<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">To be sure, the circuit court remarked that Moutiny had been deprived of the benefit of its bargain. The circuit court clearly found, however, that it could not make a determination as to Moutiny\u2019s potential damages, as Moutiny\u2019s profits were speculative and uncertain and as Moutiny \u201cmay have failed for numerous other reasons\u201d aside from Fadul\u2019s tortious acts. The circuit court rejected several possible theories of damages incurred by Moutiny, stating that it would not order damages based on loss of the License, lost profits, or benefits Fadul received from A1 Nakheel. We stated that damages generally \u201cmust be proven with reasonable certainty, or some degree of specificity, and may not be based on mere speculation or conjecture[,]\u201d <em>Zachair, Ltd., </em>135 Md.App. at 427, 762 A.2d 991 (citation omitted), and that benefit-of-the-bargain damages under the flexibility theory, specifically, must be proven with \u201csufficient certainty[.]\u201d <em>Goldstein, </em>159 Md.App. at 424, 859 A.2d 313 (citation omitted). Despite its clear finding that it could not make a determination as to damages incurred by <em>Moutiny\u2014i.e. </em>that Moutiny\u2019s damages were speculative and uncertain-the circuit court entered judgment in favor of appellees on the derivative claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">As to appellees\u2019 claim that the circuit court intended the $30,000,000 in damages found for Aramtel to be assessed as damages on the derivative claims, the record demonstrates that the circuit court simply did not make this finding. Although appellees urge that when read as a whole, the circuit court\u2019s opinion leads to the conclusion that the court intended the $30,000,000 in damages to be assessed as to Count I, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>fraudulent inducement, and as to the derivative claims, an award of damages must not be based on speculation. Interpreting the circuit court\u2019s opinion in the manner argued by appellees directly contradicts the circuit court\u2019s statement that it could not make a determination as to damages for Moutiny. <em>Zachair, Ltd., </em>135 Md.App. at 427, 762 A.2d 991 (Damages \u201cmay not be based on mere speculation or conjecture.\u201d) (citation omitted).

An appellate court may consider grounds that differ from a trial court\u2019s. <em>See Yaffe v. Scarlett Place Residential Condo., </em>205 Md.App. 429, 440, 45 A.3d 844 (2012) (\"[A]lthough an appellate court will not ordinarily consider an issue that was not previously raised in the trial court, an appellate court can affirm when the record in a case adequately demonstrates that the decision of the trial court was correct, although on a ground not relied upon by the trial court and perhaps not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>even raised by the parties.

Pursuant to Maryland Rule 8-131(c), an appellate court \"will not set aside the judgment of the trial court on the evidence unless clearly erroneous, and will give due regard to the opportunity of the trial court to judge the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d In <em>Fischer Org., Inc. </em>v. <em>Landry\u2019s Seafood Rests., Inc., </em>143 Md.App. 65, 72, 792 A.2d 349 (2002), after stating the standard of review set forth in Maryland Rule 8-131(c), we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-8\">If, in considering the evidence produced at trial in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, an appellate court determines that there is sufficient evidence to support the judgment of the trial court, it will not be disturbed.

At trial, Fadul denied that he added the attachment to his February 1, 2006, e-mail to Salkini.

Indeed, Section 1.8 of the March Operating Agreement stated that enforceability of the agreement was conditional on \u201capproval of th[e] Agreement and TWS as equipment supplier\u201d by the Iraqi government. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>At trial, Fadul testified that the Iraqi government declined to approve the transfer of VitalTel\u2019s License to Moutiny or to agree to the use of TWS equipment. Fadul presented no documentation, at trial, however, that would confirm the lack of approval from the Iraqi government of the transfer of the License to Moutiny or the use of TWS as equipment supplier. Thus, as to the disapproval, we have only Fadul's word on the matter. Interestingly, at trial, Salkini testified that, after Fadul informed him about the failure of gaining approval from the Iraqi government for TWS, he and Fadul met and \"at the end of the conversation it turned out that the [MOC] had nothing to do with [the approval] and there was really no approval needed, that [Fadul could] utilize whatever equipment he want[ed].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b482-6\">. At oral argument, appellants contended that the circuit court found in its Memorandum Opinion that the transfer of VitalTel to Moutiny occurred. Needless to say, appellees disagreed. When asked by this Court to identify a location in the record that supported the contention that the circuit court found the transfer occurred, appellants\u2019 counsel pointed to the following: (1) In the memorandum opinion, the circuit court noted that, after the April Operating Agreement was executed, AlHadethy was asked to effectuate the transfer of VitalTel to Moutiny; and (2) the circuit court wrote that the documents contained in defense exhibit 34A were sent to Salkini by Fadul to establish that 100% of the shares of VitalTel had been successfully transferred to Moutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">Although appellants contend that the circuit court found the transfer occurred, appellants rely exclusively on the two statements above, neither of which is a finding by the circuit court that Fadul transferred ownership of VitalTel to Moutiny. The circuit court explicitly found that Fadul failed to produce any evidence demonstrating the transfer was effectuated and that it drew a \"negative inference\u201d from that failure. Indeed, the record demonstrates that Fadul disavowed the very documents contained in defense exhibit 34A and in defense exhibit 49, which purported to demonstrate the transfer of VitalTel to Moutiny. We find no merit whatsoever in appellants\u2019 argument that the circuit court determined Fadul transferred ownership of VitalTel to Moutiny.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b483-5\">. The August 7, 2006, letter from the Iraqi government did not constitute a significant change in circumstances that alleviated Fadul's obligations under the April Operating Agreement\u2014namely, Fadul\u2019s promise to transfer ownership of VitalTel to Moutiny. In the August 7, 2006, letter, the Minister of the MOC made clear that the invalidity of VitalTel\u2019s License was temporary and that, after review of the contracts, the Minister expected to \u201cobtain the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers\u201d to proceed under the License. Salkini testified that, despite the invalidity of the License, Aramtel continued to make payments to Moutiny pursuant to the April Operating Agreement and TWS continued to deliver equipment pursuant to the April Purchase Agreement. The record demonstrates that Fadul continued to assure Salkini that the License was \u201cgoing to be reinstated, that it[ was] just in suspension status, and that all the provinces that were assigned to th[e L]icense [were] going to be reinstated.\u201d In the Moutiny Status Report dated December 13, 2006, Fadul stated that he was \u201cworking closely with the MOC to finalize [an] amendment\u201d to the License, and that he was doing \u201ceverything in [his] power to restore the [L]icense.\u201d Indeed, at oral argument, appellants acknowledged that after receiving the August 7, 2006, communication from the MOC, the parties agreed to continue to try to get the License back, and that Fadul and Salkini continued to perform pursuant to the April Operating Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">In short, the temporary invalidity of the License did not disrupt the parties\u2019 respective obligations under the April Operating Agreement\u2014 the April Operating Agreement remained in full effect. The record is devoid of any information that the License would not be <em>reissued\u2014i.e. </em>that the invalidity of the License in August 2006 was permanent and irrevocable\u2014or that the invalidity of the License released Fadul of his obligation to transfer, ownership of VitalTel to Moutiny. Fadul's negotiation of the April Operating Agreement eliminating the requirement that the License be held directly by Moutiny, his delay in producing the purported documentation of the transfer of VitalTel to Moutiny, and his sending of documents on July 20, 2006, to Salkini\u2014which he later testified were \u201cforgeries,\u201d all preceded notice of the suspension of the License. The temporary invalidity of the License did not constitute a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>significant change in circumstances as to the April Operating Agreement nor does it undermine the conclusion as to Fadul's pre-existing fraudulent intent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b485-8\">.

We find unpersuasive appellants\u2019 contentions that \u201cthe claim for damages under the Note was released by merger into a confessed judgment that Aramtel already had received with respect to the Note\u201d and that \"the [cjircuit [cjourt erroneously ordered [] Fadul to 'repay\u2019 mon[ies] that he never received on a note that he did not personally sign, but were instead loaned by Aramtel to Moutiny and VitalTel, and \u25a0where Aramtel expressly agreed that, as a condition to get [] Fadul to sign the April [Operating] Agreement, [ ] Fadul would not be liable on the up to $30 million loan that Aramtel would make to Moutiny and VitalTel.\u201d (Emphasis omitted). Although a party can contract out of liability for repayment of a loan, a party cannot contract out of liability for fraud. <em>See generally Wolf v.

Although appellants assert that, due to merger, the Note cannot serve as a measure of damages, appellants identify no case law supporting the argument and we, therefore, decline to address the matter. <em>See Assateague Coastkeeper v.

On appeal, there is no dispute as to this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b493-10\">. Before orally ruling from the bench, the following exchange occurred between appellants' counsel and the circuit court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-11\">THE COURT: So you would concede\u2014you would concede!] that if every wrong has a remedy, and if there, in theory, was a wrong in this case, that the remedy should be through a derivative claim; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-12\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: Well, the right exists through Moutiny; every claim that they're making is a claim that is Moutiny\u2019s.

And they have to bring, or attempt to bring that, through a derivative action[.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b496-7\">. In a reply brief, appellants contend that, had any Member of Moutiny \"wanted to except a Member\u2019s right to bring a shareholder derivative suit in Moutiny\u2019s name from Section 4.1\u2019s absolute prohibition against any 'act for or bind[ing]\u2019 Moutiny, they could have included such a[n] exception in the April [Operating] Agreement\u2019s language.\u201d We observe that appellants' rationale is equally applicable to the converse proposition-had the parties wished to clearly and unambiguously require that the consent of the majority of the Members be present in order for one Member to proceed with a derivative suit on behalf of Moutiny, the parties could have included such a provision in the agreement. The parties failed to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b497-8\">. In light of appellants\u2019 concession at oral argument, that in the amended complaint it brought direct claims by Moutiny, we need not address appellants\u2019 contention that, after having granted summary judgment as to Fadul's and Dynacorp\u2019s claims, the circuit court ruled inconsistently in finding that Aramtel may bring derivative actions on Moutiny's behalf. At oral argument, appellants agreed that their claims were direct claims brought in Moutiny\u2019s name rather than derivative claims, but argued that, based on the language of the April Operating Agreement, neither party could bring any claim\u2014direct or derivative\u2014 without the permission of the other party. For the reasons discussed <em>supra, </em>we conclude that the language of the April Operating Agreement is not so limited and does not support appellants\u2019 argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"38\">\n<p id=\"b499-9\">. \"Forum-selection clauses\u201d are also known as \u201cvenue-selection clauses,\u201d \"choice of venue clauses,\" or \"choice of forum clauses.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"39\">\n<p id=\"b505-8\">.

Appellants' argument that \"mere execution of a contract in Maryland ... is inadequate\u201d to establish specific personal jurisdiction is without merit. As the record reveals, Fadul and Dynacorp did much more than simply execute a contract in Maryland\u2014they corresponded with Salkini, a Maryland resident, in Maryland; they attended meetings related to the contract in Maryland; and, they brought suit pursuant to the contract in Maryland. In <em>Jason Pharm., Inc. v. Jianas Bros.
