Appellants alleged violations of \u00a7\u00a7 206 and 207 of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (\u201cFLSA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 201 <em>et seq., </em>as well as \u00a7\u00a7 3-502 and 3-505 of the Maryland Wage Payment and Collection Law (\u201cPayment and Collection Law\u201d), Md.Code (1991, 2008 Repl.Vol., 2010 Suppl.), \u00a7\u00a7 3-501 <em>et seq. </em>of the Labor and Employment Article (\u201cLE\u201d). On November 1, 2010, the trial court entered judgment against Geoffrey and Lusitano Construction for treble damages of $57,400.00. The court\u2019s judgment did not address appellants\u2019 claims for attorney\u2019s fees and costs or their claims against Francisco. On November 10, 2010, appellants moved to amend the judgment to award attorney\u2019s fees and costs and to enter judgment in favor of Francisco for purposes of appeal. The court denied appellants\u2019 motion on September 8, 2011, and this timely appeal followed on September 15, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>Questions Presented</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">Appellants present two questions, which we quote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-5\">I. Is Francisco de Oliveira an employer within the meaning of the Fair Labor Standards Act and the Maryland Wage and Payment Collection Law?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-6\">II. Did the Circuit Court err by denying the Plaintiffs as prevailing parties an award of their reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">For the reasons that follow, we answer no to the first question, but we answer yes to the second question and remand for further proceedings in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">Factual and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b55-9\">Geoffrey de Oliveira was the sole owner of Lusitano Construction, LLC, which in 2007 and 2008 was under contract to complete two interior renovation projects: the Oro Pomodoro Restaurant in Rockville, MD, and the Valley Terrace Apartments in Baltimore, MD. Appellants worked on both projects at various times as construction laborers.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-10\">Geoffrey supervised the Oro Pomodoro project while Geoffrey\u2019s father, Francisco de Oliveira, supervised the Valley Terrace project. In that capacity, Francisco set appellants\u2019 work schedule, assigned their tasks, managed supplies, maintained work logs, and \u201coccasionally\u201d distributed paychecks drafted by Geoffrey or Lusitano Construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-11\">Francisco testified that he did not hire appellants or set their wages. Portocarrero and Mallo corroborated Francisco\u2019s testimony. Rosales testified that he merely \u201ccommunicated\u201d with Francisco about employment and salary. Campusano testified that Geoffrey hired him and that he \u201cthinks\u201d Francisco may have had some influence on his wages because Francisco was his supervisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-12\">At some point in 2007, Geoffrey stopped issuing payment to appellants. Francisco told the workers that Geoffrey would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>pay them with money from other projects once those projects finished.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">Francisco testified that he purchased supplies for the Valley Terrace project with personal funds, and the evidence showed that Geoffrey had an unspecified $50,000.00 line of credit with his father discharged in bankruptcy in 2009.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Campusano testified that Francisco paid some of his wages from personal funds, but Francisco denied this.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">On February 10, 2010, appellants brought suit against appellees for violations of FLSA \u00a7\u00a7 206-207, as well as \u00a7\u00a7 502 and 505 of the Payment and Collection Law. Appellants sought unpaid wages and overtime under FLSA \u00a7 216(b)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>Payment and Collection Law \u00a7 507.2, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-4\">(a) <em>In </em>general.\u2014Notwithstanding any remedy available under \u00a7 3-507 of this subtitle, if an employer fails to pay an employee in accordance with \u00a7 3-502 or \u00a7 3-505 of this subtitle, after 2 weeks have elapsed from the date on which the employer is required to have paid the wages, the employee may bring an action against the employer to recover the unpaid wages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">Appellants also sought attorney\u2019s fees and costs under FLSA \u00a7 216(b) and Payment and Collection Law \u00a7 507(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">At the conclusion of a one-day trial on October 27, 2010, the trial court found Geoffrey liable under the FLSA and the Payment and Collection Law, and found that Francisco was not an \u201cemployer\u201d under either law. Accordingly, the court entered judgment against Geoffrey and Lusitano Construction for treble damages of $57,400.00 on November 1, 2010. The judgment did not address appellants\u2019 claims for attorney\u2019s fees or their claims against Francisco. On November 10, 2010, appellants moved to amend the judgment to award attorney\u2019s fees and costs and to enter judgment <em>in favor </em>of Francisco. The court denied appellants\u2019 motion on September 8, 2011, and this timely appeal followed on September 15, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">Appellants argue that Francisco was an \u201cemployer\u201d under the FLSA and the Payment and Collection Law according to the four-factor \u201ceconomic reality\u201d test of \u201ccontrol\u201d developed by federal courts for the FLSA and applied in <em>Newell v. Runnels, </em>407 Md. 578, 649-54, 967 A.2d 729 (2009), to the Maryland Wage and Hour Law (\u201cWage and Hour Law\u201d), Md.Code (1991, 2008 Repl.Vol., 2010 Suppl.), \u00a7\u00a7 3-401 et seq. Their argument challenges both factual findings, which we review for clear error, and conclusions of law, which we review <em>de novo. Blackwell v. Wyeth, </em>408 Md. 575, 611-12, 971 A.2d 235 (2009). For the following reasons, we decide\u2014as a matter of first impression\u2014that the test also applies to the Payment and Collection Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit succinctly summarized the history of the general \u201ceconomic reality\u201d test in <em>Haybarger v. Lawrence County Adult Prob. &amp; Parole, </em>667 F.3d 408, 418 n. 8 (3d Cir.Pa.2012):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-7\">The \u201ceconomic reality\u201d test is a broad test for determining whether an employment relationship exists, and is not limited to evaluating whether a supervisor is an employer for purposes of individual liability. In 1944, the Supreme Court first looked to the \u201cunderlying economic facts\u201d to distinguish between employees and independent contractors under the National Labor Relations Act. <em>N.L.R.B. v. Hearst Publ\u2019ns, Inc., </em>322 U.S. 111, 129, 64 S.Ct. 851, 88 L.Ed. 1170 (1944) (citing <em>N.L.R.B. v. Blount, </em>131 F.2d 585 (8th Cir.1942)). Seventeen years later, the Supreme Court looked to the \u201ceconomic reality\u201d of the employment relationship to hold that members of a work cooperative qualified as employees under the FLSA. <em>Goldberg v. Whitaker House Coop., Inc., </em>366 U.S. 28, 33, 81 S.Ct. 933, 6 L.Ed.2d 100 (1961) (quoting <em>United States v. Silk, </em>331 U.S. 704, 713, 67 S.Ct. 1463, 91 L.Ed. 1757 (1947)) (additional citation omitted). Since then, we and other circuits have applied the economic reality test to decide whether entities qualify as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>employers under the FLSA. <em>See, e.g., Hodgson [v. Arnheim &amp; Neely, Inc., </em>444 F.2d 609, 612 (3d Cir.Pa.1971) ]; <em>Baystate Alt. Staffing v. Herman, </em>163 F.3d 668, 675 (1st Cir.1998); <em>Bonnette v. California Health &amp; Welfare Agency, </em>704 F.2d 1465, 1469 (9th Cir.1983).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">The general \u201ceconomic reality\u201d test is now nearly ubiquitous in the federal courts of appeal. <em>See, e.g., Herman v. RSR Sec. Servs., </em>172 F.3d 132, 140 (2d Cir.N.Y.1999); <em>Haybarger v. Lawrence County Adult Prob. &amp; Parole, </em>667 F.3d 408, 417-18 (3d Cir.Pa.2012); <em>Brennan v. Gilles &amp; Cotting, Inc., </em>504 F.2d 1255, 1262 (4th Cir.1974); <em>Donovan v. Grim Hotel Co., </em>747 F.2d 966, 971-72 (5th Cir.Tex.1984); <em>Dole v. Elliott Travel &amp; Tours, Inc., </em>942 F.2d 962, 965-66 (6th Cir.Mich.1991); <em>Karr v. Strong Detective Agency, Inc., Div. of Kane Services, </em>787 F.2d 1205, 1207 (7th Cir.Wis.1986); <em>Blair v. Wills, </em>420 F.3d 823, 829 (8th Cir.Mo.2005); <em>Patel v. Wargo, </em>803 F.2d 632, 637-38 (11th Cir.Fla.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">Our Court of Appeals has not applied the economic reality test to the Payment and Collection law, but it has applied the test to the Wage and Hour Law because the latter is the State parallel of the FLSA. <em>Newell, </em>407 Md. at 649, 967 A.2d 729. Appellants assume that the test should be applied in their case, but as the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland rightly noted in <em>Watkins v. C. Earl Brown, Inc., </em>173 F.Supp.2d 409, 416 (D.Md.2001), the Maryland Wage and Hour Law, <em>not </em>the Payment and Collection Law, is the state\u2019s equivalent of the FLSA. First, the Wage and Hour Law defines \u201cemployer\u201d identically to the FLSA. <em>Compare </em>29 USCS \u00a7 203(d) (\u201c \u2018Employer\u2019 includes any person acting directly or indirectly in the interest of an employer in relation to an employee ...\u201d) to MWHL \u00a7 3-401(b) (\u201c\u2018Employer\u2019 includes a person who acts directly or indirectly in the interest of another employer with an employee.\u201d). Second, the FLSA governs primarily minimum wages and maximum hours, whereas the Payment and Collection Law sets <em>specific terms </em>for payment mandated elsewhere in the Wage and Hour Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>Despite its differences from the Wage and Hour Law, the Payment and Collection Law is sufficiently similar for the economic reality test to apply. Payment and Collection Law \u00a7 501(b) defines an employer to include \u201cany person who employs an individual in the State or a successor of the person.\u201d The word \u201cemploy\u201d is defined broadly by LE \u00a7 3-101(c) as \u201cto engage an individual to work,\u201d and the term includes \u201c(i) allowing an individual to work; and (ii) instructing an individual to be present at a work site.\u201d Because of this expansive definition and the Payment and Collection Law\u2019s remedial purposes, <em>see Friolo v. Frankel, </em>373 Md. 501, 517-18, 819 A.2d 354 (2003); <em>Stevenson v. Branch Banking &amp; Trust Corp., </em>159 Md.App. 620, 644, 861 A.2d 735 (2004), the reasoning in <em>Newell </em>leads us to conclude that the economic reality test governs the definition of \u201cemployer\u201d in Payment and Collection Law \u00a7 501(b).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">There is, however, more than one incarnation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>\u201ceconomic reality\u201d test.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Newell, </em>407 Md. at 651, 967 A.2d 729 (citing <em>Barfield v. N.Y. City Health &amp; Hosps. Corp., </em>537 F.3d 132, 142 (2d Cir.2008)). As we explain below, there is insufficient evidence that Francisco personally benefitted from appellants\u2019 labor, and so we are only concerned with the four-factor economic reality test for \u201ccontrol\u201d that the Court of Appeals (coincidentally) applied in <em>Newell, </em>407 Md. at 653, 653 n. 39, 967 A.2d 729. <em>See also Harker v. State Use Indus., </em>990 F.2d 131, 133 (4th Cir.Md.1993) (holding that \u201ca true employer-employee relationship\u201d involves a \u201c \u2018bargained-for exchange of labor\u2019 for mutual economic gain\u201d (citing <em>Vanskike v. Peters, </em>974 F.2d 806, 809 (7th Cir.1992); <em>Gilbreath v. Cutter Biological, Inc., </em>931 F.2d 1320, 1325 (9th Cir.1991))).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The economic reality test for \u201ccontrol\u201d examines \u201cwhether the alleged employer (1) had the power to hire and fire the employees, (2) supervised and controlled employee work schedules or conditions of employment, (3) determined the rate and method of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>payment, and (4) maintained employment records.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 651, 967 A.2d 729 (quoting <em>Barfield v. N.Y. City Health &amp; Hosps. Corp., </em>537 F.3d 132, 142 (2d Cir.2008)).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">The four enunciated factors of \u201ccontrol\u201d are not to be applied mechanistically, and their general purpose must be understood as ultimately assigning <em>responsibility </em>under the law. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has explained that the four-factor analysis of control focuses \u201con the role played by the corporate officers in <em>causing </em>the corporation to undercompensate employees and to prefer the payment of other obligations and/or the retention of profits.\u201d <em>Baystate Alternative Staffing v. Herman, </em>163 F.3d 668, 678 (1st Cir.Mass.1998) (emphasis added). \u201cIn addition to direct evidence of such a role, other relevant indicia may exist as well\u2014for example, an individual\u2019s operational control over significant aspects of the business and an individual\u2019s ownership interest in the business.... Such indicia, while not dispositive, are important to the analysis because they suggest that an individual controls a corporation\u2019s financial affairs and can cause the corporation to compensate (or not to compensate) employees in accordance with the FLSA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Donovan v. Agnew, </em>712 F.2d 1509, 1511-14 (1st Cir.Mass.1983)). \u201c[I]t is the totality of the circumstances, and not any one factor, which determines whether a worker is the employee of a particular alleged employer.\u201d <em>Baystate, </em>163 F.3d at 676.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">The legislative intent to incentivize payment by responsible parties would not be served by holding that a supervisor such as Francisco was an \u201cemployer\u201d under either the FLSA or the Payment and Collection Law. Although Francisco supervised and controlled appellants\u2019 work schedules and conditions of employment, and although he maintained their work logs, these supervisory tasks are not sufficient to make him personally liable for appellants\u2019 wages, particularly where he had no ownership, control, or investment in the LLC that was appellants\u2019 formal employer. First, the trial court found that Geoffrey, not Francisco, had the power to hire and fire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>employees and to determine their rate and method of payment. There is scant evidence to the contrary, and certainly not enough to reverse the trial court\u2019s factual finding as clearly erroneous. Second, there was no evidence that Geoffrey\u2019s $50,000.00 line of credit with Francisco was given\u2014or even related\u2014to Lusitano Construction. Third, the trial court was free to credit Francisco\u2019s testimony that he never paid wages personally, rather than Campusano\u2019s uncorroborated testimony that Francisco stressed (for no apparent reason) that he was paying appellants\u2019 wages from his own pocket. Fourth, Francisco merely distributed appellants\u2019 paychecks, all of which indisputably originated from Geoffrey. Fifth, Francisco admitted to purchasing some supplies to help advance the construction project, but mere payment of minor, reimbursable expenses does not even approach an \u201cinvestment\u201d in a firm such that one should be considered responsible for employee wages. Finally, while appellants claim that Francisco \u201cinduced\u201d them to work without pay, Francisco merely stated an apparent\u2014if contingent\u2014fact: if Geoffrey received funds from other projects, then he would pay appellants. Nothing in the record indicates that Francisco personally guaranteed appellants\u2019 pay or intended to give them false hope of payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">Taking these facts as a whole, we hold that Francisco was not an \u201cemployer\u201d within the meaning of either FLSA or the Payment and Collection Law. Were we to hold otherwise, we would set the precedent that any manager who has some direction in hiring, wages, and other conditions of employment is <em>personally liable </em>for wages that the manager\u2019s own employer is unable or unwilling to pay. Simply stated, managers with no equity interest in the fruits of employee labor should not have to act as insurers of last resort, either to their employers or to the employees that they supervise. Because the trial court failed to do so, we hereby enter final judgment under Maryland Rule 8-604(e) in favor of Francisco as to all claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">Appellants next argue that the trial court erred when it failed to award reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs under FLSA \u00a7 216(b) and Payment and Collection Law \u00a7 507.2. Attorney\u2019s fees and costs must be awarded under FLSA \u00a7 216(b), but the \u201caward\u201d may be zero in certain circumstances. <em>Sahyers v. Prugh, Holliday &amp; Karatinos, P.L., </em>560 F.3d 1241, 1245-46 (11th Cir.Fla.2009) (FLSA fees denied where counsel\u2019s \u201cconscious disregard for lawyer-to-lawyer collegiality and civility caused (among other things) the judiciary to waste significant time and resources on unnecessary litigation and stood in stark contrast to the behavior expected of an officer of the court\u201d). The Payment and Collection Law, however, leaves the matter of attorney\u2019s fees and costs to the judge\u2019s discretion. LE \u00a7 3-507.2(b). \u201c[S]uch discretion, consistent with the intent of the General Assembly, is \u2018to be exercised liberally in favor of awarding fees, at least in appropriate cases.\u2019 \u201d <em>Friolo v. Frankel, </em>403 Md. 443, 456-57, 942 A.2d 1242 (2008) (citing <em>Friolo v. Frankel, </em>373 Md. 501, 516, 819 A.2d 354 (2003)). The trial court failed to consider appellants\u2019 requests for fees and costs under the Payment and Collection Law, and our review of the record reveals no indication whether the trial court was inclined to grant or deny the request. We note that the Court of Appeals held in <em>Henriquez v. Henriquez, </em>413 Md. 287, 992 A.2d 446 (2010), that fees may be awarded to a <em>pro bono </em>organization under the more stringent attorney\u2019s fee provision of Maryland Code (1984, 2006 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 12-103. While the circumstances here may dictate a different result, we must remand only appellants\u2019 request for attorney\u2019s fees to the trial court for consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">JUDGMENT HEREBY ENTERED IN FAVOR OF AP-PELLEE FRANCISCO DE OLIVEIRA AS TO ALL CLAIMS.

Appellants corroborated this testimony, if vaguely.

The U.S. District Court cited <em>Battaglia v. Clinical Perfusionists, </em>338 Md. 352, 658 A.2d 680 (1995) and <em>Baltimore Harbor Charters, Ltd. v. Ayd, </em>365 Md. 366, 780 A.2d 303 (2001), for its supporting premise that, \"[w]hen the Maryland Court of Appeals has interpreted the [Payment and Collection Law], however, that court has not attributed to the act a legislative intent to provide a remedy greater than what is available at common law.\u201d 173 F.Supp.2d at 415. But <em>Battaglia </em>and <em>Ayd. </em>dealt with specific provisions of the Payment and Collection Law that did not alter the common law with new definitions or rules of law. <em>Ayd, </em>365 Md. at 392, 780 A.2d 303 (the difference between an \"employee\u201d under the Payment and Collection Law and an \"independent contractor\u201d is informed by the doctrine of <em>respondeat superior, </em>principles enumerated in Restatement (Second) of Agency, and case law interpreting wage act statutes of other jurisdictions); <em>Battaglia, </em>338 Md. at 362, 658 A.2d 680 (Payment and Collection Law \u00a7\u00a7 501(c), 502, 505, and 507.1 do not alter the common law of contract and unjust enrichment).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">We, however, are not bound to define \"employer\u201d according to the common law because the broad definition of \u201cemploy\u201d in LE \u00a7 3-101 (as incorporated by Payment and Collection Law \u00a7 501(b)), evinces the legislature\u2019s intent to expand the common law definition of \"employer,\u201d just as it did with the MWHL. <em>See Newell, </em>407 Md. at 649-50, 967 A.2d 729.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b61-4\">.
