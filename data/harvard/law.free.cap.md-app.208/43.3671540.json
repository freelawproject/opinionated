This appeal comes to us from the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, where the circuit judge granted appellee Marie-Louise Tshiani\u2019s (\u201cMarie-Louise\u201d) request for absolute divorce, alimony, property division, child support, and attorney\u2019s fees. Appellant Noel Tshiani (\u201cNoel\u201d) contends that there can be no divorce and no monetary award because the parties\u2019 marriage in the Democratic Republic of Congo is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>not valid under Maryland law. We reject this contention and affirm the judgment of absolute divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Both parties are natives of Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire). Marie-Louise and Noel met in the Congo in 1993. Marie-Louise was 18 years old and Noel was 35. According to Marie-Louise, after five months of dating, the two were married on December 23,1993 in Kinshasa. She testified that Noel was not physically present at the wedding because \u201che was on assignment in [another country in] Africa and couldn\u2019t make the trip.\u201d Noel designated his cousin to represent him. One of the families gave the other $200 cash, clothes, and a live goat.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Noel participated in the ceremony over the phone. According to Marie-Louise, her family asked Noel and his family members three questions regarding whether Noel knew the bride, whether he liked her, and whether he wanted a dowry to be exchanged.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Noel responded in the affirmative.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> According to Marie-Louise, \u201ctradition requires that the wife leave[ ] with the husband\u2019s family and then go[] to live with the husband.\u201d After the ceremony, Marie-Louise spent the night at Noel\u2019s cousin\u2019s house. The next day she traveled to live with Noel in Arlington, Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">Since the marriage, the couple have been living together and representing themselves as husband and wife. They first lived in an apartment in Virginia, then purchased a home in Bethesda, Maryland in January 1994. The parties bought another piece of property in Potomac, Maryland as \u201ctenants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>by the entirety.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The parties had three children together: P.E. was born on June 8, 1995, J.H. was born on October 29, 1997, and D.G. was born December 6,1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">On April 16, 1994, the parties participated in a \u201crenewal of vows\u201d ceremony at the Church of the Cathedral of Saint Thomas Moore in Arlington. The couple obtained a \u201cProof of Marriage\u201d from the Congolese Embassy and brought it to the Virginia ceremony. The church provided them with a certif\u00edcate stating that they were \u201cunited in matrimony ... in conformity with the laws of the State of Virginia and the Republic of Zaire.\u201d The certificate also attested that \u201cthere were witnesses present at the ceremony, including one member of [Noel\u2019s] family.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">Noel applied for a \u201cdependency allowance\u201d for Marie-Louise with his employer (the World Bank) and attached a \u201cCertificate of Customary Marriage from the Embassy of Zaire\u201d or <em>\u201cAttestation de Mariage Coutomier </em>\u201d dated January 25, 1994. He requested and received health insurance coverage for Marie-Louise and asked the World Bank to \u201cadd my wife as beneficiary\u201d of his life insurance policy. Noel also went to the United States Immigration Service to obtain permanent resident alien status (Green Card) for Marie-Louise, asserting that she was his wife. Since 1994, Noel has filed joint federal and state tax returns, listing Marie-Louise as his spouse. Further, during a protective order hearing, Noel referred to Marie-Louise as his wife. Although he filed an Amended Answer, when Marie-Louise first filed for absolute divorce Noel\u2019s Answer admitted that he and Marie-Louise were married. Finally, Noel wrote in his motion to dismiss Marie-Louise\u2019s complaint for absolute divorce, \u201cthe parties were joined in a union based on the Congolese practices ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">At the circuit court hearing, Noel equivocated when asked about almost all of the above facts. He testified \u201che had no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>participation\u201d in the Congolese marriage \u201cby phone or anyway.\u201d He claimed he was \u201cunaware of it.\u201d The court said that \u201c[Noel] argued that the marriage ceremony in the Congo was something that is not recognized outside the Congo, but failed to provide support legal or otherwise for this assertion.\u201d He also said of the Virginia marriage: it is \u201ccustomary for there to be a Catholic service for people not necessarily married to live in Virginia.\u201d The court entered a Judgment of Absolute Divorce. As to the validity of the marriage, the court found as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-5\">[Noel\u2019s] actions subsequent to the ceremony in the Congo demonstrate [Noel\u2019s] recognition that there was a lawful marriage between the parties. [Noel] took action after the marriage ceremony in the Congo to have the marriage recognized by the World Bank by requesting a \u2018certificate of marriage\u2019 from the Congolese [E]mbassy. Although that document was not produced at trial, [Marie-Louise] produced a document from the Embassy of the Democratic Republic of the Congo stating that a Certificate of Marriage was delivered to the World Bank and that due to \u201cfloods and destructive of archives,\u201d the embassy could not provide another copy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-6\">Since 1994, [Noel] has filed a joint federal and state tax returns with [Noel] listing [Marie-Louise] as \u201cspouse.\u201d [Noel] had titled real property that he purchased on Raymond Lane in Potomac, Maryland as \u201ctenants by the entirety,\u201d which is a form of land ownership only available to married couples. Further, during the course of another hearing wherein [Marie-Louise] obtained a Final Protective Order against him, [Noel] referred to [Marie-Louise] as his \u201cwife.\u201d [Noel] seeks to explain this designation by stating that \u201cin the Congo, if you live with a woman she is called your wife and by respect I call her \u2018wife.\u2019 \u201d Indeed, [Noel] went to the United States Immigration Service in order to obtain a \u2018green card\u2019 for [Marie-Louise] on her status as his wife.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-7\">[Noel\u2019s] prevarication on this issue becomes clearer upon consideration of his application for spousal dependancy benefits from the World Bank, which included an \u201cAttestation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>De [Mariage] Coutumier\u201d (Certificate of Customary Marriage) dated January 25, 1994 to support [Noel\u2019s] claim of a legal marriage. [Noel] requested and received heath insurance coverage for [Marie-Louise] from the World Bank on the basis of [Marie-Louise\u2019s] status as his spouse. [Noel asked the World Bank to \u201cadd my wife as beneficiary\u201d of his life insurance policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-5\">[Noel] is a liar and a manipulator. Either he lied to the [c]ourt in his testimony regarding the existence of the marriage and his participation therein or he lied to the World Bank, the Internal Revenue Service, and the immigration authorities. In either event his testimony is not to be believed. The [c]ourt finds that a valid marriage existed between the parties and took place on December 23, 1993.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-y\">Noel timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">QUESTION PRESENTED</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">Appellant presents the following question for our review:<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ai\">Did the Circuit Court err in recognizing the parties\u2019 marriage in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">For the following reasons, we affirm the Judgment of Absolute Divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Az\">I. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b72-10\">In this case, we are asked to review the circuit court\u2019s determination that Maryland would recognize the parties\u2019 marriage in the Democratic Republic of Congo. This is a mixed question of law and fact. On the one hand, on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>question of whether there was a valid marriage based on the evidence presented, we give deference to the factual findings of the trial judge and will reverse only for clear factual error. <em>Hoang v. Hewitt Ave. </em>Ass., <em>LLC, </em>177 Md.App. 562, 576, 936 A.2d 915 (2007) (Citations omitted). \u201cA factual finding is clearly erroneous if there is no competent material evidence in the record to support it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(Citations omitted). On the other hand, whether Maryland will recognize a valid foreign marriage is a purely legal determination. A circuit court\u2019s legal determinations are reviewed <em>de novo. Id. </em>(Citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">II. The Parties\u2019 Marriage</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">Noel argues that Maryland should not recognize the Congolese marriage while Marie-Louise argues that we should. To determine this issue, we first decide if the marriage was valid in the Congo. If we answer yes, then we determine whether a Maryland court should recognize the marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">A. The Validity of the Marriage Under Congolese Law</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">Noel attests that the record contains no proof of Congolese law,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and as such, the trial court could not have concluded that the marriage was valid under the law of the Congo. Instead, he contends, the absence of Congolese law demands that the court decide the validity of the marriage under Maryland law. He cites <em>Hall v. Hall, </em>238 Md. 191, 195, 208 A.2d 593 (1965) and <em>Gebhard v. Gebhard, </em>253 Md. 125, 128, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>252 A.2d 171, 173 (1969) (If the record contains no proof of the law of another jurisdiction, the law is presumed to be the same as the laws of Maryland). We disagree with Noel because proof of foreign law is not required to raise a presumption of a valid foreign marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">When evidence suggests that the parties were lawfully married, it raises the presumption that the marriage was valid according to the law of the foreign state or country where it occurred. <em>Redgrave v. </em>Redgrave, 38 Md. 93, 97 (1873). Competent evidence of a marriage includes official records of a marriage, admissions or declarations of the husband and wife, statements of witnesses to the wedding, or any other evidence that is admissible under the general rules of evidence. <em>Wright v. State, </em>198 Md. 163, 168-69, 81 A.2d 602 (1951). Indeed, \u201cthe admissions and declarations of the husband and wife have always been accepted in this State to prove their marriage.\u201d <em>Brell v. Brell, </em>143 Md. 443, 448, 122 A. 635 (1923). \u201c[WJhere parties live together ostensibly as man and wife, demeaning<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> themselves towards each other as such, and are received into society and treated by their friends and relations as having and being entitled to that status, the law will, in favor of morality and decency, presume that they have been legally married.\u201d <em>Redgrave, </em>38 Md. at 97 (Citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">In <em>Brell, </em>the Court of Appeals determined that a wife\u2019s testimony that she and her husband were married in Germany coupled with the husband and wife living together and having a deed and a mortgage in both names was sufficient evidence to regard the two as husband and wife. <em>Brell, </em>143 Md. at 448, 122 A. 635. In <em>Redgrave, </em>the Court found a marriage to be valid where witnesses testified that the parties were married <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>in Wisconsin, went to Iowa for two or three years, held themselves out as husband and wife, the community recognized them as husband and wife, and they had two children together. <em>Redgrave, </em>38 Md. at 96-97. The evidence in this case exceeds that in <em>Brell </em>and <em>Redgrave.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">We start with the certificates of marriage.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Noel requested a certificate of marriage from the Congolese Embassy. The embassy provided the certificate entitled \u201cAttestation De Mariage Coutumier\u201d or Certificate of Customary Marriage. The certificate is dated January 25, 1994. The couple provided this certificate to Noel\u2019s employer (the World Bank) and to a Catholic church in Virginia when they appeared to renew their marriage vows. The Virginia church augmented the certificate with yet another certificate, this one stating that they were \u201cunited in matrimony ... in conformity with the laws of the State of Virginia and the Republic of Zaire.\u201d The Virginia ceremony took place April 16, 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">We next review the testimony from Marie-Louise describing the wedding. Marie-Louise recounted the wedding that occurred in the Congo in December 1994: both parties\u2019 families were there; $200 cash, clothes, and a live goat were exchanged; Noel participated in the ceremony over the phone; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>Noel affirmatively responded that he knew the bride, he liked her, and he wanted the exchange of gifts so the bride could become his wife; Marie-Louise spent the night at Noel\u2019s cousin\u2019s house; and she traveled to live with Noel in Arlington, Virginia the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">We now focus on the couple\u2019s living situation and children. Noel and Marie-Louise first lived in an apartment in Virginia, then they purchased a home in Bethesda, Maryland in January 1994. The parties also bought a piece of property in Potomac, Maryland as \u201ctenants by the entirety.\u201d As for children, the couple have three.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">As further evidence of marriage, the couple also have held themselves out to the community as husband and wife. Noel applied for a dependency allowance for Marie-Louise with his employer. He requested and received health insurance coverage for Marie-Louise and added her to his life insurance policy. Noel went to the United States Immigration Service in order to obtain a Green Card for Marie-Louise based on her status as his wife. Since 1994, Noel has filed joint federal and state tax returns, listing Marie-Louise as his spouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">Finally, Noel has also proclaimed several times, under oath, that he and Marie-Louise were married. For example, during a protective order hearing, Noel referred to Marie-Louise as his wife. Additionally, although he later filed an Amended Answer, Noel\u2019s first Answer admitted that he and Marie-Louise were married. He also wrote a motion to dismiss that stated, \u201cthe parties were joined in a union based on the Congolese practices, that basically consists of an agreement between families whom make an agreement to cohabitate in their villages, however, it is not a recognized marriage outside of the Congo.\u201d In light of all these facts, we find Marie-Louise provided a plethora of evidence to raise a presumption that the Congolese marriage was a valid marriage according to the law of the Congo. It was incumbent on Noel to rebut the presumption, and he presented no evidence to do so.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b77-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>B. Honoring- a Valid Foreign Proxy/Phone Marriage</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">In deciding whether a valid foreign marriage will be acknowledged in Maryland, courts employ the doctrine of comity. <em>Henderson v. Henderson, </em>199 Md. 449, 457-58, 87 A.2d 403 (1952). Under this doctrine, Maryland \u201cwill give effect to laws and judicial decisions of another state or jurisdiction, not as a matter of obligation but out of deference and respect.\u201d <em>Wash. Suburban Sanitary Comm\u2019n v. CAE-Link Corp., </em>330 Md. 115, 140, 622 A.2d 745 (1993) (Citations omitted). In other words, Maryland courts will honor foreign marriages that were valid where performed, even if the marriage would not have been valid if performed in Maryland. <em>Henderson, </em>199 Md. at 458, 87 A.2d 403. There are two exceptions to this general rule. First, the marriage must not be expressly prohibited by the General Assembly. Second, the marriage must not be repugnant to Maryland public policy. <em>Port v. Cowan, </em>426 Md. 435, 444-45, 44 A.3d 970 (2012) (Citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">Noel assumes that Maryland does not recognize proxy marriages <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> performed in this State. However, Noel\u2019s description of the Congo marriage as a \u201cproxy marriage\u201d is a misnomer, since the circuit court found that Noel did participate over the phone. Regardless, because we find that the marriage is presumed to be valid under the laws of the Congo, we do not need to determine whether Noel\u2019s assumption about proxy marriage is correct. Instead, we will recognize a foreign marriage as long as the marriage is not prohibited by the General Assembly or repugnant to Maryland public policy. These exceptions rarely invalidate a marriage because Maryland liberally recognizes foreign marriage to promote \u201cuniformity in the recognition of the marital status ...\u201d <em>Henderson, </em>199 Md. at 458, 87 A.2d 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">Regarding the statutory prohibition exception, Md.Code (1984, 2006 RepLVol.), Family Law Article (\u201cFL\u201d) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>\u00a7 2-406 describes who can perform a marriage ceremony and when the ceremony must be performed.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Neither this law, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>nor any other statute, precludes Maryland from recognizing a ceremony where one party participates by proxy\u2014or in the manner that occurred here\u2014and the ceremony is valid in another jurisdiction. To preclude validity, the statute must unequivocally void such marriages. <em>Port, </em>426 Md. at 447, 44 A.3d 970 (Citations omitted). The General Assembly has not prohibited recognition of a foreign marriage such as the one that occurred here.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">We also find that neither proxy nor phone marriages are repugnant to Maryland public policy. Maryland\u2019s attitude is that marriage should not be set aside lightly. <em>Picarella v. Picarella, </em>20 Md.App. 499, 504, 316 A.2d 826 (1974) (Citations omitted). As such, several types of marriages that would not have been valid if performed in Maryland have been recognized in Maryland. Just recently, in <em>Port, </em>the Court of Appeals found that valid out-of-state same sex marriages are not repugnant to Maryland public policy, despite the existence of a Maryland statute limiting marriage to a man and a woman. <em>Port, </em>426 Md. at 450-51, 44 A.3d 970. In <em>Henderson, </em>the Court of Appeals recognized an out-of-state common law marriage, finding that an absence of the proper form and ceremony does not make a marriage contrary to public policy. <em>Henderson, </em>199 Md. at 459, 87 A.2d 403. This State has even recognized an out-of-state uncle-niece marriage, which would have been a misdemeanor if attempted to be formed in Maryland, in <em>Fensterwald v. Burk, </em>129 Md. 131, 138-39, 98 A. 358 (1916).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">A Maryland court has never found a valid foreign marriage repugnant to public policy. The closest an appellate decision came was in 1952, in <em>Henderson, </em>where the Court of Appeals suggested in dicta that a valid out-of-state interracial marriage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>would not be recognized in Maryland. <em>Henderson, </em>199 Md. at 459, 87 A.2d 403. This dicta has been discredited by case law and statute. <em>See Conaway v. Deane, </em>401 Md. 219, 304 n. 66, 932 A.2d 571 (2007); 1967 Md. Laws 6. However, it demonstrates the level an otherwise valid marriage must reach to be repugnant to public policy. At that time, an interracial marriage was an infamous crime. The penalty was imprisonment for not less than 18 months, but not more than 10 years. In a case not dealing with marriage, but a valid foreign divorce, <em>Aleem v. Aleem, </em>404 Md. 404, 947 A.2d 489 (2008), Maryland declined to recognize a divorce valid in Pakistan. <em>Id. </em>at 422-23, 947 A.2d 489. A husband obtained an <em>ex parte </em>divorce at the Pakistani Embassy in Washington, D.C. <em>Id. </em>at 406, 947 A.2d 489. Under Pakistani law, a husband has the right to obtain a divorce without notice to his wife. <em>Id. </em>at 422, 947 A.2d 489. Maryland found it was contrary to public policy because it violated Article 46 of Maryland\u2019s Declaration of Rights, providing that \u201c[ejquality of rights under the law shall not be abridged or denied because of sex.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(Citations and internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">In contrast, a proxy marriage performed in Maryland carries no criminal penalty for the couple or the celebrant. Also, these types of marriages do not infringe equal rights principles like the one-party divorce in <em>Aleem. </em>In fact, unlike a common law marriage, a same-sex marriage, or an uncle-niece marriage, no law suggests that proxy or phone marriages would not be permitted when performed in Maryland. It is true that one secondary source, a family law treatise, hypothesizes, \u201cit is doubtful that Maryland would ever recognize proxy marriages, marriage by telephone, or marriage by mail.\u201d 1-3 Bender\u2019s Maryland Family Law \u00a7 3-4(e). But this hypothesis originated with a dated Maryland Law Review article written in 1938. At that time in Maryland, a religious ceremony was a mandatory part of a legal marriage. The article doubted that a proxy or phone marriage would be valid \u201cunder the policy of the religious ceremony.\u201d John S. Strahorn, Jr., <em>Void and Voidable Marriages in Maryland and Their Annulment, </em>2 Md. L.Rev. 211, 222 (1938). According to the article, these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>types of marriage may not evidence that an \u201cactual contract\u201d had been made and \u201ca solemn act\u201d had been performed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">This theory is outdated for two reasons. One, Maryland no longer requires a religious ceremony as part of a marriage. <em>See </em>FL \u00a7 2-406. Two, modern communication technology reduces the likelihood that the absent individual can claim he or she did not enter into an actual contract or commit a solemn act. Indeed, the power of modern communication to eliminate the suspicions of proxy marriage is not a new idea. In 1964, the Supreme Court of Oregon expressed, \u201c[t]he most often voiced objection to proxy marriages is that unbeknownst to the celebrants the power of attorney may have been revoked prior to the celebration of the marriage. With the many accurate and prompt modern methods of communication available, the possibility of a failure to communicate revocation is extremely slight.\u201d <em>State v. Anderson, </em>239 Or. 200, 206, 396 P.2d 558 (1964) (Citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">Although Maryland has not adopted it, the Unif. Marriage &amp; Divorce Act, 9A U.L.A. 182 (1998), permits proxy marriage. Specifically, the Act declares \u201c[i]f a party to a marriage is unable to be present at the solemnization, he may authorize in writing a third person to act as his proxy. If the person solemnizing the marriage is satisfied that the absent party is unable to be present and has consented to the marriage, he may solemnize the marriage by proxy. If he is not satisfied, the parties may petition the ... court for an order permitting the marriage to be solemnized by proxy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 206(b). The comment to this portion of the act further explains that \u201cthere are many reasons why, in individual cases, couples may prefer such a ceremony. So long as the marriage license procedure has been followed and the official performing the ceremony has no reason to doubt the intentions of the absent prospective spouse, there is no reason why a proxy marriage should be prohibited.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 206 cmt.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">A few states by statute also allow some form of proxy marriage. <em>See </em>Cal. Fam.Code \u00a7 420(b) (West Supp.2012); Colo.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 14-2-109(2) (West 2005); Mont.Code Ann. \u00a7 40-1-301(2) (2009); Tex. Fam.Code Ann. \u00a7 2.203(b) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>(West 2006). Still other courts have found proxy marriage is not contrary to state public policy. <em>See Barrons v.

Notably, two law professors at Michigan State University have been conducting a study, the E-Marriage Project, since 2008. <em>See </em>Bob Kuszynski, <em>Do Couples Need to Be in the Same Place to Get Married? Two Michigan Professors Say \u2018No\u2019, </em>Scripps TV Station Group (Oct. 6, 2011), http://www.wxyz.com/dpp/ news/marriage-by-skype. The study looks at the marriage ceremonies of the 50 states. <em>Id. </em>The two professors believe that states should go so far as to permit couples to marry using videoconferencing technologies such as Skype.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>They call this proposal \u201cmodernizing marriage,\u201d and they compare a Skype marriage with other major business contracts that take place over videoconference every day. Id.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">The mounting recognition and research on distant marriages suggest that sometimes it may be a couple\u2019s only option. The men and women who serve in our armed forces sacrifice a great deal of control over their daily lives for this country and they often are married by proxy. <em>See </em>Andrea B. Carroll, <em>Reviving Proxy Marriage, </em>76 Brook. L.Rev. 455, 492 (2011). In addition, modern employment commitments often uproot one party from home for long periods of time. This may make personal participation in a marriage ceremony impracticable. <em>Id. </em>at 458. Not permitting marriages by proxy or by phone could deprive these couples of the emotional and legal benefits that accompany marriage. <em>See id. </em>Noel and Marie-Louise\u2019s marriage seems to illustrate such a situation. Noel was working in another country for the World Bank, yet the couple was still able to have a wedding ceremony in their native country with Noel participating by phone.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">For these reasons, we are not persuaded that a marriage by proxy or by phone rises to the level of being repugnant to public policy. The types of marriages are not specifically prohibited by law, do not harm the liberties of either spouse, and it is not inconceivable in the future that such a marriage may be valid when performed in Maryland. The parties\u2019 marriage in the Congo, where someone stood in for Noel and Noel participated by phone, was valid in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Maryland courts would find it valid in this State under the doctrine of comity. Recognizing that the parties\u2019 marriage was valid, the circuit court did not err in granting a divorce, awarding alimony, dividing property, calculating child support, or awarding attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY AFFIRMED.

We have rephrased Appellant's question. In his brief, it was presented as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-12\">Whether the Circuit Court erred in finding that on December 23, 1993, the parties were married in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo, when Marie-Louise failed to meet her burden of proof that a legal marriage occurred when the undisputed evidence was that Noel was not physically present at the wedding ceremony, and Marie-Louise failed to provide foreign law that this type of proxy marriage is recognized in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo, and thus should be recognized here.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b73-9\">. Noel also mentioned in his brief that Marie-Louise did not provide a notice of intent to use foreign law under Md.Code (1974, 2006 Repl. Vol.), Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\"CJP\u201d), \u00a7 10-504. Yet in the same breath, he argues \"the court [was not] presented with foreign law from Marie-Louise validating this \u2018proxy\u2019 ceremony.\u201d The issue of notice is irrelevant if Marie-Louise did not rely on foreign law. Regardless, the issue was not raised below and therefore is not preserved. \"A contention not raised below either in the pleading or in the evidence and not directly passed upon by the trial court is not preserved for appellate review.\u201d <em>Zellinger v. CRC Dev. Corp., </em>281 Md. 614, 620, 380 A.2d 1064 (1977). Noel did not raise the notice issue either in his pleadings or during the hearing. The circuit court did not address the issue in its opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b74-7\">. Based on the context of the sentence, it appears that the Court was using a word in a fashion not commonly used today. According to The Oxford English Dictionary, one definition of \"demeaning\u201d is \"[c]on-duct, behavior, demeanor.\u201d The Oxford English Dictionary 433 (def. 2) (2d ed.1989). The dictionary considers it to be an obsolete word, except when being used in the context of \"demeaning of oneself, comporting oneself.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b75-7\">. In Noel\u2019s reply brief, he advanced that the <em>Attestation De Manage Coutumier </em>was entered into evidence \u201conly to indicate why there is an absence of a certificate of marriage at the Democratic Republic of the Congo Embassy. As such, this document fails to offer any evidence that in fact a marriage occurred pursuant to the laws of the Congo ...\u201d This argument is without merit. The court admitted a letter from the Congolese Embassy, which stated that the embassy had lost the certificate of marriage due to flooding, into evidence and the court said that it was admissible only to show the absence of the marriage certificate. However Marie-Louise also introduced certified records from the World Bank that included a copy of the <em>Attestation De Mariage Coutumier. </em>The court admitted these documents without any limiting instruction on their admissibility. In its written opinion, the circuit court referred to the <em>Attestation </em>stating, \"[Noel's! prevarication on this issue becomes clearer upon consideration of his application for spousal dependancy benefits from the World Bank, which included an \u201cAttestation De Marriage Coutumier\u201d (Certificate of Customary Marriage) dated January 25.\u201d The Attestation De Marriage Coutumier was admitted as substantive evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b76-8\">.
