(\u201cMother\u201d) for minor child, Adriana T. (\u201cAdriana\u201d). Mother apparently exhibited delusional behavior while in labor, and the Prince George\u2019s County Department of Social Services (\u201cDepartment\u201d) authorized limited custody, and placed Adriana in foster care. The Department filed a Child in Need of Assistance (\u201cCINA\u201d) petition, alleging that Mother was unable to care for the child. The court ordered that Adriana be placed in the Department\u2019s temporary custody for continued foster care placement. Following a hearing, the court determined that Adriana was a CINA and permitted placement with a relative. The Department filed a Petition for Guardianship with the Right to Consent to Adoption, to which Mother filed an objection. Adriana\u2019s father, Detuan J. (\u201cFather\u201d), consented to the termination of his parental rights. Following a hearing on the petition, the court entered judgment terminating parental rights. Mother noted an appeal, and presents two questions for our consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-7\">1. Did the court err in permitting a social worker to testify by telephone when [appelleej-child had not complied with Md. Rule 2-513?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-10\">2. Did the court err in admitting irrelevant evidence?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-11\">For the reasons outlined below, we affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b571-13\">Mother, now thirty-seven years of age, has suffered from Delusional Disorder Persecutory Type since she was seventeen.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On December 20, 2001, Mother suffered from a psychi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>atric episode and believed that her mother, Mary T. (\u201cGrandmother\u201d) was complicit in a conspiracy against her. An argument ensued between Mother and Grandmother. Mother left Grandmother\u2019s residence, but returned with a handgun. Mother fired two shots at Grandmother, striking her in the chest and abdomen, but Grandmother survived. Mother was arrested and charged with several criminal offenses.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On June 16, 2003, Mother was found not criminally responsible and was committed to Perkins Hospital until her conditional release on March 26, 2007.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">On November 25, 2009, Mother, who was pregnant, was admitted to the Prince George\u2019s Hospital Center because of a preeclampsia diagnosis,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which posed a serious health risk to Mother and the unborn child. Mother disregarded the physician\u2019s warning and left the hospital. On November 30, 2009, Mother returned to the hospital, but during labor, she again attempted to leave. However, she gave birth to Adriana, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>was subsequently involuntarily committed to the hospital\u2019s mental health unit until December 8, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">The hospital sent a report to the Department, explaining that Mother was a risk to herself and to others, and recommended that she not be left alone with the baby. The Department\u2019s child protective services investigator interviewed Mother to determine if she was capable of caring for Adriana. Due to Mother\u2019s mental state and the inability to identify other relatives in the interim, the investigator issued a report of limited custody.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">On December 7, 2009, Adriana was discharged from the hospital and placed in foster care. On December 8, 2009, the Department filed a CINA petition for Adriana.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On December 14, 2009, following a hearing which reflected Mother\u2019s absence and Father\u2019s concurrence with foster care, the juvenile court ordered that Adriana be placed in the temporary care and custody of the Department. The court granted Mother and Father visitation rights, but ordered that visitation be supervised by the Department.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>During a hearing on March 10, 2010, Mother contended that Adriana was not a CI\u00d1A, and that based on her history of compliance with therapy and medication, she posed no danger to the child. Although the court found that Mother\u2019s physicians indicated her return to therapy and compliance with her medication regimen, there were no mental health evaluations or laboratory results to confirm this. The court \u201c[was] not willing to take a chance on Mother,\u201d and determined that Adriana was a CI\u00d1A and could be placed with a relative.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">In May 2010, after the approval of the Interstate Compact for the Placement of Children (ICPC) process,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the Department placed Adriana with Grandmother, in North Carolina, where she currently resides. During this time, Ms. Joyce Trott (\u201cMs. Trott\u201d), the North Carolina social worker, visited Grandmother\u2019s residence once a month, monitored Adriana\u2019s care, and provided reports to the Department. On October 29, 2010, the Department filed a Petition for Guardianship with Right to Consent to Adoption. Father consented to the petition, but on December 16, 2010, Mother noted her objection. On April 8, 2011, the court determined that the matter was a contested guardianship, and ordered a hearing on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">On June 28, 2011, Adriana filed a motion to take Ms. Trott\u2019s testimony by telephone.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> On June 29, 2011, Mother filed a response, arguing that (1) the motion was not filed in a timely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>fashion and it lacked the required contents,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> which deprived her of the opportunity to depose, oppose, and contact the witness; (2) the court could not determine the witness\u2019 demeanor and credibility; and (3) substantial prejudice would result because she would not have the opportunity for face-to-face cross-examination. On July 6, 2011, the court granted Adriana\u2019s motion. Additionally, over Mother\u2019s objections, the court permitted Grandmother to testify regarding her medical recovery from the gunshot wounds that Mother inflicted. On April 2, 2012, the court ordered that Mother\u2019s parental rights be terminated under \u00a7 5-323(d) of the Family Law Article.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Thereafter, Mother noted a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">In <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship of Ta\u2019Niya C., </em>417 Md. 90, 100, 8 A.3d 745 (2010), the Court of Appeals outlined the standard in reviewing a juvenile court\u2019s decision to terminate parental rights:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-7\">Namely, [wjhen the appellate court scrutinizes factual findings, the clearly erroneous standard of [Rule 8-131(c) ] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>applies.[<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>] [Second,] [i]f it appears that the [court] erred as to matters of law, further proceedings in the trial court will ordinarily be required unless the error is determined to be harmless. Finally, when the appellate court views the ultimate conclusion of the [court] founded upon sound legal principles and based upon factual findings that are not clearly erroneous, the [court\u2019s] decision should be disturbed only if there has been a clear abuse of discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-5\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>In re Yve S., </em>373 Md. 551, 586, 819 A.2d 1030 (2003)) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">The trial court is vested with broad discretion in determining the admissibility of evidence. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 5-104(a). \u201cWhether to admit lay opinion testimony is vested in the sound discretion of the trial judge.\u201d <em>Bey v. State, </em>140 Md.App. 607, 623, 781 A.2d 952 (2001) (citation omitted). Specifically, the trial courts have wide discretion in permitting witnesses to testify by telephone. Audio tape: <em>Hearing on the Notice of Proposed Rules Changes: </em>held by the Court of Appeals on the 163rd Report (March 8, 2010). During the Court of Appeals\u2019 hearing on Md. Rule 2-513, the Honorable Sally D. Adkins stated, \u201cObviously, this is going to be a discretionary decision by the trial courts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">The trial court abuses its discretion \u201c \u2018where no reasonable person would take the view adopted by the trial court,\u2019 \u201d or when the court does not refer to any guiding principles or rules. <em>In re Yve S., </em>373 Md. at 583, 819 A.2d 1030 (quoting <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 3598, </em>347 Md. 295, 312-13, 701 A.2d [\u00b6] (1997)). \u201cQuestions within the discretion of the trial court are \u2018much better decided by the trial judges than by appellate courts, and the decisions of such judges should only be disturbed where it is apparent that some serious error or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>abuse of discretion or autocratic action has occurred.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Caya B., </em>153 Md.App. 63, 74, 834 A.2d 997 (2003) (quoting <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 3598, </em>347 Md. at 312, 701 A.2d 110) (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">A. Did the Trial Court Err in Permitting the North Carolina Social Worker to Testify By Telephone?</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">Md. Rule 2-513 became effective on July 1, 2010. This rule permits telephone testimony in civil cases under certain conditions. <em>See </em>Reporter\u2019s Note to Proposed Rule 2-513, Md. Reg., Yol. 37, Issue 3, Friday, January 29, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">Our task is to determine whether the court erred in permitting Ms. Trott\u2019s testimony by telephone. Md. Rule 2-513(b)(2) reads, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-9\">When testimony taken by telephone allowed; applicability. A court may allow the testimony of a witness to be taken by telephone (1) upon stipulation by the parties or (2) subject to sections (e) and (f) of this Rule, <em>[infra] </em>on motion of a party to the action and for good cause shown.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-10\">During trial, Mother avowed that Adriana failed to satisfy the \u201cgood cause\u201d exception. Good cause permits the court to have \u201csome discretion in enforcing the notice requirement, and allows a court, in certain circumstances, to avoid an unjust conclusion.\u201d <em>Prince George\u2019s County v. Longtin, </em>419 Md. 450, 467, 19 A.3d 859 (2011). Md. Rule 2-513(e) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-11\">Good cause. A court may find that there is good cause to allow the testimony of a witness to be taken by telephone if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-12\">(1) the witness is otherwise unavailable to appear because of age, infirmity, or illness;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-13\">(2) personal appearance of the witness cannot be secured by subpoena or other reasonable means;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-14\">(3) a personal appearance would be an undue hardship to the witness; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>(4) there are any other circumstances that constitute good cause for allowing the testimony of the witness to be taken by telephone.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">In attempting to orient the Court of Appeals Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure [hereinafter \u201cRules Committee\u201d], concerning proposed Md. Rule 2-513, the Honorable Paul E. Alpert,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> speaking on behalf of the MSB A Judicial Administration Section, stated, \u201c[telephone testimony would be allowed if the presence of a witness [was] not available because of financial limitations or because of personal availability. To safeguard abuse of this procedure, the court must find good cause to allow it.\u201d Court of Appeals Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure, Minutes of Meeting of November 16, 2007 at 12, 16. Adriana alleged that she possessed a lack of funds to finance Ms. Trott\u2019s travel and hotel expenses, thereby satisfying the good cause exception pursuant to Md. Rule 2\u2014513(e)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">Md. Rule 2-513(c) reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-7\">Time for filing motion. Unless for good cause shown the court allows the motion to be filed later, a motion to take the testimony of a witness by telephone shall be filed at least 30 days before the trial or hearing at which the testimony is to be offered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">Adriana\u2019s motion was filed fourteen days prior to the first day of trial, and fifteen days prior to the date that the testimony was offered. As noted previously, during trial, Mother challenged the timeliness of the motion, alleging she was deprived of the opportunity to depose the witness because the motion failed to include the subject matter of the witness\u2019 expected testimony. Additionally, she contended that she was unable to contact the witness because of Adriana\u2019s failure to include the witness\u2019 name, address, and telephone number.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>During trial, the following colloquy indicated that there was good cause to permit the untimely motion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-5\">THE COURT: I\u2019m saying for the factor of community adjustment, if I don\u2019t grant this motion, then the only testimony will be from the grandmother.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-6\">[DEPARTMENT\u2019S COUNSEL]: That is correct, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-7\">[ADRIANA\u2019S COUNSEL]: Your Honor, I do know that Ms. Trott is the only unbiased resource that has monthly seen [Adriana].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-8\">THE COURT: I was trying to say that in a nice way\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-9\">[THE COURT]:\u2014that she\u2019s more independent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-10\">THE COURT: ... But, I\u2019m saying it would have appeared then that the only source for that element will be someone who\u2019s with the child every day in North Carolina. 'And then I don\u2019t know if they have, I looked at his witness list. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anyone else who\u2019s going to be able to provide that to me. You agree? Unless I let Ms. Trott testify.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-11\">Furthermore, Mother acknowledged that Ms. Trott\u2019s testimony was \u201cmaterial to the case as it [went] to some of the core issues that ... the [c]ourt must [have] examine[d] under the [termination of parental rights] statute. So, it [did] impact the case.\u201d Hence, the court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that there was good cause to allow the motion to be filed after the deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-12\">The Rules Committee\u2019s minutes read, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-13\">Judge Alpert told the Committee that the 30-day period provided for in section (c) had been decreased from the initial time period suggested. A lawyer may need time to prepare as to who the witnesses will be. The 30-day period [was] discussed before it was chosen. The [Committee] Chair [,the Honorable Joseph Murphy,] commented that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>when one lawyer proposes to the other that a witness\u2019s testimony be taken by telephone, the lawyer who has been asked may wish to do some investigation before deciding whether to agree to this----The Chair suggested that the time period could be changed to 15 days, but he expressed the opinion that the 30-day time period [was] not unreasonable. The [trial] court [could] allow the motion to be filed later, so that solve[d] the time problem....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">Court of Appeals Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure, Minutes of Meeting of November 16, 2007 at 12, 25-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">Regarding the inability of Mother to depose Ms. Trott, although a thirty-day notice was not given, Mother had received Ms. Trott\u2019s monthly reports to the Department, through their incorporation into the Department\u2019s CINA review reports, which the court took judicial notice of at the onset of the hearing. Thus, Mother received notice of the content of Ms. Trott\u2019s status reports and accordingly, was aware of what she would communicate through her testimony. Concerning Mother\u2019s inability to contact Ms. Trott, the court willingly assessed the lack of the required contents and determined that Adriana\u2019s failure to include the contents were immaterial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-8\">THE COURT: [I will] address each and every one of these elements or it will come back. And I\u2019m not going to leave anything out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-9\">So if there\u2019s something missing and I feel it\u2019s material, I will, also, delay this and take [Adriana\u2019s counsel\u2019s] suggestion and do it in two weeks if I\u2019m not satisfied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-10\">Mother next asserts that it was necessary for the court to assess Ms. Trott\u2019s demeanor and credibility. \u201cIf a party objects to the testimony, a court shall not allow the testimony of a witness to be taken by telephone unless the court finds,\u201d among other factors, that \u201cthe demeanor and credibility of the witness are not ... critical to the outcome of the proceeding.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>Md. Rule 2\u2014513(f)(3). During trial, Mother argued the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-4\">... [I]t has, the [c]ourt has the, it\u2019s duty to determine the credibility of all witnesses and case law has in a variety of different cases said that it is absolutely preferred that witnesses be present for the [c]ourt to observe the demean- or of the witness as opposed to other means of providing that testimony....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">In <em>Phillips v. Venker, </em>316 Md. 212, 220, 557 A.2d 1338 (1989), the Court of Appeals noted an unwillingness in conducting evidentiary matters by telephone because of the inability to ascertain the witness\u2019 demeanor during testimony. However, the Rules Committee recommended a broadening of electronic means to utilize telephone testimony in certain judicial proceedings. <em>See </em>Proposed Rule 2-513, Md. Reg., Vol. 37, Issue 3, Friday, January 29, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">Since Md. Rule 2-513 is relatively new, we examine the development of the rule to obtain helpful background information. The Rules Committee drafted subsection (f)(2) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-7\">(f) When Testimony Taken by Telephone is Prohibited</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AFe\">If a party objects, a court shall not allow the testimony of a witness to be taken by telephone if the court finds that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"At0\">(2) the demeanor and credibility of the witness are or may be critical to the outcome of the proceeding</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AOz9\">Judge Adkins noted that the Committee\u2019s wording indicated a presumption that telephone testimony was permitted. She further stated, \u201cWell, I\u2019m wondering if it should be, if the burden should be shifted a little bit, so that the judge should only do it if it makes certain findings.\u201d The Court agreed, and decided to construct the letter of the rule such that it indicated \u201caffirmative findings,\u201d so the presumption was that telephone testimony was not permitted unless the court made specific findings. Thus, the wording was changed to the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-8\">(f) When testimony taken by telephone is prohibited. If a party objects, a court shall not allow the testimony of a witness to be taken by telephone <em>unless </em>the court finds that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>(3) the demeanor and credibility of the witness <em>are not </em>likely to be critical to the outcome of the proceeding</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">We have not found any Maryland case law on the specific issue, nor have the parties supported their contentions with case law. While this issue is one of first impression in Maryland, several jurisdictions have undertaken consideration of the safeguards required under similar circumstances. Md. Rule 2-513 was modeled after a statute and rule in Oregon. Court of Appeals Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure, Minutes of Meeting of November 16, 2007 at 12, 18. Hence, we consult Oregon\u2019s cases, in addition to other sister states, to determine the extent a witness\u2019 credibility may be material, as well as the fair opportunity to cross examine witnesses who testify by telephone in civil proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">In <em>State v. Parker, </em>317 Or. 225, 855 P.2d 636, 639 (1993), the Oregon Supreme Court resolved the conflict of whether the trial court erred in permitting the defendant\u2019s expert to testify via telephone. There, the defendant was indicted for driving under the influence of intoxicants and for breaching the duty of a reasonable and careful driver. <em>Id. </em>at 637. The defendant motioned for a continuance because his initial expert was unavailable for trial. <em>Id. </em>at 639. The court denied the motion, but permitted the telephone testimony from another expert witness. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">The defendant averred that the court\u2019s denial was prejudicial because he could not present demeanor evidence. <em>Parker, </em>855 P.2d at 639. The Oregon court determined that the defendant had obtained three continuances and had adequate time to prepare for expert testimony. <em>Id. </em>As a result, the loss of demeanor evidence was not material, so there was no abuse of discretion. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">In <em>Babcock v. Employment Div., </em>72 Or.App. 486, 696 P.2d 19, 20 (1985), the plaintiff averred that the Employment Appeals Board violated Oregon\u2019s statutes and rules when it conducted a telephone hearing in deciding to deny her unem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>ployment benefits. Specifically, the plaintiff asserted that the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) could not adequately determine the witnesses\u2019 demeanor and credibility. <em>Id. </em>at 21. The Oregon court concluded that although the physicality of a witness was a clue to credibility, a witness\u2019 assertion and how he or she asserted it was of equal and greater value. <em>Id. </em>\u201cBeyond testing credibility by the inherent plausibility of a witness\u2019 testimony ...,\u201d the court concluded that the \u201caudible indicia of a witness\u2019 demeanor [was] sufficient\u201d for the ALJ to find an adequate judgment concerning believability. <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). <em>But see State ex rel. Juvenile Dep\u2019t of Multnomah County v. Gates, </em>86 Or.App. 631, 740 P.2d 217, 218 (1987) (\u201cThe opportunity to observe a witness is so critical to judicial control and effective cross-examination that its denial is manifestly prejudicial.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">In <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (Docket No. 10155), </em>187 Conn. 431, 446 A.2d 808, 812 (1982), the incarcerated father testified from prison relating to the termination of his parental rights. The father argued that the trial court erred because it could not assess his demeanor while testifying. <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court of Connecticut concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-6\">We cannot, however, say that the lack of a visual image seriously disadvantaged the trial court in making its determination. The referee heard the [father\u2019s] testimony directly and took the opportunity to ask several questions of his own. On this record, limiting the opportunity to assess the [father\u2019s] demeanor to its auditory component seems to us to entail only the most marginal risk that the referee would be misled in evaluating the [father\u2019s] credibility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">In <em>In re Megan L., </em>128 N.M. 618, 995 P.2d 1060, 1062 (Ct.App.2000), the New Mexico Court of Appeals sought to determine whether the trial court abused its discretion in permitting telephone testimony during a termination of parental rights (\u201cTPR\u201d) proceeding.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The Children, Youth &amp; Fam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>ilies Department (CYFD) received a referral that a child had been sexually abused by her stepfather. <em>Id. </em>CYFD filed a motion to terminate the parental rights, and sought to elicit telephone testimony of six CYFD witnesses.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 1063. Among other contentions, the mother asserted that the witnesses should have been personally presented because the court needed to evaluate their \u201cdemeanor, body language, and other physical aspects.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1064. Since the witnesses merely testified regarding the mother\u2019s evaluation and the child\u2019s behavior, the New Mexico court held that the mother failed to demonstrate that any of the witnesses\u2019 credibility and veracity were critical issues requiring their personal presence. <em>See id. </em>at 1067-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>when Mother\u2019s counsel alluded to the court\u2019s assessment of Ms. Trott\u2019s demeanor and credibility, the following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-5\">THE COURT: That probably is more important with respect to a witness other than a social worker. Just your regular civilian witness. I think jurors more so than a judge need to look at their demeanor when they\u2019re testifying. I don\u2019t think that that [sic] criteria is actually applicable to this witness, per se. I just don\u2019t think in the nature of her business that that [sic] would be a factor for me. I mean, she\u2019ll say what\u2019s she\u2019s going to say. I\u2019m not going to say that her demeanor she\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-6\">[MOTHER\u2019S COUNSEL]: Certainly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-7\">THE COURT:\u2014slides this way or slides this way [sic], or sits up or sits down ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">Ms. Trott was involved in Adriana\u2019s case since May 2010, and visited Adriana and Grandmother once a month. On July 7, 2011, the following colloquy ensued during the hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>[ADRIANA\u2019S COUNSEL]: And what have you observed about [Grandmother\u2019s] case for Adriana?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-4\">LMS. TROTT]: I think she has provided excellent care for her. She certainly has everything materially that she needs at her apartment. When she talks to her, she has a firm but a gentle voice with her. She\u2019s able to easily get her attention. Adriana is responsive. I don\u2019t see any fear with Adriana. And I think just as she\u2019s getting to her age now she has a little gleam in her eye when she wants to do something or she knows she\u2019s being, you know, corrected or something like that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Demeanor-based credibility is a witness\u2019 outer appearance and mannerisms while testifying before the fact finder. <em>State Bd. of Physicians v. Bernstein, </em>167 Md.App. 714, 759, 894 A.2d 621 (2006). Credibility is at issue in any case concerning testimonial evidence. <em>Dpt. of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene v. Shrieves, </em>100 Md.App. 283, 299, 641 A.2d 899 (1994). For instance, the credibility of a witness in a criminal case is regularly a significant issue. <em>Sivells v. State, </em>196 Md.App. 254, 278, 9 A.3d 123 (2010), cert. <em>granted </em>418 Md. 397, 15 A.3d 298 (2011). Here, Ms. Trott was a disinterested party, who testified to Adriana\u2019s general welfare during her placement with Grandmother. Thus, we agree with the court that Ms. Trott\u2019s demeanor and credibility were not likely to be critical to the outcome of the proceedings, to the extent that her physical presence was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">We do discern that another jurisdiction has ruled contrary to what we hold today. In <em>People ex rel. O.S., </em>701 N.W.2d 421, 424 (S.D.2005), the mother, whose parental rights were terminated, sought to present expert testimony by telephone. The South Dakota trial court denied the testimony because it was untimely and because the court desired to ascertain the expert\u2019s credibility. <em>Id. </em>The trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-7\">The first time I heard from you was this morning when you requested a telephonic conference so your expert witness could appeal telephonically. Not now or no way by telephone. You\u2019re judging credibility of the witness. ... ,[sic] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>but you can\u2019t judge it on the telephone and it\u2019s not going to happen telephonically, period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 427. The South Dakota Supreme Court concluded that the trial court did not abuse its discretion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\"><em>People ex rel. O.S. </em>is distinguishable from the case sub judice. In our case, Ms. Trott was not testifying as an expert, but rather as a lay witness who possessed personal knowledge of Grandmother\u2019s relationship with Adriana. Furthermore, in <em>People ex rel. O.S., </em>701 N.W.2d at 427, other than the credibility element, the exclusion of the telephone testimony was predicated on the untimeliness of the request, which was brought for the first time during the morning of the TPR hearing. Adriana\u2019s motion was filed fourteen days prior to the first day of trial, and fifteen days prior to the date that the testimony was offered. Although untimely, the court found that there was good cause to permit Ms. Trott\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">Mother lastly asserts that substantial prejudice resulted because she was not able to have face-to-face cross-examination. In <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 6Z980001, </em>131 Md.App. 187, 190, 748 A.2d 1020 (2000), we determined if the trial court erred in disallowing an imprisoned father to participate in the termination of parental rights proceeding by speaker phone. The Montgomery County Department of Health and Human Services petitioned the trial court for guardianship with the right to consent to adoption. <em>Id. </em>at 189, 748 A.2d 1020. The father was imprisoned for conspiracy to distribute cocaine, and filed a motion to participate in the trial by speaker phone, citing the impossibility of being transported to the proceeding. <em>Id. </em>at 189-90, 748 A.2d 1020. The motion was denied, but the father could obtain the certified copies of the audiotapes, in which the court offered him sixty days to submit an affidavit. <em>Id. </em>at 190, 748 A.2d 1020.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-9\">Despite the father\u2019s affidavit reflecting the arguments he desired to assert at trial, the court terminated his rights and granted the petition for guardianship. <em>Id. </em>at 191, 748 A.2d 1020. The father appealed and asserted that his Sixth Amendment\u2019s right to confrontation was violated. <em>See id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>191-92, 748 A.2d 1020. The trial court held that a case involving the termination of parental rights was a civil proceeding, and therefore the Sixth Amendment conferred no right of confrontation. <em>Id. </em>at 192, 748 A.2d 1020 (citing <em>People in Interest of C.G., </em>885 P.2d 355, 357 (Colo.Ct.App.1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">In <em>Salerian v. Md. State Bd. of Physicians, </em>176 Md.App. 231, 256, 932 A.2d 1225 (2007), we determined whether the trial court erred in permitting an incarcerated witness to testify by telephone in an administrative proceeding. The defendant, a psychiatrist, publicized information that was related to him during sessions with the incarcerated witness, who was charged with espionage. <em>Id. </em>at 236, <em>932 A.2d 1225. </em>The plaintiffs, the witness and his wife, filed a complaint with the Maryland State Board of Physicians (\u201cBoard\u201d). <em>Id. </em>By the time the hearing was conducted, the witness had been convicted of espionage and was serving a life sentence in a federal prison in Colorado. <em>Id. </em>at 243, 932 A.2d 1225. Because of the restrictions imposed by his detention, the witness was required to testify by telephone. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">The ALJ found that the defendant was liable and imposed a two year probation period and a $5,000 fine. <em>Id. </em>at 238, 932 A.2d 1225. The defendant appealed, and the trial court affirmed the Board\u2019s decision. <em>Id. </em>On appeal to our Court, the defendant asserted that the telephone testimony was \u201cso fraught with problems\u201d that it \u201cdenied [him] a fair hearing\u201d because the telephone connection had to be reconnected every fifteen minutes. <em>Id. </em>at 255-56, 932 A.2d 1225. Furthermore, there were times when the witness could not be heard clearly. <em>Id. </em>at 256, 932 A.2d 1225.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">The ALJ found that the defendant had a \u201c \u2018full and fair opportunity to cross examine the [witness], via telephone, and had every opportunity to request that the [witness] repeat his responses to the satisfaction of [c]ounsel.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Additionally, the witness\u2019 testimony was supported by other witnesses who testified in person at the hearing. <em>Id. </em>Hence, there was substantial evidence in the record, independent of the telephone testimony, to substantiate the Board\u2019s conclusion. <em>Id. </em>We affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment, and found that the admission of the telephone testimony was permissible. <em>See id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>at 238, 932 A.2d 1225. <em>See also In re D.S., </em>333 S.W.3d 379, 387-88 (Tex.App.2011) (\u201cAt times when the father said he was unable to hear, the court directed the witnesses and counsel to speak loudly. At one point during testimony the telephone connection was lost, briefly restored, and lost again. The court substituted telephones and allowed the witness to be re-questioned.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">In <em>In re Megan L., </em>995 P.2d at 1064, <em>supra, </em>the mother noted the possibility that some of CYPD\u2019s witnesses would be called by her as rebuttal witnesses, and noted the impracticality of doing so if they were not physically present in court. The New Mexico court examined the mother\u2019s cross-examination of the witnesses, and found that her cross-examination was extremely limited. <em>Id. </em>at 1067. The mother had an unrestricted opportunity for cross-examination and the court directed CYPD to make its witnesses available for rebuttal. <em>Id. </em>at 1068. As a result, there was no violation of procedural due process rights nor an abuse of discretion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">In <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (Docket No. 10155), </em>446 A.2d at 811-12, <em>supra, </em>the court permitted the incarcerated father to obtain the complete transcript, including his counsel\u2019s cross-examination of the maternal grandmother. The father argued that because the court denied his motion for continuance until he could be present at the TPR hearing, this weakened the effectiveness of the cross-examination. <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court of Connecticut concluded that the father was offered the opportunity to defer cross-examination entirely until the father reviewed the transcript, but he decided against this. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, the cross-examination was not defective or incomplete. <em>Id. </em>Thus, the trial court did not err. <em>Id. </em>at 815. <em>See also State ex rel. Juvenile Dep\u2019t of Lane County v. Stevens, </em>100 Or.App. 481, 786 P.2d 1296, 1299 (1990) (The father\u2019s counsel performed a thorough and significant cross-examination despite the father\u2019s absence.).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">Here, Ms. Trott\u2019s testimony was corroborated by other witnesses who testified in person at the hearing, including the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>Department\u2019s social worker, Natalie Gimperling, whose testimony revealed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-5\">Yes, [Grandmother was] beyond an appropriate placement for her granddaughter. She [was] meeting all of her needs. She ... stepped up, became licensed as a foster parent, which meant that she met all of that state\u2019s regulations and requirements for someone to be approved, and ... soon to be approved as an adoptive resource as well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-6\">Adriana view[ed] [Grandmother] as a mother figure. She, you know, was completely engaged with her, was giving her lots of affection, both, you know, vice versa. Very happy, excited, you know, and [Grandmother] was providing me with all kinds of updates on how well she [was] doing and was just a proud and beaming grandmother.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">Similar to <em>In re D.S., </em>333 S.W.3d at 387-88, the counsels elevated their voices to ensure that Ms. Trott could hear the questions. The following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-8\">[ADRIANA\u2019S COUNSEL]: Your Honor, may I approach?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AnV\">THE COURT: Approach who? She\u2019s on the phone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ADQ\">[ADRIANA\u2019S COUNSEL]: I was going to get close so she [could] hear me, but I can just talk very loudly if you\u2019d like.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AW8\">THE COURT: Can you hear her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-9\">[MS. TROTT]: Yes. Barely, but I can hear her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-10\">THE COURT: All right. She said you\u2019d better get closer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-11\">THE COURT: Do you want to get closer, too?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-12\">[MOTHER\u2019S COUNSEL]: I\u2019d better.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-13\">THE COURT: All right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-14\">Unlike <em>Salerian </em>and <em>In re D.S., </em>in the case <em>sub judice, </em>there were no phone disconnections or any other technological problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-15\">Mother\u2019s counsel asked Ms. Trott the following during cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>[MOTHER\u2019S COUNSEL]: [Grandmother] ... she\u2019s not been approved as an adoptive placement at this point, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-4\">[MS. TROTT]: She is\u2014I\u2019m in the process of writing that study. I have not completed it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-5\">[MOTHER\u2019S COUNSEL]: Okay. So she has not, in fact, been approved at this point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-6\">[MS. TROTT]: No, she has not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-7\">[MOTHER\u2019S COUNSEL]: Okay. That\u2019s my only question.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">Although, there is no Sixth Amendment right to confrontation in this civil proceeding, Mother still reserved her right to cross-examine Ms. Trott. Our review of the record reveals that Mother\u2019s ability to effectively cross-examine was not stifled because Ms. Trott testified by telephone. Mother had a full and fair opportunity to cross-examine, but chose to limit her cross-examination to one question. We conclude that (1) Adriana\u2019s inadequate notice was not an inconvenience to Mother; (2) Ms. Trott\u2019s demeanor and credibility were not likely to be critical to the outcome of the proceedings; and (3) Mother had a fair opportunity to cross-examine Ms. Trott. Hence, the court did not abuse its discretion in permitting the telephone testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">III. RELEVANCY</p>\n<p id=\"b590-10\">A. Did the Trial Court Err in Admitting Irrelevant Evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b590-11\">Relevant evidence has \u201cany tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d Md. Rule 5-401. Generally, the trial court has wide discretion when considering the relevancy of evidence. <em>State v. Simms, </em>420 Md. 705, 724, 25 A.3d 144 (2011) (citations omitted). \u201cWhile trial judges are vested with discretion in weighing relevancy in light of unfairness or efficiency considerations, trial judges do not have discretion to admit irrelevant evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>See Pearson v. State, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>182 Md. 1, 13, 31 A.2d 624 (1943)) (noting that \u201c \u2018the rule [of discretion] will not be extended to facts obviously irrelevant as well as prejudicial to the defendant\u2019 \u201d). The <em>de novo </em>standard of review applies to the trial court\u2019s conclusion of law that the evidence at issue is or is not \u201c \u2018of consequence to the determination of the action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ruffin Hotel Corp. of Md. v. Gasper, </em>418 Md. 594, 620, 17 A.3d 676 (2011) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Adriana asserts that Grandmother\u2019s reference to the severity of the shooting incident, the injuries sustained, and her recovery was directly related not only to Grandmother\u2019s ability to be a fit parent, but also to whether continuing the legal relationship between Mother and Adriana was detrimental. Likewise, the Department avers that the shooting and Grandmother\u2019s recovery were probative to the question of whether Mother posed a safety issue to Adriana, and insofar as it had a bearing on Grandmother\u2019s ability to care for Adriana and develop a positive emotional bond with her. In the court\u2019s assessment of Mother\u2019s objection to Grandmother\u2019s testimony, the following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-6\">THE COURT: No, we have to get to the relevant, [sic] why would it not be relevant in terms of an interaction or how she has overcome what happened to her in the past with respect to her relationship with her own daughter?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-7\">[MOTHER\u2019S COUNSEL]: Your Honor, I argue that that [sic] has nothing to do with any decision regarding why she needs, why her, my client\u2019s parental rights need to be terminated. I think that it\u2019s being introduced to establish, quite honestly, some level of drama in the case that is unnecessary and prejudicial to my client.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-8\">THE COURT: Well, we haven\u2019t heard what she had to say yet\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-9\">THE COURT:\u2014to know if it\u2019s dramatic or not. So it\u2019s overruled. Go ahead. Answer the question.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>It has long been established that a parent\u2019s past conduct is relevant to a consideration of the parent\u2019s future conduct. <em>In re Dustin T., </em>93 Md.App. 726, 731, 614 A.2d 999 (1992) (citing <em>See, e.g., McCabe v. McCabe, </em>218 Md. 378, 383, 146 A.2d 768 (1958)) (\u201cTn making our decision [as to the future of the infant at issue] we should not gamble about that future. We can only judge the future by the past.\u2019 \u201d). Reliance upon past behavior as a basis for ascertaining the parent\u2019s present and future actions directly serves the purpose of the CINA statute. <em>Id. </em>at 732, 614 A.2d 999.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">In <em>In re Dustin T., </em>93 Md.App. at 733, 614 A.2d 999, we determined whether a mother\u2019s pre-natal drug use was relevant to her ability to provide adequate care for her child. Following the child\u2019s birth, he tested positive for cocaine. <em>Id. </em>at 731, 614 A.2d 999. The child was declared a CINA and the court continued the commitment for placement in temporary foster care. <em>Id. </em>at 729, 614 A.2d 999. On appeal, predicated on the above-mentioned law, we held that the mother\u2019s prior drug use was relevant to whether she could provide sufficient care for the child. <em>Id. </em>at 733, 614 A.2d 999.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>Grandmother testified that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-7\">Thank you. First of all, I want to say is [sic] that I don\u2019t have any ill will against my daughter. I\u2019m not here bash [sic] her or anything like that. I forgave her for what she did. I still love her. I love my granddaughter regardless of what people may think.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-8\">You know. When I was in the hospital, I was out for a while. I don\u2019t know how long. I couldn\u2019t even tell you. I was in a coma. And when I came to there [sic] were nurses around me because the doctor had given me up and called the family to let them know that I may not make it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-9\">And to make a long story short, to go on to the, what you call it, the recovery part where I had to go [sic] rehab. They sent me to rehab. The doctor sa[id], \u201cWell, [Grandmother], be expected to stay in rehab for at least six <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>months.\u201d I said, \u201cSix months?\u201d I went into rehab. I did everything I could, had to do as far as the walking and pushing myself. A lot of mornings and days I did not feel like it. But I made myself do it and I came out of rehab in six weeks, not six months.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-5\">And that was, I had always been a strong person because I had strong parents and family. And then when I left rehab, my brother took me in his home and I had to go to, well, it\u2019s okay, North Carolina to live with him for two years. And what he did, I had to have other operations. My brother would take off from work and take me back, bring me back to Baltimore, Maryland to have my operations....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-6\">And that\u2019s what I did. But for two years, I mean, and then my brother would push me up the steps. I couldn\u2019t walk when I first got there. And I couldn\u2019t get out the bed by myself. They would pull my arms up, a nurse would come in once a week to monitor me and my blood pressure and change my wounds and all of that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-7\">My sister-in-law would put me in the shower and I would have to sit on a bench and she would wash me.... But then after my last operation and I got well enough, I moved away and he used to come and visit me on a regular basis\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-8\">Yes, my brother. And come and visit me. And I still had, like, a nurse that would come when I had to go to doctors and nurses and stuff, you know. And it took a while. I mean, I\u2019m not completely well but there are things that I can do and there are little limitations and I have wear [sic] a band for the rest of my life because my stomach is messed up so bad.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">We find that Grandmother\u2019s testimony regarding her recovery was relevant to the TPR proceeding because Grandmother\u2019s recuperation demonstrated the extent of the damage caused by Mother\u2019s violent conduct. Mother suffered from a psychiatric episode and believed that Grandmother was complicit in a conspiracy against her. After an argument ensued, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>Mother left Grandmother\u2019s residence, and returned with a handgun, shooting Grandmother in the chest and abdomen. Grandmother\u2019s testimony demonstrated the gravity of the injuries that she sustained since (1) the doctor estimated a six month rehabilitation period; (2) Grandmother traveled from North Carolina to Baltimore to undergo surgical procedures; (3) Grandmother was unable to walk or bathe herself; and because (4) she must utilize a medical band for the remainder of her life. Grandmother\u2019s testimony also denoted her ability to care for Adriana, despite the shooting incident, Mother\u2019s inability to raise Adriana, and the potential peril she posed to Adriana\u2019s health and well-being.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">\u201cIt is well settled in Maryland that a judgment in a civil case will not be reversed in the absence of a showing of error <em>and </em>prejudice of the appealing party.\u201d <em>In re Ashley E., </em>158 Md.App. 144, 164, 854 A.2d 893 (2004). \u201cIn that context, prejudice means that it is likely that the outcome of the case was negatively affected by the court\u2019s error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). We find that there was no prejudice, since it was important to address both whether Mother\u2019s conduct posed any potential adverse impact on Adriana, as well as whether Grandmother was physically capable of caring for Adriana. As a result of the plausibility of Mother\u2019s future violent conduct, the court did not err in admitting the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Overall, the juvenile court considered all the factors enumerated in \u00a7 5-323(d) of the Family Law Article and found clear and convincing evidence that Mother was unfit to care for Adriana because of her chronic and severe mental illness. The court found that it was in Adriana\u2019s best interest to terminate Mother\u2019s parental rights. Hence, the court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY IS AFFIRMED.
