D. Sir, I received yours, loft at my house yesterday, requesting my advice and opinion respecting the first and second lines of the tract of land called <em>William and James, </em>on which your land in the neck in some degree depends. As to my advice and opinion, I think of little consequence. I shall, therefore, lay all the circumstances before you on which my opinion is founded. The <em>William and James </em>is a resurvey on a tract of land called <em>Rotterdam, </em>about the year 1728. The certificate says, (after running a number of courses,) to an ancient bounded white oak standing on an ivy point by <em>Nanjemoy </em>creek side, opposite to the dweling house of Mi. <em>William Stone, </em>at which place, (according to the depositions of <em>Nicholas Cooper </em>and <em>Robert Taylor, </em>formerly taken,) stood the second bound tree of <em>Rotterdam, </em>from thence running into the woods east <em>according to the original line of Rotterdam, </em>for the length of 500 perches, then S W by W 270 perches, to a locust post now put up in the line of the said tract called <em>Nanjemoy </em>or <em>Indian Town, </em>then, &amp;c. About thirty years ago Mr. <em>Hutchison </em>and Mr. <em>Sloddert </em>run this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>Jand, or part of it, in order to make a division, (as you will see by the enclosed paper,) but for some reason, and probably because, (what you call the first line of <em>William and James </em>did not take in their possessions,) did not complete the division. In the year 1764, <em>Wheton Wallace </em>made a resurvey, and look up the land left out by the then running the east line of <em>William and James </em>as far as the head of <em>Goose creek, </em>or nearly as far. This appears to have been done a very little after the survey made by <em>Hutchison </em>and <em>Slodderi. </em>Some time after this survey, Mr. <em>Henry Brent </em>took up the balance of the land left out by the first line of <em>William and James. </em>About 10 or <em>12 </em>years ago, Mr. <em>Hutchison </em>called on me to survey <em>William and James, at </em>which time the appearances were as represented in the enclosed paper. There were then three or four witnesses; <em>Charles Timms </em>was one, the rest I do not remember; they all agreed in the same representation; they had all lived long in the neck, and appeared to be well acquainted with the circumstances. I made the survey for <em>Wheton Wallace, </em>as assistant under my father, and well remember running the first line of <em>William and James </em>a considerable distance into the possessions and cultivations of the tenants on the <em>William and </em>James. From these circumstances it is my opinion, that the east line of the <em>William and James, </em>from the second boundary of <em>Rotterdam, </em>ought to be run so as to include the possessions as shown, and that it would be so supposed, provided that no transactions of the proprietors of the <em>William and James </em>would operate against them. There is no possession that will operate in this case I believe; and although the correction, agreeably to the age of the <em>William and James, </em>would not include the former possessions; yet as its my opinion, according to the original line of <em>Rotterdam, </em>it would be corrected agreeably to the age of <em>Rotterdam, </em>so as to include the former possessions, and that the second line would run from the end of the first line as aforesaid to a free stone, a boundary of <em>St.. Thomas\u2019s Manor, </em>which is also a boundary of <em>William and James. </em>And if the transactions of the proprietors of the <em>William and James </em>should prevent them from their claim on the first line, I do not think it would prevent yours on the second. I would advise you to get more able opinions than mine before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>you do any thing on the land which might involve you in a suit, in which you might possibly suffer.

The plaintiff then, in proof of his locations of <em>Rotterdam- </em>and <em>William and James, </em>read in evidence the patent of a tract of land called <em>Rotterdam, </em>granted to <em>Simon Oversee; </em>also the patent of a tract of land called <em>Rotterdam, </em>granted to <em>Robert Boyne', </em>and also the patent of a tract of land called <em>William and James, </em>granted to <em>William Hutchison </em>and <em>John Stoddert </em>\u2014 all of which said' patents are hereinbefore more particularly referred to. The plaintiff then gave in evidence by a certain <em>Giles G. Crayeroft, </em>that he lived on the plaintiff, <em>(Stodderfs,) </em>land, in the year 1807, or 8, and that he asked <em>S. Chandler </em>if he knew how the fencing, located on the plot from red <em>C </em>to little red c was to be kept up, and that then they were near the said fence, and who informed him that the fence was put there by agreement between <em>Hutchison, </em>and <em>Stoddert </em>and <em>Wallace, </em>who are the same persons who held <em>Rotterdam </em>and the <em>William and James, </em>and that from the head of the marsh the line run to a box oak, standing on a point of the bank near which there are ivys and near the new discovered springs and that he went this morning with the surveyor, and pointed out the tree which he supposes to be the tree alluded to by the said Chandler, and that there is no other box oak standing on the said point, or near it. The plaintiff further gave evidence, that the said <em>Chandler </em>is dead; and also gave in evidence by the surveyor, that the tree shown by the witness, <em>Crayeroft, </em>is the tree marked on the plot by letter B. The witness further <em>stated, </em>that <em>Sami. Chandler </em>said that he had understood from old people that the tree formerly stood under the bank, and was a white oak, but that he, <em>Chandler, </em>never knew any other boundary but the box oak, and that he had frequently seen it run from, and not from any other; and he further told the witness, that it was a boundary of the <em>Indian-Town Land, </em>which name was the common name of the lands held by <em>Hutchison </em>and <em>Stoddert. </em>And further gave in evidence by <em>Rennet B. Semmes, </em>that he has known the lands held by <em>Hutchison </em>and <em>Stoddert </em>for 38 years, and that the lands went <em>by the </em>common name of. the <em>Indian-Town Tract. </em>This witness did not know any thing about Rotterdam, except what he has seen and heard upon theloeationmade in this cause. The plaintiff further gave in evidence by <em>William W. Lewis, </em>that at the-place <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>marked on the plot by black <em>B, </em>there stands a box oak, the same that stood there thirty-five years ago; that it has not grown much; that it stands on a point near a spring called <em>'The New Discovery Spring, </em>about <em>20 </em>steps from the creek, and is surrounded along the bank with ivys, and that there is no other point like it any where near it. The plaintiff further gave in evidence by <em>James Brawner, </em>a competent witness, that at the place marked on the plot by black <em>B, </em>there has stood from the time he fust knew it, and still stands, a box oak upon an ivy point near <em>Nanjemoy Creek; </em>that there were three trees there standing when he first knew it, one a red oak, one a hickory, and the other the said box oak; that there is no other point on the creek near this place answering this description. And further gave in evidence, that the tree is marked with blaze, which appears to have been done from 15 to <em>20 </em>years ago, and that the said tree is a flourishing, thriving tree. The defendant then prayed the court to instruct the jury, that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover. Which opinion and direction the court refused to give. The defendant excepted. The verdict of the jury, and judgment thereon <em>by </em>the court, was for the defendant, and the plaintiff appealed to this court.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b163-5\">The cause was argued before Buchanan, Ch.

In the progress of the trial, five bills of exceptions were signed by the court, at the instance of the appellant, which it has now become our duty to revise and decide upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-10\">It is the modern practice, in location causes, <em>to </em>offer in evidence all the plots and explanations returned under the warrant of resurvey. This we commend as an excellent course, well calculated to lay the whole subject litigated, explicitly before the court and jury. It has not been pursued in the case under consideration; but the plots and explanations are, nevertheless, adverted to in the proceedings, and are sufficiently before us, to claim our attention in disposing of the points we have to act upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-11\">We concur withthecourt below, in their opinions delivered in the <em>first </em>and <em>last </em>(th <em>e fifth) </em>bills of exceptions; but we must beg leave to dissent from those expressed by them, in the remaining bills of exceptions. In the <em>first </em>bill of exceptions the court were right in rejecting the letter, plot and explanations, of the deceased surveyor, <em>Theophilus Hanson, </em>and in not permitting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>them to be laid before the jury. They contain no legally correct information, and are made up mostly of statements and opinions. Unlike the case of <em>Snavely v </em>M'Pherson &amp; Brien, 5 <em>Harr. &amp; Johns. </em>150, they do not give his declarations of former runnings, which he performed as a surveyor, or to which he was in any way a witness. He speaks, it is true, of a survey made between the years 1760 and 1776, when he acted as an assistant to his father, in locating a vacancy taken up by <em>Whcton Wallace, </em>yet he does not designate it on his plot with sufficient precision to be understood, or to ascertain the place where the line of <em>William and James </em>sometimes called its first line, formerly run. He well remembers that it run a considerable distance into the possessions and cultivations of the tenants on the <em>William and </em>James; but the exact distance it run is undetermined, and the possessions and cultivations are not delineated on his plot. The old <em>Peach Orchard </em>he has mentioned, is not located by the plaintiff on the plots in this cause, and we cannot readily perceive how it would be possible to give it an exact designation, on any particular part of them, from the very uncertain information derived from <em>Theophilus Hanson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">It is to be collected from the depositions offered in evidence in the <em>fifth </em>bill of exceptions, that they were taken under a commission issued from the high court of chancery in the year 1713. But the record of the commission is not produced, neither does it appear by what authority, or under what law, it was issued; nor in what manner, or on what notice it was executed. If authorised, it seems to have been altogether an incomplete and imperfect proceeding, and the court could not have erred, we think, in refusing it admission to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">In the <em>second </em>and <em>third </em>bills of exceptions, the court refused to the plaintiff the benefit of <em>Thomas Burgess\u2019s </em>testimony, on the score of incompetency, on account of his supposed interest in the event of the suit. In this we clearly think their honours were wrong. \" The objection to testify was made by the witness himself, but if it had come from a different quarter, it could not have been available. If <em>Thomas Burgess </em>had an interest, it is not located on the plots in the cause, and his own private plot made to demonstrate-it,- could not be received <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>for that purpose. He was moreover called to swear against his interest, and it is not for a witness to excuse himself from giving evidence on this ground. Since the case of <em>Taney v Kemp, </em>decided in this court in the year 1818, 4 <em>Harr. </em>&amp; <em>Johns. </em>348, it may be laid down as a rule of evidence, that no person shall be exempted from giving testimony on the ground that his answer may affect his interest. What the particular situation of <em>Thomas Burgess </em>is, in respect to the lines of <em>Rotterdam, </em>or <em>William and James, </em>does not fully appear. But whether the-establishment of the boundary at <em>B, </em>deprives him of a part of his land, within the lines of his tract called <em>Bye Fields Close, </em>or subjects him to the plaintiff\u2019s action, for a trespass on <em>Rotterdam, </em>or <em>William and James, </em>he is equally within the operation of the rule, and in neither case is entitled to exemption from giving evidence in this cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">There is another difficulty arising out of the consideration of the <em>second </em>and <em>third </em>bills of exceptions, which we deem it proper to notice. <em>Thomas Burgess </em>declined to give evidence of the boundary at <em>B, </em>although, in the execution of the warrant of resurvey, he was at the place where it stands, and was called upon by the plaintiff to testify in relation to it. Ought he to have been rejected as a witness on the trial lor this cause? The usual course is to examine a witness on the survey, and to take his deposition de bene <em>esse; </em>and it is not the least among many advantages attending this practice, that the testimony of the same witness in court, is applied more readily to designate points on the plots, and is, therefore, more perfectly understood by the court and jury. This advantage is attained in this case. By <em>Thomas Burgess </em>being on the ground, atthe time of the survey, at the boundary <em>B, </em>where he was called upon to give evidence, no mistake can arise as <em>to the </em>place at which he was required to prove the boundary, and his testimony on the trial can be as well understood, as if it was a repetition of -what he had previously sworn in the country. Nor can we perceive that the.offer to swear him, could produce any surprize on the opposite party, as the intention to make him a witness to a particular and designated boundary, was explicitly avowed on the execution of the warrant. For these reasons we are of -opinion, that his testimony on the trial ought not to have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>rejected on the ground that he was not a sworn witness on the resurvey.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">The court below certainly erred in admitting to the jury, the evidence mentioned in the <em>fourth </em>bill of exceptions. <em>Giles G. Craycroft </em>was not on the <em>survey, and </em>did not show <em>to the </em>surveyor the division line, designated by the letters <em>i. k. on </em>the plots, and his testimony in reference to it ought not to have, been laid before the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-12\">JUDGMENT REVERSED, AND PROCEDENDO AWARDED,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
