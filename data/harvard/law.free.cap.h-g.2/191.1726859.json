The bill in this case was filed on the 25th of February 1817, in <em>Baltimore </em>county court, by the appellees, (the complainants in that court,) against the appellant and <em>John Rogers, </em>(the defendants therein;) and afterwards, under the act of 1824, <em>eh. </em>196, the proceedings were, at the instance of the complainants, transmitted to the court of chancery, on the 15th of June 1825. The bill stated, that some time previous to the year 1811, <em>John Rogers, </em>stone mason in the city of <em>Baltimore, </em>entered into partnership with <em>Robert Henderson, </em>merchant of the said place, for the purpose of carrying on the flour and milling business, under the title of <em>Henderson fy Rogers. </em>That <em>Henderson </em>and <em>Rogers </em>in carrying on their said business contracted considerable debts, among which was one contracted with the complainants in the purchase of wheat, which then amounted to about $6,000. That <em>Henderson 8,- Rogers </em>becoming embarrassed in their affairs, <em>Rogers, </em>for the purpose of preventing his private property from being made responsible for the debts of the said firm, on. or about the 16th of January 1811, assigned to <em>Nicholas Strike, </em>oi the said city, two certain lots or parcels of ground situate in <em>Praft-street </em>in the said city, with their appurtenances, for the term of ninety-nine years; which assignments were exhibited marked No. 1, and 2. That the complainants have every reason to believe that there was no <em>bona fide </em>sale of the said lots by <em>Rogers </em>to <em>Strike; </em>that no consideration passed between the said parties as for a sale of property; <em>that if Strike paid Rogers any money, it was subsequently and by way of loan on the security of the said deeds; and that the said assignments were understood by the parties expressly to be made to avoid the payment of the creditors of Rogers, or of Henderson Rogers. </em>That as an evidence that the said deeds executed by <em>Rogers </em>to <em>Strike </em>were not intended to be absolute, but only intended to secure the same against the creditors of <em>Rogers\u2019, </em>and that the monies paid by <em>Strike </em>to <em>Rogers </em>were paid only \u00abpon the security of the deeds, which had been previously executed. That a considerable part of the said money was expended by <em>Strike </em>upon the said property contained in the deed marked No. 2, as an exhibit, after the execution thereof, and charged <em>Rogers </em>as part of the purchase money; and that another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>portion of said pretended purchase money was expended by <em>Rogers </em>in erecting a furnace and other permanent buildings on the property contained in the deed made marked No-, 1, as an exhibit. <em>That'Rogers, </em>notwithstanding the said deeds, for two years after the dates thereof continued to receive the rente thereof, and also to pay the taxes thereon, and the ground rent which was due on the same. <em>That Strike, not considering the deeds absolute, has often promised Rogers, to reconvey the same on the repayment of the amount paid by him on account of the execution of the said conveyances. That part of the alleged purchase money for said lots and houses was a sum of money paid by Strike to Col. Jacob Small, long after the execution of the said deeds; and even after Rogers\u2019 ap\u00b6 plication for the act of insolvency, which was in October </em>1812,. When <em>Strike was </em>appointed trustee for his creditors. That Strike, long after the date of said deeds, which is on the same day and year, drew up his account' against <em>Roger's, </em>showing the manner in which he had expended, and <em>Rogers </em>received to the axnount of the said nominal consideration in the said deeds mentioned, which the complainants pray <em>Strike </em>may be compelled to produce, by which the said mode of payment by <em>Strike </em>for said lots will satisfactorily appear as above stated. That <em>Rogers, </em>about October 1812, in consequence of his pecuniary difficulties, applied to <em>Baltimore </em>county court for the benefit of this acts of insolvency of this state; on\u2019 which occasion the said parties procured <em>Strike </em>to be named, by the said court trustee of the effects of <em>Rogers, </em>for the purpose of better concealing the above mentioned fraudulent assignments of said property by <em>Rogers </em>to <em>Strike. </em>The relief sought by the bill was, that the. deeds from <em>Rogers </em>to <em>Strike </em>might be declared null and void; that the property be sold for the benefit of the creditors of <em>Rogers, </em>and of <em>Henderson </em>and <em>Rogers; </em>and that <em>Strike </em>should account for the rents and profits. The bill1, after stating certain interrogatories to be answered, also prayed for general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-5\">The <em>Exhibit </em>No. 1, is a deed from <em>John Rogers </em>to <em>Nicholas Strike, </em>dated the 16th of January 1811, whereby, in consideration of #500, <em>Rogers </em>conveyed to <em>Strike, </em>and his heirs, executors, &amp;c. all and singular that piece or parcel of ground, situate, lying and being; in <em>Baltimore </em>county aforesaid, and near <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>the said city of <em>Baltimore, </em>which is contained within the following metes and bounds, courses and distances, to wit: Beginning for the same, at, &amp;c. \u201cTo have and to hold all and singular the said before described piece or parcel of ground, buildings, improvements and premises, hereby assigned, transferred and set over, or meant or intended so to be, with the rights and appurtenances thereunto belonging, to the use of the said <em>Nicholas Strike, </em>his heirs, executors, administrators or assigns, from henceforth, for and during all the rest, residue and remainder, of the original term therein of ninety-nine years, which is yet to <em>come </em>and unexpired, and fully to be complete and ended, with the said benefits of renewals of the original lease and term from time to time forever; and of purchasing the same in fee simple, or otherwise, as herein before is mentioned, in as full, large, ample, and beneficial a manner, to all intents and purposes whatever, as the same could have been had, held and enjoyed, by the said <em>John Rogers, </em>his heirs, executors, administrators, or assigns, in anywise, under and subject, nevertheless, to the payment of the yearly rent or rents, as the ease may be, and to a proportion of the fines for renewals, covenants and conditions, in and by the original indenture of lease thereof mentioned and expressed, and for and in respect of the said hereby assigned piece or parcel of ground and premises, to be paid, observed, performed and kept,\u201d &amp;c.

That he hath no knowledge of any contract made between the complainants, and <em>Henderson </em>and <em>Rogers, </em>nor what sum of money was due, or is now due, by the said <em>Henderson </em>and <em>Rogers, </em>to the complainants, or if any money is due by them to the complainants. He stated, that on the 16th of January 1811, <em>Rogers, </em>by his two several deeds of assignment of that date, <em>did bargain, sell and assign, to this defendant, </em>the two several lots and parcels of ground, therein particularly described, <em>for the consideration money therein mentioned, </em>which said deeds were duly executed, acknowledged and recorded, according to law, as by the said original deeds therewith filed, will more at large appear. That the said sale of the said two lots mentioned in the said deeds, was <em>a bona fide sale, and that the full consideration </em>money set forth in the said deed, to <em>John Rogers. </em>That <em>John Rogers </em>and <em>Robert Henderson, </em>nor <em>either of them, were not indebted to him previous to the execution of said deeds, </em>and <em>that the said deeds, or either of them, were not executed to him, to cover any loans of monies due by Rogers </em>and <em>Henderson,or </em>either of them, to this defendant; and that the said deeds, and the lots of ground thereby conveyed, <em>were not executed to this defendant in trust, or by way of mortgage or security, or to evade the claims of the creditors of Henderson and </em>Rogers, or the creditors of either of them; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>but this defendant saith, that he purchased the said <em>lots of ground as aforesaid, absolutely for his own use, and paid for the same out of his own monies. </em>That after he had purchased said lots of ground, and had obtained a conveyance for them, he improved one of the said lots, by erecting additional buildings thereon, which said improvements, were erected at his own charges; and he never did charge <em>Rogers </em>with the expenditure of the said buildings and improvements.' That after he had obtained the said deeds, and possession of the said lots, he leased one of them for a term of years, and that the tenants did erect a furnace on one of the said lots, and that <em>Rogers </em>did not erect the said furnace, and it is no advantage to him, inasmuch as the tenants have a right to remove the said furnace, at the expiration of the said term. That <em>Rogers, </em>after the said purchase, never did receive the rents of the said property, with the consent of this defendant, nor pay taxes and gi\u2019ound rents, due on the said lots. He denies that he ever promised <em>Rogers </em>to reconvey the said property to him, upon his repaying the amount of the purchase money paid by this defendant for the same. That he never paid to Colonel <em>Jacob Small, </em>any moldes for part of the purchase money of the said lots; but he paid the <em>whole purchase money to Rogers. </em>That he did make an estimate or account of sundry sums of money, showing what the said lots of ground stood him in, and he showed to <em>Henry W. Rogers, </em>Esq. counsel for the complainants, who called on this defendant, to inquire how this defendant held the said property, a rough paper containing such estimate of what said property and improvements cost him, but this defendant alleges, that he took no particular care of the said paper, and now cannot lay his hands upon it. That <em>Rogers </em>did obtain the benefit of the insolvent laws of this state; and that this defendant was appointed his trustee, for the benefit of <em>Rogers\u2019 </em>creditors. That he, as trustee, never did receive any property of any description belonging to the estate of <em>Rogers. </em>He refers to the insolvent proceedings filed by said <em>Rogers </em>in this court, which will show the amount of property delivered in the schedule of <em>Rogers </em>lor the benefit of his creditors. That <em>Rogers </em>did remain in one of said houses, on one of said lots, for sometime after this defendant had purchased the same, as the tenantofthis defendant;. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>and he, <em>Rogers, </em>failing to pay the rent thereof, this defendant levied a distress for such rent in arrear, and sold the goods of <em>Rogers, </em>for said rent in arrear, and was paid the same by the officer who executed the said distress. He denies all fraud and combination as set forth in the bill of complaint.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b206-4\">The answer of <em>Rogers </em>stated, that he entered into partnership with <em>Robert Henderson </em>about the year 1807 or 1808, and that they carried on the flour and mill business until the year 1811, when they failed in consequence of the failure of certain mercantile houses which were largely indebted to them. That he had been a stone mason by trade, and at the time of enter? ing into partnership was possessed of the two lots mentioned In the deeds mentioned in complainants\u2019 bill, and of nearly ten thousand dollars in cash, which were carried into the partnership funds. That at the time of entering into this partnership he supposed <em>Henderson </em>to be in flourishing circumstances, and clear of debt, but afterwards found that he was much incumbered with heavy debts contracted before the partnership was formed. That a few days after the failure of <em>Henderson 8? Rogers, </em>this defendant executed to <em>Nicholas Strike </em>the deeds No. 1 and No. 2,,exhibited by the complainants, in order to secure the property therein contained for the benefit of the creditors of <em>Henderson </em>&lt;$\u2022 <em>Rogers, </em>and of this defendant\u2019s own -creditors, &amp;c. in order to save the same from the creditors of <em>Henderson </em>before the partnership, and upon a special confidence and trust for these purposes, as well as to preserve the surplus, after payment of these debts, for this defendant and his family. That this was the understanding and agreement between this defendant and <em>Strike, </em>who did not pay, or agree to pay, any part of the money which was the nominal consideration of said deeds. That the said conveyances were not intended, or in any manner designed by the parties thereto, to operate as a sale of the property, or to become such in any \u25a0event, but only as a conveyance in trust for the purposes above mentioned. That this defendant, after the failure of the house, returned to his trade, giving up all concern or attention to the winding up of the affairs of the partnership, believing that these effects and his own would probably be sufficient for the payment of the debts; but being afterwards sued and pressed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>by the creditors, he was obliged in 1812 to apply for the benefit of the insolvent laws, when he obtained a release of his person, and <em>Strike </em>was appointed trustee for the benefit of his creditors, as being already in possession of the principal part of defendant\u2019s property. That defendant has not since prosecuted his application, in order to obtain a final discharge, being willing and desirous that all his just debts should be paid, and believing that the property was sufficient for the purpose; that in fact, the creditors are now all satisfied, as this defendant believes, except the complainants and <em>John Okely, </em>to whom a small balance is still due, and that the complainants received but a small payment on their debt, which amounts, as this defendant believes, to nearly $6000. That at the time when the deeds were made to <em>Strike, </em>the property conveyed by them was worth much more than the sum expressed as the consideration money in them, and that the complainants then offered to take them at the price of $4000; but that at present they are worth, as defendant believes, more than twice that sum. That at the time of executing the said deeds, the improvements on the lot, conveyed by deed, marked as complainants\u2019 exhibit No, 2, consisted of a good dwelling-house, in which this defend-, ant resided, and in which he continued to reside about eighteen months after the date of said conveyance, without any contract, agreement or understanding with <em>Strike, </em>or any demand or suggestion of paying rent for the occupation of the premises. That the improvements on the other lot, exhibit No. 1, consisted at the time of said conveyances, of two small frame dwelling-houses, occupied by tenants, and a cooper\u2019s shop, which was then unoccupied. That this defendant continued to receive the rents from the tenants of said two houses, for his own use, for more than eighteen months after the date of said conveyances to <em>Strike, </em>without any hindrance, demand or molestation from <em>Strike; </em>and that he, this defendant, constantly paid the ground rents, taxes, and all other dues incident to ownership on lot No. 2, during the time of his residence in the house thereon, and on No. 1, for a long space of time after-wards. That during this period, being desirous to engage in a more profitable employment, he borrowed of <em>Strike, </em>from time to time, about $1700, which he laid out in erecting a. furnace-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>on lot No. 1, which he carried on about two years and an half, in conjunction with <em>Henry MlJlrdle </em>and <em>Patrick Coulson, </em>to whom <em>Strike </em>granted a lease for ten years, at the rent of #80, which was only the amount of the ground rent payable on said lot, on which, besides, were the houses above mentioned; the one renting for #60, and the other for #48, per annum, which rents were received by this defendant. That about the time when the defendant was engaged in erecting said furnace, he was persuaded by <em>Strike </em>to give up the house on lot No. 2 to him, in order to remove into one more conveniently situated for his business in the furnace, being assured by him that the rent which he should receive from <em>Strike </em>would be sufficient to pay the rent of the house which he might take; that he accordingly surrendered his house to <em>Strike, </em>who has ever since, resided in it, and removed into one higher up the street; that before'he left his house, being then very much embarrassed in his affairs, he was persuaded by <em>Strike, </em>in order to save his household goods from executions by creditors, to consent to a colourable distress for .rent upon his effects, which was accordingly made, and \u00e1 fictitious sale of his goods had, under a warrant of distress, <em>Strike </em>advancing the money to a mutual friend, one <em>Patrick Coulson, </em>to purchase them in for the use of this defendant, and <em>Coulson </em>handing back the money to <em>Strike </em>after the apparent sale had taken place, while the goods remained all the time in the undisturbed possession of this defendant, who sold and disposed of them afterwards, at his pleasure, without any demand or claim by either <em>Coulson </em>or <em>Strike </em>against this defendant, or each other, on account of the transaction. That after <em>Strike </em>took possession of the house, he made various repairs and improvements on it, and about eighteen or nineteen months afterwards, he rendered an account to this defendant, charging him with the expenses of the same, amounting to about #500, and also with the money loaned to him for the building of the furnace, as well as certain other small sums, which he had from time to time lent to this defendant, amounting in the whole, as nearly as he can recollect, to about #3000; and then assured this defendant, as he had often done on other .occasions, that, on payment of the sums charged in this account, he would reconvey the whole property to him. That this ac\u00ab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>count, which he prays <em>Strike </em>may be compelled to produce, was made out in the handwriting of <em>Strike, </em>but without date; and that defendant signed it, and returned it to <em>Strike. </em>That this defendant afterwards, although the money expended on the house by <em>Strike </em>was entirely unauthorized by him, got the money, and tendered the amount of the account to <em>Strike, </em>urging him to reconvey the property to him, and that <em>Strike </em>turned away without receiving the money, or making any answer, and has ever since refused to reconvey the property to this defendant, although he has been informed, that he has admitted to others that he held the same in trust for this defendant and his family, and was willing to convey it to them on payment of the sum due to him from this defendant. This defendant further states, that at the time when he executed those deeds, neither he, nor the house of <em>Henderson </em>4' <em>Rogers, </em>owed any thing to <em>Strike; </em>and that the said conveyances were not; made in contemplation of future advances of money from <em>Strike, </em>although he afterwards received advances from him; but that tlie said conveyances were entirely voluntary, and without consideration, and for the uses and trusts above mentioned; and in order that the same may be applied to the payment of his just debts, and those of the firm, contracted after he entered the house, he consents that the said property be sold, and the proceeds applied under the direction of this court, to the payment of his just debts, reserving the surplus to this defendant and his family, and submitting to such decree as the court may make in the premises. The general replication was entered, and directions given for issuing commissions to take testimony, and such commissions accordingly issued. On motion of the complainants\u2019 counsel leave was given to examine <em>John Rogers, </em>one of the defendants, saving all exceptions. The testimony taken was very voluminous; and related to the consideration in the deeds from <em>Rogers </em>to <em>Strike; </em>the declarations of <em>Rogers, </em>and of <em>Strike; </em>the value of the property; the amount of the rents and profits, and the manner in which the distress of <em>Rogers\u2019s </em>property for rent was conducted, &amp;e.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-5\"><em>John Rogers, </em>(one of the defendants, but whose examination \u2022as a witness was excepted to by the defendant <em>Strike,) </em>deposed, that he was a partner in the house of <em>Henderson </em>4' <em>Rogers </em>at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>time of their failure in 1811. That he executed the deed's to , <em>Strike, </em>to prevent the property therein mentioned being made liable to the debts of <em>Henderson. </em>That there was some of the property of <em>Henderson </em>4\" <em>Rogers, </em>seized for the private debt\u00ae of <em>Henderson, </em>Contracted before the co-partnership of <em>Henderson </em>-4\u2019 <em>Rogers, </em>by <em>Charles G-winn </em>and others. That he did apply to <em>Alexander Irvine </em>and <em>Frederick Johnson </em>to suffer him to execute deeds to them for the same property, to prevent the-property being seized for the debts of <em>Henderson fy Rogers', </em>Mr. <em>Irvine </em>refused, and Mr. <em>Johnson </em>was in <em>Bucks </em>county, <em>(Pa.) </em>and not convenient. He did execute deeds to <em>Johnson, </em>but he did not come-in time and' never received them. That it was expressly understood between this deponent and <em>Strike, </em>that the deeds were executed to <em>Strike </em>for this deponent\u2019s own benefit, and that <em>Strike </em>acted as the deponent\u2019s friend, to protect the-property for' this deponent\u2019s use, from the debts of <em>Henderson, </em>contracted before the partnership of <em>Henderson </em>4' <em>Rogers. </em>That there was no. money paid by <em>Strike </em>to this deponent for said property until a considerable time after, say eleven, months; the property was never sold to said <em>Strike </em>to be kept as- his own property. That <em>Strike </em>did for some time after-the execution of said deeds, loan occasionally sums of money to this deponent, but it was-considered: by this deponent, as lent money to be returned; but does not know how <em>Strike </em>considered it. That <em>Strike </em>did in presence of <em>Strike\u2019s </em>brother-in-law and wife, and one of his sons, promise <em>to convey </em>the property to this deponent in six months or six years, upon, payment of the sums he- <em>(Strike,) </em>alleged to be borrowed from-him by this deponent; and this deponent did inform Mr. <em>Irvine </em>of the transactions. That he remained better than eighteen- months in the house in whioh <em>Strike </em>now resides, after the-date of said deeds; this-deponent never paid <em>Strike </em>rent in his life. That this deponent was induced by <em>Strike </em>to suffer a distress to\" be laid on his furniture in <em>Strike\u2019s </em>name, that the same-might be bought in for his <em>(Rogers\u2019s) </em>use, and prevent it being taken by his other creditors. That the said furniture was all bought by <em>P. Coulson, </em>for the deponent, except the candlesticks and carpet by <em>Wolfenden, </em>for this deponent\u2019s use; and all were.sent to this-deponent\u2019s house; this deponent did procure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number><em>CottIson </em>to purchase them, by the advice of <em>Strike. </em>That <em>Strike </em>did advance the money to pay for said furniture; this deponent had not at that time five dollars in the world. That the said goods were immediately carried from said dwelling-house, when sold, to the house rented by this deponent in. <em>Whiskey-alley, </em>after his removal from <em>Pratt-street. </em>That <em>Strike </em>advised him to remove to <em>Whiskey-alley </em>because the house was cheaper, and nearer his furnace and his business; and he thought it good advice at that time. That <em>Strike, </em>a considerable time after the date of said deeds, made out an account of the monies borrowed by deponent from <em>Strike </em>since the date of said deeds, including @500 for repairs of said house, and this deponent signed the same at his request, as an evidence that this deponent owed <em>Strike </em>that amount. That one of the charges in said account was @500 for repairs to the dwelling-house in <em>Pratt-street. </em>That this deponent received from <em>Falls </em>d' <em>Brown, </em>two bonds of Dr. <em>Harsnip </em>and <em>Shipley, </em>in payment of a debt due to this deponent individually from said Dr. <em>Falls </em>for building a mill; and this deponent delivered said bonds to <em>Strike, </em>as <em>his trustee, </em>under the application for the act of insolvency. That <em>Strike </em>did return the two bonds of <em>Harsnip </em>\u00ab\u00a7&gt; <em>Shipley </em>to this deponent, upon this deponent paying <em>Strike </em>the money he had paid to Colonel <em>Small. </em>That the debt due by this deponent to Colonel <em>Small, </em>was for lumber to repair the dwelling-house in <em>Pratt-street, </em>purchased before the date of said deeds <em>to Strike; </em>and said lumber was in the house, and af the furnace, when <em>Strike </em>went to reside at the house in Pratt-street. That the said bonds of <em>Harsnip \u00a7\u25a0 Shipley </em>were put into the hands of <em>J. Oakley </em>and <em>Wra. M\u2018Donald, </em>this deponent\u2019s creditors, to satisfy them part of their debts, and also a debt due <em>Nixon Wilson. </em>That this deponent does not know the amount due <em>John Oakely. </em>That this deponent was interested one-third in the lease from <em>Strike </em>to <em>Coulson </em>and <em>MlJtrdle, </em>and <em>Strike </em>knew this deponent was so interested. The house in <em>Whiskey-alley </em>was not leased with the furnace lot. That this deponent received the rents of the houses in <em>Whiskey-alley </em>for nearly two years after the date of the deeds to <em>Strike.; </em>he never paid said rents to <em>Strike, </em>nor did <em>Strike. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>ever ask deponent for them; <em>Strike </em>knew this deponent received said rents,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b212-5\">He was then examined upon cross interrogatories on behalf of the defendant <em>Strike, </em>and answers: That there were about 2000 bushels of wheat, and about 1100 barrels of flour, seized by <em>Charles Gwinn </em>and others, for the private debts of <em>Henderson; </em>this was in the year 1811. That the property was conveyed to <em>Strike </em>for the use of this deponent and wife, and this deponent\u2019s private creditors. That he does not know how much money he received from <em>Strike, </em>or when, but the paper which this deponent signed for <em>Strike </em>is correct, except the $500 for repairs. That the said money was received, a triflle before, and the remainder after this deponent\u2019s application for the benefit of the insolvent law; this deponent does not recollect how much money he received from <em>Strike. </em>It was about eighteen months after the date of the deeds to <em>Strike, that Strike </em>offered to r.econvey said property to this deponent. That he never was to pay <em>Strike </em>any thing for rent of said liouse in <em>Pratt-street. </em>That <em>Strike </em>advanced to him 300 and some odd dollars, which was paid by this deponent to <em>Coulsonf </em>and by <em>Coulsoh </em>to <em>Carroll </em>the constable; the sales of said furniture were upwards of $300; the furniture was all, except one candlestick, sent <em>to </em>this deponent\u2019s house in Whiskey-alley; said sale was made at his house in <em>Pratt-street; </em>the said furniture was seized by <em>Strike </em>under pretence of house rent due <em>Strike, </em>and to. prevent other creditors from seizing it. <em>A. Carroll </em>levied said distress, and sold the property to the highest bidder at public auction; <em>Strike </em>was present a few minutes at the sale, and then gave this deponent the money which was paid to <em>Carroll. </em>He did receive back from <em>Strike </em>the bonds before mentioned, upon this defendant\u2019s paying <em>Strike </em>between fifty and sixty dollars, which <em>Strike </em>had paid Colonel <em>Small; </em>be thinks about $800 due when <em>Strike </em>returned him said bonds; this deponent called a meeting of his creditors at <em>Barney\u2019s </em>tavern, and gave said bonds, and his gold repeating watch, to <em>John Oakely, William MiDonald' </em>and <em>Nixon Wilson; </em>he received no money on said bonds, after he received them from <em>Strike, </em>and before he gave them to <em>Oakely, M\u2018Bonald </em>and <em>Wilson, </em>That he neyer did put the bonds of <em>Harsnip </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number><em>Sutherland </em>in the hands of <em>Strike; </em>he thinks <em>Sutherland </em>was a surety on <em>Harsnip\u2019s, </em>but there were only two bonds which were the bonds of <em>Harsnip </em>and <em>Shipley. </em>That he pledged all his property to <em>M\u2018Donald, </em>to help to carry on this law suit against <em>Strike, </em>and to be his friend; <em>MlDonald </em>promising to deliver back the property to this deponent after the suit was gained, and he <em>(McDonald) </em>paid what money this deponent owes him; this deponent is to pay <em>M\u2018Donald </em>whatever money he may advance on the law suit, and what this deponent owes <em>M\u2018Donald, </em>if the property is recovered from <em>Strike; </em>that <em>M\u2018Donald </em>is to be first paid, and the balance of property to be returned to this deponent. This deponent held 400 acres in <em>Virginia, </em>which was willed to this deponent by <em>F. Maguire, </em>and he verbally conveyed his right to said land to <em>M\u2018Donald, </em>until this suit be over; this deponent corrects-himself by saying the land was willed to his son, <em>John Rogers, </em>Junior; <em>M\u2018Donald </em>had lent this deponent (he thinks,) about $400, but paid him no money on this land; this deponent verbally conveyed the said land in <em>Virginia </em>to <em>McDonald </em>about four months ago; when this suit is ended this deponent is to receive back said land, and all his property, upon <em>M\u2018Donald\u2019s </em>being satisfied. He mortgaged said land to <em>John Brady </em>for the purpose of finishing <em>L. Martin\u2019s </em>building, but returned said <em>Brady </em>his money, which money <em>McDonald </em>gave this deponent to return to <em>Brady. </em>Said mortgage was executed before his verbal conveyance to <em>M'-Donald. </em>He lent <em>F. Maguire </em>$700 on Thursday evening, he died the Saturday following, and his wife took her oath before the county and orphan\u2019s court, that he had no friend in <em>Baltimore </em>but this deponent; and for the money this deponent lent <em>Maguire, </em>he, by his dying words, gave his land on <em>Potomac </em>to <em>John Rogers, </em>Jun\u2019r. this deponent\u2019s son; and <em>Priestman </em>and <em>Whalen </em>and the widow, executors, made a deed for said lands to <em>John Rogers, </em>Jr. He lent the money to <em>Maguire </em>he thinks about two and a half years ago. This deponent promised to put in <em>M\u2018Donald\u2019s </em>hands the debts due this deponent from <em>F. Price, L. Martin </em>and <em>Hugh Neilson, </em>which debts were for work done since his application for said laws. This deponent never had a final discharge, but took a stay for his body. That he owes <em>F. </em>John<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number><em>son </em>nothing, but thinks if their accounts were settled he would owe deponent something. They have never settled their accounts. This dejonsnt was not a party in the lease from <em>Strike </em>to <em>Coulson </em>and JPJlrdle; the lease was made to <em>Coulson, M'&amp;rdlt </em>and <em>John Rogers, </em>Jr. to prevent the creditors from getting at the property. That he told <em>Strike </em>he had received the rents fqr the houses in <em>Whiskey-alley. </em>That <em>Strike </em>lent him no money at or-before the time of the execution of the deeds; the money wa3 lent in the years 1814 or 1815 as deponent thinks. That he promised continually to return the property to deponent, but the time before mentioned by him, was the last. That <em>Strike </em>had lent him nothing at the time of the execution of the .deeds, but he promised deponent frequently afterwards to return him his property, upon payment of what deponent owed him. That <em>Strike </em>did cut down the trees in <em>Whiskey-alley, </em>and one before the door in <em>Prut \u00bf-street;, </em>deponent complained, and <em>Strike </em>promised tp satisfy him for the injury, if any. That <em>M\u2018Donald </em>frequently told deponent that his watch was safe \u25a0enough; deponent thinks that <em>MlDonald </em>would return it if asked, but he was never asked for it. That his eon <em>John\\s between </em>fourteen and fifteen years of age. Thai a few days ago, ,\u00aen the morning qf his long examination, <em>Strike </em>took him <em>to </em>the tavern at the corner of <em>St. Paul\u2019s-lane </em>and <em>Chat ham-street, </em>and. treated him with-liquor; he proposed to deponent to come before the commissioner and- say that he, <em>Strike, </em>had lent the -deponent #3500, and his, <em>Strike\u2019s, </em>house should never be shut against him, <em>Rogers, </em>and he would settle the balance with him ft some other time. That it was the morning of his examination, and just before he delivered his testimony. That he certainly means the money which <em>Donald </em>gives to himself, or his attorneys, in carrying on th\u00e9 law suit, and for the support \u00aef his family. That the said sum of #700 was part of the profits of his furnace, and not lent him by <em>Strike. </em>He put in $1880 in the concern with <em>Coulson </em>and <em>MiJirdle, </em>in the furnace built upon one of the lots now in dispute; that this was in J814 or 1815, as he thinks; that some of this money was lent-by <em>Strike, </em>and some received from <em>Hugh Neilson, Ennion Williams </em>and <em>Frederick Price, </em>for work done for them, which was collected by him from the above persons in 1814 or 1S15, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>for work done by him before that time. That he thinks he became concerned in said iurnace in the year 1814 or 1815, with <em>P. Coulson </em>and <em>MdQrdle- </em>that upon reference to the lease he finds he was mistaken, and that his concern in the furnace commenced in 1812; that he does not recollect what sum of money he employed in said furnace from time to time, that he only put $1880 in the same concern, altogether, as his whole capital; that the concern existed eighteen months or two years. That he rented the upper rooms of the house in <em>Praft-street </em>to Mrs. <em>Ramsay, </em>after the conveyance to <em>Strike, </em>at five dollars per month; that he thinks Mrs. <em>Ramsay </em>resided about two years is-the house; that he never rented any part of the house in Pratt-<em>street </em>to any body until after the conveyance to <em>Strike. </em>That his son, <em>John Rogers, jr. </em>resides in the city of <em>Baltimore, </em>and never was in <em>Virginia </em>to deponent\u2019s knowledge. That he did not apply to <em>Strike, </em>or press him, to consent to withdraw\" the present case out of court, and did not suppose. <em>Strike </em>would speak to him; that he told <em>Strike </em>he would soon have it settled by two honest men, as the law suit was expensive to him and his children, and kept him from his trade; that he never said his lawyers were trying to get the money into their hands, and that deponent would never get any part of it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b215-5\">The defendant <em>Strike, </em>exhibited' his lease to <em>Coulson </em>and <em>M\u2018dlrdle, </em>dated the 6th of October 1812, for a parcel of ground in <em>Baltimore, </em>for 10 years, at the annual rent of $80.

This defendant admits he was appointed trustee for the benefit of the creditors of <em>Rogers, </em>and that <em>Rogers, </em>in pursuance of the said insolvent laws, made and executed a deed to this defendant, which is also-of record in this court. That this defendant-at the instance of <em>Henry Rogers, </em>Esquire, attorney at law, instituted suit in Baltimore.county court against <em>Penelope Price, </em>late widow of <em>Frederick Price, </em>one of the debtors of <em>Rogers, </em>the insolvent debtor aforesaid, and contained in his said schedule, the cause of action whereof had been before, as this defendant hath been informed, placed by <em>John Rogers </em>in the hands of the said <em>Henry Rogers </em>for collection. That <em>Greetham 8\u00a1- Devereayx, </em>other debtors of <em>Rogers, </em>and mention<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>ed in his schedule, were insolvent debtors, and evidently not' solvent at the time of this defendant\u2019s appointment as trustee aforesaid. He hath no knowledge of any claims or debts due to <em>Rogers </em>than are contained in his said schedule, except as hereinafter mentioned, if such may or can be deemed belonging to <em>Rogers </em>at the time of said insolvency. That <em>Rogers, </em>before his application for the said insolvent laws, conveyed to the defendant, for the consideration mentioned in the deeds, the lots of ground therein mentioned; and this defendant deuies that the said deeds were made to him by <em>Rogers, </em>in trust for <em>Rogers\u2019s </em>benefit,or to defraud <em>Rogers\u2019s </em>creditors; but this defendant saith, that he paid to <em>Rogers </em>the full consideration expressed in said deeds for said property. He admits that the complainants have, filed their bill in equity in this court against this defendant and <em>Rogers, </em>and that a commission has issued to take evidence, and has not yet been returned; but he denies that the testimony taken under said commission does establish the fraud and want \u00a9f consideration as set forth in the complainants\u2019 bill. He denies that he ever procured himself to be appointed trustee for <em>Rogers, </em>by fraudulent collusion, as set forth in the bill. He was appointed trustee without any solicitation on his part, and did not know of said appointment until it was made. That at ter he was so appointed trustee he was about to take the possession of the property mentioned in the schedule of <em>Rogers. </em>He found that the property being household furniture was claimed by the landlord of the said house, wherein the said furniture then was, to a larger amount than the said property was worth, and that the said claim of said landlord was for house rent in arrear. That long before <em>Rogers </em>applied for the benefit of the said insolvent laws, he placed in this defendant\u2019s hands, then a constable of <em>Baltimore </em>county, for collection, two bonds of a certain <em>Ilarsnip \u00a7 Sutherland, </em>the amount whereof he cannot precisely recollect, but which he believes are now in the possession of <em>Wm. McDonald, </em>or the same has been . collected or recovered by him. That <em>Rogers </em>had created liens on the said two bonds then uncollectedj so held by the defendant, one in favour of <em>(Villiam Mi Mechen, </em>Esquire, for $120, the other in favour of <em>Jacob Small </em>for $80; and this defendant, long before his said appointment as trustee, received no<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>tice of said liens, and was directed to hold the said sums of money for the said <em>Mi Mechen </em>and Small, <em>by </em>them, with <em>Rogers\u2019s </em>consent. That after his said appointment as trustee he received a note in writing from <em>MsMechen, </em>desiring him to deliver the said bonds to Mrs. <em>Rogers, </em>wife of <em>Rogers, </em>as he had taken <em>Rogers\u2019s </em>note for the debt due him from <em>Rogers; </em>and Mrs. <em>Rogers </em>having paid this defendant the sum of $80, the amount of <em>Small\u2019s </em>lien, he delivered up the said two bonds to Mrs. <em>Rogers, </em>under the impression and belief that he, as trustee, had no right to retain the said bonds, because they were not mentioned in the schedule filed by <em>Rogers </em>with his petition fertile benefit of the said insolvent law, and were claimed as aforesaid. That Rogers, having received the said two bonds last mentioned from his wife, as this defendant is informed and believes, deposited the same with a certain <em>Robert R. Richardson, </em>in pledge, or to have the same discounted. That <em>Nixon Wilson, </em>a creditor of <em>Rogers, </em>issued an attachment against <em>Rogers </em>to affect the said bonds in the hands of <em>Richardson. </em>That the said bonds were-delivered to <em>Wilson </em>by <em>Richardson </em>with the consent of <em>Rogers. </em>That <em>William M(Donald </em>afterwards applied to <em>Wilson </em>for said notes, which were delivered by <em>Wilson </em>to <em>M\u2018Donald </em>who now holds the same. That he never \u2022 received any part of the said two bonds, nor hath he received any money or property of any description from the estate and effects of <em>Rogers </em>since his appointment as trustee aforesaid, or before his said appointment as trustee, belonging or which ever belonged to <em>Rogers\u2019s </em>creditors which he ought to account for under his trust. He denies that he bath been guilty of any fraud or neglect as trustee of <em>Rogers. </em>He denies that <em>Rogers </em>handed to him any evidences of debts due to him, or accounts due to him, or any .other property, real, personal or mixed, than is mentioned in his said schedule, nor did this defendant receive an account or voucher for the debts due <em>Rogers </em>mentioned in his schedule. He hath not received any of the debts due <em>Rogers, </em>mentioned in his schedule aforesaid. He <em>hath </em>no knowledge of any claims or debts due <em>Rogers </em>more than are contained in his said schedule, except-the two last mentioned bonds, and that in the manner herein before stated.

Murray, </em>solicitors for complainants, the sum of $690, as complete fees for conduct of the case, subject to the usual exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-5\">On the 6th of April 1824, the auditor made his report, stating that he has examined the proceedings in this cause, and from them has stated the claims against the late firm of <em>Henderson </em>and <em>Rogers, </em>and <em>John Rogers, </em>and also the within account: between the estate of <em>John Rogers, </em>and the trustees; that from the papers in this cause, it appears that the complainants have received the sum of <em>$549 </em>10, the amount of two bonds due to <em>Rogers, </em>but that there is no evidence to show that they are entitled to retain the same to their exclusive benefit, except the amount of $476 13, a part thereof having been by them paid in discharge of a lien upon the said bonds, and the balance in securing the same. The auditor has therefore credited the estate with the whole sum thus received by them, with interest thereon, and has stated the sum then paid them as preferred claims, in order that they may account with the trustees for the difference in receiving their dividend. The auditor also reports, that in stating the said account, he has credited it with the proceeds of the sale; and that he has in the first instance applied the proceeds of the said estate to the allowance to the trustees, the costs in this court, the preferred claims of the complainants before mentioned, and the allowance of' their solicitors, and that he has distributed the balance <em>pro rata, </em>amongst the creditors. The auditor also reports, that in stating the said claims and accounts, he has not noticed the claims of the defendant <em>Strike, </em>because the whole of them appear to have proceeded from, and to have grown out of the first fraud between <em>Strike </em>and <em>Rogers, </em>and are not therefore entitled either to a preference or dividend.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-6\">The complainants excepted to the report of the auditor, 1st Because there is no evidence sufficient in law to support the. various claims stated in said account, except the complainants\u2019 claim, filed or exhibited in the cause. <em>2d. </em>Because the said claims, or the greater part of them, have been paid and satisfied \u2014 your exceptants particularly charge that the following claims, reported by the auditor, have been fully satisfied, viz. &amp;c. and others which the exceotants will be prepared to prove as this court may direct. 3. Because the whole of said claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>are barred by the act of limitations, which your exceptants plead and rely on in bar of said claims. 4. Because from the laches \u2022and neglect of the several parties named in said account and report as creditors, to prosecute their several claims, they are not entitled to the aid of this court, or to come in for a proportion of said funds; and have not applied to be let in for such distribution. 5. Because said report and account are not in conformity with the evidence in the cause, or warranted by the principles of equity, and are in other respects erroneous.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b222-5\">The defendant, <em>Strike, </em>excepted to the report of the auditor \u2014 1. Because the auditor hath not stated the claim of the said <em>Strike </em>which is filed in the said cause, and the evidence which shows the veracity of the said claim sufficiently proved therein. <em>2. </em>Because the auditor in his report hath mistaken both- the law and the fact relating to the said claim, of the defendant <em>Nicholas Strike.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b222-6\">On the 17th of May 1825, the auditor made another report, in which he stated, that since the 13th February 1824, when he stated an account between the estate of <em>John Rogers </em>and <em>Hen.ry W. Rogers </em>and <em>Samuel Moale, Esq\u2019rs. </em>trustees of the said <em>John Rogers, </em>and made a statement of the claims against said <em>John Rogers, </em>(which said account and statement are filed in this court,) the complainants in this case have filed additional claims against said <em>Rogers, </em>which are herewith stated. And the auditor further reports, that the claims of, <em>Hollingsworth Worthingion, </em>and <em>Irvine \u00a7 Beatty, </em>contained in the aforegoing statement, have been withdrawn; and.that, except the schedule of <em>John Rogers, </em>there is no proof to establish any of the claims contained therein, but the claims of the complainants and of <em>Robert Taylor. </em>That the claim of th\u00e9 said <em>Taylor </em>is for a judgment rendered against <em>Robert Henderson, </em>the former partner of <em>Rogsrs, </em>at October term 1812, of <em>Baltimore </em>county court, on a joint action with <em>Rogers, </em>which said judgment was revived against <em>Henderson </em>at March term <em>1821. </em>The auditor further reports, that he has herewith made a statement of the rents received by <em>Strike, </em>and the sums expended in repairs done on the property in this cause mentioned, and in payment of'taxes and ground rents thereon, so far as he could collect the same from the papers in the cause. And further, that although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>he gave notice to the counsel of the complainants and defendants, to produce any further testimony which they might have, no additional testimony has been produced.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-5\">The defendant, <em>Strike, </em>excepted to the last mentioned report of the auditor \u2014 1st.

For that the said report and statement is erroneous and defective in point of law and fact; wherefore the said defendant, <em>Strike, </em>begs leave to except to the same, and that the said report and statement may not be confirmed by this court, but that the same may bo remanded to the said auditor, or set asido and annulled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-8\">The complainants excepted to the said report \u2014 1st.

That the said auditor hath reported the claims of <em>Strike </em>for repairs done to said property, although <em>Strike </em>has refused to produce the bills of the persons who did the repairs, and has relied upon the conjectures of said persons as to their probable Value after a long lapse of time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-12\">5th. These complainants further except to the claim hitherto audited in the first report in favour of the <em>Mechanics Bank-of Baltimore, </em>because the same is barred by the statute of li<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>\u2018nutations, the said claimants having laid by, without making any demand, until these complainants, believing themselves the sole creditors, had, by their own exertions, and at their <em>sole </em>and great expense, succeeded in setting aside the deeds in this cause mentioned, when they have first presented their demand.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-5\">6th. For that ihe said report and statement is erroneous and defective in point of law and fact; wherefore the said complainants beg leave to except to the same, and pray that the report and statement may not be confirmed by this court, but that the same may be remanded to the said auditor, or set aside and annulled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-6\">The cause and proceedings were afterwards transmitted to the court of chancery under the act of <em>1824, ch. 196.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-7\">The cause was then set down for argument, and was argued*</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-8\">Bland, Chancellor, (10th of April 1826 ) This case has been very elaborately argued, and is now presented to the court for the purpose of being finally closed. It appears to have been warmly contested in every stage. It has been partly decided, but -there yet remains much to be judicially considered and determined.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-9\">. There is no principle in relation to the administration of justice, which it is more important to preserve, or more necessary to adhere to than, that there must somewhere be -an end to litigation. A -matter which has been once solemnly decided, ought not, nor cannot be reheard and readjudicated; controversy must have an end, or society could have no peace. Errors of an inferior tribunal may be corrected by a superior; and even the same court,under certain circumstances, will correct its own mistakes by motion, petition, or bill of review. \u2022 But no court of justice can allow itself to be engaged in the endless task of weaving and unweaving; of progressing to an adjudication, and then going back to readjudicate. Hence, whatever has been heretofore determined in this cause must now be considered as finally settled, and in every respect unalterable, except by bill of review, appeal, or in the regular course of law. This does \u2022not seem to have been directly controverted in the argument; but the counsel differ widely as to the nature of the decree of March, 1822 \u2014 and as to how far it extends over the matter of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>this suit; and some arguments have been urged which, if yielded to, might lead the court unwarily to trench upon the confines of that decree.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-5\">The first inquiry, therefore is, how much of this case yet remains to be judicially passed upon. This case was originated on the equity side of <em>Baltimore </em>county court, and has been removed into this court according to the act of assembly authorising such removals. It stands here now as it would have stood had it continued there, or as if it had been begun and instituted here, and these proceedings are to be so considered. They have not been affected by any mere circumstance of place or tribunal, but are here as if they had all passed under, and been sanctioned by the judicial authority of the present chancellor, and will be so treated accordingly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-6\">The complainants come into court as the creditors of <em>Henderson &lt;</em>\u00a7 <em>Rogers, </em>of both and each of them. These plaintiffs complain that their debt, has not been paid; and they are here seeking payment. To enable this tribunal io give them the relief they ask; and which cannot be obtained without the aid of its peculiar powers; they point to certain property which they allege was once confessedly, and ought now in reality to be within their legal reach and subject to the payment of their .claim. They allege, that this property which was at one time held by, and in the name of their debtor, <em>Rogers, </em>has been and is now iniquitously covered up and withdrawn from their grasp, by certain deeds of conveyance made by their debtor, <em>Rogers\u00bf </em>to a certain <em>Nicholas Strike; </em>they pray that this cover, and these impediments, may be removed; that the property maybe sold; that the rents and profits of it may be accounted for; and that the proceeds may be applied in satisfaction of their claim. These plaintiffs then call on <em>Rogers </em>and Strike, as defendants, to meet and repel these allegations if they can.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-7\"><em>Rogers </em>appears, and admits that he is the debtor of the plaintiffs, and admits that he conveyed the property in question to <em>Strike, </em>but denies that it was done with any fraudulent design; on the contrary he avers, that those conveyances to <em>Strike </em>were made by him in trust for, and the better to secure the payment of all his just debts. <em>Strike </em>comes in and boldly takes his stand in direct and total opposition to the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>tiffs. He avers and undertakes to maintain and prove, that he acquired the property in question for a full and valuable consideration, and that he has a right to claim protection here, as a fair and <em>bona fide </em>purchaser. He plants himself upon the honesty of his title, and claims nothing by his answer which should not be conceded to a defendant who fully sustains such a defence as he-has set forth.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b226-5\">In application to this claim and defence, proofs have been collected, and the case has been submitted to the decision of a competent tribunal, who in March 1822, declared and decreed, that the conveyances from <em>Rogers </em>to <em>Strike </em>were \u201cnull and void as against the complainants;\u201d that the property in question should be sold; that the proceeds be brought in \u201cto be applied under the court\u2019s direction,\u201d and concluding with a declaration, \u201cthat-all equities as to the distribution of the proceeds of sale are reserved by the court for hearing,\u201d on their being brought in. <em>Jones v </em>Slubey, 5 <em>Harr. 8? Johns. '383.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b226-6\">It is held to be a first principle, by every court of justice, that no one can ask for its determination without showing a sufficient ground for its decision. Before a plaintiff can call for a determination in his favour, he must furnish the court with a basis whereon, to rest its judgment. In this case, the validity and sufficiency of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, are the very foundations of the decree; without that claim having been proved or admitted, no such decree ought or could have been rightfully made. It does, therefore, necessarily and conclusively establish the plaintiff\u2019s claim; and consequently, that claim cannot now, in this stage of this cause, be again in any manner put in controversy. This is the first point settled by this decree.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b226-7\">The decree then proceeds to remove obstructions, and to grant facilities. The deeds which were the impediments complained of, ar\u00e9 declared to be' null and void; or, in other words, as between the plaintiffs and defendants, they are totally annihilated. Whatever validity or operation they may be permitted to have, as between <em>Rogers </em>and <em>Strike, </em>they can have none at all \u201cas against the complainants.\u201d In relation to them, this property ' is to be dealt with as if those deeds had never existed. This is the second point settled by this-decree.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b226-8\">But it would have cpme to a most lame and impotent con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>elusion had it stopped here; therefore, after having determined that the plaintiffs had a claim, which ought to be satisfied, and that they had a right to have recourse to this property, it goes on to declare, that the property shall be sold, and the proceeds brought in to be paid over as the court should ditect. And this is the third point settled by this decree. So far then the matters in controversy between these parties have been finally closed; and. this decree must be regarded, as all others of a similar nature have been, as a final- decree; one in which all the material rights of the parties have been considered and adjudicated upon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-5\">But the decre\u00e9 speaks of further directions, and of equities reserved; and it has omitted to say any thing of certain incidents to those rights which it had finally settled. As to all these particulars this decree yet remains to be fulfilled and' executed. When a case circumstanced like this, is brought before the court, it is spoken of as a case for further directions; and this phrase is used in reference to all cases, where after the final decree, as in this instance, a iurther and eventual interposition of the court becomes necessary, to follow out and complete the equity, the substance of which has been established by the final decree. These further directions are spoken of in, this decree, and in all similar decrees of this court, and of the <em>English </em>court of chancery; but in giving them, the court must act consistently with itself; and in this instance, where the decree speaks of \u201cthe court\u2019s directions,\u201d and of all equities being reserved, its phraseology must be made compatible in all its parts. The reservation of all equities must not be used to fritter away, and to abnegate the substance of any matter, which had been in a previous part of the decree carefully and solemnly decided. No directions, therefore, will or can now be given, which are incompatible with the points settled by the decree. It is now brought before the court to be executed and completed, not in any manner to be revised or impaired. <em>The Santa Maria, </em>10 <em>Wheat. </em>442.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-6\">The decree of March 1822, is predicated upon the existence of a debt due to the plaintiffs; but it does not specify the exact amount, nor does it say any thing of the interest thereon. Intel est in equity is held to'be something more than a mere inch-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>dent; it is the production, the fruit of the money due. In this ease these creditors may now call for directions as to these particulars. An exact estimate of their claim could not with propriety have been made until after the sale of the property decreed to be liable for its payment; because according to the course of the court in such cases as this, where the proceeds are insufficient to pay all, the interest is to be calculated only up to the day of sale. This then is the first point left open by this decree; but it is a matter which is reducible to precision and certainty by the calculation of the auditor, to be made according to established principles, from the proofs in the cause; any further special directions in this instance, therefore, are deemed wholly unnecessary.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-5\">In this case, the bill expressly prays, that the defendants may be ordered to account for the rents and profits of the property in question. The decree has determined, that it was unlawfully detained, by declaring the deeds under which it was held, null and void. It follows therefore, as a consequence of this decision, that an account of the rents and profits should now be ordered, and that directions' should be given, as to the time for which the account is to be taken, and as to the manner of taking it. This is the second point left open- by this decree; and, as to which the chancellor will now give directions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-6\">\u2019The decree totally annuls the deeds under which <em>Strike </em>claims, without retaining them as a security for any thing. He can now therefore, claim nothing whatever under them .as against the complainants. But, if under all the circumstances of this case, apart from those deeds, and compatibly \u2022 with the matters decided by the decree, he can show any equitable claim to an allowance for improvements he put upon the property in question, while it remained in his possession or under his control, the court may now give directions concerning such an allowance. This is the third point left open by the decree, and upon which the chancellor will now decide.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-7\">This is one of those cases in which one creditor is allowed to file a bill for the purpose of subjecting the property of his debtor to the payment of his own claim; and of all others who may obtain permission to come in and participate in the burthens \u2019and the benefits. The other creditors are allowed to come in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>at. anytime, either before or after the decree; and it is most usual and proper that the decree itself should command the trustee to give notice, at the time of advertising the property for sale, to all creditors to bring in their claims with the vouchers. This is the fourth point which has been left open in this, as in all other decrees of the kind. The further directions as to claims which may be thus brought in, comprehends every thing concerning them. As to all matters of this nature, so far as may be deemed necessary in this case, the chancellor will now give directions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b229-5\">It is said to be an established rule of the <em>Roman </em>law, and that of almost all modern nations, that the true proprietor shall not recover from the <em>bona fide </em>possessor, any rents and profits which have been consumed by him. But whatever fruits and profits, whether natural or industrial, such as trees standing or felled, grain growing, and the like, which remain upon the land at the time the true proprietor established his right, belong to him, and may be recovered from such possessor, as well as the land itself. Yet, as it would seem, if it can be ascertained, that the <em>bona fide </em>possessor was not merely maintained by the rents and profits, but was actually enriched by them, as by ap-' plying them to the payment of his debts, he will be held accountable to that amount to the rightful proprietor. But this general exemption is not granted to him, who, knowingly, keeps possession of another\u2019s estate, and therefore he is compellable to account for all the mesne profits he has derived from the land prior to its being recovered from him. <em>Prin. Eq. </em>411, 420. <em>Just. Inst. </em>1. 2, tit. 1, <em>s. </em>35.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b229-6\">According to the common law of <em>England, </em>the real owner may recover the rents and profits from the tenant, whether they remain upon the land or have been consumed by him or not; nor does the occupying tenant\u2019s knowing any thing of his ad.~ Yersary\u2019s title make any difference, as to the nature and extent of his liability for rents and'profits. At common law no damages were recovered in any real action; because, as it was said, until 4he right to the land was determined, the party could not be said to suffer any wrong. But it seems to have been considered as well established law from a very remote period, that the right to maintain an action of trespass for the recovery of th\u00e9 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>mesne profits, followed as a clear and necessary consequence of the party\u2019s having established his right to the land itself. And it appears to be somewhat singular, that during the period when real actions were much in use, the legislature should have deemed it necessary to interpose, for the purpose of allowing by positive provision, the demandant in many of them to recover damages or rents and profits, and yet that those real actions so amended and improved, should have been superseded by the action of ejectment, in which as it now seems to be settled, nothing is recovered but the land, and the party is left, as at common law, to recover the mesne profits in a separate action of trespass. But the right to recover the mesne profits by way-of damages in the modern action of ejectment itself, is recognized by an <em>English </em>statute passed in the year 1664, and the practice of so recovering- them, seems to have pre'vailed for some time in <em>England </em>and also in this state. <em>2 Bac.

And it is now settled, that where there is a serious difficulty of recovering at law, fraud, concealment or the like, or where the title is merely equitable, the party may recover the rents and profits in equity. But in chancery, as in the courts of common law, there seems to have been always a strong disposition to keep the adjudication upon the title entirely apart from the direction as to the mesne profits. It is not.improper that the final decree, settling the right to the property, .should also go on and decree an account for the rents and profits, but it is usual, where the property is sold, as in this case, to leave the account of the rents and profits to be provided for ip the subsequent and further directions. 1 <em>Bac.

And should he proceed in equity, if there has been a mere adverse possession without fraud or concealment, the account will be taken only from the time of filing the bill, for it was his own fault not to have filed it sooner. But where the bill is brought upon an equitable title, and there is a trust; and in the case of an infant, or where there has been any fraud; and in cases of dower, an account of the rents and profiis will be ordered, and that from the time the title accrued. <em>Pulteney v Warren, </em>6 <em>Ves. </em>89, 93. <em>Dormer v Fortesque, </em>3 <em>Aik. </em>124. <em>Goodiitle v Tombs, </em>3 <em>Wits. </em>121.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b231-6\">In an action of trespass for mesne profits, they are assessed at the discretion of the jury in damages, and therefore governed by no settled rule as to the amount. The jury may, if they think the circumstances of fraud and wrong warrant or require it, give large and vindictive damages, even as much as four times the value of the mesne profits; or, on the other hand, they may mitigate the damages down almost to nothing; and it does not appear that their unlimited discretion in this respect, has ever been materially controled by,granting new trials. The eourt of chancery is more steady in its principles, with regard to the amount of the mesne profits. If the occupant is the mere rightful holder of the piopcrty as a pledge; for example, as mortgagee who has been let in possession, he is held accountable for no more than he has actually received, what has really come into his hands, and not for the full value, or what he might have made by skilful and proper management. But where the occupant is a wrongful holder, or has obtained possession, and has held it fraudulently, or where, there being several incumbrances, the first mortgagee uses his security for the purpose of shielding the debtor from the junior mortgagees; in such eases, such a fraudulent or wrongfully occupying tenant, oran incum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>brancer who makes such an ill use of his security, will be charged 'with the full value; that is, with sueh an amount of rents and profits as a skilful and diligent tenant might have made from, the land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-5\">In this case, <em>Strike </em>informs us in his answer, that he obtained possession of the property in question (the one lot actually, and the other legally, as the landlord of <em>Rogers, </em>on whose property he levied a distress for rent in arrear,) under and by virtue of the deeds from <em>Rogers </em>to him, on the date of them, and \u2022that he took and received the whole, rents and profits. Those deeds have been declared null and void by the decree of March 1822, as against the complainants, on the ground of fraud. It appears, then, that <em>Strike </em>obtained possession of the property in question, fraudulently; that he used those deeds against these creditors, and that he wrongfully held the possession, and received the whole of the rents and profits from the date of those deeds; consequently, according to the principles of equity by which this court is governed, and I may venture to add, by the law of all civilized nations, in relation to the rents and profits, <em>Strike </em>must be charged with the full value of the property in question, from the date^of the deeds down to the date of the sale when he was turned out of possession.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-6\">In relation to the improvements for which <em>Strike </em>claims an allowance, one would suppose, that in the administration of a system of jurisprudence in a civilized society, there would be no flux and reflux of the principles of justice; that a rule once found necessary could never drop into oblivion; that however it might be altered or reformed, it could never, for any .length of time, be wholly forgotten, and then be called up again, and generally applied. But it would seem there is a fluctuation, perhaps indeed a mere change of fashion as to principles of law, as in every thing else. It does not appear from any thing I can learn, that the doctrine, in relation to an allowance to the occupying tenant for ameliorations, was ever at all, until very recently, presented to the consideration of a court of justice in this state as \u00e1 subject of controversy, and perhaps never before so urged and investigated as it has been upon this occasion. <em>Drury v Watkins, </em>March 1823, (MS.) <em>Quynnv Haines, </em>3 <em>Harr..fy M(Hen. </em>12S, The principles of law, in relation to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>.this matter, belong to our code, but until lately, they have been suffered to lay unnoticed among those rarely used regulations, which are seldom examined but by the curious. In a neighbouring state, so far back as the year 1643, it seems to have been deemed expedient to place upon its statute book, all the rules in relation to compensation for improvement, made upon the land by one man, the title of which was in another. 1 <em>Hen. Virg. Stat. </em>260, 349, 443. 2 <em>Hen. Virg. Stat. </em>96. Yet upon a recent occasion, when a judicial decision was called for upon the occupying claimants law of <em>Kentucky, </em>involving matters which in a greater or less degree attracted the attention of the whole Union, it was found that those legislative provisions had disappeared from the revised statute book of that state, and it required some care to ascertain distinctly what was then its law \u00abpon the subject. <em>Green v Biddle, </em>8 <em>Wheat. </em>1, and <em>,App. </em>n. 1.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-5\">It seems to be a sound and a very generally admitted principle of justice, that no man shall be allowed to enrich himself from the losses of another, or, as it is expressed in the <em>Roman </em>law, <em>nemo debit locupletari aliena jactura. </em>The moral force of this rule, in all eases to which it applies, and as between parties alike fair and innocent, appears to have been considered as altogether irresistible. In all cases in which the court is called on to apply this rule, it is essential that it should most clearly-and distinctly appear, that he who claims an allowance for his losses in the shape of compensation, for improvements, should be entirely and absolutely free from all blame, because equity never interferes in favour of a wrong-doer. In eases where a <em>bona fide </em>possessor of property, one who is ignorant \u00a9f all the facts and circumstances relating to his adversary\u2019s title, under a confident apprehension and belief that he was himself the <em>true owner, </em>proceeds to make improvements, and increase the value of the subject so held, it seems to have been almost universally admitted, that an allowance for such increased value should be made, at least to the extent of the rents and profits. According to the <em>Roman </em>law, such a claim tor improvements may be extended to their full value, beyond the amount of the rents and profits as against the improved subject itself. <em>Doroner v Fortesque, </em>3 <em>JLlk. </em>134. <em>Prin.

By the <em>Roman </em>law it is declared, that if a man build with his own materials upon the ground of another, the edifice becomes the property of him to whom the ground belongs,, because the owner of the material is understood to have made a voluntary alienation pf them, if he knew he was building upon another\u2019s land; and in the <em>English </em>court of admiralty, it has been held, that if a person buys a ship, the title to which is notoriously invalid, it must be at his own peril that he proceeds to lay out money in repairing and improving her, as no allowance for ameliorations will be made in such case. <em>\u25a0Just.

This argument is adduced in a case in which the only question was, whether an executor <em>de son tort </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>could retain. The court in their opinion held that he clearly eould not, assigning the most satisfactory reasons; and they then go on to say, that \u201cas to the case of <em>reeouper </em>in damages in tha ease of rent-service, charge, or seek, it was resolved, that the reason of reeouper in such case is, because otherwise when the disseisee re-enters, the arrearages of die rent service, charge, or seek, would be revived; and therefore to avoid circuity of action, and <em>circuitus est evitandus et boni judices est lites dirimere, ne lis ex lite oriatur, </em>the arrearages during the disseisin shall .be recouped in damages; but if the disseisor ought to have common on the land, the value of the common shall not be recouped, for by the regress of the disseisee, he should not have any arrearages or recompence for them.\u201d <em>Green v Biddle, </em>8 <em>Wheat. </em>81. The court take no notice of the position advanced in the argument, that \u201cthe disseisor shall recoupe all in damages which he hath expended in amending of the houses,\u201d and assign a reason for allowing the reeouper in the other instances put, that is utterly incompatible with allowing a disseisor or <em>mala fide </em>possessor, to recoupe what he had expended in mending the houses, and therefore the position cannot be admitted to be sound law, to the full extent for which it was advanced, if at all.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-5\">The term <em>recoupe </em>in the common law, signifies the keeping hack or stopping something which is due, and is used for \u201cto defalk or to discount;\u201d of which <em>Coulter\u2019s </em>case furnishes an illustration. It is from the common law doctrine of reeouper that our legislative provisions for \u201cpleading discount,\u201d <em>Acts of Ass. </em>1654, <em>ch. 23, </em>and 1785, <em>ch. </em>46, <em>s. </em>7, and the <em>English </em>statutes of set-off, about half a century later, have been derived, <em>St at. 5 Anne, ch. </em>17, <em>s. 11.2 Geo. </em>II, <em>ch. 22. Just. Inst. </em>L 4, tit. 6, <em>s. </em>30. They all rest upon precisely the same principles. The object is to prevent cross actions, or as the books express it, circuity of action, to allow the opposing claims of the same parties to be settled in one action, which must otherwise necessarily give rise to two actions; but however reasonable and desirable it may be thus to put an end to <em>two </em>subjects of litigation in one and ihe same suit, yet as it appears from <em>Coulter\u2019s </em>case no man shall be allowed to obtain this advantage by his own wrong; and therefore it is that an executor of his own wrong will not be allowed to recoupe and retain.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>Apart from the doctrine of recouper, every claim must have a fair, legal, or equitable basis, whether presented to the court as the cause of an original action, or by way of recouper, discount or set-off. The claim for rents and profits, and the opposing claim for improvements, each of them rests upon principles of law and equity that are wholly separate and distinct. Whether or not the proprietor shall recover rents and profits must, in each case, depend upon the justice and equity with which he sustains his claim. If he has for an unreasonable time slept upon his rights, and there should appear to be any suspicious circumstances about his case, or any discoverable infirmity in it, the court will lessen or reject the claim altogether. So on the.other hand, he who presents a claim for ameliorations, must in like manner show that it is sustainable on its own independent, substantial, and fair principles of equity; as it stands exhibited before the court, it must appear in all respects unsullied by wrong or deception; it must have no taint of fraud about it; if it has it cannot be allowed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-5\">Such claims as these for rents and profits, and for ameliorations, may very often present them selves in a court off equity in opposition to each other; and be set up by <em>litigating </em>parties by way of recouper, discount or set-off, the one against the other. But if, as in the case of an executor <em>de son tort, </em>a man shall not be permitted to take advantage of his own wrong, even so far as to place himself in a situation to recoupe a just and equitable claim, most certainly the law would not endure a wrong doer to oppose a fair claim in any degree whatever, by one which had originated in, and was wholly fourided in his own wrong. Hence it is that a <em>mala fide </em>possessor can in no ease, nor under any circumstances, be allowed any thing for improvements, either beyond or even to the amount of the rents and profits. A different rulo, as has been justly observed, would place it in the power of the wrongful possessor to improve the right owner out of his estate. Yet it is said that where the sums are large, the peculiar circumstances of the case may influence the court in directing the account to be taken from the filing of the bill \"only, and not from the time of taking possession. <em>Suga. </em>526.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>Now how stands the case under consideration in reference to this claim for improvements? The bill charges that <em>Rogers </em>conveyed the property in question to <em>Strike </em>for the purpose of avoiding the payment of <em>Rogers\u2019 </em>creditors; <em>Strike </em>answers and denies the charge, and avers that the conveyances to him were absolute, fair, and for a valuable consideration, and that he is the <em>bona fide </em>purchaser and holder of the property. But the court, by the decree of March 1822, has declared those conveyances to be null and void as against the complainants, and directed the property <em>to he sold </em>for their benefit. Hence it dearly appears, that <em>Strike </em>now stands before this court convicted and -condemned as a fraudulent and <em>mala fide </em>purchaser and holder of the property. He, one of the very contrivers, and a party to the fraud, claims an allowance for improvements on the property so obtained and held. Such a claim, it is believed, was never sanctioned by a court of justice in any country, or at any time. According to all law, and every principle of equity, this claim for improvements of every description, must be totally and absolutely rejected.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-5\"><em>Strike\u2019s </em>claim for repairs and improvements have been thus disposed of on general principles. But it is alleged he has another and special foundation for his claim for amelioration, and advances, under the concluding sentence of the decree of Marelt 1822. But that decree has declared the deeds from <em>Rogers </em>to <em>Strike </em>\u201cnull and void as against the complainants;\u201d it has retained them as a security for nothing, and in no respect whatever. The several parts of that decree must be made to harmonize one with another. Those deeds which have been go to-, tally annulled as against the complainants, cannot, therefore, consistently with that decree, be allowed to stand as mortgages against them, to secure to <em>Strike </em>either the amount of the improvements, or the advances in money he has made to Rogers. Upon that ground <em>Strike </em>cannot stand, because it is completely covered by the decree. This being the decided opinion of the chancellor, he might deem it unnecessary to notice that class of cases which speak of allowances for improvements and advances made by actual mortgagees, or by those <em>pseudo </em>purchasers of young heirs and others, whose conveyances are allowed by special favour to stand and be considered as of the na<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>ture of mere mortgages. Yet from the manner in which those cases have been pressed forward, some further reasons, show* ing why they are inapplicable to this case, may be expected.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-5\">In this case it must be distinctly and constantly recollected, that <em>Sirike now </em>claims reimbursement for his improvements and advances, not of <em>Rogers, </em>but out of the proceeds of the property in question, and against the creditors of <em>Rogers, </em>who are here as the complainants. All those cases of mortgages and <em>pseudo </em>purchases, are governed alike by the same principles of equity. A separate examination. of each of them will therefore be entirely unnecessary.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-6\">In all, the'.bill is brought by the grantor against the grantee, or between parties who stand precisely in that relation to each other, to redeem the mortgaged property, or to set aside a conveyance which has been improperly or fraudulently obtained. And on the case being made out by the proofs, the tribunal has uniformly answered to him who asked the relief, \u201cyou must do equity before you shall obtain equity. It is true you have been imposed upon and defrauded \u2014 but itis.no less true that you have been partially and in some degree benefited; you have received' money from your opponent; he has permanently enhanced the value of your estate; refund the money you have received, pay for the increased value of your estate, and it shall be restored to you; the conveyances of which you complain shall be annulled, until then they shall stand as a security for thos\u00e9 improvements and advances.\u201d Such is the language of the chancellor in those cases where he acts under the influence of the maxim, that he who asks equity must do equity; and this maxim is sanctioned and illustrated by an almost endless variety of eases to be found in the books.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-7\">But the application of this maxim in these cases, and for the most part, depends not only upon the immediate relationship between the parties of grantor and grantee, but also .almost always upon the vendees being brought before the court by the vendor; that is, the contracting party injured as plaintiff, against the party injuring as defendant. A few examples will sufficiently illustrate this position: The plaintiff came to be relieved against the penalty of a bond; the ground of equity was established by the proofs, and the relief was decreed, but not with*<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>out the payment of principal and interest, even although it exceeded the penalty of the bond. <em>Fran. Max. </em>4, <em>(note.) 2 Ev. Poth. Ob. </em>89. But where lands were devised for the payment of debts, and there was a bond debt, the interest of which had outran the penalty, yet the creditor, on a bill filed by him, was allowed to recover no more than the penalty. In the first ease the creditor was sustained by this maxim of equity \u2014 in the second, his case rested barely on his own contract. Again, the plaintiff for ninety pounds lent, fraudulently obtained a bond for eight hundred pounds, on which he obtained a judgment, and the object of the bill was to have certain lands subjected to the plaintiff\u2019s satisfaction in equity. But the court would not give him any relief, not so much as for the principal he had really lent, and dismissed his bill. If however the defendant in this case had come in to set aside the judgment for fraud, equity would have obliged him to pay the ninety pounds really lent. This case is also illustrative of another maxim, that he who has committed iniquity shall not have equity. <em>Fran. Max. </em>8.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-5\">Now in order to bring these cases, and the principle they illustrate, fully to bear upon the case under consideration, it must appear, that the complainants not only claim under <em>Rogers, </em>but that they stand here in all respects as he would have stood; and that they ask to have these deeds vacated upon the same grounds that he could have made a similar prayer. But the case now before the court is of a totally different nature. <em>Rogers </em>himself is here as a defendant, charged as a <em>particeps fraudis, </em>and relief is prayed by these complainants against him as well as against <em>Strike. </em>The present creditors do certainly claim this property under <em>Rogers; </em>and it is also true that they can only take it, subject to all fair, legal and equitable liens wife which <em>Rogers </em>may have incumbered it, antecedent and superior to their claims. But as against <em>Strike </em>these plaintiffs are to be considered as purchasers of the most favoured and meritorious class, holding by a prior and superior title. The improvements and the advances for the ground rent, the <em>Pratt-street </em>assessment, and the taxes alleged to have been made and paid by <em>Strike, </em>give him no lien upon the property itself against the rightful owner, either <em>Rogers, </em>these creditors, or any one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>else. . But if <em>Rogers </em>had come here to be relieved against the fraud practised on him by <em>Strike, </em>and to have the property restored to <em>him, </em>the court would have granted him relief only upon condition of his reimbursing <em>Strike </em>for all his improvements and advances, because they enured to the use and benefit of <em>Rogers. </em>But no equitable principle of that sort can be urged against.the complainants. They are here as creditors, praying to be relieved against a fraud contrived between <em>Rogers </em>and <em>Strike.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-5\">But admitting all this. It is alleged, that, independently of the vacated deeds and of the decree, <em>Strike </em>has a claim, as a kind of <em>salvor </em>of this property, which ought to he allowed. It is said he has saved it from the hands of the ground landlord, by paying the ground rent; he has saved it from the grasp of the <em>Pratt-street </em>commissioners, by paying the assessment levied upon it; and he has saved it from the power of the state, by .paying the taxes. He maintains .that he has a right to assume the place and to be substituted for those claimants, and he founds this claim upon the doctrine of <em>substitution. </em>But <em>Strike, </em>as regards these complainants, was an uninvited officious <em>mala fide </em>meddler with property which be knew did not belong, to him, and which he was apprised ought to be liable to the claims of <em>Rogers\u2019 </em>creditors. He made these advances <em>to </em>serve himself, not for the benefit of these complainants; and if he had an intention that these advances should enure to theper..sonal benefit of any one, it must have been to <em>Rogers; </em>because 3t was from him. he took the estate; and if the conveyances Were to be annulled it was only against him he could seek reimbursement. <em>Prin. Eq. </em>134.\u00ab <em>Strike, </em>therefore, cannot have, against these complainants, any shadow of countervailing equity on which to rest his claim for these advances, out of the proceeds directed to be brought into court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A3s\">'</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-6\">Having discussed the liabilities and pretensions of the defendants, let us now consider the interests of the complainants among themselves.. This is what is commonly called a creditor\u2019s bill; and where two or more creditors bring such a bill, or others come in afterwards, the adjustment of their rights and interests, in relation to each other, and the objections which the defendants'may make against those who have come in after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>institution of the suit, most generally remain to be considered and decided when the court is called on to make a distribution of the fund. The claim of the plaintiffs has, as we have seen, to a certain extent, been settled and determined by the decree of March 1822 \u2014 and therefore, their claim is not now to be reconsidered and reinvestigated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-5\">It has been objected that the bill does not, as it ought, allege that the complainants sue as well for the benefit of other creditors, as for themselves. It is often a matter of some perplexity to determine who ought to be made parties, the rule being laid down in general terms, that all who are interested in the, decree should be made parties. This decree virtually recognizes this as one of those cases in which all the other creditors of the debtor, against whom, or whose estate the suit is brought; may come in either before or after the decree, or at any time before the assets have been distributed, and claim a proportion-able share of them. And supposing the bill had alleged that the originally suing creditors sued as well for others as for themselves, it is said that the right of such others to come in could not now have been questioned. In <em>England </em>it seems to be an established rule in cases of this kind, that the bill should distinctly allege that the complainant institutes the suit, as well for the benefit of all others who may thereafter come in, as of himself. In this state such a <em>qui tarn </em>allegation in bills of this nature is very common, and is certainly very proper and use - ful in apprising the court, and all concerned, at once of the object and character, in which the suit is brought. But this is the first instance here in which such an objection to a bill of this kind has ever been made, so far as I have been able to learn. In this case it sufficiently appears from the whole pror ceedings, bill, answers, orders and decree, that this is a case in which other creditors may come in, and therefore in this inr stance, and in this stage of this case, I cannot say that this bill is erroneous and deficient for the want of such an allegation; and therefore in this case, the other creditors of <em>Rogers </em>may be permitted to come in and participate, notwithstanding there is no such allegation in this bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-6\">But it is objected, that those other creditors who, it is alleged, have actually come in to partake, have not presented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>themselves in legal and proper form, that their claims have not been sufficiently authenticated and proved, and, even if these objections were removed, that their claims are barred by the statute bf limitations. These objections will be severally con\u00bb sidered, and also the reply that such objections can only be made by the defendants, and not, as in this instance, by a creditor or co-plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Apk\">In <em>England </em>it is the established practice for the other creditors, who come in after the institution of the suit, to do so by bill or petition. In this state, the practice has been less formal and strict. In some eases the creditor, who wishes to come in, has filed his petition in the suit that has been instituted, concisely stating the nature of his claim, and praying to be admitted as a co-plaintiff accordingly. But in most cases the creditor has been allowed to come in and participate, merely by filing the voucher of his claim with the register. This latter mode certainly does, in many respects, save much trouble and expense, and is the'preferable one, where the creditor\u2019s claim is of small amount. On adverting to the case <em>o\u00ed Mien Quynn\u2019s </em>estate, I find, that I had there recognized it as the established practice of the court, in cases of creditors\u2019 bills. <em>This </em>practice will, therefore, be adhered to in future, in all such cases. <em>M\u2018Mechen\u2019s Ex\u2019rs. v Chase\u2019s Heirs, </em>1820, <em>(MS.)

Because, in such cases, there being no other mode by which the real estate of a deceased person could be subjected to the payment of his debts, generally, including those due by simple contract, but by bill or petition in chancery; and on the creditors coming here for that purpose, it being directed to be sold, (as was usually expressly declared, in the older decrees of this court,) \u201cfor the payment of the just claims of the creditors of the deceased in a due course of administration,\u201d are therefore, when such assets are brought in, this court feels itself authorised and required to-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>act upon the same kind of proof that the orphans court acts on, in case of personal assets, and to make distribution upon the Same degree of authenticity and proof; so that the creditor when his claim is submitted to a court of justice, will find the same measure in one tribunal as in another, or whether he obtained payment from one fund or another; and I find this practice spoken of as far back as the year 1803, as then well established. <em>Sluby\u2019s </em>Estate, <em>(MS.).

But, if the insolvent denied the debt, or there was any discrepancy between his schedule or admission and the creditor\u2019s claim, then the creditor was put to full proof. 1 <em>Ev. Roth. Ob. </em>409 But the statute of limitations was never considered as an objection to the payment of a claim, either in the case of a deceased person\u2019s estate, or in the case of insolvency, unless it was specially relied upon. The case now under consideration is substantially and in truth, a case of insolvency; not, indeed, referred to the chancellor by any special act of assembly, but one which has been brought here by these proceedings., and in due course of law, and, there - fore, the assets now here will be distributed upon such principles and proof as have been applied and required in similar cases, where no objection to the claim has been made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b243-6\">But, in this case, the originally suing creditors have objected, that the claims of the other creditors who have come in since the institution of the suit, are not sufficiently sustained <em>by </em>proof; they have also objected that those claims are barred <em>by </em>the statute of limitations;- and their reliance on the statute of limitations, it appears, was made, and sent with the reference of the cause to the auditor. The reply to these objections, in argument, is, that they are such as can only be made by one or other, or both of the defendants; and not by a creditor or co-plaintiifi</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>The debtor or his heir, has so manifest an interest in the real estate which it is proposed, in eases of this sort, to subject to the payment of his defats, that there never seems to have been any difference of opinion as to his right to make such objections. Where an executor or administrator fails to make such objections or waives them; or there has been a judgment against him; still the heir or devisee may make such objections in defence of the real assets. And where the executor and some of the heirs waives these objections; yet, any other of the heirs or devisees may alone make them in defence of the whole of the real assets, as was done in the case of <em>Wm. Frazier\u2019s </em>estate in this court. It seems to be conceded on all' hands, that these originally suing creditors have an interest in these real assets; but, yet it is urged, that they cannot make such objections as these against the claims of their fellow creditors. This matter must be determined on practice, on principle, and on authority.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-5\">The defendants or the representatives of deceased debtors are generally from strong motives of interest, so very active in their opposition to all and each of the creditors, where opposition of any sort can be of any avail, that they rarely leave any thing to be said or done by any one else; \u00e1nd, hence, it would \u25a0seem from the practice of the court, that they alone were the only persons who had any right to urge such objections. It is obvious, therefore, that the main current of the practice here is not likely to be'very fruitful of information on this subject.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-6\">There is a class of creditors\u2019 bills common in <em>England, </em>but of rare occurrence here, which will cast light upon this matter. Bills are often brought there by one creditor in behalf of himself and others against executors to obtain payment, and to have the assets brought in and administered under the directions of tile court of chancery. In such cases the executor is not bound to plead the statute of limitations; and if he does <em>not, </em>the creditors will have a decree, and be paid. But it is the constant course, in the master\u2019s office, to take the objections against other creditors, and to exclude from distribution, those, who, if legal objections are brought forward, cannot make their claims effectual. So, too, in cases of bankruptcy \u2014 if the bankrupt waives any objection, it may still be made by the ere*<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>ditors; and the reason of this is, that the creditors have a direct and manifest interest in the funds, and that ft should satisfy their whole claims respectively. If each of them was not permitted to make these objections, they would be left at the mercy of those, for a full defence, who, in all cases, where the fund is not more than enough to pay all the debts, have no interest to exclude any one from partaking, to their prejudice, in the distribution, however ill-founded his claim may be. And besides, such bills by creditors, and proceedings in chancery, are only to be considered as other modes of compelling payment; and the chancellor is understood, in the distribution, to govern himself as to legal debts by the rules of law; and as to equitable debts, by the rules of equity, regarding the claim of each creditor as a suit depending; and, hence, if the executor or bankrupt fails to object or to plead the statute of limitations, it may bo made or relied upon by any of the creditors; and the validity of such objections will sometimes be directed to be tried in an issue at law. <em>Exparte </em>Dewdney, 15 <em>Ves. </em>497. <em>Civil Code Nap. dirt. 2225.

It is left entirely to the chancellor\u2019s discretion. But, (he observes,) it is a rule to admit claims on such proof as is prescribed for, and is satisfactory to an orphans\u2019 court; and even to admit claims passed against an executor or administrator by an orphans\u2019 court, unless objected to by some person interested, viz, <em>by a creditor of the deceased, </em>or his executor or administrator; or by the guardian of the infant.\u201d The chancellor then goes on to speak of the manner in which such objections should be tried; and in substance declares, that he would not direct an issue at law for that purpose, but in extraordinary eases. <em>Purnellv Comegys, </em>1806, <em>per </em>Kilty, Chan. <em>(MS.)

There can be no difference, in point of equity, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>between the case of a creditor\u2019s bill against a deceased person\u2019s estate, and 'a creditor\u2019s bill, as in this instance, against an insolvent\u2019s estate. Therefore, upon principle and authority it is competent for these originally suing creditors to make these objections, and to rely upon'the statute of limitations, in opposition to these claims of the other creditors who have come in since the institution of this suit. But in applying the statute of limitations in such cases, it must be with all its saving provisoes; and also subject to the resuscitating qualifications of such acknowledgments as are deemed sufficient to take a case out of the'statute; of which a statement in ah insolvent\u2019s schedule may be considered as one, where the claim and schedule agree. And the statute, as in other cases, must be allowed to commence its operation from the time the debt accrued; and to run on until the creditor came in, by filing his petition, or the voucher of his claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-5\">The plaintiffs, by their bill found their claim, against the defendants, upon contracts made with <em>Henderson fy Rogers-, </em>and the decree of March,-1822, recognizes and affirms their claims of that description; and the proofs derived from competent witnesses, will enable the auditor, in fulfilment of that decree, to refer to the notes and vouchers, to ascertain the amount, and to compute the interest thereon. But it would be altogether without precedent to allow a plaintiff to add to the amount, and to eke out his claim indefinitely, by introducing other particulars and causes of action of a different description, not mentioned or alluded to in the pleadings, or sanctioned by the decree, and which were only noticed in the depositions of some of the witnesses; or to bring in any additional claim by a mere <em>ex parte </em>petition, filed after the hearing and decree.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-6\">If the plaintiffs had other claims than those mentioned in the pleadings, subsisting at time of filing their bill, which might have been included therein, they should have had their bill so amended as to have embraced them, and thereby enabled the opposite party to.gainsay them if he could: \u2014 Therefore the account of the plaintiffs, with <em>John Rogers </em>alone, and also their claim for costs in the suit against <em>Penelope D.

But the filing of the schedule of an insolvent debtor, certainly cannot by any strained or liberal construction of this practice, be considered as the filing of the vouchers of the claims, of all, or any of those creditors, whose names and claims are stated thereon; and laying aside the insolvent\u2019s schedule in this case, as furnishing no evidence of the intention of any creditor therein named, to come in and make a claim for any debt, which he alleged, and was ready to prove was due him, when such schedule was filed, three are but two other creditors who have made any show of coming in as other creditors of <em>Rogers; </em>and they are <em>Robert Taylor, </em>and the firm of <em>Hollingsworth \u00a3? Worthington. Taylor </em>has filed a mere short copy of a judgment, which he obtained in <em>Baltimore </em>county court against Henderson,-the partner of <em>Rogers; </em>and <em>Hollingsworth fy Worthington </em>merely say, that the only demand they now have against <em>Rogers, </em>is for twenty dollars, lent him several years ago: \u2014 But these claims are so utterly destitute of any support by proof of any sort, that they must be rejected There are then, in fact, no claims of any other creditors of the defendant <em>Rogers, </em>which the auditor can be allowed to state and report for confirmation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-7\">Upon the principles before explained, <em>Strike </em>must be charged with the rents and profits, or full value of the property ie <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>question, from the date of the deeds from <em>Rogers </em>to him, to the day of the sale by the trustee. The amount, or what has been the full value during that time must be collected and ascertained by the auditor from the proofs in the cause; and, for the reasons already given, <em>Strike\u2019s </em>claim for repairs, improvements and advances must be totally rejected.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-5\">The practice in this state is wholly unlike that of <em>England, </em>in relation to exceptions to witnesses. <em>2 Madd. Ch. </em>425. Here when the commission is returned, it is opened by the chancellor or the register, and objections of every kind to the testimony, are taken and considered at the hearing of the cause. In this case objections have been made to the reading of the depositions of two of the witnesses, on the ground of their being interested. The proofs are all now to be sent to the auditor, upon which he is to .found some of the particulars of the account he is directed to state. But he should riot be suffered to make any statements derived from the testimony of incompetent witnesses or illegal evidence. Therefore these objections do not come now too late, and must be decided on for the government of the auditor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"102\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-6\">The chancellor considers it as sufficiently apparent upon the-proceedings, without going into a statement of the case, and his reasons, that <em>John Rogers, </em>the defendant, is an interested witness, and therefore the whole of his testimony must be set aside and totally rejected. The reading of the deposition of <em>Alexander Irvine, </em>h\u00e1s also been objected to, on the ground of his interest. It does not however sufficiently appear, that he was a creditor of <em>Rogers </em>and interested at the time; and therefore the objection against his testimony must be over-ruled. A paper purporting to be the' answer of <em>Strike </em>to a petition of the complainants filed in <em>Baltimore </em>county court against him, has been insisted on as applicable and furnishing evidence pertinent to this case. But from its phraseology and general tenor, it is evident, that it cannot be a part of the pleadings of <em>this </em>suit, and without the other proceedings to which it purports to be an answer, it cannot be evidence in this cause, and must be re-\u00bb jected. \u25a0 '</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-7\">With these explanations, determinations and directions, the case is referred to the auditor to state an. account accordingly; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>and the several exceptions, as well of the plaintiffs as of the der .dants, to the auditor\u2019s statements and reports heretofore made, so far as the same are inconsistent with the determinations and directions herein before given, are overruled, and so far as they may agree therewith, are sustained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b249-5\">The complainants afterwards filed a petition stating that they originally employed as their counsel in this cause <em>Henry M.

The petitioners further stated, that the said <em>Henry M, Murray, </em>Esq\u2019r. soon after the order aforesaid was passed, died without proceeding further in the said cause,, after the auditor\u2019s first report therein, and the petitioners have been compelled to engage <em>Charles Mitchell </em>as their counsel, in the place of the said <em>Henry M.

Wherefore the petitioners prayed, that the same per eentage in proportion to his services in this cause, may be allowed out of the said suit to the said <em>Charles Mitchell, </em>as was to be allowed to the said <em>Henry M.

The chancellor has read and considered the foregoing petition. No objection was intimated to him against the claim of <em>Henry M.

The chancellor knows of no' practice of this court, or of any analogous proceedings of the <em>English </em>court, which would authorise the introduction of claims of this sort into a cause, depending or about to be finally disposed of. The claim of the solicitors <em>Rogers </em>and <em>Murray, </em>he sanctioned under all the very peculiar circumstances which belonged to-it, and he considers th\u00e9 objections to it stated in the foregoing petition as coming n\u00f3^t\u00f3pidate. The claim has been acquiesced in, and could not nif^hbhr^considered without giving <em>H. M, Murray\u2019s </em>representative's bn opportunity of being heard, which cannot now be done. The chancellor must in all cases leave the contracts between solicitors and suitors, relative to professional services, to be settled and decided upon in like manner as all other contracts. They cannot nor ought not to be introduced into, and blended\u2019with any pending suit.

The claim of the complainants rests on the promissory notes of <em>Henderson </em>and <em>Rogers </em>\u2014 a simple contract debt. They show a debt due by <em>Henderson </em>and <em>Rogers </em>\u2014 that <em>Henderson </em>is liable equally with <em>Rogers, </em>and should have been made a party in this case. The* complainants could not go against the individual property of <em>Rogers </em>until it was shown that the partnership funds of <em>Henderson </em>and <em>Rogers </em>were insufficient. The individual creditors of <em>Rogers </em>have a right to be paid out of the individual fund of Rogers. in preference to the creditors of <em>Henderson </em>and Rogers. The complainants are the creditors of <em>Henderson </em>and <em>Rogers, </em>and cannot be paid out of the private property of <em>Rogers, </em>until all his private creditors are satisfied their claims. A simple contract creditor cannot proceed in equity against the specific property of his debtor, until he has first resorted to a court of law to recover his claim. <em>Colman v Croker, </em>1 <em>Ves. jr. </em>160, 161. <em>Hendricks v Robinson, </em>2 <em>Johns.

The bill does not profess to have the deeds set aside on account of fraud. There is no charge of fraud averred in the bill \u2014 it must be charged to give chancery jurisdiction. It is charged in the bill that the deeds were executed to shield the private property of <em>Rogers </em>from the payment of his debts, and the debts of <em>Henderson </em>and <em>Rogers. Rogers </em>had a right, at common law, to convey his property to any of his creditors. Our insolvent laws do not avoid such deeds. They were executed more than twenty months before <em>Rogers </em>applied for the benefit of the insolvent laws. There is no fraud charged in the bill, nor is any fraud proved in the case. The witnesses differ very materially as to the value of the property. The court can draw their own inference as to the value, without relying on the testimony of the witnesses. From their testimony no conclusion is to be drawn unless an average is taken of the value deposed to by the witnesses, and this would bring the value to very near the price that <em>Strike </em>paid for the property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"126\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b254-6\">3.

A fictitious distress is got up; by which, and the deeds, the whole property of <em>Rogers </em>came into the possession of <em>Strike, </em>who not only acted dishonestly with regard to the creditors of <em>Rogers, </em>but also as to <em>Rogers </em>himself, and determined, by making small advances to <em>Rogers, </em>to defraud him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"129\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b255-7\">2. Can this court travel into the decree of <em>Baltimore </em>county court, and look into the merits or demerits of that decree? By the act o\u00ed 1807, <em>ch. </em>151, no appeal in any case is allowed after three years have elapsed between the judgment or decree and the time of entering the appeal. The question then is, was it a decree or not which was passed in this case by <em>Baltimore </em>county court? Whether the decree was final, or only interloeutory, still the appeal should have been within three years. <em>Thompson v M\u2018Kim, </em>6 <em>Harr. &amp; Johns. </em>302. The decree was final as to the question of right between the parties. The deeds were declared null and void, and were set aside. It is now attempted by this appeal to open that decree, having been passed more than three years before the appeal, for the purpose of letting in a technical objection \u2014 that the complainants had not proceeded at law to recover their claim, before they resorted to a court of equity. Captious objections will not be allowed. <em>Carroll v Norwood, </em>4 <em>Harr. &amp; M\u2018Hen. </em>290. The defendant should have demurred to the bill, and the complainants would then have dismissed their bill, and proceeded at law. But if the. decree of <em>Baltimore </em>county court is open for the consideration of this court, yet it is impossible, from the testimony, for this \"ourt to decree otherwise than that the deeds were fraudulent, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>and therefore void. The evidence is so full and irresistible, that no other conclusion can be drawn from <em>it Strike\u2019s </em>own uniform declarations are strong evidence of the fraud, and conclusive of the fact. There is no proof which can be relied on for the amount paid for the improvements made by <em>Strike </em>on the property. Why did he not produce the bills, receipts, &amp;c. This he did not do, but the vague recollection of witnesses is resorted to. A fraudulent grantee must exhibit strong evidence of his claim. <em>Piddock v Brown, </em>3 <em>P. Wms. 288. Vaughan v Lloyd, 5 Ves. </em>48, 49.</p>\n<p data-order=\"130\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b256-5\">3. In the case of absolute fraud a court of equity will grant no relief. The case of a constructive fraud is different \u2014 as usury, &amp;c. where the complainant must do equity before he can obtain equity. So also where there has been an inadequacy of price. If <em>Rogers </em>was the complainant in this case against <em>Strike, </em>the claim of <em>Strike </em>would be allowed. <em>Sands v Codwise, </em>4 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>536, 555, 582, 585, 598. Necessary repairs \u2014 permanent and beneficial, may be allowed for; but here none have been proved to be made which are beneficial, but merely for <em>Strike\u2019s </em>own personal pride \u2014 not for convenience, but for show. <em>Rob. on Fraud. Convey. </em>451, <em>(note a.) Sugd. </em>525, (483.) <em>Green v Winter, </em>1 <em>Johns. Ch. Rep. </em>26, 27, 39. <em>Moore v Cable, Ib. </em>385. The deeds being void, <em>Strike </em>held the property in trust for the benefit of the creditors of <em>Rogers. </em>He had, therefore, no right to make expensive repairs, &amp;c. on the property. He improved the property solely for the purpose of appropriating it to his own use. A deed for one purpose cannot be set up for another or different purpose. <em>Bridgman v Green, 2 Ves. 627</em>. <em>Watt v Grove, 2 Sch. &amp; Lef. </em>501, 502.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"131\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b256-6\"><em>Mitchell, </em>on the Same side.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"132\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ANl\">1.

The prayer in this bill is that the property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>may be sold for the benefit of the creditors of <em>Rogers </em>and of <em>Rogers </em>and <em>Henderson. </em>The answer of <em>Strike </em>denies all fraud; by -which he considered it a bill charging him with fraud, and not a bill charging it as a trust. Fraud then was put in issue, although imperfectly charged in the bill. <em>Cooper\u2019s Plead. </em>6, <em>7. Whorwood v Simpson, </em>2 <em>Vern. </em>187. 2 <em>Madd.

Their claim has been admitted by <em>Rogers, </em>one of the defendants. <em>Strike, </em>the other defendant, neither admits, nor denies.</p>\n<p data-order=\"134\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b257-6\">By the act of 1825, <em>ch. </em>117, unless exceptions are taken to the report of the auditor, there can be no objection made to it in this court. Here there has been no exception taken to the report of the claim of the complainants, nor to their right to participate in the fund \u2014 there can, therefore, be no objection made in this court. But it has been said that simple contract creditors cannot come into a court of equity, unless there has been a judgment, &amp;c. at law. This is a question of jurisdiction, and should have been raised before the defendant, <em>Strike, </em>submitted to the jurisdiction of the court by his answer. <em>Underhill v Van Cortlandt, 2 Johns.

Here the insolvent debtor has executed a deed to the trustee appointed according to the insolvent laws The complainants may, therefore, call on the trustee to account for his trust, and to account for the rents and profits of the property in question. <em>Strike, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>as charged in the bill, is a fraudulent and colluding trustee.

There is no question as to the right of the complainants to the fund. The point, therefore, ought not to be argued, as it is unconnected with partnership assets. At law a creditor may levy his execution on the joint or separate property of the partners. In equity it is different, until the proper fund has been exhausted. But here there are no separate creditors of <em>Rogers </em>\u2014 none appear in the record. There can then be no contest as to the joint and separate property of <em>Rogers. </em>M'Cul<em>loh v Dashiell's adm\u2019r. </em>1 <em>Harr. &amp; Gill, </em>96. The schedule returned by <em>Rogers </em>under his application for relief under the insolvent laws, is no evidence that there were private or <em>other </em>creditors. 1 <em>Phill. Evid. </em>51.

This question has been settled by the decree of <em>Baltimore </em>county court in 1822, from which decree there has been no appeal within the time prescribed by law. The decree was pronounced upon a final hearing, the bill, answers, &amp;c. being submitted for that purpose. It is a final decree. 2 <em>Harr. Ch. Pr. </em>622. An interlocutory decree does not dispose of the matters in litigation be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>tween the parties; but this decree does. The equity reserved by the decree was as to the distribution of the fund raised by a sale of the property, among the honest and <em>bona fide </em>creditors. It wras not for the benefit of <em>Strike, </em>for he had no equity. The decree was final. <em>Ray v Law, </em>3 <em>Cranch, </em>179. 1 <em>Wooddison, </em>232 to 240. <em>Thompson v M'Kim, </em>6 <em>Harr. </em>&amp; <em>Johns. </em>328. <em>Slee v Bloom, </em>20 <em>Johns.

By the act of 1763, <em>ch. </em>23, <em>s. 5, 6, </em>the county courts had concur rent jurisdiction with the court of chancery as to certain amounts. This jurisdiction was enlarged by the acts of 1791, <em>ch. </em>78, 1792, <em>ch. 63; </em>and the right to appeal, and the time within which such appeal was to be made, is the same as given under the act of 1785, <em>ch. </em>72. By the act of 1807, <em>ch. </em>151, appeals from the decrees of county courts are limited to three years. The decree in this case was passed by <em>Baltimore </em>county court on the 28th of May 1822, and the appeal was not made until the 29th of May 1826. It is clear, therefore, that not more of the case is before this court than that part upon which the statute limiting appeals does not operate. It is possible that the decree might have been opened by a bill of review, but not otherwise. <em>Lashley v Hogg, </em>11 <em>Ves. </em>602. <em>Taylor v Popham, </em>15 <em>Ves. </em>76. <em>Charman v Charman, </em>16 <em>Ves. </em>115. <em>Waldo v Galey, Ib. </em>214. 2 <em>Madd.

What does the appeal from the court of chancery open in this case? It does not open what the chancellor considered, and what was finally acted upon before the proceedings were transferred to his court. It does not open the question of fraud; but only what was done by the chancellor. What equity was there reserved by the decree of 1822, and what can now be enforced? What is the equity which <em>Strike, </em>by his answer, shows he is entitled to? He knew of In's defective title to the property, and should not have improved it; and this he should not have done independent of the fraud. A \u00a1xnant for years shall not improve the proper\u00edy so as to prolong his possession in order to enjoy his improvements, until he is reimbursed. Equity will not relieve him by reim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>bursing him for the improvements. 1 <em>Madd. Ch. </em>263. <em>Moore v Cable, </em>1 <em>Johns.

But it has been said that the bill does not chargethat the deeds were fraudulently obtained. If the facts in a bill arc all stated, showing that there had been a fraud, it need not be stated that they had been obtained by fraud. <em>Jones v Slubey, 5 Harr. </em>&amp; <em>Johns. 372. Farrow v Teackle, </em>4 <em>Harr. &amp; Johns. </em>271.</p>\n<p data-order=\"140\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-5\">Again, it has been insisted that a simple contract creditor must first resort to a court of law to obtain his claim; and if he cannot succeed there, then he may go into chancery to affect any property liable for the debt. Why drive a claimant first to law? Why not let him proceed immediately in equity? The books are full of eases where a creditor may go into chancery for himself and other creditors to obtain their claims. Fraud is equally cognizable at law as in equity, except in the case of a fraudulent will. A court of equity has jurisdiction of simple <em>contract </em>debts; and can bring all the parties interested as creditors, before the court, to participate in the funds in case payment is decreed. ' By the act of 1794, <em>ch. </em>60, <em>s. </em>10, the court of chancery may decree the sale of equitable estates for the payment of debts; and this power has been constantly exercised as well in this as in other states in the union. But hero the debtor had applied for the benefit of <em>the </em>insolvent laws, and this of itself gave the complainants a right to proceed in equity. <em>Strike, </em>by his answer, put in issue the fraud in obtaining the deeds.</p>\n<p data-order=\"141\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AaA\">Again, it has been said that the deeds were <em>bona fide, </em>and for a valuable consideration. This is expressly negatived by the testimony, which is full and ample to establish <em>that the </em>deeds were fraudulently obtained.</p>\n<p data-order=\"142\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-7\">Can the decree of 1822 be examined by this court on the present appeal? What followed that decree was no more than an execution of it \u2014 similar to an execution on a judgment at law. After the sale by the trustees, that decree was satisfied. <em>Thomp</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number><em>son v Brown, </em>4 <em>Johns. Ch.

There is no question whether the defendant, <em>Strike, </em>should be entitled to have his account stated, there being no objections made to it. Nor is there any whether or not the complainants are creditors of Ro<em>gers. </em>Their claim has not been disputed. This court will not, therefore, notice any exceptions or objections now made, unless they were also made in the court below. There is no proof that <em>Strike </em>advanced any money to <em>Rogers, </em>either before or after the deeds; but certainly none that he advanced any money before the deeds. The question is, whether any allowance should be made to <em>Strike </em>for improvements under the circumstances of the case? We think no allowance ought to be made to him. <em>Moore v Cable, </em>1 <em>Johns. Ch. Rep. </em>385. <em>Bostock v Blakeney, 2 Bro. Ch.

Can the court look into the decree of 1822? It has been contended, on the other side, that this court, cannot, there being no appeal in time. The chancellor considered himself tue very court by whom the decree was pronounced, and he would not disturb it. Does the act of assembly limiting appeals, apply to final decrees only, and to discretionary appeals from deci\u2019etal orders or interlocutory decrees? The decree of JR22 must be considered as justifying an appeal from it if the party choose to appeal; but the party was not bound to appeal then, but might wait the final decree to be made, before lie appealed. It is a privilege given to the party to appeal yr not, until a final decree is pronounced. On an appeal from a final decree, the appellate court goes back to all interlocutory orders or decrees which took place in the action. It is the policy of the court to discountenance so many appeals, when one would answer every purpose. It would' otherwise be making one case the mother of many appeals. <em>Thompson v. M'Kim, </em>6 <em>Harr. &amp; Johns. </em>302 <em>Snowden v Dorsey, Ih. </em>114. It is often difficult to draw the line whore the appeal may be made, and where it should not. The party must appeal to ascertain whether or not it was a case proper for an appeal. Should he not appeal, he might be precluded, at the time of the final decree, from showing that the interlocutory decree should not have passed. All this may be easily obvialcd by permitting the party to wait the event of the suit, and then appeal from all that had taken place, and urge any errors apparent on the record. Atkinson <em>v Manks, </em>1 <em>Cowan\u2019s Rep. 702. Norwood v Norwood, 2 Harr. &amp; Johns. </em>241. But it has been said that, the decree of 1822 was a final decree. How can it be said to be'\u2019 final when it does not put an end to the suit, or the cause off the docket? The decree of 1822 did nothing more than annul the deeds, and direct a sale of the premises.

If the bill does not on the face of it, make out a case, the court will not sustain it. It requires neither a plea nor demurrer to a bill, where it does not make a proper case of itself. If the court discover that all the proper parties are not before the court, they will not decide the case. Here the claim of the complainants is against <em>Henderson </em>and <em>Rogers, </em>and the bill is against <em>Rogers </em>individually. <em>Henderson </em>should have been made a party.

A creditor must ascertain his claim at law before he can go into equity, if fraud standsin the wayof his getting his debt paid.</p>\n<p data-order=\"150\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b264-8\">There is no case of fraud either by the bill, or proof sufficient to justify the decree. The bill must allege that the complainants are defrauded by the deeds they seek to annul. Here the bill does.not allege the deeds to be fraudulent conveyances. It is an equivocal bill. Suppose the bill is free from all exceptions, does the evidence make out a case of fraud against <em>Striked </em>The answer, testimony and declarations of <em>Rogers </em>are not evidence against <em>Strike, </em>and if stricken from the case as not evidence, there is nothing left of a shadow of fraud. The answer of <em>Strike </em>has not been overthrown by any testimony in the cause. There arc not two positive witnesses impeaching the answer. His answer is to a bill of discovery, and is entitled to greater weight than an answer in \u00e1re ordinary case. The whole of <em>Rogers\u2019s </em>evidence, if taken into the case, does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>prove fraud in <em>Strike. Rogers </em>being consid ired as plaintiff, liis evidence operates against him, and cannot be used in favour of the complainants; but <em>Strike </em>may use it for his benefit, if he thinks proper. Where one defendant claims under his codefendant, the answer of one is evidence against the other; but in the alleged case of turpitude it is not so. Besides here, <em>Rogers </em>is in fact a complainant. <em>Rogers, </em>in his answer, says the deeds were to shield the property from being liable for the debts of <em>Henderson, </em>which fell upon the firm of <em>Henderson </em>and Rogers. So is the evidence of three other witnesses, to whom <em>liogers </em>had applied to take a deed of the property. This Shows that the deeds were not intended to defraud the complainants of their debt. If the deeds were not to defraud the very creditors who go to vacate them, they are not void. It must be charged in the bill, and proved that the deeds were to defraud the complainants. The statute of 13 <em>Elizabeth </em>does not look to any such intention, upon which to ground -a fraud in a case like this. The deeds were intended to protect the property against debts for which it was not liable. They cannot, therefore, be considered as void \u2014 not being to defraud any real creditor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"151\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b265-5\">If the decree of sale be right, yet the complainants, to be entitled to equity, must do equity before they can recover their claim. In <em>England </em>no relief is granted where deeds are set aside, &amp;e. unless upon the ground of replacing the party where he was before the deeds were executed; and this, too, in cases of atrocious frauds. The case of a creditor makes no distinction. These complainants could not have relief, except upon <em>Strike </em>being paid for all advances, improvements, &amp;c. At law it would be different. A plaintiff having a judgment might levy an execution on the property fraudulently conveyed, and the fraudulent grantee has no redress. But in equity it is otherwise; there the claimant must do equity in order to entitle him to obtain it. There is no distinction between a creditor complainant, and a grantor complainant, on either going into a court of equity to have a deed set aside. The fraudulent grantee must be placed in the situation he was orginally, <em>Watt v Grove, 2 Sch. &amp; Lef. </em>501. <em>Herne v Meeres, </em>1 <em>Vern. </em>465. It has been said that there is a distinction between an absolute and constructive fraud,. In the first case the fraudulent grantee has no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>relief, but in the latter he is t\u00f3 be reimbursed for all advances, &amp;c. Are the deeds in this case absolutely fraudulent? As to the distinction between absolute and constructive fraud, the court are referred to <em>Rob. on Fraud. Convey. 451, (anAnote a.) </em>There is no distinction between covin and fraud; and equity never considers whether a deed be void or voidable \u2014 that is done at law. A deed cannot be set aside <em>in part </em>for fraud \u2014 it must be <em>in tolo: </em>1 <em>Madd.

This cause originat\u00e9d on the equity side of <em>Baltimore </em>county court, and was removed to the court of chancery, under the provisions of the act of 1824, <em>ch. </em>196, where it received a final determination. On the 28th of May 1822, the county court, expressed, an \u00a9pinion, that the deeds; of the 16th of January 1811, from <em>Rogers </em>to <em>Strike, </em>mentioned in the proceedings, were executed for the purpose of defrauding, the creditors of <em>Rogers, </em>.and without <em>bona fide </em>consideration, and ordered, adjudged and decreed, that the said deeds were null' and void as against the complainants; and. further ordered, adjudged and decreed, that the property therein contained be sold, and that <em>Henry W. </em>Rogers-and. <em>Samuel Moale- </em>be appointed trustees, for the purpose of making the sale. And all equities as to the distribution of the proceeds of sale, were reserved by the court for hearing, on the trustees\u2019 report, or bringing into court the money or securities arising on the sale. The auditor then stated an account,, which was excepted to1 by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>both parties; but the exceptions were not acted upon before the case was transferred to the court of chancery, where it made its appearance in October 1825. It was argued at large upon 5ts merits at March term 1S26, and on the 10th of April following, the chancellor referred it to the auditor in chancery, to state an account, having in view the explanations, determinations and directions, made and given by him; and he overruled the former auditor\u2019s statements and reports, so far as the same were inconsistent with his then determinations and directions. Pursuant to these directions of the chancellor the auditor stated and reported two accounts. One between the estate of <em>Rogers </em>and the trustees, and the other between <em>Strike </em>and the same estate. And in the last account, <em>Strike </em>is charged with rents and profits, to a large amount, and has received no credit or allowance for necessary and permanent improvements, taxes, ground rent, or sums assessed for the extension of <em>Pratt street. </em>To this report he took many exceptions, all of which the chancellor overruled, and by his order of the 15th of May 1826, the report and statements of the auditor were ratified and confirmed; and the trustees were directed to apply the proceeds accordingly, with the interest that had been, or might be received. And the chancellor further ordered, that <em>Strike </em>pay to the complainants $5907 01, with interest thereon from the 14th of September 1822 until paid, with the costs, not included in the report of the auditor, to be taxed by the register.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">From these several decrees and orders <em>Strike </em>appealed to this court, and they present the subjects which are now to engage our attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">The appeal from the decision of the county court of the 28th of May 1822, has given rise to a point in this court, that could not have arisen before the chancellor. It has been made a question, wliether that appeal was taken within the time prescribed by the acts of assembly. It was taken on the 29th of May 1826, and when more than three years had elapsed from the time of making the decision. For <em>Strike </em>it was strenuously argued, that it was not a final decree, and therefore not within the operation of the act of 1807, <em>eh. </em>151; while his opponents\u2019 counsel as warmly urged it to be a final and conclusive judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>ment; and that if considered a decretal order only, the appeal was equally barred by length of time.- \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"A5CB\">\u2022 Our examination of this point has been anxious and diligent, and it has conducted us to the conclusion, that it is unnecessary to determine on the nature of the decision; for whether it is a final decree, or only a decretal Older,' the appeal from it appears to have come too late. If viewed as a decretal order of <em>Baltimore </em>county court, it should have been appealed from within nine months from the time of making it, by the terms of the act of <em>1785, ch. 72, s. 27. </em>This act was passed long before the enlargement Of the equity jurisdiction of the county courts; but when that jurisdiction, within the legitimate sphere of its operation, was made concurrent and co-extensive with the powers of' the court of chancery, it necessarily took with it all the laws and regulations relating to equity matters in that high tribunal, and among others, it carried with it all the provisions of this act of assembly. It must th.en be considered on a footing with a decretal order in the court of chancery, which is to he appealed from within nine months from the time of making it. This is not a permissive privilege, as was said in argument, to be exercised or not in the election of the party, and to be postponed at his pleasure until the final decree. The law is imperative, and .the alleged error, if insisted on, must be appealed from within nine months from the time of making the order, and not afterwards.</p>\n<p id=\"AML\">The phraseology of the act is too plain to be mistaken, and. whatever inconvenieneies in practice our construction of it may produce, it is conceived it can be made to bear no other. With all our research we have been unable to light upon a case where our courts have given to the act a more convenient interpretation; and we confess we should have been much relieved, if such an adjudication could have been found to have been made by them. We would, willingly have taken it for our guide, and made it the foundation of our judgment- But in the absence of an adjudged case, we feel that we are bound to construe'the act agreeably to its language; and it in. terms is, that the appeal be .made within nine months from the time of making the decision appealed from, and not afterwards.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">The disposition thus made of the question on the time of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>appeal, makes it unnecessary to examine into several points discussed before us. They were suggested by the proceedings anterior to the decision of the 28th of May 1822, and in strictness were improperly brought into the argument. Excluding them from our consideration, it only remains for us to express in general terms our entire approbation of the steps pursued by the chancellor in the case, after it was transferred to his court. He very properly viewed all the proceedings as having taken place in the same tribunal, and treating the decree of May 1822 as a final decree, he went on to settle and complete what it left undetermined. The complainants\u2019 bill prayed that the defendants might be made to account for rents and profits; and on the 3 0th of April 1826, he referred the case to the auditor to state an account, including rents and profits, with other matters in the cause. In this he was clearly right. The decree had established the fraudulent conduct of the defendants, and vacated the deeds from the one to the other; and surely if <em>Strike\u2019s </em>possession of the property conveyed commenced in fraud, his continuation of that possession partook no less, of the same illicit character; and it may be well received as a settled principle of equity, <em>that </em>whosoever <em>comes </em>into the possession of an estate by fraud, must account for rents and profits, when the fraudulent conveyance is vacated and set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">The further directions of the chancellor to reject from the account allowances for advances and improvements made by Strike, we think also perfectly correct. The reserved equities of the decree had no view to the interest of <em>Strike; </em>arid the bleeds having'been annulled, because they originated in a frau\u00bb' dalent combination to cheat the creditors of <em>Rogers, </em>they are to be considered void <em>ah initio, </em>and wholly \u00ab'anting in legal fitness to stand as securities <em>for any </em>advances whatsoever. They have, in truth, no lawful existence; and to use the words of an eminent civilian, \u201cit would be inconsistent and absurd to recognize them for any lawful purpose.\u201d The quoted passage of <em>Sugd. </em>525, furnishes a sound practical rule for rejecting claims for improvements, where the transaction is tainted with fraud. It is expressed nearly in these words: If a man has acted fraudulently, and is conscious of a defect in his title, and with that con\u00bb <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>viction on his mind, expends a sum of money in improvements* he is not entitled to avail himself of it.. Its just application to <em>Strike\u2019s </em>situation is too obvious to be enlarged upon. His deeds from <em>Rogers </em>were grossly fraudulent in fact, being made under corrupt motives to cheat, and his improvements were made soon after, while his conscience was broad awake to his title, and his mind probably engaged in contrivances to escape detection.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">The chancellor\u2019s last order of the 15th of May 1826, ratified the auditor\u2019s statements and report, made in, conformity to his. directions, and by it <em>Strike\u2019s </em>numerous exceptions were properly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">DECREE AFFIRMED!</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
