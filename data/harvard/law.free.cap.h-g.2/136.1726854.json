Action of replevin for certain negro slaves, brought in the lifetime of the appellee\u2019s intestate, against the appellant. The death of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>then plaintiff was suggested, and the appellee, as his administrator, was made plaintiff. The sureties in the replevin bond entered into by the plaintiff before the issuing the writ of replevin, were <em>George G. Jlshcom </em>and <em>John C. Jlshcom. </em>The, defendant pleaded property in himself, to which issue was joined.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-5\">At the trial the plaintiff produced and swore <em>John C. Jlsh&lt;aom. </em>who gave important testimony to the jury on the issue joined. Other witnesses were then examined by the plaintiff and defendant, when the hour for adjourning the court arrived. When the court were about to adjourn, they gave notice to the counsel on both sides, that they would permit no other testimony to be. examined in the case the next day; if they had any other they* must then examine it; and the counsel answered they had none. The court then adjourned. At the meeting of the court, the next morning, the case was taken up for trial, when the defendant, by his counsel, prayed the court to instruct the jury, that they would discard from their consideration, in making up their verdict in this case, the testimony of the said <em>John C. </em>Jlshcom, it having been discovered, since the said witness was examined, that he was a surety in the replevin bond given in this ease by the plaintiff, and, therefore, incompetent. Which fact, was admitted. The counsel for the plaintiff objected to the instruction to the jury as prayed for. And the court told the counsel for the defendant, that if he would state that he had not, yesterday known the fact, that the witness was surety in the replevin bond, that then they would now discard his testimony, otherwise they would not. The counsel answered that they had discovered it when they were taking up the papers at the time of the adjournment of the court on yesterday. The Court, [A'A<em>phen, </em>Ch. J. and <em>Plater, </em>A. J. ] then refused to give the said instruction, alleging that the application was too late; and instructed the jury to consider the testimony of the said <em>John C. Jlshcom </em>as competent \u2014 the witnesses all having been discharged the preceding day. The defendant excepted; and the verdict and judgment being for the plaintiff, the defendant appealed to <em>this </em>court.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>The cause was argued before Buchanan, Ch.

We are of opinion that the judgment in this case ought to be reversed, and a <em>procedendo </em>awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">The court clearly erred in refusing to direct the jury to discard the testimony of <em>John C. Jlshcom, </em>who was manifestly an incompetent witness in the cause. The rule now is, if it is discovered, during any part of the trial, that a witness is interested\u2019, his evidence shall be struck out. The reason assigned for not striking out the evidence of <em>John C. Jlshcom, </em>appears to us to be an insufficient one. No witness in the cause gave the im~, portant testimony delivered by <em>John C. Jlshcom, </em>and it is presumable none of the witnesses were in possession of the facts narrated by him. If then new witnesses were to be sought for to supply his place, it could have been as well done the second day of the trial, as on the first, and the plaintiff\u2019s predicament was in no way changed by the adjournment. Neither does there appear any thing like a disposition in the defendant, tc&gt; ensnare his adversary, by disregarding the promise made by him, to produce no new testimony at the adjourned meeting of the court. He offered no new evidence the next day, and only objected to testimony laid before the jury by the plaintiff, on a ground which came to his knowledge, when the jury were for the day discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-10\">JUDGMENT REVERSED, AND PROCEDENDO ORDERED\u00bb</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
