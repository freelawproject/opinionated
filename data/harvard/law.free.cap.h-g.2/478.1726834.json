The plaintiff\u2019s dissolution was legally in evidence; and the court ought to have granted the instruction to the <em>jury, </em>that the plaintiff, <em>upon the evidence, </em>was not entitled to recover. Even if the court were right in-refusing the defendant\u2019s prayer, their <em>judgment </em>ought to have been for the defendant, <em>non obstante veredicto; </em>as the plaintiff\u2019s dissolution was shewn by the record. 3.

Where an act of assembly, incorporating a bank, reserves-to the state the right of subscribing for stock; and also provides for the prosecution of its directors, by indictment, in, case of fraud, &amp;c. it is a public law, and must be judicially noticed by the court. <em>Towson v Havre de Grace Bank, </em>6 <em>Harr. </em>&amp; <em>Johns. </em>47. The testimony adduced was not <em>sufficient </em>to prove the corporate existence. The act o\u00ed the legislature of <em>Pennsylvania, </em>under the authority of which the governor professes to have acted, ought also to have been shewn. The recital in the <em>charter-,, </em>is no proof of the existence of the Jaw. <em>2 Starkie\u2019s Evidence, 568. Laws U. S. 26th May </em>1790. But admitting the existence of \u201can act relating to banks,\u201d does it confer the powers undertaken to be exercised, by the governor? It is not recited in <em>hcec verba; </em>and the governor may have misconstrued the law. When a law is proved, it is for the court to construe it,- and decide upon its effect. <em>Conrequa v Willing, et al. </em>1 <em>Peter\u2019s Rep. 229. </em>The governor may have failed to gratify all the provisions of the law.

The charter was <em>functus officio </em>when offered in evidence. By its own limitation the corporation was dissolved. The court could not road part of the paper, and reject the residue. The proof was <em>felo de se. </em>There is a-difference between evidence <em>introduced </em>by the plaintiff, and testimony <em>offered </em>by the defendant. The latter can give nothing in evidence, under the general issue, which has occurred subsequent to the commencement of the suit, because it would be a <em>surprise </em>on the plaintiff. 1 <em>Chitty\u2019s Pl. </em>472, But the operation of <em>evidence, </em>when introduced by the plaintiff, would seem to be the same, as if introduced by the defendant, under an appropriate plea. The plaintiff\u2019s dissolution was a total extinction of the debt. 1 <em>Levins, </em>237, cited in 1 <em>Blk. Com. </em>482. 2 <em>Kent\u2019s Com. 246 There </em>was no plaintiff in being; the attorney\u2019s warrant to appear was re.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>voiced by the plaintiff\u2019s dissolution. But, at all events, the <em>judgment </em>of the court was error, notwithstanding <em>the issue found </em>in favour of ihe plaintiff. <em>Le Bret v Papillon, </em>4 <em>East, </em>502. This court will give such <em>judgment, </em>as the court below should have given. <em>Ibid. </em>The inquiry is, whether the <em>judgment </em>is right.

The court will take notice of the calendar, of leap year, &amp;c. 1 <em>Chitty\u2019s Plead. 221. </em>The year 1824 was leap year; and the notice to the endorser was not in due time. 2 <em>Stark.

That by an act of assembly of <em>Pennsylvania </em>passed in 1824, the time of its limitation was extended to 1833. At the time of the trial the plaintiff\u2019s counsel had not in their possession this continuing law, duly authenticated. It forms no part of the record, and is now only stated to prevent an impression that the bank is dissolved.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b492-7\">Where there is a general prayer to the court to instruct the jury, all evidence not objected to is considered as admitted. It takes the fact from the jury, and submits a question of law to the court, as a demurrer to evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b492-8\">There is no error in the court\u2019s rejecting a prayer, unless it ought to have prevailed in the very terms in which it was made. 11 <em>Wheat </em>94.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b492-9\">The court could not, in any state of pleadings, grant the prayer in the terms in which it was made. If the defendant below bad plead specially, the expiration of the charter after the commencement of the action,- and the plaintiff had demurred to the plea, the court could only have ruled, \u201cthat the plaintiff ought not further to haye or maintain his action.\u201d This direr.-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>tion would have admitted that the action was well brought, and would have suspended the suit until the plaintiff had removed the disability; whereas the direction as prayed by the defendant below would have all the effect of a plea to the merits, and would have operated as a complete bar lo the plaintiff\u2019s claim. 7 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>194, <em>(note a.) Le Bret v Papillon, </em>4 <em>East, </em>506.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b493-5\">There is an essential difference between the death of a natural person and a corporation. Whenever the death of a natural person happens pending the writ, the right descends to the representative, and a new cause of action springs up; and the plea is not, therefore, in the same condition as it was in the lifetime of the party; the suit abates at common law, because the death introduces a new party, and a new cause of action. <em>Gilb. H C. P. </em>195. 1 <em>Bac. Ab. </em>7. 6 <em>Wheat. 262. </em>Not so in the case of a corporation; it is a creature of the iaw, and its existence can be continued by the legislature beyond the term originally granted. The plea is in the same condition as when living under its original charter. The expiration of its original term does not abate the suit \u2014 neither the party nor the rights are altered. The plaintiffs below had no right to anticipate a defence which might arise after the action was commenced. The defendant\u2019s plea did not apprize them of this defence, and all pleadings are designed lo give the parties an opportunity to answer as to traverse the facts alleged. The court eould not deny the plaintiffs the right to reply sufficient matter to avoid the defence, if the defendant had pleaded it, and being bound to plead it, he is estopped from giving it in evidence under the general issue. The plea of <em>non assumpsit </em>speaks of the time past, and goes to the commencement of the action. 1 <em>Salk. 278. </em>3 <em>Term. </em>186. 4 <em>East, </em>507. 9 <em>East, 85</em>. Under this issue the plaintiff is only bound to prove the traversable facts mentioned in his nar, and which are put in issue by the plea. A corporation need not aver in the declaration that they are a corporation. In the case at bar, the parties to'the promissory note recognize the <em>Bank of Gettysburg </em>as a bank, by making the debt payable <em>at the Bank of Gettysburg without defalcation, </em>and are estopped by this admission to say otherwise, on the general issue. The general issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>being pleaded, the plaintiffs are not bound to shew they are a&lt; body corporate, <em>Whittington v Farmers Bank, 5 Harr. &amp; Johns. </em>489.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b494-4\">The defendant under this issue may give in evidence \u2014 1st-No cause of action. 2dly. That the plaintiff had no subsisting, cause <em>of action at the commencement of the suit. </em>1 <em>Chitty, 472. </em>But the defendant cannot give in evidence <em>any matter </em>which arose <em>after the commencement </em>of the suit; not even payment; nor the statute of limitations, though it appear from&lt; the plaintiffs own shewing, or even from the declaration itself,that the cause of action did not arise within six years. These fac+s must be plead. 2 <em>Stark. on Evid. </em>129. 3 <em>Serg. </em>&amp; Lowb. 6. A jury can take no cognizance of any fact done since the; action brought, for that was not in issue. <em>Gilb. H. P. C. </em>106.

Payment after action, brought cannot be given in evidence under the general issue,, but must be introduced by plea. <em>Holland v Jourdine, </em>1 <em>Holt, </em>6, reported in 3 <em>Serg. &amp; Lowb. 6. </em>The expiration of the charter <em>after the action brought </em>is a dilatory plea. It is not a plea to the action or the merits. 3 <em>Blk. Com. </em>301. 5 <em>Harr. &amp; Johns. </em>489. It is a special plea, and not technically a plea in abatement, it concludes to the person, and if allowed, sus\u00bb pends the remedy, until the\" disability is removed. 3 Blk. <em>Com. </em>301, 3. The defendant was not bound to plead it <em>puis dar. cont. </em>nor in further maintenance, &amp;c. He was bound to plead it specially so as to enable the plaintiff to reply or to demur, and the court would have received the plea any time before the jury had given their verdict. <em>3 Caine\u2019s Rep. 172. 7 Johns.

Whether the facts should come from one party or the o'ther to bring the plaintiffs within, or <em>to </em>take the plaintiffs out of, the disability to sue, it is very clear that every <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>fact must appear on the record, which negatives their right to sue. <em>2 Gallison, </em>130.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b495-5\">In the case at bar, in the trial below, the defendant did not \u2022by plea, negative the plaintiff\u2019s right to sue or to prosecute the suit to judgment, for the charter though given in evidence, formed no part of the record below, and not appearing on their record, the court could not give the direction as prayed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b495-6\">The plaintiffs produced the charter to sustain their right and capacity to bring the suit, and objected to the defendant\u2019s using it as the evidence of any fact, to support a defence arising from any new matter sinee the commencement of the action. The court below, by rejecting the defendant\u2019s prayer, would not receive it as evidence under the general issue. The defendant excepted, and the charter is made a part of the bill of exceptions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b495-7\">If upon <em>the </em>pleadings in this cause, the charter was improperly submitted to the jury, the court of appeals will reject it, whether produced by the plaintiffs or defendant. 7 <em>Harr. </em>&amp; <em>Johns. </em>50, and the cases there cited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b495-8\">In <em>Morgan v Painter, </em>in 6 <em>Term. </em>265, it appeared in evidence that the plaintiff was a <em>feme covert, </em>yet the court would not receive it under the general issue, but drove the defendant to his plea. No admission of the parties can, or ought to restrain the court from looking into the record. 2 <em>Saund. </em>101. 1 <em>Salk. </em>270. If upon looking at the record, I should see that the defence did not arise till after the action brought, I should say that the evidence given did not apply to the plea so pleaded.. 6 <em>East, </em>416.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b495-10\">To the <em>second </em>part, of the <em>first point. </em>The appellees\u2019 counsel reply, that the patent is authenticated under the seal of the Commonwealth of <em>Pennsylvania, </em>which by the consent of nations is received, as the ultimate limit of proof, beyond which no solemnity of authentication is required. Letters patent, if not duly authenticated, according to the rules of the common laws, or the provisions of the acts of Congress, may be rejected, but when they are received, the seal imparts to it all the character of the state. It gives to the instrument to which it is ap-* pended, absolute verity. To impeach its statements in toto or in part, would be to impugn the veracity of the state, whose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>seal it bears. The patent is as full proof of the act of assembly it recites, as o\u00ed the charter itself, which creates the <em>Bank of Gettysburg, </em>a body corporate. The appellees are at a loss to perceive the distinction attempted to be made by the appellant\u2019s counsel, \u201cthat the letters patent are admissible evidence, but that they are not sufficient <em>per se </em>to prove that the corporation ever existed; to prove this, the act of assembly vesting the power in the' governor, should have been given in evidence.\u201d This argument seems to imply a distinction between the proof of the power and the charter. If the letters patent are made evidence by reason of the seal of the state being annexed thereto, they must <em>se, </em>prove all the facts contained in the patent, for the whole is greater,than its part. When the governor recites his power to grant a charter, and authenticates this fact under the seal of the state, it would be impeaching the legal effect of the seal to call in question his power to issue the patent. The seal proves the power, as well as the charter. For any higher evidence of the power to grant the charter, than the seal itself imports, is impossible, and to require extrinsic evidence of it, would be to subvert the rule itself, that a national seal is the.highest proof of authenticity. <em>U.

The courts of <em>Maryland </em>will not permit the question to be tried <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>collaterally in this form of action. 5 <em>Johns. Ch.

Rep. </em>230. 3 <em>Cowen, 263. </em>That <em>David Edie </em>was a notary, and that he had the lawful possession of the note, is abundantly manifest Irom the testimony taken under the commission in the cause. He presented the note, and protested it for nonpayment; this proves him to have been at least the agent of the holders, until it is shewn he acted as a stranger and without authority. 3 <em>Cowen, </em>263.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b497-7\">The year 1824 was a leap year; the 28th February, the 3d day of grace when the note was protested, was Saturday.

When the 3d day of grace is Saturday, notice of. nonpayment need not be given till Monday. 3 <em>Cowen, </em>262. 2 <em>Caine\u2019s, </em>343. 2 <em>Campb. </em>602.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b497-8\"><em>Palmer, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A4xC\">Two important questions occur in this case \u2014 1. Whether under the general issue plea,, the defendant can give in evidence the nonexistence of the plaintiffs asa corporation? 2. Whether there has been sufficient offered by the plaintiffs to entitle them to recover?</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b497-9\">1. There was not evidence offered by the plaintiffs to shew that the charter existed at the trial, or indeed that it ever had existed. The letters patent offered in evidence are different from charters granted by the king in <em>England. </em>They are different from grants of land in this state. Letters patent are evidence of law; but grants of land are evidence of title. In this case there was a specially delegated power vested in the governor, by an act of assembly, to grant the charter on certain requisites being complied with. Under the general issue a private corporation is bound to produce its charter. A corporation has ideal existence; and it must be proved that the suit is in the corporate name. <em>Bank of Auburn v Weed, 19 Johns. Rep. </em>300. <em>Henriques v Dutch West India Company, 2 Ld. Raym. </em>1535. In <em>Whittington v The Farmers Bank, &amp;c. </em>the court refused to receive the plea, the rule day having expired.

The plaintiffs must prove that they were a corporate body, not only when the suit was brought, but also at the time of the trial. As to the manner of granting charters in England, and the effect of them, he referred to 2 <em>Kent\u2019s Com. </em>246. 2 <em>Bac. Ab. </em>3. Case of <em>Sutton\u2019s </em>Hospital, 10 <em>Coke, </em>33. Here there was a special delegated power to the governor to .grant the charter; and the plaintiffs ought to have shewn the authority by which such power was delegated, in order that it might be seen that he had strictly complied with the directions given. <em>Gilbert v The Columbia Turnpike Company, 3 Johns.

It would go to defeat the action, and to show that there was no existing cause of action, or person, to recover \u2014 that the right to recover was at an end. Pleading is for the purpose of not taking the party by surprise. 1 <em>Chitty\u2019s Plead. </em>215. Here there could be no surprise. What plea could the defendant have pleaded? Notjtmis <em>darein continuance </em>\u2014 * not in further maintenance of the suit, like the case of an alien enemy, which is only in suspension of the action. Here the debt was extinguished. There was no party in court, or ever could be. What was there to put in issue?

The various questions which have been discussed arise on the general prayer that the plaintiff is not entitled to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">The general issue having been plead, the plaintiff, to support the issue on his part, and to shew that at the commencement of the suit he had a right to sue, offered in evidence letters patent issued by the governor of <em>Pennsylvania </em>under the great seal of that state, whereby it appeared that the <em>Gettysburg Bank, </em>anterior to the suit, was a regularly chartered company of that commonwealth. By the same letters patent it appears that the charter of the bank had, by its own limitation, expired between the time of bringing the suit, and the time of trial. The defendant contends, that as it appears from the letters patent that the charter had expired, and that the corporation was extinet, he had a right to use the same as evidence under the issue, and that as it thus appeared the corporation had no longer any existence, the plaintiff was not entitled to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"Avp\">The cases are very conclusive to shew, that where matter of defence arises after the institution of the suit, it must in general be specially plead, and cannot be given in evidence under the general issue, as in the case of a release given after the commencement of the suit, or a reference and award made <em>pendente lite, </em>or hostile alienage happening after the commencement of the action, or coverture of the plaintiff after action brought, or any matter of ahatement occurring after suit brought, or after plea pleaded to the merits. All other matters which go to the foundation and gist of the plaintiff\u2019s action, at the time of its commencement, with some very special exceptions, which it would be unnecessary to enumerate, may be given in evidence under the general issue. Defences arising after the commencement of the action, should be plead <em>puis darein continuance, </em>or against the further maintenance of the suit. It was said by Lord <em>Mansfield, </em>in <em>Sullivan v Montague, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>1 <em>Doug. </em>106, that <em>actio non </em>went to. the time of plea pleaded, \u00e1nd not to the commencement of the action; but this doctrine 3has been overruled, by subsequent cases, as departures from the law. 3 <em>T. R. </em>185. 4 <em>East, 503; </em>and the rule now is, that when the defendant pleads the general issue in assumpsit, he asserts, that at the time of the commencement of the suit some reason existed which should have prevented the plaintiff from bringing his action. This doctrine is supported by several cases of high authority, and by esteemed compilers and elementary books on pleading. It is a doctrine too, as we apprehend, in general founded in justice, and calculated to prevent surprize. <em>Chitty\u2019s Plead. </em>531, 635, and the authorities there referred to. .</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">If then the defendant could not, under the general issue, have given in evidence the dissolution of the charter subsequent to the institution of the suit, it is quite impossible to say that he can nevertheless avail himself of the fact to nonsuit the plaintiff because that fact appears in the letters patent, which, the plaintiff is compelled to adduce. Whether the bank was dissolved or not pending the suit, was not in issue, and the fact of the dissolution of the charter having taken place after the commencement of the action, was not pertinent, to the issue, and was not in evidence before the jury. The fact which the jury had to ascertain was, whether the corporation had a right to sue at the commencement of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">It is, however, said, that by the dissolution of the charter of the bank, the debts due to it were extinguished, that this therefore is matter which goes to the merits of the defendant\u2019s case, and can be given in evidence under the general issue. It is not necessary that we should express any opinion on the question how far the debts of a corporation are extinguished by the dissolution of its charter, whatever our views on that question maybe, not considering that, its determination is necessarily involved in this case, for we have seen that such a defence,, arising after the commencement of the suit, would be no bar to the suit, where the defendant chooses to rest his defence on the general issue. On the admission of the correctness of the above doctrines, the defendant contends, that it was necessary it should be shewn on the trial, to enable, the bank to main<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>Iain the suit, that it was incorporated, and that if necessary the evidence adduced is insufficient for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">That, on the general issue, it was necessary for the plaintiff to shew its charter of incorporation, is clear, as will be seen by a reference to the following authorities. <em>2 Ld. Raym. </em>1535. 1 <em>Strange, </em>612. 2 <em>Bac. Ab. </em>212. This law is adopted in News <em>York </em>by numerous decisions <em>8 Johns. Rep. </em>375. 14 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>245. 19 <em>Johns Rep. </em>300. <em>2 Cowan, </em>378.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">At first view it might be supposed that this question had been decided differently in the <em>Farmers Bank v </em>Whittington, <em>5 Harr. &amp; Johns, </em>and that the want of a charter could only be taken advantage of by a plea in abatement. But an attentive examination of the case will shew that such was not the judgment of the court. The charter of the <em>Farmers Bank of Somerset </em>was a public law, which judicial tribunals were bound to notice, and being such, the plaintiff could not, before he could make out his title to recover, be called upon to shew in evidence that which the court were bound <em>ex officio </em>to notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">Upon authority it is clear that the plaintiff, to maintain his ease, must shew that by law he has been effectually created a corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-10\">Has the plaintiff exhibited evidence that the bank was duly incorporated? This evidence consists solely of a charter granted by the governor of the state of <em>Pennsylvania </em>to the bank, reciting his authority, by the laws of that state, to make such grants, and authenticated by the great seal of that state. The evidence thus offered, it is said, is deficient in this, that the laws of Pennsylvania, authorising the governor to issue his letters patent, in this respect should be proved to the court as other facts are proven, that the court might adjudge and determine whether the governor had complied with his powers. This objection is grounded by the counsel upon the general and well established principle, that specially delegated authorities must be strictly pursued, and that the court must have before them what will enable them to say whether these powers har-e been legally pursued or lawlessly transcended. But we think, that when the foundation of this principle is examined, it will1 be found inapplicable to the present case. This strictness in the execution of special authorities, is demanded, because every <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>delegation of them is in derogation of the common law, and of the rights conferred by it on the citizen. Have we judicial notice from the record, or otherwise, that this special power, delegated by a law of the Commonwealth of <em>Pennsylvania, </em>derogates from the rights of her citizens? The rights of her citizens, (except as members of the Union,) we mean their rights derived from her own municipal regulations, cannot be noticed by us. If the defendant had desired to place himself in a proper attitude to raise the objection, he should have exhibited proof in the record that the grant of this charter, a\u00bb made, derogated from the rights of individuals as established by the laws of that commonwealth. The laws securing those rights, alleged to have been trenched upon by this charter, should have been proven as other facts; until that was done, the question obviously could not arise.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">But in any aspect which can be given to the case, can this act of the governor be classed among the cases of special authorities, and subjected to all the limitations and restrictions which judicial determinations have put upon the execution of such power? It. is on his part neither the exercise of a judicial or ministerial authority, but the fulfilment of a high, executive trust and confidence; and it would certainly be demanded by that comity which is due from one sovereign state to another, that we should presume, until the contrary is proven, that the public acts of the chief magistrate of such state, purporting to be in execution of the laws, were legitimate acts, and within the scope of his powers as such officer, until the contrary is established by the proof of the laws themselves, by which it should be made to appear that he had overstepped the boundaries prescribed to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">But it is contended by the defendant, that notwithstanding the court might have been right in the general direction which, they gave, yet that, as it appears from the evidence in the bill of exceptions that the corporation was dissolved, the court were still bound, although the verdict was for the plaintiff, to have entered judgment for the defendant. In answer to this It may be briefly said, if there were not other objections to such a course, that the defendant would be in no condition to have made such a requisition on the court, until it had been spread <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>upon the pleadings in the cause, that the charter had expired, and such fact stood admitted by the pleadings. The bill of exceptions is no part of the pleadings, and it is alone on the pleadings and verdict that the court can be called upon to pronounce judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">The last question for our examination is the sufficiency of <em>the </em>demand and notice. The note was demanded at the <em>Bank Of Gettysburg, </em>the place at which it was payable, and on the day it was due. The demand is proven to have been made by one having possession of the note for demand, and at the place where payable, which will furnish presumptive evidence of his authority to demand and receive.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">The note fell due on Saturday, and notice was sent and delivered on Monday. It is said it should have been put in the mad at an earlier day than Monday. But there is no evidence there was any mail either on Saturday or Sunday. It cannot be pretended that it was necessary to send an express, and that too on Sunday. The notice, under the circumstances of the \u25a0case, was sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
