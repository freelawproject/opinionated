That before the issuing the original writ, to wit, on the 3d of October 1823, it was agreed between the plaintiff and defendant, that the plaintiff should deliver up the possession of the farm upon which he resided, and relinquish the residue of his term; that the same should be received in full satisfaction of all rent then in arrear, or thereafter to become due. Which said farm was then and there de\u00bb livered to the defendant, and he put in possession thereof, and the residue of the plaintiff\u2019s term therein relinquished in full satisfaction and discharge of the rent, &amp;c. and which said possession and relinquishment, the defendant then and there accepted and received of and from the plaintiff, in full satisfasSion, &amp;c.

The defendant, at the trial, proved that the rent claimed was due on the 1st of March 1823.

That the plaintiff remaining in possession of the said property on the 29th of September, the defendant, as bailiff of <em>Shade, </em>levied the distress for rent due on the 1st of March 1823; and that afterwards, in the month of October, the plaintiff left the property demised, and delivered possession thereof to <em>Hughes. </em>To which testimony the avowant objected; but the Court, <em>\\Jlrcher, </em>Ch.

We think <em>Baltimore </em>county court erred in receiving parol evidence for the purpose it was offered, as stated in the <em>first </em>bill of exceptions. <em>Gist </em>held the property .leased, under <em>Shade, </em>and that tenancy could not be determined by a parol license to quit the premises. The agreement was, that the lease should be surrendered, and the rent discharged, and is embraced within the statute of frauds, which provides, that no lease or term of years, or any uncertain interest, of or in any messuages, lands, tenements or hereditaments, shall be surrendered, unless by deed, or note in writing, or by act or operation of law. The release of the rent, and the surrender of the property, form one agreement \u2014 they cannot be separated; and to make the agreement available, it ought to have been in writing. <em>Botting v </em>Martin, 1 <em>Campb. </em>317. <em>Mollet v Brayne, </em>2 <em>Campb. </em>103. <em>Thomson v Wilson, </em>3 <em>Serg. &amp; Lowb. </em>391.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">In the <em>second </em>bill of exceptions, there was a prayer by the avowant, that the court would instruct the jury, he was entitled to recover. If the parol evidence received by the court, assisted in the <em>first </em>bill of exceptions, had been legal, this prayer might have been important, and then it would have been proper to consider the objections relied on in the argument, one of which was, a variance between the agreement offered in evidence, and that set out in the pleadings. But as this court has decided, the parol evidence of the agreement, stated in the <em>first </em>bill of exceptions, ought not to have been received by the court, that evidence must be rejected; and being rejected, the cause stood only on the pleadings and the evidence offered by the avowant. The pleadings do not controvert that <em>Lammott </em>was the bailiff of <em>Shade, </em>and it was proved by testimony the rent was due.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">We dissent from the opinions expressed by <em>Baltimore </em>county court, as stated in both bills of exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">JUDGMENT REVERSED, AND TROCEDENDO AWARDED:</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
