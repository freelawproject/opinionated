This was an action of debt, brought on the testamentary bond executed to the state on the 29th of March 1808, by <em>Robert Hanson </em>the intestate of the defendant below, (now appellee,) on the estate of <em>Theophilus Hanson, </em>as his executor. The defendant pleaded general performance, and the plaintiff replied non-performance, and assigned for breach, that <em>Theophilus Hanson, </em>the father of the said <em>Robert, </em>did in his lifetime, to wit, on, &amp;c. make, and in due form of law, sign, seal and execute, his last will and testament in writing, and thereby, after bequeathing certain specific legacies, &amp;c. bequeathed as follows, viz. <em>\u201cItem. </em>I leave and bequeath all the residue of my personal property, of what nature or kind soever, to my son <em>Robert, </em>and my daughter <em>Mary H. </em>Hanson, and their heirs, forever; in trust and confidence, nevertheless, and for the use and purposes hereafter mentioned, and no other use or purpose; that is to say, that my executors, hereafter mentioned, shall pay my just debts, and that <em>Robert Hanson </em>shall hold and enjoy absolutely one-third part of the said residue; that my said daughter, <em>Mary H Hanson, </em>shall hold one other third during her single life, and after her death or marriage, that which may be assigned for her use, shall be and remain to the children of <em>Pamela L. Briscoe; </em>and to direct and see that this provision is carried into effect, I hereby appoint <em>Robert Hanson </em>trustee for that purpose. And as to the other remaining third part of the residue aforesaid, it is my will and desire that my son <em>Robert </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number><em>Hanson, </em>and my daughter <em>Mary II. Hanson, </em>should have the legal right, and be trustees thereof; and as in the other be\u00bf quest to <em>Pamela L. Briscoe, </em>they should make use thereof in the best manner they can for the separate use and support of the said <em>Pamela L. Briscoe, </em>and her children, for and during her natural life; and at the death of the said <em>Pamela L. Briscoe, </em>the said property, last devised, is to be equally divided between all the children she may leave.\u201d And he thereby constituted and appointed his son <em>Robert Hanson, </em>and his daughter <em>Mary H. Hanson, </em>executor and executrix, trustees and overseers, of his last will and testament. And that after making and executing his last will and testament, to wit, &amp;c. the said <em>Theophilus Hanson </em>died, to wit, at the county aforesaid, by which said will and testament the said <em>Robert Hanson </em>was appointed executor thereof, and to whom letters testamentary were by the orphans court of said county, in due form of law granted. In which said last will and testament, among others, is the following clause and bequest, to wit: &lt;;that <em>Robert Hanson </em>shall hold and \u00e9njoy,\u201d &amp;c. [as set forth jn the said will.] The replication then averred, that after the execution of the said will, and death of the said <em>Theophilus, </em>the said, Afery <em>II Hanson </em>intermarried with a certain <em>Samuel Griffin, </em>which said <em>Mary, </em>as well as the said <em>Robert </em>and the said <em>Pamela, L. Briscoe, </em>have since all died; by reason whereof, and by virtue of the last will and testament aforesaid, the children of the said <em>Pamela </em>became, entitled to two-thirds of the residue of the personal estate of the said <em>Theophilus, </em>after, all necessary allowance and disbursements upon the administration of the said estate were discharged and allowed. That upon the death of the said <em>Robert, </em>letters of administration <em>de bonis non </em>upon the- estate of the said <em>Theophilus, </em>were granted to <em>Thomas\u25a0 Burgess, </em>who hath duly administered all the goods and chattels of the said deceased which came to his hands; but that the said <em>Robert </em>did not duly and properly administer the goods. and chattels of said deceased, according to the tenor and effect of the writing obligatory aforesaid, and to the condition thereof, but misapplied and wasted the same. That after the death of the said <em>Robert Hanson, </em>and marriage and death of the said <em>Mary II Hanson, </em>to wit; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>&amp;c. a certain <em>Peter </em>Griffin, in the endorsement of the original writ in this cause mentioned, was by the orphans court of <em>Charles </em>county in due form of law appointed trustee to the children of the said <em>Pamela L.

He died before the settlement of the estate, and letters of administration <em>de boriis non </em>were granted to <em>Thomas Burgess, </em>who duly administered all the property which <em>Robert Hanson, </em>the executor, did not waste. To the plaintiff\u2019s replication the defendant rejoined, and the plaintiff demurred, which the court below overruled. Three points arise upon the demurrer. 1. Whether the action can be sustained against the administratrix of the-executor, on the bond executed by the executor of <em>Theophilus Hanson, </em>for a breach of the condition of the \u2022bond? 2. Whether a decision in the orphans court, relative to the estate of a deceased person, is conclusive, and precludes the party from his action in the county court on the testamentary bond? 3. That there is such a departure in the rejoinder from the plea, as to be fatal'. '</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b448-5\">1. The <em>first point </em>is to be settled by its analogy to adjudged cases., In the cases referred to in <em>Wheatly v Lane, 1 Saund. 219, (note 8,) </em>a judgment against an executor is evidence of assets on a <em>devastavit; </em>and upon that fact being established, the debt becomes personal, and the executor\u2019s personal representative is'liable in his character of administrator or executor. In the, case now before the court, the <em>devastavit </em>is admitted, and the question does not vary from the point decided in <em>Wheatly v Lane, </em>except that the action is upon the bond for breach of the condition. By the <em>Stat. </em>30 <em>Car. </em>II. <em>ch. </em>7. and 4 &amp; 5 <em>William &amp; Mary, ch. </em>24, <em>s. </em>12, the executor or administrator of any executor, who shall waste or convert to his own use, the estate of his testator, shall be liable and chargeable in the same manner the testafor or intestate would have been if living., It seems to be evident, that if <em>Robert Hanson, </em>the executor, were living, he would be liable to the equitable plaintiffs in an action on his bond for the <em>devastavit. </em>The case of <em>Shelton v Hawling, </em>1 <em>Wils. 258, </em>seems to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>e-onclusive as to the liability of the administrator of the executor, for the <em>devastavit </em>committed by the executor. This was the principal point decided in the court below; and if the principle is correct, the administrator <em>de bonis non </em>cannot be answerable; for upon the <em>devastavit </em>being established, the debt becomes personal as to the executor, and if living, he would be chargeable <em>de bonis prop?'iis; </em>his administratrix must, therefore, be chargeable in her representative character. The action could not have been brought upon the administration bond entered into by the administratrix, for she might have administered all the goods of <em>Robert Hanson, </em>and yet the securities on his bond would not have been discharged; neither could the action be sustained against the administrator <em>debonis non, </em>for he is not in default, having administered all the goods of the testator, <em>Theophilus Hanson, </em>which came to his possession, and complied with the condition of his bond. If <em>Robert Hanson\u2019s </em>estate was insolvent, and the securities in his bond in the like situation, will it be contended that the administrator <em>de bonis non, </em>would be answerable to the distributees for the executor\u2019s <em>devastavit? </em>If such doctrine was law, who would administer after a wasteful executor? <em>Ho, </em>then, who is in default, should be chargeable for the waste. The appellee represents the executor, <em>Robert Hanson, </em>and should be chargeable for his <em>devastavit, </em>as far as she has assets of lus \u00abstate. <em>Merchant v Driver, </em>1 <em>Saund. </em>307. <em>Blackmor v Mercer, </em>3 <em>Saund. </em>403. It will not be denied that the administrator <em>de bonis non </em>could have maintained an action against the administratrix of the executor, (the appellee,) for the property which was not accounted for by the executor, <em>Robert Hanson. Haslett\u2019s Adm\u2019r. D. B. N. v Glenn, </em>7 <em>Harr. &amp; Johns. </em>17. But it is contended on the part of the equitable plaintiffs, (the appellants,) that an action is given to them on <em>Robert Hanson\u2019s </em>bond, by the acts of assembly of 1718, <em>ch. </em>5; 1798, <em>ch. </em>101, <em>sub ch. </em>3, s 10. In an action of <em>assumpsit </em>between the legatee and the executor, the law will not imply a promise, except for a specific legacy; but here the action is for a breach of the condition of the bond, and is brought for the use of those interested, against the representative of him who failed to comply with the condition of his bond to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>the state, and to \u201cdischarge the duties required of him by law in the faithful performance of the office.\u201d The state is the plaintiff, and the condition broken the cause of action. If the executor was living, can it be denied that he would be answerable in this form of action?\u2019 He is represented by the appellee, Who is chargeable with his contracts, and answerable for his broken covenants. If the legatees were-driven to their action against the administrator <em>de bonis non, </em>and be compelled to institute suit against the administratrix of <em>Robert Hanson, </em>it would be such a multiplication of suits as seems to be guarded against by the acts of 1718 and 1798, by giving to all persons interested, an action in the name of the state on the bond. Upon the breach of the condition of the bond, the executor becomes indebted to the state in the amount of the penalty, for the use of those interested. The state is truslee foi the legatees, the debt accrues -upon breach of the condition, the executor is chargeable <em>de bonis propriis, </em>and his administratrix is chargeable in her representative character for his debts. The state, as trustee for the legatees, is a creditor, and brings this action. The administratrix of the executor is bound to account for property disposed- of by the executor, and not accounted for by him. <em>Act of Ass. </em>1816, <em>ch. </em>203, <em>s. </em>3.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b450-4\">2. The proceedings in the court below were commenced prior to those had in the orphans court, and of a different character. An application to the orphans court for an order to compel a settlement, does not preclude the party interested from his action on the bond. <em>Act </em>1798, <em>ch. </em>101, <em>sub ch. </em>15, <em>s. </em>19. The county court has jurisdiction in such'cases. 1798, <em>ch. </em>101, <em>sub ch. </em>14, <em>s. </em>6. The defendant below, (the appellee,) by,her rejoinder tb the plaintiff\u2019s replication, sets out, that certain proceedings were had in the orphans court, with-' out stating the nature of those proceedings. The proceedings in that court could not'have been of the same nature, because, the act of 1798 does not give to that court jurisdiction in an action on the testamentary bond. The administrator <em>de bonis non </em>may b\u00e9 answerable for all claims iti the orphans court against the estate of <em>Theophilits Hanson, </em>(the testator,) and yet not answerable in the county court for legacies Which lie never received. The appellee should have stated in her re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>joinder, the application which was made to the orphans court, with the record of the proceedings.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b451-5\">8. The rejoinder is a departure from the plea \u2014 -the plea answers the declaration, but the rejoinder neither answers the replication, nor is it a continuation of the defence commenced <em>hy </em>the plea. The rejoinder does not support the plea. The plea alleges that <em>Robert Hanson </em>did perform the condition of the bond, &amp;c. The rejoinder states, that certain proceedings were had in another court, and that that court decided that another person was answerable for claims against the estate of <em>Theophilus Hanson. </em>This is not a claim against his estate, but against the estate of <em>Robert Hanson. </em>This is a depart ture, and does not answer the replication. 1 <em>Chit.
