The writ of <em>fieri facias </em>was made returnable on the first Tuesday of March following. By law the marshal must give 10 days notice previous to the sale. The writ of replevin was issued and executed on the 4th of March 1824, and as the 10 days notice had not then expired, the property must have, been in the custody of the law when the writ of replevin was executed; The decision in <em>Mahoney v Ashton </em>is clearly erroneous, and cannot be sanctioned by this court.

This case, it is supposed by the counsel for the appellant, is within the rule established in <em>Cromwell, et al. v Owings, </em>7 <em>Harr. &amp; Johns. </em>55; because, as is contended by them, before the execution of the writ of replevin, the goods were seized by the deputy marshal of the <em>United States </em>for the district of <em>Maryland, </em>in virtue of a <em>fieri facias </em>issued from the district court, and were by said officer held under the execution until the re\u00bb plevin was executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">This case is brought up upon a case stated, and, like a special verdict, we are not at liberty to infer facts from the evidence therein stated, but the facts relied upon must be stated. <em>Palmer v Johnson, </em>2 <em>Wils. </em>163. 2 <em>Tidd\u2019s Pr. </em>808, 809.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">That the goods replevied had been seized under a <em>fieri facias, </em>is apparent from the statement, but it is silent as to the time of seizure, or whether at the time of the replevin from the deputy marshal, the. goods were in his hands under the <em>fieri facias. </em>This might be all true, and still the goods not in the custody of the law., He might have sold them, and the purchaser may have left them in his hands, or the execution may have been countermanded,,and the property not in fact redelivered, so that it is by no means a necessary conclusion, as has been contended, that the goods were in <em>custodia legis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">There appearing t\u00f3 be no objection in the record to the legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>title of the plaintiff, and as far as the statement shows, no legal impediment arising from the execution, the judgment of the Court below must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
