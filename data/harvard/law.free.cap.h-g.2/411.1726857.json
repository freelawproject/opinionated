That the said goods and merchandize were received Into the said <em>Stansbury\u2019s </em>store, accompanied with the said invoices, which goods were examined by the witness, compared With the invoices, found to agree, and the goods were placed on. the shelves in the said store occupied by <em>Stansbury, </em>alongwith the other goods in the said store; and all the said goods were indiscriminately offered for sale as usual, and part of the goods purchased from the plaintiff were sold from time to time with the other goods, and a part of them remained in the store in the early part of August 1834. During all which time the witness had no knowledge of the hill of sale above mentioned, and considered himself as the clerk of said <em>Stansbury, </em>and all the goods in the said store as belonging to said <em>Stansbury. </em>Thai the witness was first informed that the defendant had a bill of sale for the goods in <em>Stansbury\u2019s </em>store, in the early part of August 1824, by Mr. <em>Richard Frisby, </em>the son-in-law of the defendant, who then, in her name, as her agent, demanded of the witness the key and possession of the store, which the witness refused to deliver until directed by <em>Stansbury. </em>That <em>Stansbury </em>on the same day directed the witness to deliver the key to Mr. <em>Frisby, </em>which he did; and that all the goods which remained in the store, including a part of those purchased from the plaintiff, but what proportion the witness does not know, were shortly after sold by <em>Frisby, </em>the agent of the defendant, at auction. And evidence was given, and it was admitted, that the proceeds of the sale at auction were about $2000. Which amount was received by an agent of the defeirlant, and part of it retained in satisfaction for money lent by her to <em>Stansbury, </em>and the residue applied to the payment of notes of <em>Stansbury </em>on which the defendant was security, as drawer or endorser, for the accommodation of <em>Stansbury. </em>The plaintiff also, by <em>Edward J. Richardson, </em>proved that the witness, as clerk to the plaintiff, made out the two invoices above inserted, and that the goods therein described were sold and delivered by tlw plaintiff to <em>Stansbury, </em>at, the respective dates mentioned m the said invoices. The plaintiff further offered in evidence, that the money for which the goods were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>sold at retail, was received by <em>Stansbury </em>during the months of March, April, May, and until the time when the goods in the store were delivered to Mrs. <em>Edwards, </em>and by him applied to the payment of his general debts, notes and household expenses, and to the reduction of notes which Mrs. <em>Edwards </em>had drawn or endorsed for the use and accommodation of said <em>Stansbury. </em>And the witness of the plaintiff, upon being asked by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, whether there was any agreement when the bill of. sale was executed, or at any other time, that the proceeds of the goods, or any part thereof, was to be received by Mrs. <em>Edwards, </em>the defendant, or applied to her benefit? replied, that none such was made or existed. That he himself had attended to the transaction for Mrs. Edwards, that he made none such, nor had she received any part thereof. Upon the cross examination of the plaintiff\u2019s witness by the defendant\u2019s counsel, he stated, that a note of <em>Stansbury\u2019s </em>was protested for non payment, the day before the demand was made for the key; he also stated that he himself was on a note of <em>Stansbury\u2019s, </em>and that <em>Stansbury, </em>in the said month of August, after the sale of the goods, transferred to the witness his books of accounts of the business, and the accounts, to him, to secure the debt for which he was so responsible. The defendant then prayed the opinion of the court, and their direction to the jury, that the plaintiff upon the evidence so given was not entitled to recover \u2014 1st. Because there is no evidence offered to justify the jury in finding the existence of any co-partnership between the defendant and <em>William Stansbury. 2d. </em>Because there is no evidence offered to justify the jury in finding that the said store or business was carried on by Stans<em>bury </em>for the benefit, and on account of, the defendant, and that <em>Stansbury </em>was constituted her agent for that purpose. Sd. Because there is no evidence to justify the jury in finding that the said goods, wares and merchandize, mentioned in the invoices, were sold and delivered to the defendant by the plaintiff; and no evidence of any combination on the part of the defendant to obtain the p\u2019aintiff\u2019s goods by fraud.
