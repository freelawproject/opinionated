And the plaintiff read in evidence the will of his-father, <em>Richard Berry, </em>and proved the same. By which will, dated the 26th of August 1818, the testator devised to his son <em>Elisha D. </em>Berry, (the plaintiff,) and his heirs, all the remainder of his tract of land called <em>The Charles and Benjamin, </em>not devised to his daughter <em>Deborah. </em>The will was proved on the 30th of November 1819. The plaintiff further proved by a competent witness, that the defendant had, after the purchase and sale by the sheriff, as hereinafter stated, directed one <em>John Thomas </em>the 3d, to cut timber trees on that part of said land, so before sold, as mentioned and described <em>in </em>ihe <em>return </em>of the sheriff hereinafter stated, and that the said <em>Thomas </em>had accordingly cut and removed them therefrom. The defendant, for the purpose of proving the title and possession of the said land in himself, produced and offered to read the following records and papers, viz. A record of a judgment recovered in <em>Montgomery </em>county court in March 1820, in the name of <em>William Willson, </em>and <em>Anna Maria Willson, </em>his wife, against <em>Elisha D. Berry, </em>for $134 88-J debt, $300 damages and costs. The damages to be released on payment of interest on the debt, from the 19th of June 1816. This judgment was superseded by confession of judgment entered into by <em>Elisha D. Berry, </em>with <em>Jannaro S. Farre </em>and <em>Alexander Young, </em>on the 22d of February 1831, before one of the Associate Justices of the orphans court of the said county. Upon this confession of judgment a writ of <em>fieri facias </em>issued on the 4th of March 1822, against Berry, and his sureties. The sheriff returned the <em>fieri facias, </em>that he had laid it on all that part of the tract of land lying in <em>Montgomery </em>county, called <em>Charles and Benjamin, </em>which was devised to the said <em>Elisha D. Berry </em>by his father <em>Richard Berry, </em>to the value of $6,000. That after having. given due and public notice of' the time, place, manner, terms, and cause of sale, he did on the 13th of August 1822, expose to sale the said part of the said tract of land which lies on the N W side of'the public road leading-from <em>Rockville, </em>in <em>Mont~ gomery </em>county, to the city of <em>Baltimore, </em>supposed to contain 350 acres more or less, but found on an accurate survey thereof,. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>by *he Surveyor of <em>Montgomery </em>county, to contain 2421 acres, as will appear by the plot annexed and returned. That, at the said sale <em>Henry B. Griffith </em>and <em>Bichar\u00e1 H Griffith, </em>then and there became the highest bidders and purchasers of the said last mentioned part of a tract or parcel of land, at and for the sum of $2,000, and which sum they had paid to the sheriff. <em>Berry </em>moved the court to quash the <em>fieri, facias, </em>assigning certain reasons, which motion the court overruled. The defendant also proved by several competent witnesses, that the land in the declaration mentioned, is the same land which is men, tioned in the return of the sheriff above, and that the said land was sold by the sheriff of <em>Montgomery </em>county at public sale, and that the defendant became the purchaser thereof, as stated in the amended return of said sheriff. That the plaintiff was present at <em>the </em>said sale, and that it was at his request that the part of the land taken under the said execution, and so sold by the. sheriff, was exposed to sale. That the plaintiff made no objection to the said sale, and that the defendant and <em>Henry </em>B. <em>Griffith, </em>then paid the purchase money to the sheriff, and the plaintiff thereupon paid a balance remaining unsatisfied of the executions in his hands of nine or ten dollars to the sheriff. That <em>the </em>day after the said sale the defendant, and his co-purchaser <em>Henry B. Griffith, </em>engaged one <em>Washington Owen </em>to enter upon the said land, (there being-no bouse or enclosure thereon,) and take charge of the same, and directed him to authorise one <em>John Thomas </em>to cut down wood, and enclose the fields on the said land, which he did. And that the said land had always been held, and considered as a part of the dwelling plantation of the plaintiff, until the said sale. That after the said <em>Thomas </em>had cut down the said trees, the plaintiff called upon him to know by what authority he had so cut them, and <em>Thomas </em>replied on the authority of the defendant. The plaintiff replied that was all he wanted to know. The witness thinks <em>Thomas </em>went on to cut some trees after the plaintiff had so called upon him, and carried those he had previously cut down, to the field which he enclosed with them on said land. That the said <em>Thomas </em>did enclose and cultivated said fields, and ftiat the defendant, and the said <em>Henry B. Griffith, </em>nave continued in such possession of said land so purchased, ever <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>since. But the said witnesses proved that they had no knowledge, except what is above stated, of the defendant or <em>Henry B. Griffith, </em>(his co-purchaser,) having been in possession of said land, and that they supposed he had possession in consequence of his authority given to said <em>Thomas </em>to cut wood. The said <em>Thomas </em>had, before the said sale, by the leave of the plaintiff, taken down wood from said land ior firewood. And the plaintiff further offered the record of an action of ejectment brought by the defendant against the plaintiff. Tiffs record sets forth an action of ejectment brought by <em>Henry B. Griffith </em>and <em>Richard H Griffith\u2019s </em>lessee, against <em>Elisha D. Berry, </em>on the 23d of December 1822, for a tract of land called <em>Charles and Benjamin, </em>as described in the sheriff\u2019s return before mentioned, containing 250 acres. Which said action was entered, on the 10th of November 1825, \u201coff by plaintiffs.\u201d The plaintiff further proved by <em>Richard Butt, </em>a competent witness, and the deputy sheriff who made the sale, that there was land included in the sheriff\u2019s amended return which was not sold under the said execution to the defendant, but that the land on which the alleged trespass is said to have been committed, was sold as aforesaid. And the defendant proved by four competent witnesses, that all the land mentioned in the sheriff\u2019s return was sold as stated in the said <em>return; </em>and produced the receipt of said <em>Butt </em>to prove the same fact: \u201cReceived, August 13th, 1822, from <em>Henry B. Griffith </em>and <em>Richard H. Griffith, </em>two thousand dollars, for all the land lying on the north west side of the <em>Baltimore </em>road, called <em>Charles and Benjamin, </em>late the property of <em>Elisha D. Berry, </em>sold by virtue of a writ of <em>venditioni exponas, </em>at the suit of <em>William Scott, </em>and a writ of <em>fi. fa. </em>at the suit of <em>William Willson, </em>and <em>Jinna Maria </em>his wife.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b348-5\">E E <em>Rich\u2019d.

If the sheriff\u2019s seizure of property is not correct, he cannot afterwards make it correct. He must advertise and sell the property in conformity to his seizure. He cannot, if he advertised that the whole of a tract of land was to be sold, sell only a part of the tract. He cited <em>Sheldon v Soper, </em>14 <em>Johns. Rep. 352.

Why cannot the sheriff accommodafe purchasers by dividing the tract, <em>and </em>selling it in parcels? Suppose a sheriff levies a writ of <em>fieri facias </em>on personal property, and advertises to sell the whole, can he not sell only a part, and in parcels, if by such sale he raises a sum sufficient to discharge ttie debt? In this case the land sold lay on the N W side of the road.

The schedule returned with the writ, and the advertisement of the land to be sold, differ from the expressions used in the special return as amended.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b350-7\">Buchanan, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AA0K\">delivered the opinion of the court. This was an action of trespass for cutting down trees in a close, alleged to be the close of the appellant, who was the plaintiff below.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">The appellant claims title to the land on which the trees were cut, under a devise from his father; and the defendant rests his defence upon a purchase of the same premises by himself and <em>Henry B. Griffith, </em>from the sheriff of <em>Montgomery </em>county, at a sale by auction, in virtue of a <em>fieri facias </em>regularly sued out of the <em>Montgomery </em>county court. And the s le question presented to us in argument is, whether the sale made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number><em>by </em>the sheriff of the land on which the trespass is supposed to have been committed was a valid sale?</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">To prove that the sale was irregular and void, the appellant offered in evidence the inventory and appraisement, in which the land upon which the <em>fieri facias </em>was levied, is described as \u201cpart of a tract of land called <em>Charles and Benjamin, </em>containing five hundred acres of land more or less,\u201d valued at #6,000. The sheriff\u2019s advertisement of sale, which is of \u201call the right, title, interest and estate, of the said <em>Elisha D. Berry, </em>of, in and to, part of a tract, of land called <em>Charles and Benjamin, </em>containing five hundred acres more or less,\u201d both of them stating it to be taken by virtue of a writ of <em>fieri facias </em>at the suit of <em>William Willson, </em>and <em>Anna Maria </em>his wife. And also a paper, which it is admitted was prepared and filed by the sheriff as his return to the <em>fieri facias, </em>and in which the land sold is described as \u201cpart of a tract of land called <em>Charles and Benjamin, </em>lying on the north west side of the <em>Baltimore </em>road, containing two hundred and fifty acres more or less.\u2019*' \u00a1And all of them describing it as the land of <em>Elisha 2). </em>Berry\u201e And <em>the </em>defendant produced a <em>corrected </em>return by the sheriff, of the <em>fieri facias, </em>on the return day of the writ. That correeted return is full and special, and sufficiently describes the land sold, and entirely supersedes the paper that was first prepared by the sheriff as his return; which paper, if admitted to be imperfect as a return, cannot avail the appellant, as it will rot be denied, that a sheriff has a right, in due time, to eor\u2022ect his return to a <em>fieri facias, </em>so as to make it conform to ;he truth of the fact, whatever that may be, and to give it effect and legal operation; and indeed, it is his duty to do so,, lot only as respects himself, but all others concerned, and pur\u00a1Lasers not less than others, who commit themselves to the acuracy and integrity of sheriffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">In this ease it is not denied, that the correction was in time; mr is it contended, that the return, standing alone, is upon the ice of it defective, but it is supposed that there are discrepancies etween the return, the inventory and appraisement, and the dvertisement of sale, which vitiate the whole proceedings, and Rider the sale void. With respect to certainty in the descrip<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>lion of the property, we do not perceive the fatal discrepancies that are supposed to exist. The corrected <em>return </em>describes the land levied upon, as the property of <em>Elisha D. Berry, to </em>be \u201call that part of the tract of land called <em>Charles and. Benjamin, </em>which was devised to <em>Elisha D. Berry </em>by his father,\u201d with a reference to the will, and states the amount, to which it was appraised, to be #6,000, referring also to the schedule or inventory. Between the description then of the land levied upon, as given in the return, and the inventory and appraisement, there is no discrepancy, but the land clearly appears to be identical. In the latter, it is described as part of a tract of land called <em>Charles and Benjamin, </em>the property of <em>Elisha D. Berry, </em>containing five hundred acres more or less, and appraised to #6,000. In the former, as all that part of the tract of land called <em>Charles and Benjamin, </em>belonging to <em>Elisha D. Berry, </em>which was devised to him by his father, stating the amount of the appraised value to be the same as that set out in the inventory and appraisement, and showing, by the reference to that paper, (which is made a part of the return,) the quantity of acres to be the same. The only difference being this, that the return professes to show in what manner <em>Berry </em>acquired title, by reference to his father\u2019s will, which the inventory does not. But the two papers manifestly show the land devised to <em>Berry </em>by his father, and the land levied on to be the same; and the same may be said of the advertisement of sale, which is of all the.right, title, interest and estate, of <em>Elisha D. Berry, </em>of, in and to, part of a tract of land called <em>Charles and Benjamin, </em>containing five hundred acres more or less, taken by virtue of a writ of <em>fieri facias, </em>at the suit of <em>William Willson </em>and <em>wife. </em>This, paper does not, to be sure, set out the means by which <em>Berry </em>acquired title, but it desciibes the land seized under the <em>fieri facias, </em>as the property of <em>Berry, </em>by its name and contents, as it is described in the other two papers. And it is difficult to wink so hard, as not to see, that they all manifestly relate to the same land, and describe it with sufficient certainty. But it is not true, that lands taken in execution, must be described in the schedule and advertisement of sale, with technical minuteness. If it were so, it would per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>haps be found that there are few titles in the state, acquired by purchase at sheriffs sales, that might not be shaken. The sheriff cannot sell what has not been levied upon, but a general description in the shedule and advertisement of sale is sufficient. The return should regularly, for the security of purchasers, describe the premises with precision; but it is enough if the description be such as that the property sold may bo clearly identified. In this case, the land sold was a part of the premises levied upon and advertised, and that part is described in the sheriff\u2019s return, in a manner by which it may be sufficiently known and ascertained. But it is contended, that the sale was void, because a part only of the premises seized and advertised was sold, on the ground that the sheriff was not legally authorised to sell a part only, but was bound to sell the whole of the land levied upon. We cannot, however, assent to the proposition. Sheriffs, it is believed, are already sufficiently disposed to sell more than is necessary; and it would be pregnant with mischief to the community, if a sheriff, who lays an execution for $100, On a tract of land worth $10,000, should be held to be obliged to sell the entire tract, and could not sell such part as might be sufficient to discharge the debt. On the contrary, we think, that in such a case the sheriff is not only authorised to lay off and sell such a proportion of the land as may be found sufficient to satisfy the debt, but that he ought to do so, and not to sacrifice at auction more than may be found necessary. Or suppose a sheriff having taken in execution an entire tract of land, finds it will sell to a greater advantage if divided and sold in lots, than if sold altogether; and accordingly lays it off into lots, and sells them separately to different persons; would it, in such a c\u00e1se be said, that the sale of each lot would be void, because the sale of neither was a sale of the whole? And yet the doctrine contended for here, if maintained, would lead to that length.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">We ean perceive nothing wrong in the sale and return in this case, and affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">JUDGMENT affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
