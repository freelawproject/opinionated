This letter of guaranty was dated the 3d of January 1821. Evidence was given to the jury, that goods to the amount of $552 97, were delivered in pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>suance of this agreement; and also that <em>Lewis &amp; Co. </em>were indebted to <em>Mitchell </em>in another sum of $395 89 for goods sold to them on the 25th of October 1820. <em>Dali, </em>to discharge himself from the claim of <em>Mitchell, </em>gave in evidence to the jury, two receipts signed by <em>Mitchell, </em>the first dated the 10th of May 1821, and the second, on the 16th of June in the same year, each for the sum of $400; and also a letter from <em>Mitchell </em>to <em>Dali, </em>dated the 5th of May 1821, advising him, that the amount for which he had become responsible for <em>Lewis Sr Co. </em>was then due. <em>Mitchell, </em>to prove the money mentioned in the receipt of the 10th of May 1821, ought to be applied to the discharge of the debt due by <em>Lewis Sr Co. </em>on the 25th of October 1820, and not to that for which <em>Dali </em>was responsible, offered to give in evidence a <em>copy </em>of a letter, alleged to have been written by him to <em>Lewis </em>&amp; <em>Co. </em>which copy was found in a book kept for the purpose of copying letters by the firm of which <em>Mitchell </em>was a partner; and who offered to prove, that he <em>(Mitchell,) </em>drew' a draft on <em>Lewis Sf Co. </em>dated the 7th of May 1821, at 3 days sight, for $395 <em>89, </em>which was not paid, but was returned to him; which draft has been <em>lost, and can - not be found; </em>and in connexion with the said draft, offered to read in evidence the letter found in the record, written by <em>Archibald Austin, </em>as the agent of <em>Lewis Sr Co. </em>dated May 8th 1821; but the court refused to permit this evidence to go to the jury. And whether this procedure was correct, is the only question presented to us by the <em>first </em>and <em>second </em>bills of exceptions, on the part of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">We agree in opinion with <em>Baltimore </em>county court, that the eopy of the letter found in the letter-book of the plaintiff, was not legal evidence for him in the cause, and that it was properly rejected; but we must dissent from them, so far as it relates to the evidence offered to show a draft was drawn on <em>Lewis &amp; Co. </em>and the letter written by <em>Austin, </em>the acknowledged agent of that firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">If the draft, drawn by <em>Mitchell </em>on <em>Lewis &amp; Co. </em>had been in his possession, and he had it in his power to produce it, it certainly ought to have been produced; but when it was proved to have been lost, and could not be found, he ought to have been permitted to have given evidence of its contents.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>It is admitted in the record, that <em>Austin </em>was the agent of <em>Lewis &amp; Co. </em>and it has been decided by this court, that where an agency is sufficiently established, the acts and declarations of the agent, within the scope of his authority, are to be considered as the acts and declarations of the principal, of which evidence may be given as if they had been done and made by the principal himself. <em>City Bank of Baltimore v </em>Bateman, 7 <em>Harr. &amp; Johns. </em>108. <em>Lewis &amp; Co. </em>were indebted to <em>Mitchell </em>in two several sums of money, and were about to make a part payment; they had an undoubted right to apply that payment to either the one or the other of those claims, as they thought proper, and <em>Mitchell </em>was bound to apply it, as directed by his debtor. On the 8th of May 1821, <em>Lewis &amp; Co. write to </em>Mitchell, (for we consider the letter by <em>Austin, </em>their acknowledged agent, as their letter,) in substance, that they were about to remit to him a sum of money for the purpose of discharging the debt of @395 89, tor which a draft had been made on them. \u25a0The money was received by <em>Mitchell, </em>and the question before the jury was, whether <em>Lewis &amp; Co. </em>had given any directions ta which debt this money should be applied?' We think the letter was not only legal, but the best evidence, for the purpose for which it was offered. It was the direction of the debtor to the creditor, <em>in </em>writing, how this payment was to be applied. It was the creditor\u2019s authority for making the application, and after the receipt of this letter, he could not have rightfully applied it in any other manner. It has been contended that <em>Lewis </em>and <em>,.Austin </em>were legal witnesses in this cause, and ought to have been produced by the plaintiff. Admit they were competent witnesses, why was it necessary that he should have produced them? Was it to prove that <em>Austin </em>was the agent of <em>Lewis &amp; Co.? </em>That fact <em>was admitted </em>by the defendant, in the trial of the cause. Was it to prove that <em>Austin wrote a letter </em>to the plaintiff, as the accredited agent of <em>Lewis &amp; Co.? </em>That fact was also admitted by the defendant; and if they were called on to prove the manner they^had directed this payment to be applied, the moment they mentioned this direction was given, in a letter, in the possession of the plaintiff, they would haVe been stopped from giving in evidence the contents of that letter, and the letter itself would have been demanded of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>The defendant having <em>admitted </em>that <em>Austin </em>was the agent of <em>Lewis </em>&amp; <em>Co. </em>and that he had, in <em>that </em>character, directed the application of the payment, <em>in a letter to the plaintiff\\ </em>the <em>letter </em>itself was the only legal evidence to show what that direction was.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">It was not merely the declarations of a third person, as was ingeniously urged in the argument, but it is <em>an act done </em>by the party who had the legal right to make the application of the payment, directing in what manner it should be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">The <em>third </em>bill of exceptions was not relied on by the counsel for the appellant; we shall therefore pass it without notice; the law submitted to the court in that exception, will, however, necessarily demand our attention in examining <em>thz fourth </em>bill of exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">The <em>fourth </em>bill of exceptions was a general prayer on the part of the plaintiff, that if the jury believed the evidence offered by him, they must find a verdict in his favour. This prayer was refused by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">The first question to be disposed of under this exception is, whether <em>Mitchell </em>could sustain the action in his <em>own </em>name, and without joining his partners, <em>Appleton &amp; Henry, </em>in the writ?</p>\n<p id=\"AMn\">It is a general rule of law, that all the parties composing a firm must be named as plaintiffs, and an omission to name them may be taken advantage of, on <em>non assumpsit. Gow on Partnership, </em>164, 167, 153; but there is an exception to this rule, for where the partners <em>are dormant, </em>it is not necessary they should be named in the writ. <em>Gow, 167, </em>153. <em>Lloyd v Archbowle, 2 Taunt. </em>324. <em>Leveck </em>&amp; <em>Pollard v Shaftoe, 2 Esp. Rep. 468. 1 Chitty on Pleading, </em>8.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-10\">What then constitutes a dormant partner, is the point upon which this part of the cause depends. In common parlance it appears a solecism in terms to say, that he who was actively engaged in the business, should be dormant, yet in the strict legal acceptation of the term, we are led to believe, every partner is considered dormant, unless his name is mentioned in the firm, or embraced u\u00f1der^gcneraTterms, as the name of one of the firm and company. We are brought to this conclusion, not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>only by the definitions contained in elementary authors, but by adjudged cases upon this subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\"><em>Gow, </em>in his Treatise of Partnership, 12, 13, describes' the several kind of partners. He says, \u201cAn actual ostensible partner, is a party who not only participates in the profits, and contributes to the losses, but who appears and exhibits himself to the world as a person connected with a partnership, and as forming a component member of the firm. A dormant partner is likewise a participant in the profits of the trade, <em>but Ms name being suppressed and concealed from the firm, </em>his interest is consequently not apparent.\u201d The same distinction is taken in <em>Watson on </em>Partnership, 34, 46. He says, \u201cSometimes all the partners in trade do not appear ostensibly to the world, though they share in the profits and loss, &amp;c. <em>Where they do not suffer their names to appear 'in the co-partnership firm, </em>but at the same time receive their share of the profits, and bear their risk of loss, they are styled dormant partners.\u201d In the case of <em>Leveck v Shaftoe, </em>2 <em>Esp. Rep. </em>468, Lord <em>Kenyon </em>held, \u201cthat if a person had been a partner, and <em>Ms name in the firm, </em>and he afterwards <em>withdrew his name, </em>but continued to receive part of the profits; though such <em>person </em>still continued liable to all the demands against the partnership on the ground of the profits he derived; he would not allow persons who dealt with the firm, <em>without his name appearing in it, </em>to avail themselves of the objection of such partner\u2019s not having joined in the action, for the purpose of a <em>nonsuit </em>See also the case of <em>Lloyd v Archbowle, </em>2 <em>Taunt. </em>324. <em>Lucas and others v De la Cour, </em>1 <em>Maul. &amp; Selw. </em>249; and <em>Bryden v Taylor, </em>2 <em>Harr. &amp; Johns. </em>396.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">In this case it appeared the firm was carried on <em>under the name of Mitchell alone; </em>that all the books of the said firm, checks drawn, and notices of sale, were signed in his name; and that every part of the transaction, that gave birth to this suit, the letter of guaranty, and other evidence offered, was addressed to him alone, without reference to his partners. They-were therefore <em>dormant </em>partners, and it was not necessary to name them in the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">The next question is the application of the payments made by <em>Lewis </em>&amp; <em>Co. </em>And in deciding this question, we shall confine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>our remarks solely to the ease as it appears in the record, without intending to lay down a rule of law, that will apply to every case that may possibly arise- We adopt the law, as declared by the court in the <em>third </em>bill of exceptions, as correct in this case. That it is the undoubted right of the debtor to direct the appropriation of money paid by him to any debt he may think proper. And although he may not give an <em>express </em>direction, at the time of the payment, such direction may be <em>implied </em>from circumstances; but if no application has been made by the debtor, either express or implied, then the creditor may apply it.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Many cases might be produced to sustain this doctrine; we deem it necessary to refer only to a few. In <em>Tayloe v Sandiford, </em>7 <em>Wheat. </em>20, Chief Justice <em>Marshall, </em>in delivering the opinion of the court, says \u201ca person owing money under distinct contracts, has undoubtedly a right to apply his payments to which ever debt he may choose; and although prudence might suggest an express direction of the application of his payments, at the time of their being made, yet there may be cases in which this-power would be completely exercised without any express direction given at the time. A direction may be evidenced by circumstances as well as <em>by words. </em>A payment may be attended by circumstances which demonstrate its application as completely as words could demonstrate it \u201d In <em>Newmarch v Clay &amp; others, 14 East, </em>242, Lord <em>Ellenborough </em>said, \u201cthat there might be a special application of a payment made arising out of the nature of the transaction, though not expressed at the time in terms by the party making it.\u201d And it was admitted in the argument of that cause, as a general rule, and many cases cited in support of it, that if the debtor, who owes money on several accounts, do not apply a part payment when made, to a particular debt, but pay in the money generally, the creditor has a right to apply it to any part of his demand which he pleases. In the case of <em>The Mayor and Commonalty of Alexandria v Patton &amp; others, </em>4 <em>Cranch, </em>320, Chief Justice <em>Marshall </em>declares it to be a clear principle of law, \u201cthat a person owing money on two several accounts, as upon bond and simple contract, may elect to make his payments to which account he pleases; but if he fails to make the application, the election passes from him to the creditor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>Objections have been taken in <em>this </em>court, to the sufficiency of the declaration filed in the cause, which we think justified fhe court below in refusing the prayer of the plaintiff in the <em>fourth </em>bill of exceptions. The agreement, which is the foundation of this suit, is susceptible of but one rational construction. That <em>Lewis &amp; Co. </em>being desirous to purchase goods, &amp;c. of <em>Mitchell, through the agency of Archibald Austin, Dali </em>engages, if the goods are furnished to <em>Lewis \u00a7 Co. </em>upon a credit of four months, and they do not pay for them at the expiration of that time, that he will do it. The goods then are sold to <em>Lewis &amp; Co. </em>They are the original debtors, and upon their default, and their default alone to pay, <em>Dali </em>becomes answerable. <em>Austin </em>has nothing to do in the transaction, but merely as an agent for <em>Lewis &amp; Co. </em>No sale is made.to him individually, nor <em>is </em>he bound to pay for the goods. It is essential, therefore, that the declaration should contain an express averment, that the money was not paid by <em>Lewis fy Co. </em>at the expiration of the time limited for payment; for until there was default on the part of <em>Lewis &amp; Co. </em>no responsibility attached upon <em>Dali.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">The <em>first count, </em>instead of stating the money had not been paid by <em>Lewis &amp; Co. </em>(the condition upon which <em>Dali </em>had agreed to pay,) says <em>Austin </em>did not pay it. <em>Austin </em>was not bound to pay it. He was not. the debtor, nor did <em>Dali </em>assume any responsibility upon the nonpayment by <em>Austin.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">The declaration, to be effective, ought to have averred the nonpayment by <em>Lewis 8f Co. </em>for it by no means follows, that although not paid by <em>Austin, </em>-that <em>Lewis fy Co. </em>may not have discharged the debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">The same objection applies to the <em>second count. </em>It is stated that <em>Austin, </em>and not <em>Lewis </em>&amp; <em>Co. </em>did not pay. The <em>third count </em>has no reference to the guaranty; it charges <em>Dali </em>with goods, &amp;c. money lent, &amp;c. furnished to him on his own account, and for his own use, and not as being charged with a debt, upon the default of another to pay it. The <em>fourth count </em>is supposed to be sufficient; because on default of <em>Lewis &amp; Co. </em>to pay, it was unnecessary to set out the special agreement in the declaration, but that it might be given in evidence on the general count. If this position were correct, it would not support -the count. If the rule relied on could be applied to this case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>still it was necessary to set out the transaction as it appeared in evidence \u2014 that the goods, &amp;c. were sold to <em>Lewis &amp; Co. </em>and <em>Dali </em>promised to pay for them. But in this count, <em>Lewis fy Co. </em>are entirely lost sight of. It is stated, not as a debt contracted by them, but by <em>Archibald </em>Austin; and surely evidence that \u00a9\u00ab//promised to pay the debt of <em>Lewis </em>&amp; <em>Co. </em>will not make him answerable for a debt contracted by <em>Austin </em>on his own account. The <em>fifth count </em>is on an <em>insimul computassent; </em>and whether this can be sustained, must depend upon the evidence in the cause. The responsibility of <em>Dali </em>under the guaranty, did not attach until default was made by <em>Lewis &amp; Co, </em>to pay, nor was there any debt due and owing by him until the expiration of the time limited for payment. His undertaking was collateral and conditional, and to make him answerable upon an <em>insimul computassent, </em>it must appear there was an accounting between the parties, after the debt was due and owing; and such is the express language of the declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">This is not like a debt between two persons, on their own account, with a future time for payment; there the debt is due, when the goods are delivered. But in this case, as before observed, the assumption is conditional; there is no debt before default, nor is there any legal demand on <em>Dali, </em>until that- time. The evidence offered by the plaintiff, to support this count, was a memorandum signed by <em>Dali, </em>admitting the amount of the-goods delivered under the guaranty; but that writing has no date. If it should be found by the jury, that the memorandum was signed <em>after </em>the time limited for payment, it may be sufficient to charge <em>Dali </em>on the <em>insimul computassent-, </em>if before, it could only be evidence to show the amount of the claim, on; a count founded on the special agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">An objection was also made to the declaration, that it did not contain an averment, that a demand had been made on <em>Lewis &amp; Co. </em>for payment, before this suit was brought. Having declared <em>all </em>the counts founded <em>on the guaranty </em>insufficient, it is unnecessary to consider this objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">JUDGMENT REVERSED, AND PROCEDENDO AWARDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
