Action of debt for $219 95, against the appellee, formerly sheriff of that county, for an escape. The declaration staled, that in Saint-Ma<em>ry\u2019s </em>county court, at March term 1819, <em>D Koones, </em>(the appellant.,) and <em>II. Koones, </em>in the lifetime of <em>H. Koones, </em>recovered judgment against a certain <em>E. Wilder for </em>$177 02 debt, $350 damages, and $6 65 costs. That on the 20th of March 1820, a writ of <em>capias ad satisfaciendum </em>was issued on the said judgment, directed to the defendant, (the appellee,) the then sheriff of the county. That on the 1 st of April 1820, the said execution was delivered to one <em>T. W. Morgan, </em>he then being the lawful deputy of the defendant, &amp;c. That <em>Morgan, </em>being such deputy of the defendant, on the 1st of May 1820, by virtue of the said writ, arrested and took in execution the said <em>Wilder, </em>and permitted him to go at large and escape, &amp;c. whereby an action accrued to the plaintiff to demand and have, of and from the defendant, the said sum of $219 95 above demanded, being the debt, damages and costs, and charges aforesaid, &amp;c.

The plaintiff then prayed the court to instruct the jury, that they must find for the plaintiff. But the Court, <em>[Key </em>and <em>Plater, </em>\u00c1. J.] refused to give such instruction.

That a sheriff is liable to an action for a voluntary escape upon process of execution. <em>2. </em>That he was liable to the full amount of the debt. The action of debt is given against a sheriff for an escape. <em>Jones vs Pope, </em>1 <em>Saund. </em>38. A sheriff is liable, in an action of debt, for an escape upon process of execution for the whole sum due by the original debtor \u2014 debt, interest and costs; in other words, he stands in the place of the original debtor. In support of this position the court are referred to <em>Hawkins vs Plomer, 2 W. Blk. </em>1048, 1050. <em>Bonafons vs Walker, 2 T. R. </em>132, 133. It is admitted, that in cases of escape upon <em>mesneprocess, </em>if the sheriff have the party in court at the return day of the writ, his liability is discharged; but it is denied, that in a case of voluntary escape upon final process, as the present is, that any act of the sheriff can purge the escape. <em>Ravenscroft vs Eyles, 2 Wils. </em>295. <em>Jones vs Pope, </em>1 <em>Saund. </em>35, <em>(note.)

It remains only to be shown, that the statute which regulated the decisions referred to, has been acted under, and obtains in this state. In order to establish this position, the court are referred to <em>Kilty\u2019s Report of Statutes, </em>221.

Dorsey, </em>for the Appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJ9\">It is conceded that an action of <em>debt </em>for escape upon final process, after arrest and before the return day, is given to the creditor in <em>England </em>against the sheriff by a <em>liberal </em>expansion of the language of the statute of 1 <em>Rich. </em>II, <em>ch. </em>12. By the common law no such action was given. The remedy was <em>case, </em>grounded upon the official misfeasance of the sheriff, where <em>damages </em>were recovered, and not of <em>necessity </em>the <em>debt </em>due from the debtor, and on which he was in execution. <em>Jones vs Pope, 1 Saund. </em>38. The right of the creditor in this state to sustain the action, depends on the question, whether the statute of 1 <em>Rich. </em>II, at the time of the declaration of rights, \u201chad by experience been found applicable to the local and other circumstances of the colony.\u201d 3d <em>Section of the Bill of Rights. </em>The statute of the 1 <em>Rich. </em>II, <em>chap. </em>12, gives to the creditor the action of <em>debt </em>against the <em>warden </em>of the <em>fleet, </em>upon an escape out of <em>execution. </em>The \u201c <em>Warden </em>of the Fleet\u201d is the gaoler of the Fleet Prison. The <em>liberal </em>construction, therefore, of the statute is, that when a debtor is committed to the \u201cgaoler\u201d <em>in execution, </em>and he suffers him to escape, an action of <em>debt </em>may be sustained. The policy of the <em>English </em>courts soon expanded the statute; and by a principle of construction familiar to their courts of enlarging the remedy in all cases of \u201clike evil,\u201d extended it to all <em>prisoners, </em>and to all <em>sheriffs </em>and gaolers. In the case referred <em>to by </em>the counsel for the appellant, of <em>Hawkins vs Plomer, 2 W. Blk. </em>1048, the court applied the action of <em>debt </em>for an escape, \u201cwhere there was no commitment (upon final process,) permitted, before the return day.\u201d Thus progressively expanding the remedy in conformity to the commercial spirit of the nation, to afford to the creditors every facility of recovering their debts, and based upon that maxim adopted in the \u201crudeness of early times of <em>qui nonhabetin crumana ndt in </em>corpore,\u201d a principle reprobated by the' liberal feelings of these times. The legislative records furnish sufficient evidence that the colony deemed the statute of 1 <em>Richard </em>II, <em>chap. </em>12, inapplicable to the local and other circumstances of the <em>colony; </em>for we find <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>that in <em>164.2, ch 42, </em>within 12 years after the charter, they passed a law, \u201cproviding some rule for execution.\u201d By which they enacted, that \u201cif the sheriff, after there is a <em>prison </em>built, suffer <em>a party </em>in execution to go at liberty out of prison, without consent of the chiefest creditor, he shall be liable as in case of escape.\u201d This law was permitted to expire. In 1669, <em>ch, </em>5, another law was passed, entitled, \u201cAn act for the relief of prisoners taken in execution;\u201d this was repealed by 1676, <em>ch, 2. </em>The provisions of this bill cannot be ascertained from any of the compilations. In <em>1676, ch. </em>17, it is provided, \u201cthat when persons are taken in execution for <em>debt, </em>or on mesne process, the sheriff shall keep them by such means, and in such manner, as prisoners in <em>England are, </em>and <em>may </em>he restrained.\u201d This law was to be in force for three years, and was afterwards continued by several reviving acts until 1692, when a new law was passed, which was afterwards <em>repealed. </em>These old acts of legislation show that after <em>prisons </em>were built, the sheriff should not suffer <em>prisoners </em>to go at large without the assent of the chiefest <em>creditor, </em>thus modifying the statutory law of <em>England. </em>This, however, was abandoned, being found inconsistent with the interest of the colony, and precluding the smaller creditors deriving any benefit from a <em>Ca. Sa. </em>They then adopted the whole <em>English </em>system, and incorporated it in their laws. But the experience of a few years convinced them that the rigid system fitted for a commercial country, was not \u201capplicable\u201d to an infant colony, that required the aid of all for the protection of all, and that it could not permit its weakness to be added to by the confinement of its citizens in the prisons. The court have by this trial an abandonment of the <em>English </em>principles \u2014 a legislative declaration that the statute of 1 <em>Rich. </em>II, <em>ch. </em>12, was not found applicable to the colonist. If the affirmative declarations of the colonial legislature sustain the position, that at that time the <em>English </em>system was repealed, it is contended that the court have no evidence that the system was afterwards recognized by the people, the legislature, or the judiciary. It is contended, that this court have no other criterion of deciding, that a statute has been deemed applicable to the local and other-circumstances of the state, than a decision of a <em>court recognizing </em>.the statute. In <em>Whittington v Polk, 1 Harr. &amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number><em>Johns. </em>250, the court say, that \u201cit does not appear to the court there can be any other safe criterion by which the applicability of a statute to our local and other circumstances, can be ascertained and established, but that of having been used and practised under in this state.\u201d The court also say, that the statute of 32 <em>Henry </em>VIII, <em>ch. 2, </em>does not exlend to this state, \u201cthe court, <em>not </em>knowing of any <em>judicial decision </em>by which the same has been adopted and introdued into this state as the law thereof.\u201d In <em>Dashiell v Attorney-General, 5 Harr. &amp; Johns. </em>403, the court say, that <em>Kilty\u2019s </em>Reports of the Statute, was compiled, printed and distributed, under the sanction of the state, for the use of its officers, and is a safe guide for exploring <em>an otherwise </em>very <em>dubious path. </em>In the above report the compiler notes, that the <em>Statute </em>of 1 <em>Rich </em>II, <em>ch. </em>12, has been deemed applicable; yet he says, that the <em>practice </em>has been, (not under the statute,) but to sue either in ease, or on the sheriffs bonds, where the damages are under <em>the control </em>of the jury; and he refers to no <em>instance </em>within his recollection of an <em>action </em>of <em>debt. </em>Neither the judicial records of this state, nor the recollection of the oldest practitioner, furnish a case of an action of <em>debt; </em>grounded on an escape permitted after an arrest upon final process, and before the return day, and where the sheriff has produced the body on <em>the return day. </em>This universal silence on a subject which necessarily must have arisen somewhere in the state in each and every week for upwards of a century, and where passion, revenge and interest, must have prompted to fix a liability on the sheriff, is a strong argument to prove, that in the opinion of the profession no such action can be sustained. In <em>Le Caux v Eden, 2 Douglass, </em>525, <em>Buller, </em>Justice, states there is no case wherever it has been holden that such an action (not this action,) can be sustained, and if it could lie, there are \u2022such \u201cfrequent opportunities\u201d for it, that it must have happened in every day\u2019s practice, or some instances <em>must </em>at least be in the memory of those who have had long experience in <em>Westminster Hall; </em>but there is not the smallest trace, or even - <em>dictum </em>in any court of <em>England, </em>and this silence is a strong argument against such an action. Where a plantation or colony is settled by <em>English </em>subjects, all the <em>English </em>laws then in force are transferred to the colonies, subject, however, to such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number><em>restrictions </em>and <em>modifications </em>as shall be adopted by their own <em>provincial judicature, </em>as compatible with their local and other circumstances. 5 <em>Jacob\u2019s Law Dictionary, </em>tit <em>Plantation, </em>159, It is contended, that the admitted absence of any judicial decision on tho liability of the sheriff in a similar case, and of the action of <em>debt </em>for an escape, affords a strong presumption that the provincial judicature refused to sustain the doctrine contended for, and modelled the doctrine of escape according ico the universal practice of this state. It is, therefore, contended, that the <em>universal </em>and long cor,t;nued <em>practice </em>of the officers of suffering a debtor arrested upon a <em>final </em>process to go at large till the return day of the process, has established a common law which the court ought to respect. The state has a common law unknown to the common law of <em>England. </em>Two instances now occur. A sheriff in <em>England </em>grants replevin, and takes bond. Here the clerk does it, without statute, and is sustained by usage. In <em>England </em>the court never grants <em>a retorno habendo </em>till judgment. Here the court grant it before judgment, without statute; the statute only regulating the practice. But if the court say that the <em>English </em>doctrine prevails, then there is no evidence that the statute 1 <em>Rich </em>II, <em>ch. 12, </em>has ever been introduced, and the party\u2019s remedy against the sheriff\u2019 must be grounded on the common law \u2014 An action on the case, or on the sheriff\u2019s bond.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b119-5\">\n<em>Curia adv. vult.</em>\n</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b119-6\">At this term,</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">JUDGMENT REVERSED</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
