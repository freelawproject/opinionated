To the admissibility <em>of </em>which evidence the defendant objected; but the Court, [Afe<em>phen, </em>Ch.

The defendant then gave evidence, that during the time when the said services were rendered, the plaintiff was register of wills in and for <em>Prince-George\u2019s </em>county, duly commissioned and qualified; and then prayed the court to instruct the jury, that if the jury should be of opinion from the evidence, that the plaintiff was the register of wills in and for <em>PrinceGcorge\u2019s </em>county, duly commissioned and qualified, at the time when the said services were rendered by the plaintiff to the defendant\u2019s testatrix, that then they must find a verdict for the defendant.

The defendant excepted; and the verdict and judgment being against him, he appealed to this court.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-5\">The cause was argued before Buchanan, Ch.

Dorsey, </em>for the Appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJj\">contended, 1. That the receipts offered in evidence were inadmissible, it not being slated therein that <em>the </em>persons giving and acknowledging the receipts, resided in the county where the acknowledgments were made. <em>3. </em>That the action could not be sustained, the consideration being contrary to the policy of the law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b64-7\">On the <em>first </em>point, he referred to the act of <em>1809, ch. 168.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b64-8\"><em>On </em>the <em>second </em>point, he referred to the acts of 1801, <em>ch. </em>74, <em>e.7; 1802, ch. 101, s. 4; 1816, ch. 203; </em>and November <em>1779, ch. 25, s. 7.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b64-9\"><em>Stonestreet, </em>and <em>J. Johnson, </em>for the Appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Am8\">1. On the <em>first point, </em>they cited <em>Bryden v Taylor, 2 Harr. &amp; Johns. 396. </em>The act of <em>1798, ch. 101, sub ch. 5. Prather v Johnson, et al. 3 Harr. &amp; Johns. 487.

The direction of the court below to the jury, guarded \u00e1gainst the plaintiff\u2019s recoveiing for any services performed by him in his character of register. There is nothing to prevent a register of wills from acting as the agent of an executor or administrator.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b64-11\">Earle, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A0U\">delivered the opinion of the Court. We concur in the opinions expressed by the court below, on both the bills of exceptions signed by them in this case, and we affirm their judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-12\">The plaintiff below proved himself to have been the agent of <em>Jlraminta Biscoe, </em>in the settlement of <em>George Biscoe\u2019s </em>estate, on which she administered; and to show himself entitled to compensation for his services, as her agent, he offered <em>in </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>evidence the receipts of two of the representatives of <em>George Biscoe, </em>deceased, which we think were properly suffered to be read to the jury for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">The copies offered were duly attested under the seal of the recording of'.ce, and appear to us to have been acknowledged and recorded agreeably to the act of 1809, <em>ch. </em>168. They were recorded in the office of the register of wills of Prince-<em>George\u2019s </em>county, where <em>George Biscoe </em>died, and where of course letters of administration were taken on his estate, having been previously acknowledged before the said register.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">It is objected, it does not appear that the representatives resided in <em>Prinm-Georgc\u2019s </em>county, and the acknowledgment should have been made before a justice of the peace or register of wills of the county, where they resided.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">The place of their residence does not appear on the face of the acknowledgment; but that they were in <em>Prince-George\u2019s </em>county, at the time of making, it is clear, for else it eould not have been made before the register of wills of that county. This indicates a temporary or transient residence, which we consider as sufficient; at least in the absence of proof of actual residence elsewhere. <em>Bryden v Taylor, 2 Harr &amp; Johns. </em>396.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">The court in our judgment very properly refused the instructions as prayed in the <em>second </em>bill <em>o\\ </em>exceptions, and discriminated well, between services rendered by the plaintiff in his official character of register o\u00ed wills, and those performed by him in his private or individual capacity. For the first he eould charge nothing, except what the fee-bill allowed him, but as to the last, he is on a footing with every other individual in the community. There are many highly responsible and laborious duties an administrator has to perform, to which a register of wills, as such, has nothing to say; and if at the instance of an administrator, he undertakes to transact them, no reason is perceived why he should not be compensated for his services.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
