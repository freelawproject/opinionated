The damages were laid in tobacco, atul current money. The defendant pleaded three pleas \u2014 1. After craving oyer of the <em>writing obligatory aforesaid </em>and of the <em>writ, </em>(a blank for which was left for their being inserted,) he pleaded that the plaintiff ought not to have or maintain his action, \u201cbecause he saith that the original writ in this cause was issued on the-day of -, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and--, and not before, and that the debt or thing in action, in virtue of the said writing obligatory in the declaration aforesaid mentioned, became due and payable on the first day of January in the year eighteen hundred and three, and that twelve years and more have elapsed and expired from the day when the said debt or thing in action, in virtue of the said writing obligatory, became due and payable; and that, the debt or thing in action, in virtue of the said writing obligatory, had been above twelve years standing before the day of the issuing of the original writ in this cause; that is to say, at <em>Charles </em>county aforesaid; and this the said <em>Robert Crain </em>is ready to verify, and so forth.

Plea of payment. The plaintiff demurred specially to the <em>first </em>and <em>second </em>pleas, and assigned for causes of demurrer, 1. That there are two writings in the declaration mentioned, and the defendant craving oyer thereof, says \u201che prays an hearing of the writing obligatory aforesaid,\u201d without saying of which writing obligatory. 2. That the said plea has many blanlus therein, omitting days, months and years. 3. That the said <em>first </em>plea states, that in the said writing obligatory in the declaration mentioned, without stating which of the two <em>writ-J </em>ings obligatory in the said declaration mentioned. The plaintiff replied <em>non-payment </em>to the <em>third </em>plea, and issue was joined. The defendant joined in demurrer to the <em>first </em>and <em>second </em>pleas. The County Court ruled the demurrer good. Verdict for the plaintiff, and the jury found the debt due, upon the writings obligatory to be 2758 lbs. of crop tobacco, and $85 91, Judgment rendered thereon for the damages laid in the declaration, to be released on payment of the tobacco and money found to be due by the jury, with interest until paid, and costs.

Here the <em>second </em>reason assigned does not specify which of the pleas has blanks. The pleas of the act of limitations do not apply to the bond for money, and they went to only one of the causes of action, which was the tobacco debt. The demurrer, therefore, should not have been ruled good as to both causes of action. <em>Duppa v </em>Mayo, 1 <em>Saund. 286, (and note 9.)

The act of 1812, <em>ch. </em>135,. was passed solely for the purpose of regulating the current coin of the state. After the act of Nov. 1781, <em>ch. </em>16, and since the act of 1812, <em>ch. </em>135, the constant practice has been to render judgments in tobacco for tobacco debts. There can be no misjoinder of causes of action for tobacco and money. The judgment is the same for tobacco is it is for money. Where. <em>the </em>judgment is for tobacco, the execution issued thereon is to make the amount in tobaccoj and in counties where tobacco is cultivated,tobacco notes pass in the same manner as banknotes or specie, and most of the contracts made there are for the payment of tobacco. We may as well sue for tobacco as for sterling money, or for <em>Virginia </em>currency, or the currency of any other of the states. <em>Purviance v Neave, </em>4 <em>Harr. </em>&amp; <em>M\u2018Hen. </em>199.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b343-6\"><em>2. </em>The <em>first </em>and <em>second </em>pleas profess to be. a bar to the whole action. The defendant craved oyer of but one cause of <em>action, </em>and he did not specify of which, there being two. Where the same plea may be pleaded, and the same judgment given, and where not, he referred to 1 <em>Chitty\u2019s Plead. </em>197. <em>Coryton v Lythebye, 2 Saund. </em>117, b. <em>(note 2.)</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b343-7\">\n<em>Curia adv. vult.</em>\n</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b343-8\">Earle, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A3T\">at the present term, delivered the opinion of the Court. Our attention was called on the argument to the declaration in this cause as containing the first defect in the pleadings, which should have been noticed in deciding the demurrer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>disposed of by <em>Charles </em>county court. It was asserted that the two counts therein could not be joined in the same action, one being on a single bill for tobacco, and the other on a like bond for current money. This subject we have considered, and we are of opinion, that the objection to the declaration is unsustained. From the earliest period to this time, tobacco has been considered in our judicial proceedings as current money, and actions of debt on bonds for the payment of it, have been constantly brought in the <em>debet and </em>detinet, and without averring its value in the current coin of the state. This being the ease, there is no doubt that money and tobacco debts may be sued for in the same action. If the question is tried by the common rule, which we do not mention as a fixed and unerring standard, \u201cthat two counts may be joined where the same judgment is upon both,\u201d these counts may be well united in this declaration. They are of the same nature, both being for debts, although in a different currency, and the judgment for them is so far the same, that it may be executed by one and the same final process, whether it issue against the person or property of the defendant. It has, besides, for many years, been the practice in actions of debt, to join tobacco and <em>money </em>counts, <em>as </em>a recurrence to the records of our courts will fully evince. The case, of <em>Gordon &amp; others against </em>Wilson, in 1788, and <em>Gordon &amp; others against Pye, </em>in 1789, in the late General Court, are instances of this kind, and many others, it is believed, might be easily adduced. And it has been, moreover, the invariable course, to render judgments in debt for tobacco, and. for costs in current money, or for costs in tobacco at a fixed and established valu\u00e9 in current money.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">The two first pleas to this declaration were rightly decided on, we think, by <em>Charles </em>county court. They are pleas of limitation, designed to bar the action as to one of the obligations sued upon, but it is not sufficiently certain to which of 'them the pleas apply. They are introduced with a prayer of oyer of the writing obligatory aforesaid, without discriminating between them; and although in the first there is something like a designation of the tobacco bond, it is in other respects entirely faulty, in not asc\u00e9rtaining the time of the commencement of the action. When a plea is only intended for a part of the de~ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>claration, the rule is, it must not cover the whole, but must ascertain the part to which it is applied, or the plaintiff may demur. Under a rule <em>to </em>plead issuably, such uncertain pleas would be deemed no pleas, and the plaintiff might take judgment for want of plea. <em>Macdonnald v Macdonnald, </em>3 <em>Bos. </em>&amp; <em>Pull. </em>174.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
