(P. L., <em>c. </em>336, <em>s. </em>27). If it were established that the plaintiff is only a nominal party to these proceedings, it might be thought that there was some merit to her contention. See <em>Penny </em>v. <em>Croul, </em>87 Mich. 15, and note on \u201cRight of surviving spouse, heir or next of kin to testify in favor of the estate\u201d in L. R. A., 1918 C, 918. It appears, however, that she is not only the executrix of the will of Joseph Hodgen, but also his widow and it must be assumed, in the absence of a contrary finding, that she has the usual rights of a widow in her husband\u2019s estate. Under these circumstances she is a plaintiff in interest as well as in name, and the cas\u00e9is governed by the decision in <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Perkins, </em>68 N. H. 264, where the defendant claimed certain bank deposits \u201cas executrix and sole legatee\u201d of her husband and was not permitted to testify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>\u201cin regard .to conversations and transactions between her husband and Mary A. Perkins\u201d the plaintiff\u2019s intestate.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">\n<em>Exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
