One indictment alleged an offense committed about six months before a like offense charged in the other indictment. The offenses were separate although committed with the same person, and are not to be regarded as a single act extending during the period between them. The statute is directed at acts without reference to habitual conduct. Repeated violations constitute distinct offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-15\">II. The allegations of the indictment are sufficiently definite and bring it within the statute. The common-law limitation of application of the offense is one of degree rather than character, and of special rather than generic differentiation. No intention to observe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>the narrow common-law rule is to be ascribed to the legislature. The fact that the offense at common law was a felony and hence punishable by death meets any presumption that the statute is to be tested by that law.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">By the better, if not great weight of, authority similar statutes are construed to be more comprehensive than the common law in the scope of the conduct prohibited. <em>Glover </em>v. <em>State, </em>179 Ind. 459; <em>State </em>v. <em>Vicknair, 52 </em>La.
