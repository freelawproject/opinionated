The motorcycle upon which the plaintiffs were riding approached the intersection on Concord Street from the north. The truck, operated by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>the defendant, approached the intersection on Orange Street from the east and stopped on the easterly side of Concord Street to allow the passage of northbound traffic which at the time in question was extremely heavy. It then proceeded across Concord Street at a speed of from 5 to 10 miles per hour and was in collision with the motorcycle when the truck was close to the curb on the westerly side of Concord Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">The plaintiff Miller testified that when he first saw the truck, the motorcycle was \u201ctwo feet beyond the center of the intersection\u201d and that the front of the truck was then ten feet \u201cpast the center line of Concord Street.\u201d With the two vehicles in this position, the same witness testified that they were \u201cabout twenty feet\u201d apart. The motorcycle was proceeding south at a speed of from 10 to 15 miles per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">The plaintiffs apparently adopt the foregoing testimony regarding the situation immediately preceding the collision as being most favorable to their contention, for in their brief we read as follows: \u201cNo complaint is made of the defendant\u2019s conduct until the motorcycle got beyond the extension of the center line of Orange Street on the west and the truck got on or beyond the center line of Concord Street.\u201d The only claim of negligence advanced by the plaintiffs is that, in the situation above described, the defendant could, and should have stopped the truck in season to give the plaintiffs the right of way and allow the motorcycle to pass in front of it. A consideration of the time element here involved precludes the adoption of this view.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">The plaintiff Miller testified that he kept \u201cgoing along\u201d and did not apply his brakes until the motorcycle was within 3 or 4 feet of the truck, when a collision was, of course, unavoidable. At a speed of from 10 to 15 miles per hour, the time necessary for the motorcycle to cover the space of 20 feet between it and the truck would be from 4/5 of a second to 1 1/3 seconds. If, as the plaintiffs contended, the truck did not cross Concord Street at a right angle but was turned somewhat to the north, from which direction the plaintiffs were approaching, this time would be still further reduced. The argument that during this brief space of time the defendant should have seen the motorcycle, sensed the danger, realized the necessity for stopping and brought his truck to a stop \u201cdefies the natural limitations on the speed of the mental and physical activities of human beings.\u201d <em>Morrison </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>86 N. H. 176, 180; <em>Legere </em>v. <em>Company, </em>89 N. H. 423, 426. \u201cThe time was too short for any<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>thing but instinctive action, and action under such circumstances \u2018cannot be said to be careless unless the actor is shown to be unfit to act\u2019 in such an emergency.\u201d <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>86 N.
