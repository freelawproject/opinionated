He said: \u201cI would have had an accident if they were placed that far. ... I would have if the bleachers were there. ... I am sure about that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">It is not a situation where the jurors were at liberty to accept one statement and reject the other; for, considering the roughness of the game and the fact that the plaintiff was knocked backward by an opposing player, any opinion that the accident would not have happened if the open space outside the playing area had been a few inches wider would be purely conjectural. The plaintiff\u2019s real complaint is that the bleachers were there at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">But he knew they were there and knew also that players during the progress of the game might be thrown against \u201canything\u201d that was \u201caround there.\u201d With this knowledge he entered a \u201cstrenuous game\u201d and it is conceded that his \u201cattention was upon the ball from the moment of entry.\u201d Under these circumstances the only reasonable conclusion to be reached is that he voluntarily encountered a known danger with no heed thereto. Such conduct precludes recovery. <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>85 N. H. 474, 475, 476. See, also, <em>Williamson </em>v. <em>Company, </em>89 N.
