Section 18 of the Uniform Sales Act, which is in force here, (P.

The evidence regarding the transaction of July 19, when the plaintiff paid the entire purchase price for the boat and the defendant executed the so-called \u201cbill of sale,\u201d fully sustained the referee\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
