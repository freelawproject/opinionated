The question is whether the words \u201cto keep 'always for a home and in good repair\u201d accompanying the above bequest operate to work its forfeiture under the situation alleged. In our opinion the words themselves, their context, and the fact that there is no specific disposition of the property in case of forfeiture <em>(Ruel </em>v. <em>Hardy, </em>90 N. H. 240), all indicate that the words above quoted were intended to be of request and not of command, to be precatory not mandatory. It follows that the defendant\u2019s devise is of a fee simple absolute and that the acts which he is alleged to have done in relation to the property bequeathed do not operate to forfeit the gift.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-15\">\n<em>Case discharged.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
