While in the course of his employment on May 22, 1939, the plaintiff had occasion to go to the taxi office from the point in the garage where his master\u2019s cars were standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-16\">As he went, he passed over a bevelled edge in the concrete floor, and near it, he claimed, his foot caught in a \u201chole in the floor.\u201d He did not describe the \u201chole.\u201d Though he had worked there more than a year, he had never seen the \u201chole\u201d before.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-17\">A witness called by the plaintiff said that there were a few rough spots at or near the bevel, though he had never seen any holes. Still another plaintiff\u2019s witness testified that the plaintiff\u2019s heel caught in a crack \u201cwhere it is chipped off \u2014 I don\u2019t know if you call it a hole.\u201d The remaining witnesses were ignorant of any imperfection at the spot.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-18\">Photographs in evidence do not indicate any particular depression at the point where the plaintiff says he fell, but at most a slight roughness. <em>Niemi </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>87 N. H. 1, 2. The record is without any evidence that more than mere roughness was the cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injuries. The most that could be found is that he stepped <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>backward upon a slight roughness that checked his heel when he turned. There is no duty to maintain a garage floor so smooth that such a check cannot occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b435-10\">Branch, J., did not sit.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
