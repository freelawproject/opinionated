The present declaration gives them no information whatever as to what the plaintiff\u2019s claim of negligence may be. It is equally clear, however, from the amended record that this relief has not been finally denied to them. The order denying the motion for a specification was made \u201cwithout prejudice.\u201d It seems to indicate the court\u2019s acceptance of the statement of plaintiff\u2019s counsel that their investigation of the case was not complete and their knowledge inadequate to permit a specific statement of the plaintiff\u2019s claim. In this state of the record the defendants are free to renew their motion at a later time when it will be considered <em>de novo </em>in the light of the circumstances then disclosed. The interlocutory order to which exception was taken raises no question of law for this court to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">\n<em>Exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b87-9\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
