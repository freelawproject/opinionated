H. 419. The contention of the defendant, Belle Weiner, at the argument was, not that the case was void of evidence to sustain the specific findings of the master, but that the facts found by him were insufficient to sustain his conclusion that \u201cthe deed from Bessie to Belle of March 4, 1929, was not considered by either party thereto as an absolute, indefeasible conveyance of Bessie\u2019s title to Belle.\u201d It is unnecessary to review in detail the findings of the master. It is sufficient to say that he found, upon competent evidence, certain facts regarding the conduct of the parties, contemporaneous with and subsequent to the execution of the document, indicating a practical construction of its terms, fully in accord with his final conclusion, with which we are quite content.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b417-10\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
