The evidence permits of no other conclusion. An embolism was described in the testimony as a foreign body, such as a blood clot, which finds its way into the blood stream and goes \u201cwhirling through the circulation\u201d until it strikes a blood vessel too small to permit its passage and plugs it. In the case of a pulmonary embolism this results in a condition sometimes called \u201cinternal suffocation\u201d and the patient dies. The defendant testified that there is \u201cno way known to the medical profession to anticipate or prevent an embolism.\u201d The plaintiff, on the other hand, produced testimony that it was \u201cthe continued bleeding from the operation which brought about the embolism\u201d and argues that the prolonged period of bleed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>ing disclosed by the evidence might have been avoided if the defendant had given Mrs. Michael adequate attention. There is no basis in the evidence, however, for a finding that the embolism in question had started prior to the second operation. Mrs. Michael left the operating room after that operation with the bleeding completely stopped and generally in fair condition. Any evidence of negligence prior to that time may, therefore, be dismissed as non-causal.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">At 1:15 the patient began to spit \u201cbright red blood\u201d and the defendant gave as his opinion that \u201cthat\u2019s when she probably had the start of her embolism.\u201d He further testified as follows: \u201cQ. Assuming that she did die from an embolism, is there anything in your judgment that anybody could have done to have prevented it? A. Absolutely not.\u201d This was a question upon which the uninformed judgment of the jury was worthless and expert testimony was essential. <em>April </em>v. <em>Peront, </em>88 N. H. 309. The defendant\u2019s testimony was the only evidence in the case upon this point and must be accepted as true. It is obviously fatal to the plaintiff\u2019s contention that Mrs. Michael\u2019s death was due to neglect following the second operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">Dr. Domizio Costa, a surgeon residing in Revere, Massachusetts, was called by the plaintiff as an expert and was asked certain questions as to the propriety of the treatment in this case and the possibility of other treatment. These questions were excluded by the Presiding Justice as a matter of discretion, subject to the plaintiff\u2019s exception. It cannot be said as a matter of law that there was error in these rulings. Although Dr. Costa resided in Revere, Massachusetts, a city on the evidence comparable in size to Rochester, he testified that his practice was largely in Boston, and it was properly to be found that he was really a Boston surgeon. Since \u201ca person who holds himself out as practicing a particular profession is only required to possess the knowledge and to exercise the care and skill of the ordinary practitioner of that profession in the same place or in similar localities,\u201d <em>(April </em>v. <em>Peront, </em>88 N. H. 309) the opinion of a Boston surgeon as to what Dr. Roberts might or ought to have done was not receivable.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b529-8\">Bukque, J., did not sit: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
