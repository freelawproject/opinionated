Construing the above quoted section of the charter as a whole, and considering that nowhere else therein or elsewhere in the statutes is any provision made for recounting the votes cast for officers elected by the voters in the separate wards to serve the city at large, we are of the opinion that the legislature intended the Board of Aldermen of Dover to have power to recount the votes cast for officers with city-wide powers like the Mayor and Street Commissioner as well as power to recount the votes cast for officers to serve in or represent their respective wards.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">The Board of Aldermen having statutory authority to recount the ballots cast for Street Commissioner, the conclusion by them reached \u201cis final as to matters of fact and cannot be otherwise inquired into. The superintending power of the court is limited to the correction of errors of law apparent upon the record.\u201d <em>Sheehan </em>v. <em>Mayor and Aldermen, </em>74 N.
