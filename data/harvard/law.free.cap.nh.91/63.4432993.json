The authorities are collected and discussed in <em>Crowley </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>204 Iowa 1235, and note to that case in 53 A. L. R. 973. In the recent case of <em>Cyr </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>88 N. H. 278, it was assumed without discussion that such was the effect of open crossing gates. This being the law, it is plain that in a case where there is a failure of warning signals, a traveler can be held to be negligent as a matter of law only under very exceptional circumstances. More often such failure will be found to be \u201ca decisive consideration in favor of the submission of such an issue to the jury,\u201d as stated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>157 Md. 256 and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">In the present case the testimony of the plaintiff fully justified the inference that his conduct was influenced by the assurance of safety which he received from the open gates. The plaintiff\u2019s youth, and the close proximity of another locomotive to which he was giving attention were also factors to be considered in passing upon the issue of his due care. Under these circumstances it cannot be said as a matter of law that the evidence conclusively established his contributory negligence and there must accordingly be</p>\n<p id=\"b92-10\">\n<em>Judgments on the verdicts.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b92-11\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
