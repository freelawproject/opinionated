There was abundant evidence to sustain a finding that the defendant was chargeable with knowledge that the use of the grinder in question for the purpose of grinding a juicy fruit was likely to result in an accumulation of liquid upon the floor unless suitable precautions were taken and that some provision for guarding against this danger should have been made. No such provision had been made by the defendant. Under these circumstances, even if it be assumed that the servant who operated the grinder was negligent in failing to place a container in position to catch the juice as he had done of his own volition upon other occasions, this case is nevertheless governed by the rule laid down in <em>Leazotte </em>v. <em>Company, </em>74 N. H. 480, and <em>Vaisbord </em>v. <em>Company, </em>74 N. H. 470, that lack of care to guard against a danger which renders the work-place unsafe, of which the master knows or ought to have known in season to prevent the injury, is a breach of his duty toward his servants \u201cwithout reference to the manner in which the danger was created.\" The plaintiff's case should have been submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">New <em>trial.</em></p>\n<judges id=\"b136-9\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
