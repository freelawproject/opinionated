The judgment was rendered in the superior court against petitioner, and in favor of one Roche, for a certain sum of money; petitioner appealed from an order denying his motion for a- new trial and gave an undertaking in double the amount of the judgment, but has not appealed from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>judgment; and the plaintiff in the action is proceeding to enforce the judgment by execution, notwithstanding the undertaking, upon the theory that the execution of a judgment directing the payment of money cannot he stayed upon an appeal from an order denying a new trial, where there is no appeal from the judgment itself. It was held otherwise, however, in the recent case of <em>Holland v. McDade, ante, </em>p. 353, and upon the authority of that case the petition must he granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">Let the writ of supersedeas issue as prayed for in the petition.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
