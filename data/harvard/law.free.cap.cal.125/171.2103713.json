(Stats. 1885, p. 109.) The act reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-14\">\u201cSection 1. Every person performing work or labor of any kind in, with, about or upon any threshing machine, the engine, horse-power, wagons, or appurtenances thereof, while engaged in threshing, shall have a lien upon the same to the extent of the value of his services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-15\">\u201cSec. <em>2. </em>The lien herein given shall extend for ten days after the person has ceased such work or labor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-16\">\u201cSec. 3. If judgment shall be recovered in any action to re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>cover for said services for work or labor performed, and said property shall be sold, the proceeds of such sale shall be distributed <em>pro rata </em>to all judgment creditors who have, within ten. days, begun suits to recover judgments for the amount due them for such work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-5\">\u201cSec. 4. The lien shall expire unless a suit to recover the amount of the claim is brought within ten days after the party ceases work.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">The findings of the court bearing on the question involved in the appeal are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-7\">\u201c1. That each and every one of the plaintiffs mentioned in said complaint was employed by the defendant to do and did perform work and labor in, with, and upon the threshing machine and appurtenances mentioned and described in said complaint while the same was engaged in threshing during the threshing season of 1896.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-8\">\u201c2. That each and every one of said plaintiffs ceased such work and labor on September 16, 1896, between 11 and 12 o\u2019clock A. M., and at no time since then has been engaged in such work and labor for defendant or any one on said machine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-9\">\u201c3. That no threshing has been done at any time with said machine since September 16, 1896.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-10\">\u201c4. That such work and labor had ceased for more than ten days before plaintiff commenced this action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-11\">The action was commenced September 28, 1896, and as a conclusion of law the court found in favor of the plaintiffs for their money demand, in the aggregate sum of four hundred and sixteen dollars and sixty-five cents, but that plaintiffs have no liens upon, and cannot enforce the lien against, the threshing machine and appurtenances mentioned and described in said complaint, or at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-12\">The plaintiffs appeal from so much of the judgment as declared that the said plaintiffs had no lien and were not entitled to an attorney\u2019s fee, and from the order denying said plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-13\">The evidence abundantly supports the findings of fact, and is all one way as to the time when work in the threshing ceased. Plaintiff Frank Kite, testifying in his own behalf, says: \u201cWe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>did no threshing for anybody after about noon of the sixteenth day of September, 1896. I did not know of anything further to do; supposed it was the last job.\u201d Plaintiff Ed. Copsey, in his own behalf, says: \u201cThe last day the machine was engaged in threshing was the sixteenth day of September, 1896. We quit about noon.\u201d Plaintiff Tom Piers, in his own behalf, says: \u201cThe machine quit on the sixteenth of September, 1896, about noon; did no work after the sixteenth that I know of.\u201d Defendant Bell says: \u201cThe machine has not done any threshing in this county for anybody since about noon, September 16, 1896.\u201d Witnesses W. D. Ashe and W. H. Brown, for defendant, testified to the same effect. Plaintiff Joe Copsey, in rebuttal, after stating that Bell had agreed to give them two days extra, says: \u201cI knew the work was finished on the sixteenth day of September, 1896.\u201d William Mitchell, for plaintiff, says: \u201cWe quit threshing about noon on the sixteenth day of September, 1896.\u201d This is all the testimony in reference to the time when the threshing ceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">The statute gives a lien for services mentioned therein \u201cwhile engaged in threshing,\u201d and \u201cthe lien shall expire unless a suit to recover the amount of the claim is brought within ten days after the party ceases work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">The lien in question is purely statutory, and the right to the same cannot be extended beyond the limits prescribed by the plain language of the law. The work while engaged in threshing having ceased on the sixteenth of September, the lien expired before the action was commenced, to wit, September 28th.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">The judgment and order denying a new trial are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">Harrison, J., and Beatty, C. J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
