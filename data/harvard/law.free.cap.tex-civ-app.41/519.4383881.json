Tried below before Hon. Sam. R. Scott.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b543-11\">Mrs. Sinclair was a passenger on a street car, which collided with another car. She testified that she was thrown down and received bruises and injury to the womb and ovaries. The two motormen and a passenger who was sitting by her contradicted her testimony as to being thrown down or apparently injured. She was corroborated as to the existence of injuries by the physician who treated her and the landlady where she boarded, and this fact denied by the defendant\u2019s surgeon who examined her about a month after the occurrence.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b543-12\"><em>Ciarle &amp; Bolinger, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqpX\">The great preponderance of the testimony showed conslusively that plaintiff was not injured and could not have been injured by the accident, and the verdict for plaintiff in any sum was manifestly against the weight of the evidence.

In very material matters the plaintiff was contradicted by three witnesses, one of whom appears to have been disinterested, and the other two were employes of the defendant. There were some other circumstances tending to discredit her, and also some tending to sustain her.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">It is the peculiar province of a jury to pass upon the credibility of witnesses; and when they have given credence to some as against others, or even to one, as against others, and the trial judge has refused to grant a new trial, the general rule is that an Appellate Court, considering the case upon written testimony and not having the witnesses before it, should not disturb the verdict. If it be conceded that the rule referred to is not without exceptions, we are of opinion that this case is not so extraordinary as to take it out of the general rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">No error has been shown and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">Writ of error refused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
