We hold that such a gain was not so taxable under the law then in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>In March, 1971, the B. W. Company (taxpayer), then named the Boston Wharf Company, entered into an agreement to sell certain real estate. In April, 1971, the taxpayer adopted a plan of complete liquidation and sold the real estate. All the trust\u2019s assets were distributed within one year of the adoption of the plan of liquidation, thereby satisfying all the conditions of \u00a7 337 (a) of the Code for the nonrecognition of gain or loss from the sale of assets during that year. The taxpayer seasonably filed a Massachusetts income tax return for its taxable year ended January 31, 1972, treating the gain on the sale of its real estate as subject to tax. It paid the tax on that gain and filed an application for abatement of that tax. The State Tax Commission (commission) denied the application, and, on appeal, the Appellate Tax Board (board) ruled in favor of the commission. The taxpayer appeals from the board\u2019s decision and in particular contests the board\u2019s denial of requests for rulings which challenged the imposition of tax on the trust\u2019s gain from the sale of its real estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">The taxpayer, as a trust with transferable shares, was subject to the taxes imposed by G. L. c. 62. G. L. c. 62, \u00a7 8 <em>(a), </em>as appearing in St. 1971, c. 555, \u00a7 5. Under that chapter, the starting point in calculating the taxpayer\u2019s taxable income was the taxpayer\u2019s gross income. G. L. c. 62, \u00a7 2, as appearing in St. 1971, c. 555, \u00a7 5. Section 2 (a) of G. L. c. 62 stated that \u201c[g]ross income means federal gross income\u201d with certain additions and deductions which are not relevant here. \u201cFederal gross income\u201d was defined in G. L. c. 62, \u00a7 1 <em>(d), </em>as appearing in St. 1971, c. 555, \u00a7 5, as \u201cgross income as defined under the [Internal Revenue Code as amended on January 1,1971] .\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> G. L. c. 62, \u00a7 1 (c), as appearing in St. 1971, c. 555, \u00a7 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">Clearly, the taxpayer\u2019s unrecognized gain was not in-cludible in its gross income for Federal income tax pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>poses.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Gross income is defined in the Code to be \u201call income from whatever source derived\u201d subject, however, to the introductory phrase: \u201cExcept as otherwise provided in this subtitle [the subtitle concerning income tax].\u201d Int. Rev. Code of 1954, \u00a7 61. Various sections of the Code imply that unrecognized gains are not part of gross income. See, e.g., Int. Rev. Code of 1954, \u00a7 63. The regulations promulgated under the Code expressly state that \u201c[c]ertain realized gains or losses on the sale or exchange of property are not \u2018recognized\u2019, that is, are not included in or deducted from <em>gross income </em>at the time the transaction occurs...\u201d (emphasis supplied). Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.61-6 (b) (1960). That regulation cites \u00a7 337 as one which provides that gain or loss from certain sales or exchanges will not be considered in the calculation of the taxpayer\u2019s gross income.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">Although the taxpayer\u2019s gain clearly was not part of its Federal gross income and literally, therefore, was not part of the taxpayer\u2019s Massachusetts gross income, the commission advances several arguments in an attempt to persuade us to rule that the taxpayer\u2019s gain was taxable. The commission argues that business trusts have been treated traditionally as individuals and not as corporations for Massachusetts income tax purposes. Obviously \u00a7 337 of the Code could not be applied sensibly to an individual. The problem with the commission\u2019s argument is that the 1971 act directs only that such a trust be considered to be an individual (and not a corporation) \u201c[i]n determining the Code <em>deductions </em>allowable to such... trust\u201d (emphasis supplied) . G. L. c. 62, \u00a7 8 <em>(a). </em>If the Legislature had intended to imply that a business trust be treated as an individual for all purposes, this statutory provision would have been unnecessary. This reference to the determination of \u201cdeductions\u201d and the absence of a similar provision as to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>determination of gross income are significant. The 1971 act left the determination of gross income to the provisions of the Code. If the Legislature had intended that a trust with transferable shares should be treated as if it were an individual in determining its gross income, it could have said so.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">The commission argues that we should reject the literal application of the Federal income tax definition of gross income because otherwise no Massachusetts income tax will be payable on any gain which resulted from the implementation of the taxpayer\u2019s plan of liquidation. The commission says that, as a practical matter, \u00a7 337 of the Code is intended to permit taxpayers to avoid possible double Federal taxation and that, because no gain is taxable to the trust\u2019s shareholders, the Legislature could not have intended to exempt from taxation all gain realized from the sale of the taxpayer\u2019s real estate and the liquidation of the taxpayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">We do not accept the commission\u2019s argument that the taxpayer\u2019s shareholders could not be subject to tax on any gain from the liquidation of the trust. In 1964, the trustees of the Boston Wharf Company entered into an agreement under G. L. c. 62, \u00a7 1, as then amended, with the Commissioner of Corporations and Taxation to be taxed on its income. That agreement meant that the shareholders were not to be taxed on dividends under the law then in effect. G. L. c. 62, \u00a7\u00a7 1 (c) and (e), as amended by St. 1935, c. 489, \u00a7 6, and St. 1963, c. 496, respectively. The question whether capital gain on liquidation could have been taxed to the shareholders of such a trust under that law has not been answered by this court. In <em>Coffman </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>365 Mass. 337, 341 (1974), we noted, but expressed no opinion on, the \u201cquestion whether the shareholders were taxable on the capital gain received by them.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>Under the provisions of G. L. c. 62, as appearing in St. 1971, c. 555 (the income tax provisions applicable at the time of distribution of the trust\u2019s assets), the dividend income of a trust with transferable shares may be deductible from a shareholder\u2019s adjusted gross income (G. L. c. 62, \u00a7\u00a7 3 [/] and <em>8 </em>[c], as appearing in St. 1971, c. 555, \u00a7 5), but there is no suggestion that any capital gain from the disposition of such shares is not to be taxed as \u201cnet capital gain.\u201d See G. L. c. 62, \u00a7 4 <em>(a) </em>(3), as appearing in St. 1971, c. 555, \u00a7 5.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See also Int. Rev. Code of 1954, \u00a7 331 <em>(a) </em>(1). If there were a legislative intent that gain from the sale of property by a trust in a \u00a7 337 liquidation should be taxed at some level, the statutory language involved here suggests that that tax may be applicable to the shareholder\u2019s gain, if any, and not to any gain to the trust.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">This case is unlike recent cases where we have recognized a clear legislative purpose in a tax statute and have avoided a literal reading of the statutory language which would have produced a result inconsistent with that purpose. See <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>The PoGM Co., </em>369 Mass. 611, 613 (1976); <em>Industrial Fin. Corp. </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>367 Mass. 360, 364-367 (1975). If the State income tax law has incorporated Federal income tax provisions, those provisions should be interpreted as they are interpreted for Federal income tax purposes. <em>Forte Inv. Fund </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>369 Mass. 786, 788 (1976). We should be reluctant to infer the existence of a State legislative intent which would require us to disregard the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>meaning established under Federal tax law of unambiguous, common statutory language. <em>Id. </em>at 551.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">The decision of the Appellate Tax Board is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b33-8\"> Statute 1971, c. 555, was approved on July 22, 1971, and by its terms was applicable to taxable years commencing after December 31, v 1970.
