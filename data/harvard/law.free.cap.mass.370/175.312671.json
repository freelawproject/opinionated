L. c. 151 A), with respect to the services of those of its employees who work exclusively in DeCordova\u2019s school of art. DeCordova is a nonprofit corporation which maintains an arts center in Lincoln, consisting of a museum, a park, and a school of art. The school of art has its own administrative and teaching staff and functions separately from DeCordova\u2019s other programs but as a unit within DeCor-dova\u2019s organizational structure. DeCordova claims that employment in its school of art is not \u201cemployment\u201d as defined in G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 4A, inserted by St. 1971, c. 940, \u00a7 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">The basic controversy turns on whether persons working in the school of art are \u201cin the employ of a religious, charitable, educational or other organization, other than a school which is not an institution of higher education.\u201d G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 4A (/). The parties agree that the school is not an institution of higher education. DeCordova argues that, therefore, services for such a school are excluded from \u201cemployment\u201d covered under the Employment Security Law. The Director of the Division of Employment Security (Director) argues that employees working for the school of art are in the employ of DeCordova and that DeCordova is not an exempt school. We conclude that this awkwardly drafted statute requires DeCordova to treat employees working for its school of art as engaged in employment covered by the Employment Security Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">DeCordova\u2019s appeal has arrived here as a result of the following events. The Director concluded that DeCordova\u2019s school employees were engaged in \u201cemployment\u201d under G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 4A, interpreting the exemption for services in the employ of a school as applicable only to organizations operating a primary, elementary, or secondary school, \u201cthe attendance at which is required by law and therefore, compulsory.\u201d DeCordova appealed to the board of review (board) in the Division of Employment Security. The board found that teachers are required to enter into teach<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>ing agreements with DeCordova and that the right to terminate a teacher\u2019s employment rests ultimately with the director of DeCordova and its board of directors. On the other hand, the board of review found that the school of art was functionally separate from DeCordova\u2019s other programs. Not relying on the reason advanced by the Director in support of his decision, a majority of the three-person board ruled that the services performed by the staff of the school of art constituted employment, \u201cnot in the employ of a school, but in the employ of the appellant organization, a non-profit educational organization within the meaning of [\u00a7 4A (/)].\u201d The board, therefore, affirmed the Director\u2019s decision. The decision of the board was affirmed in turn on DeCordova\u2019s appeal to the District Court of Central Mid-dlesex. See G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7\u00a712 and 42. DeCordova then appealed directly to this court, as provided in G. L. c. 151A, \u00a742.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">We agree with DeCordova that the question before us is solely a question of law. There are no findings of fact made by the board which preclude DeCordova from seeking our independent judgment on the application of \u00a7 4A <em>(f) </em>to its circumstances. The facts are not in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">Our function is to discern the legislative intent in the language of \u00a7 4A (/). Literally, \u00a7 4A (/), which is set forth in full in the margin,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> includes within covered employment any service performed in the employ of an organization unless that organization is a school below college level. Employment by DeCordova obviously is employment by an organization, and DeCordova as an organization is not a school below college level.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">DeCordova responds to this literal application of \u00a7 4A (/) by contending that it should not be required to contribute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>solely because it maintains a museum as well as a school of art. It argues that employees of an identical school of art, standing alone as an employer, would not be engaged in employment under the statute and that the Legislature could not have intended to require different treatment of services for two otherwise similar schools. DeCordova stresses that it operates a school of the type defined in \u00a7 4A (/) and that the word \u201corganization\u201d in \u00a7 4A (/) does not require that the organization be a legal entity. DeCordova undertakes to support this position by the legislative history of \u00a7 4A (/).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Section 4A was added to G. L. c. 151A by St. 1971, c. 940, an act the heading of which states that it further regulates \u201cthe provisions of the employment security law in order to conform with the requirements of the federal law____\u201d An introductory clause states that the purpose of St. 1971, c. 940, is \u201cto immediately make necessary changes in the employment security law in order to conform with federal law____\u201d From this language and the provisions of the act, a legislative intent to adjust the Massachusetts law to meet Federal requirements is apparent. There is no indication that the Legislature intended any other broadening of the scope of the coverage of the law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">The 1970 amendments to the Federal law encouraged States to make services in the employ of most charitable organizations subject to the State unemployment system for the first time.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, certain services in the employ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>of charitable organizations do not have to be covered by a State\u2019s law. See Int. Rev. Code of 1954, \u00a7 3309 (b). Among these services are services performed \u201cin the employ of a school which is not an institution of higher education.\u201d Int. Rev. Code of 1954, \u00a7 3309 (b) (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Statute 1971, c. 940, adopted all the permissible Federal exceptions concerning employees of charitable organizations. All of them, except the exemption involved here, were added to G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 6, which lists services which are not included within \u201cemployment.\u201d St. 1971, c. 940, \u00a7 8. A number of the services exempted by G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 6, are defined in terms of the nature of the service performed and not in terms of the nature of the employer. We think that some significance can be derived from the fact that the exception in \u00a7 3309 (b) (3) for services \u201cin the employ of a school which is not an institution of higher education\u201d is absent from the listing of exempt services in \u00a7 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">The Legislature undertook to exclude from \u201cemployment\u201d services in the employ of a school below college level in the section which otherwise extended coverage to educational institutions and other charitable organizations. It merged the language of \u00a7 3306 (c) (8) \u2014 \u201cservice performed in the employ of a religious, charitable, educational, or other organization described in section 501 (c) (3) ...\u201d \u2014 with the language from \u00a7 3309 (b) (3) \u2014 \u201cin the employ of a school which is not an institution of higher education\u201d \u2014 to produce \u00a7 4A (/). This blending of themes was not accomplished without some discord, but we think it significant that the word \u201corganization\u201d in \u00a7 4A (/) incorporates the Federal tax meaning of the word \u201corganization\u201d as appearing in \u00a7 501 of the Code. Such an organization must be formally organized, at least to the extent of having its own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>articles of organization.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See Int. Rev. Code of 1954, \u00a7 501 (c) (3); Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.501(c) (3)-1(a), (b) (1939). Cf. <em>Faulkner </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>112 F.2d 987, 989 (1st Cir. 1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">The use of the term \u201corganization\u201d in \u00a7 4A (/) supports the Director\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 4A (/). A school below college level the employees of which are to be exempt from coverage must be an organization which exists as such under Federal tax law. The employees working in DeCordova\u2019s school of art are employees of an organization (De-Cordova) described in \u00a7 501 (c) (3) of the Code and exempt from income tax under \u00a7 501 (a) of the Code. However, that organization is not a school. We will adhere to the meaning for Federal tax purposes of language incorporated in a State statute where no contrary legislative intent is apparent. See <em>B.W. Co. </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, ante, </em>18, 22-23 (1976); <em>Fort\u00e9 Inv. Fund </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>369 Mass. 786, 788 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">Other considerations which might be guides in determining the meaning of this language tend, on balance, to support our conclusion that employees of the school of art are covered. By deciding that those employees are within the act we eliminate the possibility that the Commonwealth\u2019s plan might be found to be underinclusive and thus fail to achieve approval by the Federal government. Our decision conforms to the mandate of G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 74, as appearing in St. 1949, c. 290, that the Employment Security Law \u201cshall be construed liberally in aid of its purpose, which purpose is to lighten the burden which now falls on the unemployed worker and his family.\u201d On the other hand, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>we recognize that neither the State nor Federal law requires that all employees of a single employer be treated similarly, as either covered or not covered. See G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 4A <em>(d) </em>and (e) and \u00a7 8; Int. Rev. Code of 1954, \u00a7 3306 (c) (5), (10), (13) , (15), and (17). We further recognize that a corporate reorganization may produce the tax result for which DeCordova argues here and that the different treatment of employees of DeCordova\u2019s school of art and those of a similar school, having no other activities, has no strong support in terms of public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b191-8\"> General Laws c. 151 A, \u00a7 <em>4A </em>(/), reads as follows: \u201c[The term \u2018employment\u2019 shall include any service performed] <em>...(f) </em>in the employ of a religious, charitable, educational or other organization, other than a school which is not an institution of higher education, \u2014 only if the service is excluded from \u2018employment\u2019 as defined in the Federal Unemployment Tax Act solely by reason of section 3306 (c) (8) of that act and is not excluded from \u2018employment\u2019 under section six.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b192-10\"> The Employment Security Amendments of 1970 made extensive changes in the Federal unemployment tax provisions.
