L. c. 278, \u00a7 \u00a7 33A-33G, on the defendant\u2019s appeal from his conviction of murder in the second degree and the resulting sentence of imprisonment to the Massachusetts Correctional Institution at Walpole for life. The defendant was tried together with his brother Frank Grace, who was found guilty of murder in the first degree, and with two others who were found not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>The defendant and his brother each filed a separate appeal, and each filed a separate but practically identical motion for a new trial. Their cases were both remitted to the Superior Court for hearing on the motions. G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. The trial judge heard the motions together and denied them by a single decision containing findings and an order applicable to both cases. The defendant and his brother then each appealed from the denial of his motion, and the original and supplemental records on appeal in both cases were again entered in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">The defendant, as did his brother, challenges the denial of his motion for a new trial and also seeks to raise other assignments of error in the conduct of the trial. However, the lawyer who represented both the defendant and his brother in their appeals filed a single brief applying in common to both cases and which argued only the appeal from the denial of the motions for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">We hold that there was no error in the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, and, for the reasons which we expressed in his brother\u2019s case, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grace, ante, </em>746, 758 (1976), we consider all other assignments of error waived. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">The evidence relating to the shooting of the victim, Marvin Morgan, is amply set out in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grace, ante </em>at 747-750. At trial, the defendant attempted to discredit the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses and to establish, through his testimony and that of others, that he was not present at the scene of the shooting, which occurred in front of the West End Social Club at approximately 11:30 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">The defendant\u2019s testimony was essentially as follows: He and his girl friend (now wife) Maria were at the home of one Francis Jones on the evening of August 8, 1972. They all watched television until sometime after eleven, when the news was coming on.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He and Maria then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>stopped by the home of one William Shell where they met a Mr. and Mrs. Johnson downstairs. After speaking briefly with the Johnsons, he started upstairs to Shell\u2019s apartment and met Shell on the steps. This occurred at approximately 11:20 p.m. After a brief conversation with Shell, the two men left and went to Summit Street, where the defendant planned to stay for the night. He arrived at Summit Street at approximately 11:25 p.m. and met another of his girl friends, Peggy Woodward, there. He got a beer, took a bath and then put on a bathrobe, turned on the television and a tape recorder, and ate a sandwich. Shortly thereafter, Vera Rudolph came to the door and told the defendant about an incident at the West End Social Club and about the arrest of the defendant\u2019s brother for murder. He also told the defendant that the police were looking for him in connection with the shooting. The next day, the defendant, accompanied by his attorney, turned himself in. While prosecution witnesses had testified that the assailants had \u201cAfro\u201d haircuts, the defendant testified that on the date of the homicide in question his hair was closely cropped.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">On cross-examination, the defendant denied having been the subject of a \u201crip off,\u201d although he admitted having made some sort of theft report to the State police. The Commonwealth then introduced the record of a conviction for breaking and entering to impeach the defendant\u2019s credibility. G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21, as appearing in St. 1950, c. 426.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">Several witnesses were called to corroborate the defendant\u2019s alibi testimony. Francis Jones, the brother-in-law of Maria Grace, testified that the defendant was present at his home until sometime after 11 p.m., at which time he left with Maria. Frances Jones, Maria\u2019s sister, testified to the same effect. Maria herself testified that she was with the defendant at the Jones house until after 11 P.M., and that she then left the defendant off at the Shell house approximately ten minutes later.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">Patricia Johnson and Alice Shell, Maria\u2019s sisters, testified that the defendant arrived at the Shell house about 11:30 p.m. The Shell house is approximately three blocks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>from the West End Social Club, the scene of the shooting. Robert Johnson corroborated his wife\u2019s testimony, placing the defendant at the Shell house sometime near 11:30 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">The final witness to testify and corroborate the defendant\u2019s story was Peggy Woodward. She testified that the defendant arrived at her apartment at approximately 11:30 p.m. and appeared calm and normal. She further stated that he got a beer, took a bath, changed into pajamas and watched television. Sometime between 12:30 and 1 a.m., three persons came to the apartment and told the defendant about the shooting and that his brother had been arrested. The defendant remained at Woodward\u2019s apartment all night.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">1. The defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial was based on evidence which he alleged to be \u201cnewly discovered and highly relevant.\u201d The nature and content of that evidence is set out in our opinion in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grace, ante </em>at 751-755. Essentially, the evidence was in the form of affidavits and oral testimony which (a) tended to support the alibi defense developed at the trial,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (b) challenged the testimony of a government witness whose identification of the defendant and his brother was allegedly prompted by the police, and (c) questioned the partiality of one juror who sat on the case. The judge found that the evidence was not \u201cnewly discovered\u201d and was cumulative, and he stated that he was \u201cnot convinced that justice either was not, or may not have been, done at the trial.\u201d Accordingly, he denied the defendant\u2019s motion. For the reasons we have detailed extensively in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grace, ante </em>at 751-755, there was no error in the judge\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">2. Pursuant to our obligation under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, we have considered the whole case on the law and the evidence. We have done so with particular care to determine whether the evidence introduced to support the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial indicates that justice may not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>have been done. On the basis of this review, we conclude that the jury\u2019s verdict was proper, and that neither the \u201cnew\u201d evidence nor the conduct of the trial itself warrants our ordering a new trial or reducing the verdict to a lesser degree of guilt. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeChristoforo, </em>360 Mass. 531, 543-544 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">\n<em>Order denying motion for new trial affirmed.
