May the Commission, in issuing a cease and desist order against the union, add an order requiring the parties to submit to arbitration an alleged \u201chiring freeze\u201d and work assignment by the employer, when arbitration was not applied for under the grievance provision of the collective bargaining agreement, and the Commission has not proceeded with a pending \u201cprohibited practice\u201d complaint against the employer regarding the hiring freeze? The question is a limited one. A judge of the Superior Court held in the circumstances of the case that the added order was erroneous. We agree that it was not authorized by the statutory provision on which the Commission relied, \u00a7 9A of new c. 150E of the General Laws (\u201cLabor Relations: Public Employees,\u201d effective July 1, 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">The facts appear in the stipulation of agreed facts on which the judge below acted. On March 15, 1974, the Department of Public Welfare entered into a collective bargaining agreement with Local 509, Service Employees International Union, AFL-CIO (Union), which represented the social workers employed to carry out the department\u2019s welfare program. Certain provisions of the contract (simplified) described an employee\u2019s normal caseload in an office as 120 cases and set out procedures for dealing with surplus cases. Such cases were to be first assigned on a \u201cpro-rata overtime basis\u201d to any employees who volunteered, but if there were insufficient volunteers or the overtime fund was temporarily depleted, the cases were to be mandatorily assigned to employees up to a maximum of 180 cases. The agreement, which was lengthy and detailed, further contained a \u201cno strike\u201d clause and a \u201cgrievance procedure\u201d culminating in final and binding arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">In October, 1974, some employees refused, at the urging of the Union, to handle assigned surplus cases. The Union claimed that the surplus had been generated by reductions of staff created by an administrative hiring freeze allegedly in violation of the sense, even if not the text, of the agreement. The Union, however, did not file a grievance under the arbitration provision. Instead, for reasons of its own, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>the Union on October 23, 1974, filed a \u201cprohibited practice\u201d charge with the Labor Relations Commission under \u00a7 10 (a) (5) .<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The next day the Director of the Division of Employee Relations of the Department of Administration and Finance \u2014 the public employer for present purposes<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u2014 informed the Commission that an illegal strike (more properly, an illegal withholding of services) was in progress in violation of \u00a7 9A (a), and demanded that the Commission conduct an investigation and institute appropriate court action under \u00a7 9A <em>(b) </em>to enjoin the violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">The Commission conducted a hearing on the Employer\u2019s petition and, on October 30, 1974, entered an order under \u00a7 9A <em>(b) </em>requiring the Union to cease and desist from encouraging or sanctioning the withholding of services by the employees. However, the order was subject to two \u201cprovided\u201d clauses: that the disputed assignment of cases and the imposition of the hiring freeze be promptly submitted to binding arbitration pursuant to the agreement, and that the parties participate in good faith in the arbitration procedures \u2014 to which was added the \u201ccaution\u201d that frustration of the arbitration by either party might furnish \u201ca basis for reconsideration hereof.\u201d The parties both sought modification of the order and on November 14 the Commission issued a final revised order, set out in the margin,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> still <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>under authority of \u00a7 9A (b), in which (among certain other changes) the \u201cprovided\u201d form was dropped and good-faith arbitration was directly commanded. It is noteworthy that the Commission left hanging and took no steps concerning the prohibited practice charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">The Commission did not immediately bring an action under \u00a7 9A (6) to enforce its order. Instead, the Employer sued the Commission in the Superior Court resting jurisdiction on G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, and praying a modification of the order to eliminate the command that the parties submit to binding arbitration. (In fact the Employer has been willing to arbitrate the issue whether social workers could be assigned more than 120 cases, but resisted any arbitration concerning the hiring freeze.) The Commission answered and counterclaimed, naming the Union as an additional defendant to the counterclaim, and prayed enforcement of its entire final order. The Union contested the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>portion of the order directing it to cease and desist, but argued that the order to arbitrate was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">On agreed facts, the judge of the Superior Court sustained the Employer\u2019s position. He upheld the cease and desist part of the order, and struck the rest. His decision to delete the order to arbitrate went on two alternative grounds. First, the stricken provisions were not authorized by \u00a7 9A (6) on which the Commission had relied; it was not a \u201crequirement\u201d which the Commission could \u201cset\u201d in connection with prohibiting an illegal strike, work stoppage, slowdown, or withholding of services. Second, the basic matter commanded to be arbitrated \u2014 the imposition of a hiring freeze \u2014 was intrinsically nonarbitrable: resulting from financial stringency, it was a matter of executive and legislative decision, not amenable to review by an arbitrator. See generally Annot., 68 A.L.R.3d 885 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">We took the case on request of the parties under G. L. c. 211A, \u00a7 10 (A). The Union does not now contest the cease and desist part of the order and so the sole issue on appeal is the propriety of the judge\u2019s deletion of the arbitration order. In affirming, we rest on the first ground, and do not reach or express any views about the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">1. Section 9A <em>(a) </em>is an absolute prohibition of strikes and the like by public employees. It states: \u201cNo public employee or employee organization shall engage in a strike, and no public employee or employee organization shall induce, encourage or condone any strike, work stoppage, slowdown or withholding of services by such public employees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">By subsection <em>(b) </em>of \u00a7 9A, the Commission is directed to prevent or correct any violations it finds, after investigation, to exist: \u201cWhenever a strike occurs or is about to occur, the employer shall petition the commission to make an investigation. If, after investigation, the commission determines that any provision of paragraph <em>(a) </em>of this section has been or is about to be violated, it shall immediately set requirements that must be complied with, including, but not limited to, instituting appropriate proceedings in the superior court for the county wherein such violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>has occurred or is about to occur for enforcement of such requirements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">It is argued that the power in subsection (6) to \u201cimmediately set requirements that must be complied with\u201d includes the authority not only to compel employee compliance with the fundamental prohibitory rule of subsection (a), but also to compel action by both the Employer and the Union to resolve the dispute which appears to have occasioned the employee unrest \u2014 including, as in this case, an order for mandatory arbitration for which there is no express basis anywhere in c. 150E. We agree with the trial judge that the natural reading of subsection (6) is otherwise. It is not an independent provision or a global one. It is tied to subsection (o) and confers the specific power on the Commission immediately to set requirements to be complied with by the offending party which will eliminate the violation and which may be enforced in case of further violation by resort to the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">If there is unclarity in the text of \u00a7 9A <em>(b) </em>,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> it is much relieved, we think, by an examination of its legislative history. The language about setting requirements can be traced to a bill (1973 House Doc. No. 6194, opp. B) drafted by a special commission, with Senator George Mendonca as chairman, created to recommend changes in the statute governing labor relations in the public sector. See Res. 1969, c. 97; 1971, c. 24. This bill<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and two others that followed<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> departed from the traditional absolute prohibition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>of strikes by public employees (see <em>Hansen </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>344 Mass. 214 [1962]) and would have allowed public employees to strike if during contract negotiations an impasse continued after mediation and fact-finding stages. To meet the dangers that might arise in such situations, there was provision that if a strike endangering the public health or safety was \u201coccurring, or about to occur,\u201d the public employer could petition the Labor Relations Commission to make an investigation, and \u201c[i]f the Commission finds that there is imminent or present danger to the health and safety of the public, the Commission shall set requirements that must be complied with to avoid or remove any such imminent or present danger.\u201d 1973 House Doc. No. 6194, opp. B, \u00a7 9 <em>(c) </em>(4). This seems clearly to mean that the Commission could specify standards that must be met by the public employees, such as maintaining a skeletal force to stay on the job, so that the services vital to health and safety would continue. That the \u201crequirements\u201d to be \u201cset\u201d did not envisage orders directed to the employer was indicated by a further provision, \u00a7 9 (c) (6), which would entitle the Commission to institute proceedings in the Superior Court to compel the employees or the employee organization to abide by the section, but which made no mention of enforcement proceedings against the employer.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>The intended limited scope of the \u201cset requirements\u201d provision is again illustrated by the fact that in another provision of the bill there was explicit authorization for the Commission to order arbitration to prevent or end a strike that endangered public safety.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u00a7 9 (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">The final bills<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and the law as enacted continued to include language directing the employer to petition the Commission in case of a strike and ordering the Commission to investigate and if necessary \u201cto set requirements that must be complied with.\u201d But because there was now a prohibition of all work stoppage, there was no need for the rest of the original language that looked to maintaining vital services. Folded into the provision was the authority for the Corn-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>mission to institute \u201cappropriate proceedings in the superior court... for enforcement of such requirements.\u201d The changes mentioned leave the evident meaning of \u201cset requirements\u201d unchanged, which is, in short, that the Commission might require performance of the workload by public employees who had been found in violation (that is, might create a basis for punishment by the court of concerted activities preventing the attainment of the workload) . <em>For </em>example, the Commission might initially order the Union to cease and desist from encouraging or condoning a slowdown. If the slowdown continued, the Commission could set a specified minimum amount of labor in a work period, with performance below that level figuring as a continuance of the slowdown. The same holds for a \u201cwithholding of services,\u201d and if the cease and desist order in the present case did not itself imply a level of 180 cases, that or another requirement shown to be appropriate could have been set.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">2. The Commission and the Union suggest that the Commission\u2019s role in dealing with strikes will be seriously diminished if it cannot attempt to resolve the underlying dispute. The suggestion has conspicuously little persuasive force in the present case because the Union had presented the heart of the dispute (as the Union saw it) to the Commission in the form of a charge of \u201cprohibited practice\u201d under \u00a7 10, but instead of availing itself of the opportunity, the Commission chose to disengage itself from the problem and to try to pass it to an arbitrator.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> More generally, however, there is an underestimation of the value of \u00a7 9A <em>(b) </em>which looks to the intervention in a strike situation of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>impartial agency with specialized experience. It can be hoped that a byproduct effect of this intervention will often be a reconciliation of the parties and an end to the difficulty. Even where resort by the Commission to a court becomes necessary, the fact that it is an independent body that seeks the order, instead of the employer as before the enactment of c. 150E (see, e.g., <em>School Comm. of Boston </em>v. <em>Reilly, </em>362 Mass. 334 [1972]; <em>Hansen </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>344 Mass. 214 [1962]; <em>City of Medford, </em>Mass. L.R.C. No. MUPL-29, 3 CCH Lab. L. Rep., State Laws par. 49,999A.50 [March 6, 1973]), is likely to make the result more acceptable to the employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">It is argued, further, that the Legislature \u201cunequivocally indicated its preference for arbitration... as the desired method for resolving disputes\u201d and hence \u00a7 9A <em>(b) </em>should be interpreted to permit the Commission to compel arbitration. The Commission\u2019s modification of its original order, which had conditioned the cease and desist provision on arbitration, was perhaps a recognition that there are some limits to the use of arbitration even on the expansive view of \u00a7 9A <em>(b) </em>that the Commission espouses. The fact is that c. 150E expresses no unrestrained preference for arbitration in the public employment situations. Although \u00a7 <em>8 </em>(which deals with grievance procedures) seems to regard binding arbitration as a preferred mechanism for resolution of grievances, the Commission may order arbitration only at the request of one of the parties. Moreover, the section does not authorize the Commission to supersede a multistage grievance procedure that is provided by agreement and that culminates in binding arbitration, such as existed in the present case. See <em>Town of Danvers, </em>Mass. L.R.C. No. MUP-2068 at 3, 3 CCH Lab. L. Rep., State Laws par. 49,999C.64 (December 20,1974). Under \u00a7 9 (which deals with contract negotiation), in cases of probable impasse of union and employer in negotiating a collective agreement, either party may petition the Board of Conciliation and Arbitration to investigate and determine whether an impasse exists, and the Board may then provide a mediation and fact-finding service to bring the parties together. But arbitration to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>resolve an impasse must have been \u201cvoluntarily agreed to by the parties.\u201d \u00a7 9. Despite the illegality of a strike or slowdown by public employees, it is quite conceivable that a union may use such a tactic as a means of putting pressure on the public employer during contract negotiations. An interpretation of \u00a7 9A <em>(b) </em>which would allow the Commission to compel arbitration in such a case in ending the strike would appear to be inconsistent with the legislative judgment reflected in \u00a7 9 that arbitration, if employed, should be voluntary. As we said in another case involving the Commission, we are to read the statute \u201cso as to constitute a harmonious whole.\u201d <em>Dedham </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>365 Mass. 392,402 (1974), quoting from <em>Mathewson </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>335 Mass. 610, 614 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">3. The Union argues that <em>Boys Mkts. Inc. </em>v. <em>Local 770, Retail Clerks, </em>398 U.S. 235 (1970), a \u201cprivate sector\u201d case, teaches the proper relationship between injunctive relief to end a strike and an order to arbitrate. In <em>Boys Mkts. </em>the Court overruled its decision in <em>Sinclair Ref. Co. </em>v. <em>Atkinson, </em>370 U.S. 195 (1962), which held that the anti-injunctian provisions of the Norris-LaGuardia Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 104 (1970), forbade a Federal court to enjoin a strike in breach of a no-strike provision of a collective bargaining agreement. The <em>Boys Mkts. </em>Court noted that <em>Sinclair </em>impaired the policy favoring arbitration of grievances and bred disuniformity and friction between the Federal and State forums because injunctive relief might be available in State courts. The Court held that an injunction might go against a strike in violation of a collective bargaining agreement that provided for arbitration of the dispute, but only if the employer was ordered to arbitrate. 398 U.S. at 254. See generally Axelrod, The Application of the <em>Boys Markets </em>Decision in the Federal Courts, 16 B.C. Ind. &amp; Com. L. Rev. 893 (1975); Dawson, The Scope of the <em>Boys Markets </em>Rule, 28 Okla. L. Rev. 794 (1975). In arguing for a similar connection under \u00a7 9A <em>(b) </em>between a cease and desist order and an arbitration order, the Union is not only met with the conflicting interpretation of \u00a7 9A (6) developed above, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>but appears to overlook basic differences between labor relations in the private and public sectors. Whereas the strike has been a protected weapon of private-sector employees since the 1930\u2019s, public employees have not had similar artillery (see Annot., 37 A.L.R.3d 1147 [1971]) \u2014a distinction rationalized and justified on many grounds. See, e.g., Bernstein, Alternatives to the Strike in Public Labor Relations, 85 Harv. L. Rev. 459, 462, 464-466 (1971); Wellington &amp; Winter, Structuring Collective Bargaining in Public Employment, 79 Yale L.J. 805,807-808 (1970); Wellington &amp; Winter, The Limits of Collective Bargaining in Public Employment, 78 Yale L.J. 1107, 1123-1125 (1969). Thus, although in the private sector a union\u2019s contractual waiver of its statutory right to strike may be presumptively tied to the employer\u2019s acceptance of binding arbitration for resolution of contractual disputes (see <em>Boys Mkts., supra </em>at 247-248; <em>Textile Workers Union </em>v. <em>Lincoln Mills, </em>353 U.S. 448, 455 [1957]), no similar linkage exists in public sector cases.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Union\u2019s reliance on private sector precedent seems, therefore, to be misplaced, and the Commission does not join in the Union\u2019s contentions in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">Although holding that the Commission exceeded \u00a7 9A <em>(b) </em>in commanding arbitration, we note that arbitration could have come about on the demand of the Union under the grievance provision of the collective bargaining agreement at any time during the interval of unease over the alleged hiring freeze; such a demand is, indeed, specifically enforceable under G. L. c. 150C.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> It might also have come <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>about following due consideration by the Commission of the prohibited practice charge under \u00a7 \u00a7 10-11, for it appears to be open to the Commission in a proper case to retain jurisdiction of the charge but to defer action on it pending resort to arbitration. See <em>Cohasset School Comm,., </em>Mass. L.R.C. Case No. MUP-419, 3 CCH Lab. L. Rep., State Laws par. 49,999B.04 (June 19, 1973); cf. <em>Collyer Insulated Wire, </em>192 N.L.R.B. 837 (1971).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>Chapter 150E is a new and experimental statute.

No. 7751.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b182-12\"> Section 9 <em>(c) (6) of the </em>bill recommended by the Mendonca Commission provided: \u201c[i]f any employee organization or any employee is found to be violating or failing to comply with the requirements of this section ... the Commission shall institute appropriate proceedings in the Superior Court... to require the employee organization or employees to comply with the requirements of this section, and such court may issue such orders and decrees, by way of injunction or otherwise, as may be appropriate to enforce this section.\u201d The reference to \u201crequirements\u201d would seem to include not only requirements designed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>remove a danger to public health or safety, but also numerous other conditions set out in the section that must be met by employees before their strike would be lawful, such as the completion of a sixty-day period after the Commission had made public the findings and recommendations of a fact-finder. The entire section was directed at limiting and channeling employee action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b183-7\"> Several of the bills modeled on the Mendonca Commission proposal contained a section providing a special arbitration procedure for the resolution of an impasse in contract negotiations involving firefighters or police officers. The early drafts of the section, in setting out the relation of the procedure to the Commission\u2019s power to set requirements so as to remove a danger to public health and safety, clearly indicate the legislative understanding that those requirements were to be applied only to employees. For example, \u00a7 4 (a) of 1973 House Doc. No. 7715 provided that the special arbitration procedure would be invoked \u201c[i]f an employee organization duly recognized as representing the firefighters or police officers of a city, town or district has been prevented by the commission, pursuant to [the section authorizing the Commission to set requirements] or by a superior court, pursuant to [the section authorizing the court to enforce limitations on strike activity], from engaging in a lawful strike because of the danger to the public health and safety.\u201d See also 1973 Senate Doc. No. 1771, \u00a7 4 (o).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">We note that the legislation enacting c. 150E included a section, to be effective until June 30, 1977, that provides similar special arbitration procedures to end an impasse in negotiations involving firefighters and police officers. St. 1973, c. 1078, \u00a7\u00a7 4, 8. The evidently experimental nature of the section seems to reflect the Legislature\u2019s caution and hesitation in prescribing arbitration as the uniform method for the resolution of labor disputes.

Rev. 1192,1194 (1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b183-9\"> 1973 Senate Doc. No. 1929 and 1973 House Doc.

The question is not before us. It will be noted that the \u201crequirements\u201d of \u00a7 9A <em>(b) </em>are set after \u201cinvestigation,\u201d while the Commission is authorized by \u00a7 11 to impose such a punitive sanction only after more formal procedural safeguards.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b184-7\"> The possible consequences, if the Commission had pursued the prohibited practice charge, are mentioned in n.15 below.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b187-6\"> Long before the <em>Sinclair </em>and <em>Boys Mkts. </em>cases, the anti-injunction provisions of the Norris-LaGuardia Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 104 (1970), had been held inapplicable to strikes by government employees. See <em>United, States </em>v. <em>United Mine Workers, </em>330 U.S. 258, 276 (1947). Indeed Federal employee organizations are subject to a prohibition of strike activity that is similar to c. 150E, \u00a7 9A <em>(a). </em>See Exec. Order No. 11491, \u00a7 19(b)(4), 3 C.F.R. 254, 264 (1974). Our State statute that derives from the Norris-LaGuardia Act, G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 6 (see <em>Jones </em>v. Demoulas <em>Super Mkts.

See <em>Cohasset School Comm.., supra. </em>In <em>Cohasset, </em>it was indicated that deferral would be considered only \u201c[i]f, upon investigation, the charge on its merits appears to be substantiated,\u201d and would be denied \u201cif the party against whom the charge.of prohibitive practice is made, refuses to arbitrate, raises any question as to procedure or substantive arbitrability, or delays in terms of processing the case to arbitration.\u201d Mass. L.R.C. Case No. MUP-419 at 16, 3 CCH Lab. L. Rep., State Laws par. 49.999B.04, at 61,795. The NLRB approach has been to defer only if investigation indicates the charge is not frivolous and only if the respondent is willing to go to arbitration. See <em>Gary-Hobart Water Corp., </em>210 N.L.R.B. No. 87, at 742 (1974) (1974 CCH NLRB Dec. par. 26,516, at 34,345), enforced, 511 F.2d 284 (7th Cir.), cert, denied, 423 U.S. 925 (1975); Memorandum of Peter Nash, NLRB General Counsel, to Regional Directors, Arbitration Deferral Policy under <em>Collyer </em>\u2014 Revised Guidelines, 4 CCH Lab. L. Rep., Labor Relations par. 9031, at 15,032-15,033, 15,042 (May 10, 1973); Isaacson &amp; Zifchak, Agency Deferral to Private Arbitration of Employment Disputes, 73 Colum. L. Rev. 1383, 1406 (1973). The NLRB, however, will defer if the dispute is arguably arbitrable despite the respondent\u2019s intention to challenge the arbitrability of the underlying dispute in the arbitration forum. See <em>Urban N. Patman, Inc., </em>197 N.L.R.B. No. 150 (1972) (1972 CCH NLRB Dec. par. 24,368); Memorandum of Peter Nash, <em>supra </em>at 15,033,15,039-15,040.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">Here the Commission did not undertake an investigation of the prohibited practice charge and we can only speculate what might have happened if the charge was found to have merit. The Commission now states that it might relax the <em>Cohasset </em>guidelines and defer pursuant to an \u201carguably arbitrable\u201d standard like that of the NLRB, but it does not advert to the fact that the NLRB would evidently not defer where the party resists any arbitration concerning the underlying dispute.
