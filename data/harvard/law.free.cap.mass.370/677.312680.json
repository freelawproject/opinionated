The juvenile defendant in the present case has filed a motion to dismiss the indictments brought in the Superior Court charging him with murder and unarmed robbery, alleging that a trial on these indictments is contrary to <em>Breed. </em>He contends that the pending prosecution in the Superior Court is barred by the principle of double jeopardy because he has been put in former jeopardy as a result of the determination made in the Municipal Court of the Brighton District on April 1,1975, to dismiss the juvenile complaints and to try him as an adult. A Superior Court judge reported the case without decision to the Appeals Court under the provisions of G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 30A, and G. L. c. 211A, \u00a7 10. This court granted direct appellate review of the Superior Court report.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">We do not decide if the hearing which was held in the Municipal Court on April 1,1975, constituted an adjudicatory hearing, but rather we assume arguendo that it did. Therefore, we address only the question whether a trial on the indictments in the Superior Court would violate the Fifth Amendment ban on double jeopardy. We hold that the pending prosecution of the defendant is not barred by the principle of double jeopardy, for the court\u2019s holding in <em>Breed </em>is not applicable to juvenile proceedings which were conducted prior to the date of that decision on May 27,1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">We need not recount in detail the circumstances surrounding the defendant\u2019s hearing in the Municipal Court, for we will assume, without deciding, that this proceeding was a trial on the merits. Nevertheless, the facts as reported by the trial judge may be summarized briefly as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">About 9:10 a.m. on March 12, 1975, two young men <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>snatched a handbag from Helen Murphy. She fell to the sidewalk, where she was later found lying unconscious.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">Subsequently, a juvenile complaint was issued alleging that the defendant was a delinquent by reason of unarmed robbery of Helen Murphy. After counsel was appointed for the defendant, he was arraigned in the Municipal Court. On March 21, 1975, the victim having died, a second juvenile complaint was issued pursuant to G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 54, and G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 1, charging the defendant with delinquency by reason of murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">Following defense counsel\u2019s filing of motions for sequestration of witnesses and for suppression of evidence, a hearing was conducted on April 1, 1975, on the two juvenile complaints. Evidence on the motion to suppress was heard concurrently. At the time of this hearing, Rule 85A of the Rules of the District Courts entitled \u201cDismissal of Juvenile Complaint and Trial of Child as an Adult,\u201d was in effect, having been adopted effective May 7,1973.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">The assistant district attorney, on behalf of the Commonwealth, called several witnesses and introduced in evidence an allegedly incriminating statement by the defendant; a death certificate; testimony by police officers as to the investigation of the incident, the defendant\u2019s arrest and the recovery of evidence; and a stipulation containing anticipated testimony of a witness who had arrived at the scene immediately after the handbag snatching. The appointed counsel for the defendant cross-examined the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses and called one defense witness, a teacher of a bilingual class at the defendant\u2019s school. An <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>adult defendant, whose case was heard concurrently with that of the defendant, introduced the testimony of at least one witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">At the close of the evidence, the defendant\u2019s counsel made a closing statement requesting the court to rule favorably on his motion to suppress evidence and to find the defendant not delinquent. Thereafter, the presiding judge denied the motion and indicated that he was going to dismiss the juvenile complaints.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defense counsel took no further action, whereupon the judge dismissed the juvenile complaints and caused adult complaints to issue.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">Adult complaints were issued on April 1, 1975, charging the defendant with murder and unarmed robbery. The defendant was arraigned and, at the arraignment, he waived an adult probable cause hearing. He was thereupon bound over to the grand jury and indicted for the above offenses. Following a hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictments and before a trial on the merits, the Superior Court judge reported the case in view of the serious and substantial questions of law involved.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>In deciding whether the prosecution of the defendant in the Superior Court would constitute double jeopardy, we begin by noting that in <em>Stokes </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>368 Mass. 754 (1975), we concluded that <em>Breed </em>was not to be given retroactive effect. <em>Id. </em>at 764. Nevertheless, the defendant argues that <em>Stokes </em>is not dispositive, for in the instant case the criminal trial in the Superior Court has not yet taken place, whereas in <em>Stokes </em>all proceedings had been completed prior to <em>Breed. </em>The defendant argues that the question presented here is not whether to apply <em>Breed </em>retroactively, but, rather, whether to apply it prospectively to those defendants who have been subjected to an adjudicatory juvenile proceeding before <em>Breed, </em>but are still awaiting trial for the same offense in the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">While we may agree with the defendant\u2019s characterization of the problem as involving the prospectivity of <em>Breed, </em>we do not believe that this statement of the issue necessarily leads to the conclusion urged by the defendant. In determining the cutoff date for the application of a new constitutional doctrine, \u201cthere is a large measure of judicial discretion involved____\u201d <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Delaware, </em>395 U.S. 213, 218 (1969), quoting from <em>State </em>v. <em>Vigliano, </em>50 N.J. 51, 65-66 (1987). As noted by the Supreme Court in <em>Williams </em>v. <em>United States, </em>401 U.S. 646 (1971), \u201cthere is no inflexible constitutional rule requiring in all circumstances either absolute retroactivity or complete prospectivity for decisions construing the broad language of the Bill of Rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 651.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>Despite this latitude in deciding the time at which a new constitutional principle is to be controlling, the Supreme Court has in recent decisions begun to adopt a consistent approach whereby \u201cthe moment at which the discarded standards were first relied upon\u201d is regarded as determinative. <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Delaware, supra </em>at 218.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cThe point of reliance is critical, not because of any constitutional compulsion, but because it determines the impact that newly articulated constitutional principles will have upon convictions obtained pursuant to investigatory and prosecutorial practices not previously proscribed.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In addition, as sugested by the court, emphasizing the point of initial reliance as the operative event is \u201cconsistent with the fundamental justification for not applying newly enunciated constitutional principles retroactively,\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 218-219 n.7,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and therefore is consistent with our ra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>tionale in <em>Stokes </em>for not applying <em>Breed </em>retroactively.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">Examining the case before us in light of the above analysis, we conclude that reliance, as that term has been applied in recent Supreme Court cases, first occurred on April 1, 1975, when the Municipal Court judge conducted an adjudicatory juvenile hearing. It was at that moment that the situation became irreversible, for by subjecting the defendant to former jeopardy in the Municipal Court, any subsequent trial would necessarily constitute double jeopardy under the reasoning of <em>Breed. </em>Accordingly, it is logical to consider April 1, 1975, the date of the juvenile proceeding, as the date of the \u201cprohibited practice,\u201d and, therefore, the crucial point when determining the applicability of the newly formulated constitutional standards. See <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Delaware, supra </em>at 217.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">Once it is determined that the relevant moment of reliance occurred prior to the court\u2019s decision in <em>Breed </em>on May 27, 1975, it follows that <em>Breed </em>should not be applicable, since it was permissible under the then existing law to hold such an adjudicatory hearing.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Therefore, we hold that <em>Breed </em>applies only to a juvenile adjudicatory hearing commenced after May 27, 1975, and since the defendant\u2019s hearing occurred prior to that date, we decide that his pending prosecution in the Superior Court is not barred by the principle of double jeopardy. Accordingly the defendant\u2019s motion is to be denied, and the indictments are to stand for trial in the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b692-8\"> See <em>Stokes </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>368 Mass. 754 (1975).

See A <em>Juvenile </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, ante, </em>272, 275-277 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b694-7\"> In an affidavit offered and accepted in evidence at the hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictments, the presiding judge at the Municipal Court hearing stated: \u201cI was aware of the provisions of G. L. c. 119, sec. 52-61 inclusive and sec. 74, as well as the provisions of Rule 85A ... as it then read. I understood Rule 85A to require first a hearing on juvenile complaints ... prior to a hearing on the question as to whether a child would be tried as an adult, second, a separate hearing on whether the child would be tried as an adult; and third, if a determination were to be made that such child would be tried as an adult, that the case be set down for a probable cause hearing on the adult criminal complaint, if any. It was my practice to adhere to these requirements, and I know of no reason why I did not in the case of these two complaints....\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b694-8\"> The reason cited by the judge for dismissing the juvenile complaints was the \u201c[n] ature of the offense charged, such as its seriousness.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b694-9\"> In his report, the trial judge posed the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-10\">\u201c1.

In <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>384 U.S. 719 (1966), when abandoning the <em>Linkletter </em>approach and applying <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436 (1966), and <em>Escobedo </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>378 U.S. 478 (1964), to trials begun after the date these decisions were announced, the Court noted that \u201cthere are no jurisprudential or constitutional obstacles\u201d to the adoption of a rule establishing a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>different cutoff point. 384 U.S. at 733.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">For a summary of the early cases dealing with prospectivity, see <em>Desist </em>v. <em>United States, </em>394 U.S. 244, 270-271 n.2 (1969) (Fartas, J., dissenting).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b696-9\"> This trend of emphasizing the point at which law enforcement officials relied on practices not yet proscribed began with <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>New Jersey, supra </em>(see n.6). See <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Delaware, supra </em>at 218-219 n.7. Following <em>Johnson, </em>the Court focused on the point of initial reliance. <em>Ibid. </em>See, e.g., <em>Stovall </em>v. <em>Denno, </em>388 U.S. 293 (1967) <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Wade, </em>388 U.S. 218 [1967], and <em>Gilbert </em>v. <em>California, </em>388 U.S. 263 [1967], apply only to cases in which the illegal official conduct took place after the date of decision); <em>Desist </em>v. <em>United States, </em>394 U.S. 244 (1969) <em>(Katz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>389 U.S. 347 [1967], applies to cases where the illegal electronic surveillance occurred after Katz); <em>Jenkins v.
