L. c. 272, \u00a7 99.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant filed a petition for interlocutory relief (G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 28E) from the trial judge\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress these two recorded telephone calls. A single justice of this court allowed the defendant\u2019s petition and reserved and reported the case on a statement of agreed facts for a determination by the full court. We affirm the trial judge\u2019s denial of the motion to suppress and hold that the tape recordings do not constitute an \u201cinterception\u201d in violation of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">The facts pertinent to this interlocutory appeal are as follows. On November 29, 1972, Damaris Synge Gillispie failed to return to her Cambridge apartment. On December 6 and 7,1972, an unknown male called Miss Gillispie\u2019s residence on five separate occasions. During these five calls the caller provided information relating to Miss Gillispie\u2019s clothing, her friends, her family, and articles of clothing that she was wearing when she disappeared. He also asserted that \u201cI have her.\u201d Each of these calls was recorded by the victim\u2019s brother, who used a \u201ctape recording cas<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>sette device\u201d and attached the microphone to the earpiece of the telephone receiver with a suction cup.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">During the course of the first taped conversation the caller said, \u201cYou know, I know the phone is tapped, I\u2019m hep to that, but I\u2019m going to get in touch\u201d and then he continued to speak describing certain of the victim\u2019s possessions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> During the third call the caller said, \u201cI know the thing is being taped, but that\u2019s cool too\u201d and then proceeded to talk about the victim. No such statements were made during the second, fourth or fifth call.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">Subsequently, a member of the Cambridge police department took custody of the five recorded conversations. Thereafter, several individuals, who knew the defendant, identified the recorded voice of the caller as that of the defendant. On February 13, 1973, the defendant was indicted by the Middlesex County grand jury for the crimes of murder in the first degree and kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">After the defendant\u2019s indictment, the Commonwealth filed a motion for a voice exemplar of the defendant accompanied by an affidavit recounting the facts as outlined above. In response, the defendant moved to suppress the contents of the five taped conversations asserting that the communications were unlawfully intercepted in violation of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99, because he had no knowledge that his conversations were being intercepted nor did he ever authorize such interceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">The trial judge held that the tape recordings of the second, fourth and fifth telephone calls should be suppressed under G. L. c. 272, \u00a799 P, which provides for the suppression in a criminal trial of the contents of wire or oral communication that is unlawfully intercepted or not inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>cepted in accordance with the statute. His decision as to these calls is not before us on appeal. However, the judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the statements made during the first call after the caller said that he knew the telephone was tapped, and similarly, the statements made during the third call following the words, \u201cI know the thing is being taped.\u201d Limiting ourselves to a consideration of only the first and third calls, we affirm the decision of the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">As conceded by the Commonwealth, there can be no doubt in this case that the victim\u2019s brother used an \u201cintercepting device\u201d as defined in G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 B 3, and that he recorded the \u201ccontents\u201d of \u201cwire communications\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 B 1 and 5. Therefore, the sole question before us is whether there was an \u201cinterception\u201d as defined by c. 272, \u00a7 99 B 4, set forth below.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">While we recognize that G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99, is designed to control the use of electronic surveillance devices by private individuals because of the serious threat they pose to \u201cthe privacy of all citizens\u201d (\u00a799 A), it is clear that the Legislature intended that the statutory restrictions be applicable only to the secret use of such devices. (See \u00a7 99 A, and see \u00a7 99 B 4 which defines the term \u201cinterception\u201d to include \u201cto secretly hear [or to] secretly record.\u201d) Thus, if the two recordings in this case were not made secretly, they do not constitute an \u201cinterception\u201d as defined by \u00a7 99 B 4, nor should they be suppressed under \u00a7 99 P.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">It is the defendant\u2019s argument that a recording is made secretly unless both parties have actual knowledge of the recording. He argues that the defendant\u2019s statements during the first and third calls, as to the conversation being \u201ctapped\u201d or \u201ctaped,\u201d must be considered as nothing more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>than mere speculation, since the defendant could not have known of the recording because the victim\u2019s brother never divulged the \u201csecret\u201d by acknowledging that he was taping the calls. We reject the defendant\u2019s position, for we do not believe that such an overly restrictive construction is necessary under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">We agree, as argued by the defendant, that we would render meaningless the Legislature\u2019s carefiil choice of words if we were to interpret \u201csecretly\u201d as encompassing only those situations where an individual has a reasonable expectation of privacy. If the Legislature had intended to establish such a standard, the statute would have been written in terms similar to those used in the California eavesdropping statute, see generally <em>In re Joseph </em>A, 30 Cal. App. 3d 880 (1973), which applies to communications \u201ccarried on in such circumstances as may reasonably indicate that any party to such communication desires it to be confined to such parties____\u201d Cal. Penal Code \u00a7 632 (Deering 1971) ,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Rather, it is apparent from the Report of the Special Commission on Electronic Eavesdropping, 1968 Senate Doc. No. 1132, that the legislative intent was to impose more stringent restrictions on the use of electronic surveillance devices by private individuals than is done in other States.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>Despite this conclusion, we do not accept the defendant\u2019s position that the statute requires that the caller be informed that his conversation is being recorded if no \u201cinterception\u201d is to be found. No such provision, express or implied, exists in the statute. Nevertheless, we accept, as urged by the defendant, the proposition that the caller needs to have actual knowledge of the recording, but we believe that actual knowledge is proved where there are clear and unequivocal objective manifestations of knowledge, for such indicia are sufficiently probative of a person\u2019s state of mind as to allow an inference of knowledge and to make unnecessary any further requirement that the person recording the conversation confirm the caller\u2019s apparent awareness by acknowledging the fact of the intercepting device.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">In the present case we may imply knowledge from the defendant\u2019s conduct, since he made statements to the kidnap victim\u2019s brother which evidenced a clear recognition that the calls were being taped, but, nonetheless, he continued to speak in apparent indifference to the consequences. In this instance of clear and unequivocal conduct indicating knowledge, the recordings were not made \u201csecretly\u201d and therefore do not constitute an \u201cinterception\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 99 B 4. We need not reach the question whether there was \u201cprior authority,\u201d for such a consideration arises only if there is a finding that the conversations were recorded secretly.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">The interpretation of \u201cinterception\u201d which we herein adopt is both consistent with the statutory language and the legislative policy of protecting the privacy of our citizens. Furthermore, it is a sensible approach to look to the caller\u2019s words and conduct to determine if a conversation is being intercepted unbeknown to him, for by relying on objective factors we avoid the problems involved in speculating as to the caller\u2019s subjective state of mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">In light of our conclusion that portions of the first and third telephone calls were not \u201cinterceptions\u201d under \u00a7 99 B 4 because the recordings were not made secretly, we up<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>hold the trial judge\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">\n<em>Order affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b517-7\"> Although the provisions of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99, are lengthy and oftentimes complex, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vitello, </em>367 Mass. 224 (1975), those portions relevant to this appeal may be summarized as follows. Under \u00a7 99 P, a defendant in a criminal trial may move to suppress the contents of any intercepted wire or oral communication or evidence derived therefrom if the communication was obtained by means of an unlawful interception. Under \u00a7 99 B 4, see note 4 <em>infra, </em>an \u201cinterception\u201d is committed, subject to limited exceptions dealing with an \u201cinvestigative or law enforcement officer,\u201d if a person <em>secretly </em>records the contents of the communication through the use of any intercepting device and he does so without the <em>prior authority </em>of all the parties to the communication. An interception, as so defined, is unlawful unless it comes within one of the exemptions set forth in \u00a7 99 D, such as the exemption for those authorized persons who are acting pursuant to a warrant issued in accordance with the statute (\u00a7 99 D 1 d). In the case before us, since none of the exceptions to \u00a7 99 B 4 or the \u00a7 99 D exemptions are applicable, we must determine if there was an \u201cinterception\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 99 B 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b518-9\"> The victim\u2019s brother, who is not a member of any law enforcement agency, apparently informed a Cambridge police officer on December 2, 1972, that he had placed a recording device on the telephone in the Gillispie apartment in order to record incoming calls.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b518-10\"> At the close of the first conversation the caller said, \u201cCall the police off, call them off, because you\u2019re making me nervous and I\u2019m going to have to do something.... I\u2019ll get in touch, but get the cops off the line there.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b519-8\"> Subsection. B 4 of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99, as appearing in St. 1968, c. 738, \u00a7 1, provides in relevant part: \u201cThe term \u2018interception\u2019 means to secretly hear, secretly record, or aid another to secretly hear or secretly record the contents of any wire or oral communication through the use of any intercepting device by any person other than a person given prior authority by all parties to such communication....\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b520-8\"> See also Cal. Penal Code \u00a7 633.5 (Deering 1971), which provides that \u201c[n]othing in Section ... 632 shall be construed as prohibiting one party to a confidential communication from recording such communication for the purpose of obtaining evidence reasonably believed to relate to the commission by another party to such communication of the crime of extortion, kidnapping, bribery, [or] any felony involving violence against the person____\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b520-13\"> In this regard we note that the commission, 1968 Sen. Doc. No. 1132, rejected the prevalent approach of permitting wiretapping and eavesdropping in cases of one-party consent. See, e.g., N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7250.00 (McKinney 1967). See also Greenawalt, The Consent Problem in Wiretapping &amp; Eavesdropping: Surreptitious Monitoring with the Consent of a Participant in a Conversation, 68 Colum. L. Rev. 189 (1968). One-party consent had been the operative standard in this Commonwealth prior to the 1968 amendment of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99. See G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99, as appearing in St. 1959, c. 449, \u00a7 1 (\u201cWhoever... secretly or without the consent of either a sender or receiver... .\u201d)\u2022</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
