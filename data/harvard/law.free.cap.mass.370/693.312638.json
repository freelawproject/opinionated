The mayor and the city appeal from a judgment of the Superior Court declaring, subject to certain exceptions, that such a limitation, restriction or regulation is valid. We granted the applications of all parties for direct appellate review, and we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">We summarize the statement of agreed facts. The commission was established by St. 1908, c. 562, and St. 1909, c. 486. Section 2 of the 1908 statute grants to the commission the power to require the testimony of witnesses and provides: \u201cEach of such witnesses may be represented by counsel who may cross-examine the witness for whom he appears for not more than ten minutes during his exam-ination____The commission may prescribe reasonable rules and regulations for the conduct of hearings and the giving of testimony.\u201d Section 21 of the 1909 statute carries forward \u201call the powers and duties\u201d conferred by the 1908 statute, \u201cbut counsel for any witness at any public hearing may ask him any pertinent question and may offer pertinent evidence through other witnesses subject to cross-examination by the commission and its counsel.\u201d Before October 14, 1975, the commission\u2019s \u201cRules of Procedure Governing the Conduct of Hearings and the Giving of Testimony\u201d granted each witness the right to be accompanied, represented and advised \u201cby counsel of his own choice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">On March 13, 1975, the commission voted to investigate the mayor\u2019s political fund raising; the principal areas of inquiry were to be coercion or other improper influence with respect to city employees, contractors with the city or county, and applicants for or recipients of tax abate-ments. Thereafter three city employees represented by private counsel testified under oath in closed hearings, twenty made unsworn statements without counsel, and one was represented by an assistant corporation counsel, about whose presence the hearing officer complained.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>On August 29, 1975, the commission requested nine more city employees to testify under oath in closed hearings on September 3. On September 2, the mayor met with six of the nine and told them he would provide counsel to represent them before the commission individually if they wanted such counsel. On September 3 one of the witnesses appeared at the scheduled hearing accompanied by an attorney selected and provided by the mayor himself. The attorney stated that he would be representing witnesses in this group of city employees, and because of his presence the presiding officer adjourned the hearing. A similar incident occurred on or about September 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">On October 14, 1975, pursuant to its power to prescribe rules and regulations, the commission voted on the recommendation of the chairman, to \u201cexclude from closed hearings to be conducted pursuant to the current investigation into the Mayor\u2019s fundraising activities attorneys who are selected by the Mayor or by his agents within his administration or an attorney who is regularly employed by the City of Boston.\u201d The reasons given for the chairman\u2019s recommendation were: (1) the presence of an assistant corporation counsel \u201copens up\u201d a closed hearing, since he has a duty to report back to the corporation counsel who in turn has a duty to report to the mayor. (2) The \u201coffer\u201d of counsel by the mayor would be construed by city employees as one they must accept. (3) The presence of counsel responsible to or selected by the mayor would have a chilling effect on the testimony of the witness he represented.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">The commission commenced this civil action for a declaratory judgment on October 15,1975. On November 13, 1975, a judge of the Superior Court filed a comprehensive and thoughtful memorandum of decision and a judgment declaring that the commission\u2019s vote of October 14, 1975, with certain modifications, is a valid exercise of its power to adopt reasonable rules and regulations for the conduct of its hearings. The modifications are that the limitation, restriction or regulation shall not apply if the witness and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>the attorney stand in a \u201cspecial relationship,\u201d and that there is a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d \u201c (1) when the witness and the attorney are related by blood or marriage, (2) when there presently exists or has existed between them a lawyer-client relationship, (3) when the attorney has been closely associated with the witness in the activities about which the witness is to be questioned, or (4) when other special circumstances are found by the Fin Com sufficient to warrant the appearance by the attorney for the witness.\u201d A prospective witness is to have a reasonable opportunity to persuade the commission that there is a \u201cspecial relationship.\u201d Nothing in the judgment is to prevent the city from reimbursing a witness for his attorney\u2019s fees or from paying the fees directly. The judgment also enjoins the mayor, his agents, corporation counsel, and other representatives within his administration from selecting, designating or providing counsel for witnesses in closed hearings of the commission relating to the mayor\u2019s political fund raising from city employees, except in cases of \u201cspecial relationship.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">1. <em>Actual controversy. </em>The judge found that there was an actual controversy between the parties, as required by G. L. c. 231A, \u00a7 1. We are informed that the commission subsequently completed the particular investigation and made its report to the mayor. The injunctive provisions of the judgment are therefore now moot, but the parties do not assert that the case is moot. The declaratory provisions of the judgment apply to subsequent investigations as well, and there is no question that the controversy continues.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">2. <em>The constitutional setting. </em>As the judge said, this case does not turn on a constitutional question. The function of the commission, like that of the Commission on Civil Rights involved in <em>Hannah </em>v. <em>Larche, </em>363 U.S. 420, 441 (1960), \u201cis purely investigative and fact-finding. It does not adjudicate. It does not hold trials or determine anyone\u2019s civil or criminal liability. It does not issue orders. Nor does it indict, punish, or impose any legal sanctions. It does not make determinations depriving anyone of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>life, liberty, or property. In short, the Commission does not and cannot take any affirmative action which will affect an individual\u2019s legal rights. The only purpose of its existence is to find facts which may subsequently be used as the basis for legislative or executive action.\u201d Hence \u201cit is not necessary that the full panoply of judicial procedures be used.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 442. Witnesses \u201cappearing before investigating agencies, whether legislative, executive, or judicial, have generally not been accorded the rights of apprisal, confrontation, or cross-examination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 449. A witness in a purely investigative proceeding has no constitutional right to the assistance of counsel while being interrogated. <em>Anonymous Nos. 6 and </em>7 v. <em>Baker, </em>360 U.S. 287, 295 (1959). <em>In re Groban, </em>352 U.S. 330, 333 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">3. <em>The statutory right to counsel. </em>The very same 1908 statute that granted a right to counsel to witnesses before the commission also authorized \u201creasonable rules and regulations\u201d for the conduct of hearings and the giving of testimony. We agree with the opinion of the Attorney General, given in 1915, that the 1908 and 1909 statutes \u201ccreate a right in the witness to be represented by counsel, and it is obvious that the commission has no power to withdraw this right.\u201d 4 Op. Att\u2019y Gen. 451, 456 (1915). The right is that of the witness, not of the mayor of the city. No witness is a party to the present case, and no right of a witness can be foreclosed by the judgment under review.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">As between the parties to this case, however, we do not agree with the Attorney General\u2019s opinion that, if a witness requests as counsel a member of the legal department of the city and the member appears as counsel for the witness, \u201cthe commission has no power to exclude such counsel from being present while the witness is testifying.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The question is whether the limitation imposed by the commission is \u201creasonable\u201d in striking a balance between the interest of the commission in conducting an effective investigation and the interests of potential witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">Authority in other jurisdictions is sparse and conflicting. Some trial court decisions under the Administrative Pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>cedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 555(b) (1970), have upheld disqualification of counsel for a person under investigation from also representing a witness. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Steel, </em>238 F. Supp. 575, 577 (S.D.N.Y. 1965). <em>Torras </em>v. <em>Stradley, </em>103 F. Supp. 737, 738 (N.D. Ga. 1952). <em>United States </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>87 F. Supp. 293, 294 (D. Conn. 1949). But appellate decisions have construed the right to counsel granted by that Act to mean \u201ccounsel of one\u2019s choice.\u201d <em>Securities &amp; Exch. Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Higashi, </em>359 F.2d 550, 553 (9th Cir. 1966). <em>Backer </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>275 F.2d 141, 144 (5th Cir. 1960). In <em>Pirillo </em>v. <em>Takiff, </em>462 Pa. 511, 531 (1975), on rehearing, 466 Pa. 187 (1976), appeal dismissed and cert. denied, 423 U.S. 1083 (1976), the court approved an order that no two grand jury witnesses be represented by the same counsel, but a similar order was vacated in <em>In re Investigation Before the April 1975 Grand Jury, </em>531 F.2d 600, 608 (D.C. Cir. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">We adopt the primary reason given by the judge for upholding the commission\u2019s rule: \u201cCommon sense indicates that such presence and participation [by attorneys selected by the person investigated] might well inhibit and hinder the effectiveness of the hearings and the investigation as a whole. At least the possibility is sufficient to validate the rule.\u201d We are less confident that he was correct in saying that the only advantage to the witnesses is the benefit of counsel free of charge; jointly retained counsel may also facilitate a joint defense. See <em>Matter of Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum Dated November 16, 1974, </em>406 F. Supp. 381, 386-389 (S.D.N.Y. 1975). Nor do we rely on any beneficent desire of the commission to protect the witnesses, against their desires, from supposed injury flowing from counsel\u2019s alleged conflicts of interest. See <em>Pirillo </em>v. <em>Takiff, supra, </em>462 Pa. at 528. We do not think the commission has any power to prevent witnesses before it from disclosing their testimony to anyone they choose. See <em>In re Investigation Before the April 1975 Grand Jury, supra, </em>531 F.2d at 606-607 n.ll. But it is still \u201creasonable\u201d for the commission to take what steps it can to maintain the confidentiality of testimony taken in its closed hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>4. <em>\u201cSpecial </em>relationships.\u201d The commission did not appeal from the judgment and does not complain of the judge\u2019s modifications of its limitations. We therefore do not review his power to make such modifications. The mayor and the city however, contend that the modifications \u201caggravate the wrong to employees by creating a classification of employees exempt from the exclusionary rule based on improper standards.\u201d In substance, they claim a denial of equal protection of the laws, citing <em>Ar-rington </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Authority, </em>306 F. Supp. 1355, 1358 (D. Mass. 1969). We do not think this claim is one that the mayor or the city, as distinguished from the witnesses, can assert. Cf. <em>Boston Licensing Bd. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Common, </em>367 Mass. 788, 794 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
