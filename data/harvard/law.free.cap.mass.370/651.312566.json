L. c. 231A) in the Supreme Judicial Court for the county of Suffolk asking the court to determine whether probation officers are \u201cpublic employees\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> within the meaning of the recently enacted public employee collective bargaining statute (G. L. c. 150E, inserted by St. 1973, c. 1078, \u00a7 2). Further, if it is found that probation officers are covered under c. 150E, thereby entitling them to collective bargaining rights, the plaintiff seeks a determination as to who is the \u201cpublic employer\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of these employees for purposes of collective bargaining. The case was reserved and reported to the full court on a statement of agreed facts by a single justice on March 29,1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">We conclude as a matter of statutory interpretation that probation officers do not come within the definition of \u201cpublic employees\u201d as set forth in c. 150E, \u00a7 1, and, therefore, we do not reach the question of who is the \u201cpublic employer\u201d of probation officers. Also, in light of our conclusion, we need not address the constitutional argument raised by the defendants, the Committee on Probation and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>the Commissioner of Probation, that the application of c. 150E to probation officers would constitute a violation of the separation of powers doctrine embodied in art. 30 of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">The relevant facts as appearing in the record may be summarized as follows. On October 25, 1968, United City Employees Local 285 of the Service Employees International Union filed a certification petition with the Labor Relations Commission (the Commission) pursuant to the municipal employee collective bargaining law, G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 178G-178N (since repealed by St. 1973, c. 1078, \u00a7 1), seeking designation as the exclusive bargaining agent of \u201c[a]ll Suffolk County Probation Officers.\u201d On January 16, 1969, the plaintiff filed a similar petition seeking certification as the representative of \u201call probation officers employed by the District Courts and Superior Courts in the Counties of the Commonwealth.\u201d After formal hearings were held, the Commission dismissed both petitions on the basis that the then controlling municipal employee collective bargaining law, G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 178G-178N, did not apply to probation officers, because they were State and not county employees. Nevertheless, Local 285 and the plaintiff were offered the opportunity to amend their certification petitions and to proceed under the then existing State employee collective bargaining law (G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 178F, since repealed by St. 1973, c. 1078, \u00a7 1, effective July 1,1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">At a supplemental hearing on the amended petitions in October, 1970, the parties, including the plaintiff, Local 285, the Commissioner of Probation, and the Committee on Probation, stipulated that, for the limited purposes of the pending case only, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts was the employer of probation officers. The Commission, in a supplemental decision, directed that an election be held whereby \u201cProbation Officers in the employ of the Judicial Department of the Commonwealth\u201d would be entitled to elect an employee representative for collective bargaining purposes under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 178F. Judicial re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>view of the Commission\u2019s decision was not pursued by either the Commissioner of Probation or the Committee on Probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">The plaintiff, having been elected by secret ballot, was certified on January 15, 1971, as the exclusive collective bargaining agent for the probation officers. Following approximately two months of negotiations during the summer of 1973 between the plaintiff and the Commissioner of Probation,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>a contract was submitted to the Committee on Probation<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> for its approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">On February 6, 1974, the Chief Justice of the Superior Court, in his capacity as chairman of the Committee on Probation, informed the plaintiff that the Committee did not consider itself the employer of probation officers, notwithstanding the contrary decision of the Commission, and, therefore, it would not continue to bargain with the plaintiff. In response, the plaintiff filed a petition for declaratory judgment. See note 2 <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">On July 1, 1974, the State employee collective bargaining act, G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 178F,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> was repealed and superseded by G. L. c. 150E, which gave public employees of the Commonwealth, as defined in c. 150E, \u00a7 1, the right to bargain collectively over wages, hours, standards of productivity and performance, and other terms and conditions of employment. See G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 6. See also Sherry, 1974 Ann. Survey Mass. Law \u00a7 2.12.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Commission, by virtue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>of the authority vested in it by G. L. c. 23, \u00a7 9R, as most recently amended by St. 1973, c. 1078, \u00a7 2A, and pursuant to its mandate under c. 150E, \u00a7 3, to prescribe rules and regulations and to establish procedures for the determination of appropriate bargaining units, suggested standards for ten Statewide bargaining units for Commonwealth employees. Although the plaintiff was notified of the hearings relating to the Commission\u2019s proposed amendment to its rules and regulations, it did not attend. On March 3,1975, the Commission issued its rule establishing a ten-unit bargaining structure for State employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">On March 25,1975, a petition was filed by the Alliance, AFSCME-SEIU, AFL-CIO (the Alliance) seeking certification as the exclusive representative of unit 8 employees (social and rehabilitative employees) for purposes of collective bargaining. Thereafter, unit determination proceedings were held, but the plaintiff, despite notification, did not participate. The Commission, on October 6, 1975, issued a decision directing that a representation election be conducted for unit 8 employees. Furthemore, the Commission, in view of the pending litigation concerning the status of probation officers, adopted the stipulation agreed to by the Alliance and the Director of the Division of Employee Relations, the designee of the Commissioner of Administration, which provided that, to the extent that probation officers were employees within the meaning of c. 150E, they were to be included in unit 8. Probation officers were permitted to vote in the unit 8 election, subject to the challenge of any of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">A representation election was conducted in the fall of 1975, and the verification and tabulation of ballots commenced on November 17, 1975. The probation officers\u2019 votes were not tabulated because of a challenge by the Commissioner of Administration, and, in addition, all probation officers were instructed by counsel to attach a statement to their ballots indicating that their vote was cast <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>subject to the petition for declaratory relief that is now before us. The only union making a proper showing of interest and appearing on the unit 8 ballot was the Alliance. Thus, on February 4, 1976, the Commission certified the Alliance<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> as the exclusive representative of all unit 8 employees for the purposes of collective bargaining under c. 150E.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">The question before us, whether c. 150E is applicable to probation officers, is one of first impression. We had no occasion to consider this issue under the prior State employee collective bargaining law, G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 178F, nor have we examined the definitional section (\u00a71) of c. 150E in our previous decisions (see note 8 supra). There is little agreement among the parties as to the applicability of c. 150E to probation officers and the identity of the employer for purposes of collective bargaining if they are covered. The plaintiff contends that probation officers are entitled to collective bargaining rights under the statute and that the Committee on Probation is the only logical employer because of the degree of control exercised by the Committee over the hiring, firing, and standards of performance of probation officers. Of the five named defendants, see note 1 <em>supra, </em>the Commissioner of Administration, the Committee on Probation and the Commissioner of Probation argue that c. 150E was not intended to cover probation officers.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Commission and the Alliance adhere to the view that probation officers are employees within the meaning of the statute and that the Commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>sioner of Administration is the sole employer under c. 150E, \u00a7 1, of State public employees, including probation officers. We believe that this divergence of opinion among the parties may reflect the somewhat ambiguous wording of the statute and the rather scant legislative history. Nevertheless, we are of the opinion that, despite this lack of clear guidance, a sensible reading of the whole statute in light of the history of public employee collective bargaining in this Commonwealth compels the conclusion that probation officers are not entitled to collective bargaining rights under c. 150E.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">In deciding the present case, we acknowledge, as all the parties apparently concede, that probation officers are employees of the judicial branch of government. The Committee on Probation, see note 6 <em>supra, </em>consists of members of the judiciary. This Committee appoints the Commissioner of Probation, who has responsibility, in conjunction with the Committee, for establishing standards for probation work and for promulgating rules concerning supervision, casework, record keeping, accounting and caseload. G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 \u00a7 99, 99A. The Committee, in consultation with the Commissioner, sets standards for the appointment of probation officers, G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 99A, and the Commissioner is empowered to qualify or disqualify an applicant for the position of probation officer. G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 99. Probation officers are appointed to their positions by the justices of the courts in which they serve, and they may be removed, discharged or demoted for cause by the justices of the court making the appointment, subject to the written approval of the Committee on Probation. G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 83. The compensation schedule of probation officers of all courts is established by the Legislature, G. L. c. 276, \u00a7\u00a7 83, 99B, but, as we have noted in the past, their duties are closely connected with the judicial work of the court. See <em>LaChapelle </em>v. <em>United Shoe Mach. Corp., </em>318 Mass. 166, 170 (1945); <em>Catheron </em>v. <em>County of Suffolk, </em>227 Mass. 598, 602 (1917). In practice, as well as by statute, both day-to-day and ultimate control over probation officers is vested in the judiciary, including the justices of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>the courts where the probation officers serve (see c. 276, \u00a7\u00a785 and 85A), the Committee on Probation, and its appointee, the Commissioner of Probation (see c. 276, \u00a7\u00a7 98, 99, 99A).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">Accordingly, we recognize that the instant case of necessity presents the question whether judicial employees are \u201cpublic employees\u201d as defined in c. 150E.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We turn now to a consideration of this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">In determining if judicial employees come within the scope of c. 150E, we begin by looking at the definition of \u201cpublic employee\u201d set forth in c. 150E, \u00a7 1, see note 3 <em>supra. </em>Judicial employees, including probation officers, are neither expressly excluded nor included as in other jurisdictions.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> However, \u201cpublic employee\u201d is not defined in c. 150E, \u00a7 1, to include all public employees in the Commonwealth, but rather only those employees who are employed by a \u201cpublic employer.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Therefore, we must also consider the c. 150E, \u00a7 1, definition of \u201cpublic employer\u201d (see note 4 supra).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>Chapter 150E, \u00a7 1, defines \u201cpublic employer\u201d as \u201cthe commonwealth acting through the commissioner of administration [or his designee],\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and thereby relieves us of the task, encountered in other jurisdictions,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> of determining who is the employer. In addition, contrary to the plaintiff\u2019s suggestion, it appears that the \u201cpublic employer,\u201d as so defined in c. 150E, \u00a7 1, is the sole State employer representing management at the bargaining table.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Natick, </em>369 Mass. 431 (1976). Therefore, probation officers, being employees of the judicial branch of State government, must be employed by the \u201ccommonwealth acting through the commissioner of administration\u201d if they are to be covered by c. 150E.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">We agree with the Commissioner of Administration\u2019s observation that there are two possible interpretations of the above definition of \u201cpublic employer.\u201d The first is that the Legislature may have intended to authorize the Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>missioner of Administration to bargain with all employees of the Commonwealth, including legislative, executive, and judicial employees. Alternatively, because the Commissioner of Administration is an officer within the executive branch of government (see G. L. c. 7, \u00a7 4), the Legislature may have intended c. 150E to cover only executive employees. It is this second construction of c. 150E that we adopt for the reasons outlined below.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">In reaching this conclusion, we note that the Executive Office for Administration and Finance is an executive department of the government of the Commonwealth and it serves directly under the Governor (see G. L. c. 7, \u00a7 2). Its responsibilities are defined in G. L. c. 7, \u00a7 3, set forth below.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Furthermore, the Commissioner of Administration, who serves at the pleasure of the Governor, acts as the executive officer of the Governor in matters \u201cpertaining to the financial, administrative, planning and policy co-ordi-noting functions and affairs of the departments, commissions, offices, boards, divisions, institutions and other agencies within the executive department of the government of the commonwealth.\u201d G. L. c. 7, \u00a7 4. Because the statutory authority vested in the Executive Office for Administration and Finance and its Commissioner extends primarily, if not exclusively, to the executive branch of government, it would be anomalous to interpret c. 150E, \u00a7 1, as covering State employees not employed in the executive branch of government.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>We also find it instructive to examine the prior State employee collective bargaining statute, G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 178F, which was repealed by St. 1973, c. 1078, \u00a7 1, and superseded by c. 150E. General Laws c. 149, \u00a7 178F (1), as appearing in St. 1967, c. 774, defined \u201cemployee\u201d as \u201cany employee of the commonwealth assigned to work in any department, board, commission or other agency thereof ...\u201d and \u201cemployer\u201d as \u201cthe commonwealth, acting through a department or agency head as agent____\u201d Although it is not necessary to our holding in the present case to determine the exact scope of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 178F, we observe that the words \u201cemployer\u201d and \u201cemployee\u201d were defined in terms that closely resemble those used by the Legislature in the above cited statutes (G. L. c. 7, \u00a7 \u00a7 3, 4 \u2014 \u201cdepartments, commissions, offices, boards, divisions, institutions and other agencies\u201d) when referring to entities within the executive branch of government. Cf. <em>Yont </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>275 Mass. 365, 367-368 (1931) (interpreting \u201cdepartments\u201d to mean only those in the executive branch of government and not \u201cthe three grand departments of government\u201d). In view of the similar phraseology in the statutes (G. L. c. 7, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 4, and G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 178F [1]) and the unlikelihood that the word \u201cdepartment,\u201d as used in G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 178F (1), would mean the various executive departments (such as the Department of Public Works) and also include the three branches of government (executive, judicial and legislative) , we believe that it is reasonable to consider that the prior State employee collective bargaining statute, G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 178F, applied only to executive employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">Although G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 178F, was repealed by St. 1973, c. 1078, \u00a7 1, there is no indication that the Legislature intended, when enacting c. 150E, to broaden the coverage of the public employee collective bargaining statute.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>Rather, the legislative history reveals that the definition of \u201cpublic employer\u201d was revised in an attempt to strengthen the hand of management at the bargaining table, see 1971 House Doc. No. 5235, and to provide centralized leadership and direction for collective bargaining at the State level.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Cf. Labor Relations Commission: Notice of Determination of State Employee Bargaining Units, 1 M.L.C. 1318, 1325 (March 3, 1975). Since the scope of bargaining for State employees was altered under the new law to include wages, hours, and standards of productivity and performance, as well as conditions of employment (compare G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 6, with G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 178F [6]), it was reasonable, in light of the Commissioner of Administration\u2019s role in fiscal matters, for the Legislature to designate \u201cthe commonwealth acting through the commissioner of administration\u201d as the single public employer. Therefore, the statutory change made in the definition of \u201cpublic employer\u201d reflects, not an intent to broaden the coverage of the act to include nonexecutive State employees, but, rather, an effort to promote a rational format for collective bargaining. Cf. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Natick, </em>369 Mass. 431 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">Not only do we find support for our conclusion that judicial employees are not entitled to collective bargaining rights under c. 150E on the basis of our analysis of the definitions set forth in that statute and our examination of the legislative history relating to State public employee collective bargaining, but we also note that a reading of c. 150E in its entirety demonstrates that judicial employees, including probation officers, are not \u201cpublic employees\u201d within the meaning of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">Interpreting c. 150E \u201cso as to constitute a harmonious whole,\u201d <em>Director of the Div. of Employee Relations of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number><em>the Dep\u2019t of Administration &amp; Fin. </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, ante, </em>162, 172 (1976), we discover that \u00a7 7 of c. 150E enumerates those statutes which are to be overridden by a collective bargaining agreement in the case of conflict. Cf. <em>Chief of Police of Westford </em>v. <em>Westford, </em>365 Mass. 526, 528 n.l (1974). We believe that \u00a7 7, when read in conjunction with the definitional section (\u00a7 1), indicates that probation officers, if not all judicial employees, are excluded under c. 150E, for those statutes (see G. L. c. 276, \u00a7\u00a7 83-99C) which govern the salaries and terms and conditions of employment of probation officers are not listed in c. 150E, \u00a7 7 (a) - (j). Furthermore, the statutes relating to State employees which are specified in \u00a7 7 apply only to employees clearly within the executive branch.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">In sum, we conclude that probation officers, as employees of the judiciary, are not \u201cpublic employees\u201d within the meaning of c. 150E. Having examined c. 150E in its entirety and in the context of the evolving history of public sector collective bargaining in the Commonwealth, we believe that the definitions of \u201cpublic employee\u201d and \u201cpublic employer,\u201d as used in c. 150E, \u00a7 1, convey a legislative intent to exclude nonexecutive employees from coverage under the act.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In light of our statutory analysis, we express no opinion as to any constitutional issue.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>The case is remanded to the county court for entry of a judgment in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b666-6\"> The plaintiff, in its original petition for declaratory relief, filed on April 1, 1974, raised the question whether probation officers were entitled to collective bargaining rights under the then existing law covering State employees, G.
