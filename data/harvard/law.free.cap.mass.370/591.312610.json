L. c. 278, \u00a7 \u00a7 33A-33G, from convictions of murder in the first degree, burglary while armed, and armed robbery. We hold that the prosecutor, both in his cross-examination of the defendant and in his summation to the jury, repeatedly and deliberately went beyond permissible limits, and that the cautionary instructions of the judge were insufficient to cure the resulting prejudice to the defendant. We therefore reverse the judgments and remand the case for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-14\">There is substantially no dispute as to the following facts. On Friday, February 22, 1974, the defendant, a young man of twenty, went to a party to which the host had not invited him. He drank tequila and beer and was in several fights. About 2 a.m. on February 23, he was ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>served walking on the street in the direction of the victim\u2019s home, some 1,000 feet away. The victim, a woman of twenty-nine, was alone in her home that night. Between 2 a.m. and 6 a.m. she was stabbed forty-eight times and killed in circumstances which warranted a finding of extreme atrocity or cruelty. The defendant\u2019s fingerprints were on two partially empty beer bottles found in the house. About 6:30 a.m. the defendant called a taxicab from the victim\u2019s home, carried loot from the house to the taxicab in two trips, and took the loot to his home. About 11:30 a.m. the police arrested the defendant in a car driven by one Davis; Davis\u2019s girl friend was also in the car, as was the loot from the victim\u2019s house, and the defendant was wearing two rings taken from that house.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Davis and his girl friend gave additional testimony. According to Davis the defendant telephoned him Friday evening and asked Davis to get him a gun, a knife and a car. Davis refused. Saturday morning the defendant again called Davis, said \u201che had some stuff he wanted to sell\u201d and \u201cI will give you a couple hundred dollars if you give me a ride.\u201d Later that morning Davis and his girl friend met the defendant in front of his home. Davis helped the defendant load the loot into the girl friend\u2019s sister\u2019s car, and they drove to various places where the defendant thought he might sell the loot. During the ride Davis asked the defendant about his black eye, and the defendant said \u201che wanted to ball this girl and she didn\u2019t like to ball so she slapped him in the eye and he slapped her back.\u201d In the girl friend\u2019s version the defendant said \u201che had tried to ball a chick the night before and she put up some kind of fight and slapped him, and he pointed to his eye and he said, \u2018Gave me this,\u2019 and he said, \u2018So I slapped her back and left her dead, lying dead on the floor.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">The defendant testified that in addition to tequila and beer he took ten \u201ctruckers\u201d (amphetamine pills) the night of the party, that he called Davis from the party to get a ride home, and that Davis picked him up in a car. He was then cut, bruised, beaten and nauseated. Davis said it was a wealthy neighborhood and some time later stopped at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>the victim\u2019s house. Davis said it looked like a nice house. The defendant said he didn\u2019t feel good, he just wanted to go home, he was sick and he hurt and he was going to vomit. He saw Davis ring the doorbell and then go around the side of the house, and then he passed out. Later he woke up and went into the house. Davis was putting things in bags, and the defendant had a beer and went upstairs and helped Davis sort jewelry. The defendant saw the victim\u2019s body and started screaming, and attempted to take her pulse. Davis left. When the defendant got home by taxicab about 6 a.m., Davis met him, they put the loot in Davis\u2019s car, and the defendant went into his house. About 8:30 a.m. Davis telephoned him and asked, \u201cCan you fence the stuff now?\u201d The defendant said yes, and later Davis drove to the defendant\u2019s house. The defendant denied the conversation about slapping a girl.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">1. <em>Cross-examination of the defendant. </em>In a voir dire hearing during the presentation of the prosecution\u2019s case one of the arresting officers testified to statements made by the defendant at the time of his arrest. These included \u201cnone of you have any brains,\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t go to college like I do. I go to Clark University and take up sociology and psychology.\u201d When told he was going down to the police station, the defendant said, referring to the loot, \u201cWell, if I am going, I want my clothes, they\u2019re in the rear seat of the car.\u201d The judge reded that these statements were not voluntarily given and were to be suppressed in so far as they related to the clothes.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">The prosecutor opened his cross-examination of the defendant with reference to the defendant\u2019s testimony that he went to Clark University and studied psychology and sociology. The next question was, \u201cAnd, you have made the statement to police officers on many occasions that you were an educated individual and that they were dumb cops, isn\u2019t that so?\u201d The judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial, but sustained his objection to the question. The question was withdrawn and the . jury were instructed to disregard it.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">After the defendant had testified to leaving the party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>early Saturday morning, he denied stopping at another house on his way up the street. The prosecutor then asked, \u201cDon\u2019t you recall, Mr. Redmond, that on your way up Saxon Road, in accordance with the map, that you stopped into a house and threw a hurricane lamp at the lady?\u201d There had been no previous testimony to such an incident, and the defendant objected that the question called for testimony as to an unrelated crime. The judge again denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial, but sustained the objection and instructed the jury to disregard the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">After the defendant had testified to his arrest, the prosecutor asked, \u201cAnd as you were about to leave you said to Mr. Guerry, \u2018I want my clothing in the back of the car\u2019?\u201d The defendant objected that the conversation had been suppressed, and the prosecutor argued that it was admissible under <em>Harris </em>v. <em>New York, </em>401 U.S. 222 (1971), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>364 Mass. 236 (1973). Again the judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial, this time based on the cumulative effect of the improper questions. Again his objection was sustained, the question withdrawn, and the jury were instructed to disregard it.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">The trial was then in recess. When it resumed the following day, the prosecutor promptly inquired whether the defendant had some conversation with the arresting officer. The defendant answered yes, and the prosecutor then added, \u201cAnd you asked him, did you not, if you were going down to the Police Headquarters?\u201d The defendant answered yes. Again the judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial, but sustained his objection and instructed the jury to disregard the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">2. <em>The prosecutor\u2019s summation. </em>During his argument to the jury, the prosecutor described the murder scene and said, \u201cAnd, I argue to you that the person that was up in that room that morning... attempted to do something. I say that he attempted to rape.\u201d This was speculation and conjecture; there was no such evidence, and the prosecutor said he did not ask for an instruction on felony murder in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>the commission of rape. The judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial, said he would cover the matter in his instructions, and added, \u201cI would suggest you keep away from that.\u201d The prosecutor finally said, \u201cAll right, I won\u2019t mention rape.\u201d The judge then told the jury that arguments of counsel are not evidence, that as to rape or attempted rape they were the sole judges of what took place, and that he would ask them to consider it at a later time when he would give them the full charge. The prosecutor then described the scene again, held up the defendant\u2019s blood-stained undershorts, and said, \u201cDid he go up and take her pulse? You don\u2019t have to take your pants down to take a pulse.\u201d On the defendant\u2019s objection, the judge said, \u201cAgain I point out to you, ladies and gentlemen, the argument is not evidence. And, it is for you to determine what the evidence is, and for you alone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Davis had testified that at the time the defendant was arrested Davis was driving without a license. He expected to be charged with receiving stolen goods, but he was not arrested and no reference was made to any charge against him. He had been convicted in January, 1973, of breaking and entering a dwelling in the nighttime and of unauthorized use of a motor vehicle and sentenced to one year in a house of correction. In June, 1973, he was convicted of unauthorized use of a motor vehicle and of escape. In May, 1974, he was indicted for an armed robbery on February 14, 1974, and another indictment against him was returned in November, 1974, but no trial had been held when he testified in January, 1975. He testified that he did not expect favorable treatment. Defense counsel in his summation to the jury suggested that Davis expected some consideration by reason of his statement and that of his girl friend.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">Responding to this argument, the prosecutor said, \u201cAlan Davis will get his reward when he\u2019s prosecuted for that armed robbery charge that my Brother talked about, that\u2019s still pending..... My brother well knows the congestion of the criminal dockets.\u201d On objection by the defendant, the judge again instructed the jury that argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>ments of counsel are not evidence, but denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial. The prosecutor then said, \u201cI suggest to you that Alan Davis, based on that indictment that is pending against him and still open, will be prosecuted vigorously.\u201d The judge again denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial, and instructed the jury that \u201cthe issue whether anybody will be prosecuted vigorously or not is not in this case.\u201d The prosecutor then continued, \u201cI suggest to you that Alan Davis testified regarding the indictment pending against him and he testified that he expects to be prosecuted and he will pay for any crime that he committed, isn\u2019t that the testimony in this case?\u201d A motion for a mistrial was again denied, the judge suggested \u201cthat we stay away from this particular problem,\u201d and the jury were instructed that their memory of the evidence controlled.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">3. <em>Prejudice. </em>Although no question is before us as to the judge\u2019s rulings adverse to the Commonwealth, we think it proper to say that the ruhngs we have described should have been anticipated by the prosecutor. In each case, however, the cat was to some extent out of the bag: the effect in each case was to bring to the jury\u2019s attention unsworn testimony of the prosecutor in the form of an excluded question or a purported argument. Commonly such prejudicial effects are neutralized adequately by instructions to the jury to disregard the question or argument. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeChristoforo, </em>360 Mass. 531, 537 (1971). The difficult question in the present case is whether the judge\u2019s cautionary instructions were sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">On the one hand, the case against the defendant was a strong one, even without Davis\u2019s testimony. The defendant\u2019s credibility was thoroughly impeached by his own testimony as well as by evidence of thirty prior convictions of crime. In many respects his testimony corroborated testimony on behalf of the Commonwealth, and in any event the jury were not bound to and obviously did not believe him. We are not prepared to rule that any one of the trial incidents we have recounted, taken by itself, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>was necessarily so prejudicial that curative instructions were useless or that the instructions given were inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">On the other hand, the circumstances were such as to create a serious danger of prejudice against the defendant. Most of the defendant\u2019s prior convictions were for breaking and entering, and there was an obvious danger that they might be the basis for inferences going beyond credibility. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sheeran, ante, </em>82, 88 (1976). The case was largely presented as a contest between the account of Davis and his girl friend and the account of the defendant. The defendant\u2019s version was not such as to excite admiration or sympathy for him. In these circumstances, particular care was needed to assure that the central issues were tried factually and dispassionately, without inflammatory diversions.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">Instead, the prosecutor repeatedly and deliberately sailed unnecessarily close to the wind, and, sis the judge ruled, went beyond permissible limits. Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>519 F.2d 1368, 1370 (6th Cir. 1975). In such circumstances we have a duty to be skeptical as to the effectiveness of limiting instructions. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiMarzo, </em>364 Mass. 669, 681 (1974) (Hennessey, J., concurring). We conclude that the cumulative effect of the incidents we have recounted may have been significant prejudice, and we order a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">4. <em>Other issues. </em>The defendant also assigns error in the violation of the judge\u2019s order sequestering witnesses, and in the surprise assertion in closing argument and in the judge\u2019s charge that the defendant could be found guilty on the basis of a joint enterprise with Davis. These issues are not likely to arise in the same way at a new trial, and we do not consider them.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">\n<em>Judgments reversed. Verdicts set aside.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
