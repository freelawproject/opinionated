R. Civ. P. 56 (e), 365 Mass. 824 (1974). See <em>Stetson </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Carlisle, </em>369 Mass. 755, 762-764 (1976); <em>Shapiro Equip. Corp. </em>v. <em>Morris &amp; Son Constr. Corp., </em>369 Mass. 968 (1976) ; <em>Community Nat\u2019l Bank </em>v. <em>Dawes, </em>369 Mass. 550, 553-556 (1976). The case was transmitted to the Superior Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>after trial in the Municipal Court of the City of Boston. G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 104, as appearing in St. 1975, c. 377, \u00a7 104. We hold that (1) under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 102C, as amended through St. 1975, c. 377, \u00a7\u00a7 102, 102A, the plaintiff\u2019s affidavit, incorporating the decision of the Municipal Court and the amount of damages assessed, is \u201cprima facie evidence upon such matters as are put in issue by the pleadings\u201d; (2) the defendant\u2019s first affidavit, that he \u201ccan prove\u201d that he \u201cdoes not owe\u201d the money claimed, is insufficient; and (3) the defendant\u2019s second \u201caffidavit,\u201d not sworn to or signed under the penalties of perjury, is also insufficient. We therefore affirm the judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">The plaintiff sued in the Municipal Court of the City of Boston for insurance premiums in the amount of $668.94, plus interest, on an account annexed, and the judge made a finding for the plaintiff in the amount of $668.94. The defendant then had the case transmitted to the Superior Court, and the plaintiff moved for summary judgment on an affidavit which annexed and incorporated the finding of the Municipal Court. The defendant filed two documents entitled \u201caffidavit.\u201d The first, signed under the penalties of perjury, asserts that \u201cthe defendant can prove that it does not owe the plaintiff the monies that the plaintiff contends the defendant owes,\u201d that proof would be made \u201cthrough bookkeeping processes through evidence of the defendant\u2019s bookkeeper,\u201d and that those facts \u201cindicate that there is a genuine issue for trial.\u201d The second \u201caffidavit\u201d was not sworn or signed under the penalties of perjury. The Superior Court judge allowed the plaintiff\u2019s motion, and judgment for the plaintiff was entered in the amount of $778.74, plus interest from the date the action was entered in the Superior Court to the date of judgment, but without costs. The defendant appealed to the Appeals Court, and we transferred the case to this court on our motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">1. Under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 104, the case was to be tried in the Superior Court subject to the provisions of G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 102C, applicable to retransferred cases. Under \u00a7 102C, the finding of the Municipal Court judge was \u201cprima facie evidence\u201d on the matters in issue. No matter what other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>evidence might be introduced at trial, the finding would be evidence warranting a verdict for the plaintiff. <em>Akron Brick &amp; Block Co. </em>v. <em>Moniz Eng\u2019r Co., </em>365 Mass. 92, 94 (1974). Unless rebutted by evidence to the contrary, it required a verdict for the plaintiff as matter of law. <em>Fulton </em>v. <em>Gauthier, </em>357 Mass. 116, 118 (1970). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pauley, </em>368 Mass. 286, 290-291 (1975); appeal dismissed, 423 U.S. 887 (1975). We think it was sufficient to shift to the defendant the burden of making a response setting forth specific facts showing that there was a genuine issue for trial. See 10 C.A. Wright &amp; A.R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7\u00a7 2727, 2739 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">2. The defendant\u2019s first affidavit, consisting of \u201cvague and general allegations of expected proof,\u201d was wholly inadequate. <em>Community Nat\u2019l Bank </em>v. <em>Dawes, </em>369 Mass. 550, 555-556 (1976), quoting from <em>Albre Marble &amp; Tile Co. </em>v. <em>John Bowen Co., </em>338 Mass. 394, 397 (1959). His second \u201caffidavit\u201d was not an affidavit, since it was not sworn to or signed under the penalties of perjury. G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 1A. <em>Galvin </em>v. <em>Town Clerk of Winchester, </em>369 Mass. 175, 177 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">3. It is apparent that the Superior Court judge added interest to the amount of damages assessed by the Municipal Court, but the record does not disclose the basis of the computation. The defendant argues that the addition was improper, but nothing in the record shows that he raised any such issue in the Superior Court or that it is a genuine issue for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
