An additional element is presented, however, by the fact that the decree in the present case incorporated by reference a separation agreement between the parties. We hold that that fact makes no difference.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">The parties were divorced in 1971, and the separation agreement was filed with the decree and incorporated in it. The agreement provided that the husband would convey certain property to the wife and make certain payments in lieu of alimony, support, counsel fees and expenses, would pay her \u201cfor the support and maintenance of each of the minor children\u201d $33.33 \u201cper week during their minority for each child,\u201d and would \u201cpay for Blue Cross and Blue Shield coverage for each of the children during their minority, together with major medical coverage.\u201d There were three minor children, the oldest of whom became eighteen on February 12, 1975. On February 8, 1974, the wife sought a modification of the child support provisions of the divorce decree. The case was heard on the merits in August, 1974, and a decree was entered in June, 1975, modifying the divorce decree to provide for weekly payment by the husband of $60 \u201cfor the maintenance of each of their minor children until child\u2019s eighteenth birthday\u201d plus medical and dental expenses and counsel fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">The wife requested a report of material facts and claimed an appeal. The judge did not file such a report, but did file a document entitled \u201cReservation and Report.\u201d \u201cBefore spelling out the complicated factual situation,\u201d the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>judge stated, he \u201cseeks guidance as to whether or not the underlying decree of June 24, 1971 contains any order of the Court with respect to child support which can be modified by the Court.\u201d He described the decision in <em>Gunter </em>v. <em>Gunter, </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 729 (1975), and noted that the present \u201ccase does not come strictly within the purview of\u201d G. L. c. 215, \u00a7 13, on reservation and report, since a final determination had been made. He asserted a need for \u201cenlightenment\u201d in view of the \u201cconfusion\u201d among probate judges and the \u201cdoubtful validity\u201d of many outstanding decrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">The parties agree that the issues raised by the <em>Gunter </em>case were not addressed by them or by the judge at the time of trial. Both argue that those issues need not be resolved in the present case. In this situation we think it inappropriate to address those issues. We hold that the judge\u2019s \u201cReservation and Report\u201d does not comply with G. L. c. 215, \u00a7 13, and is not properly before us. We reject the suggestion that a question of jurisdiction is presented such as to justify its consideration on our own motion. There is no doubt that the Probate Court had jurisdiction of the parties and the subject matter. \u201cIt is settled that a separation agreement does not deprive the Probate Court of its power to modify its decree relating to alimony for the wife or support for the children.\u201d <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>358 Mass. 551, 553 (1971). The court had jurisdiction to interpret its prior decree and to modify it. G. L. c. 208, \u00a7\u00a7 28, 37. Cf. <em>Whitney </em>v. <em>Whitney, </em>316 Mass. 367, 371 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">Thus the case is governed by our decision in <em>Orlandella </em>v. <em>Orlandella, supra. </em>The 1971 decree was not automatically modified on January 1, 1974. The judge had full power to modify the decree not only as to the future, but also as to arrears. In exercising that power, he could give such weight as he saw fit to the change in the legal climate. Today he can also give such weight as he sees fit to St. 1975, c. 661, \u00a7 1, amending G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 28. None of the statutes compels modification of the 1971 decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">We do not pass on any question with respect to the interpretation of the separation agreement or its effect in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>any other proceeding. Under our former practice, if the agreement continued in effect after the divorce decree, it might remain valid and might still be enforced in an action at law after the decree. <em>Schillander </em>v. <em>Schillander, </em>307 Mass. 96, 98 (1940). As to enforcement in equity, see <em>Whitney </em>v. <em>Whitney, </em>316 Mass. 367, 372 (1944). No such claim was presented to the Probate Court, and no issue relating to such a claim is before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">The decree appealed from is vacated and the case is remanded to the Probate Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
