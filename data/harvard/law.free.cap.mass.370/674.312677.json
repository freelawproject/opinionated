(the first insurer). The final decree of the Superior Court judge was reversed in the Appeals Court, which held that to allow the employee compensation from the first insurer after the employee had settled with a second insurer for a lump sum as the result of another injury contributing to his incapacity would constitute double recovery and violate the statutory scheme. <em>Carrier\u2019s Case, </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 502, 505 (1975). We agree with the Appeals Court. The facts indicate that the employee sustained an injury to his left hand while in the course of his employment with a realty trust company. The first insurer paid benefits under c. 152 until a date when the employee went to work as a painter for one Kearin, then insured by the Hartford Accident and Indemnity Company (the second insurer). While so employed he injured his right knee. The second insurer paid benefits thereafter for approximately twenty-seven months when it and the employee entered into an agreement by the terms of which the second insurer paid the employee a lump sum. Thereafter the employee filed a claim against the first insurer. A remand by the Superior Court judge to the Industrial Accident Board produced a decision to the effect that the employee\u2019s knee injury sustained while working for Kearin contributed ten per cent to his disability thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">As argued by the first insurer, it is settled that on a series of injuries contributing to an existing condition of disability the insurer covering the risk at the time of the last injury is responsible for all disability payments. The rule was stated in <em>Evans\u2019s Case, </em>299 Mass. 435, 436-437 (1938), in the following terms: \u201cWhere incapacity results from the combined effect of several distinct personal injuries, received during the successive periods of coverage of different insurers, the result is not an apportionment of responsibility nor responsibility on the part of either or any insurer at the election of the employee. The implication of the act is that only one of successive insurers is to make compensation for one and the same incapacity____ [T]he subsequent incapacity must be compensated by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>one which was the insurer at the time of the most recent injury that bore causal relation to the incapacity.\u201d This principle applies even though the significance of the most recent injury is relatively slight and a more serious former injury remains the major cause of the incapacity. See <em>McConolouge\u2019s Case, </em>336 Mass. 396, 398-399 (1957) ; <em>Morin\u2019s Case, </em>321 Mass. 310, 312 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">Here there was a causal relationship between the second injury and the employee\u2019s incapacity, a situation diverse from that prevailing in <em>Dillon\u2019s Case, </em>335 Mass. 285 (1957), where the employee had \u201cfully recovered from the effect of the second injury\u201d and his remaining partial incapacity was wholly attributable to the \u201cresiduals and symptoms of the first injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 288-289. In the circumstances of this case the second insurer assumed the total liability for compensation due the employee, and the lump sum agreement entered into by the employee with the second insurer covered all compensation payments which the employee would be entitled to receive in the future as a result of his incapacity.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See <em>Paltsios\u2019s Case, </em>329 Mass. 526, 529 (1952). Cf. <em>Henderson\u2019s Case, </em>349 Mass. 683, 685 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">Both the compensation the employee has elected to receive in a lump sum from the second insurer and the payments now sought from the first insurer are based on incapacity and cover the same period of time. To allow an additional recovery against the first insurer in this situation would be to give the employee a double recovery for his incapacity. See <em>Mizrahi\u2019s Case, </em>320 Mass. 733, 735 (1947). It follows that the final decree of the Superior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>Court is reversed, and that judgment is to be entered in the Superior Court in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">So <em>ordered.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b690-7\"> The employee in negotiating the lump sum agreement may have been laboring under the misapprehension that he was merely effecting a settlement of a claim with respect to his knee injury. The legal consequences, if there be any at all, of such a mistaken belief would not include the creation of liability in the first insurer for continuing compensation payments where no liability existed prior to the employee\u2019s agreement with the second insurer. We suggest as a desirable practice that at the time when a lump sum agreement is negotiated the employee be notified that its effect will be as is demonstrated in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
