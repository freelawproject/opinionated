We are asked to decide whether the contestants\u2019 allegations are sufficient to withstand demurrers, and we hold that they are not. But the contestants are to be given an opportunity to amend their petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-9\">Maxwell Evans Richmond died on October 22,1971, and his brother, Richard J. Richmond, was appointed administrator of his estate on October 26, 1971. On January 7, 1972, the brother filed a petition for probate of the will, and after a four-day trial on the issue of forgery, the judge found that the will was genuine and allowed it on August 15, 1972. Appeals by the contestants were withdrawn in November, 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-10\">On July 30, 1975, the contestants filed a petition to revoke the decree allowing the will, claiming that conduct of the judge and counsel \u201cconstituted a fraud upon the Court, was prejudicial to the administration of justice, and operated to deprive petitioners of their day in Court.\u201d A second judge overruled the demurrers of the proponent and the other beneficiaries of the will, and reported the matter to the Appeals Court pursuant to G. L. c. 215, \u00a7 13. We allowed the contestants\u2019 application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-11\">We summarize the allegations of the petition. The trial judge and two of the lawyers for the proponent \u201cconcealed from\u201d the contestants \u201cthe existence of a direct and con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>tinuing financial relationship between them, depending in part upon the outcomes of the litigation, which has only recently come to petitioners\u2019 attention____\u201d By 1969 one of the lawyers \u201chad achieved a position of virtual control over all aspects, excepting educational, of the operations\u201d of a certain school. In August, 1971, that lawyer \u201cprevailed upon the stockholders\u201d of the school to appoint as trustees the other lawyer (his nephew) and the judge. The judge was paid, at the behest of the first lawyer, $12,000 a year for his part time service as trustee. On May 22, 1972, the two lawyers filed appearances for the proponent of the Richmond will, and trial without jury on the issue of forgery was then scheduled to commence before the judge on June 28, 1972. Neither lawyer had previously represented the proponent or the decedent; they were specially retained by the proponent and his regular counsel, who had long represented the decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">\u201cAt no time was the ongoing financial relationship\u201d disclosed to the contestants or their counsel. \u201cThis was not oversight because\u201d a meeting of the trustees of the school occurred pursuant to notice on June 29, 1972, during the trial. The two specially retained lawyers billed the estate $100,000 for their services, and proponent\u2019s regular counsel received $70,000 in partial payment for his services from October, 1971, to August, 1972. There was expert testimony that the purported will was an \u201camateurish, palpable forgery,\u201d and two witnesses who testified on depositions taken in Philadelphia to the execution of the will were indicted for perjury in July, 1975, in Philadelphia on the basis of handwriting analyses. In August, 1973, the first lawyer \u201cprocured the appointment\u201d of the judge as dean of the faculty of the same school at an annual salary of $20,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-8\">The school is in c. 11 bankruptcy, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 \u00a7 701-799 (1970), and in September, 1974, brought an action charging the two lawyers, the judge and others with \u201cintentional wasting of the school\u2019s assets.\u201d One of the two lawyers (the nephew) filed an appearance as counsel for the judge and an answer on his behalf. A motion to impound the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>complaint recites that it \u201ccontains facts which may be confidential.\u201d The contestants are aggrieved by the decree allowing the will, by the \u201cknowing and deliberate retention\u201d by proponent\u2019s counsel \u201cof trial counsel who enjoyed an ongoing and direct pecuniary relationship with the trial judge, and by the deliberate and purposeful concealment of that relationship\u201d by the two lawyers and the judge. \u201cThe foregoing evidence, all newly discovered, of fiscal camaraderie between proponent\u2019s counsel and the trial judge, undisclosed to petitioners in violation of the Canons of Ethics and Disciplinary Rules for lawyers established by the Supreme Judicial Court and the Canons of Judicial Ethics, has operated to deny your petitioners of the impartiality and the appearance of impartiality to which they were entitled under Article 29 of the Declaration of Rights of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">1. <em>Jurisdiction and procedure. </em>The matters reported under G. L. c. 215, \u00a7 13, are the interlocutory orders overruling the demurrers of the proponent and the other beneficiaries of the will. The reports bring to us the question whether the petition states a claim upon which relief can be granted. They do not bring to us the questions, raised by answers and motions, whether the petition is barred by compromise, release, consent, loches or lapse of time. We therefore do not consider the arguments made on these questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">The power of the Probate Court to vacate a decree allowing a will was discussed at length in <em>Tucker </em>v. <em>Bowen, </em>354 Mass. 27, 31-34 (1968). That power derives from the civil law through the ecclesiastical courts of England, and was kept distinct from jurisdiction at common law and in equity. See <em>Waters </em>v. <em>Stickney, </em>12 Allen 1, 3-4 (1866). The proceeding in the Probate Court, therefore, was not one \u201cseeking equitable relief\u201d under Mass. R. Civ. P. 1, 365 Mass. 730 (1974), and was not subject to those rules. But in such cases we have looked by way of analogy to the law governing writs of review at common law and bills of review in equity. See <em>Tucker </em>v. <em>Bowen, supra </em>at 32; <em>Parsekian </em>v. <em>Oynoian, </em>299 Mass. 543, 545 (1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>The completeness and formality of the pleading in an ordinary action at law have not been required in petitions to vacate judgment. <em>Herlihy </em>v. <em>Kane, </em>310 Mass. 457, 460 (1941). Before the \u201csweeping overturn of attitudes toward pleading\u201d represented by the 1974 rules, however, no intendment in favor of the pleader could be made upon a demurrer, and pleadings were generally to be construed against the pleader. See <em>Charbonnier </em>v. <em>Amico, </em>367 Mass. 146, 152 (1975). Even under the new rules \u201ccircumstances constituting fraud\u201d are to be \u201cstated with particularity.\u201d Mass. R. Civ. P. 9 (b). Cf. <em>Moskow </em>v. <em>Boston Redevelopment Authority, </em>349 Mass. 553, 561-564 (1965), cert. denied, 382 U.S. 983 (1966); <em>Regional Land Corp. </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>334 Mass. 276, 281 (1956). We think the same principle applies to a \u201cfraud upon the Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">2. <em>Disqualification. </em>There is no claim here of personal bias or prejudice against the complaining parties or their counsel, as in <em>Lena </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>369 Mass. 571, 573-576 (1976), and <em>Police Comm\u2019r of Boston </em>v. <em>Municipal Court of the W. Roxbury Dist., </em>368 Mass. 501, 507-509 (1975). Nor is there a claim that the judge had a financial interest in the subject matter in litigation, as in <em>Matter of Troy, </em>364 Mass. 15, 62 (1973), and <em>Northampton </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>11 Met. 390, 395-396 (1846). It is not claimed that the judge was too closely associated with an opposing party, as in <em>Beauregard </em>v. <em>Dailey, </em>294 Mass. 315, 324-325 (1936). The claim is that the judge had a relationship with counsel for an opposing party. Cf. <em>Matter of Troy, </em>364 Mass. 15, 60-62, 73 (1973); <em>Frade </em>v. <em>Costa, </em>342 Mass. 5, 7-8 (1961); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Leventhal, </em>364 Mass. 718, 724-726 (1974) (relationship with victim of crime); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Keigney, </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 347, 350-351 (1975) (same) ; <em>Matter of DeSaulnier (No. 4), </em>360 Mass. 787, 812 (1972) (relationship with bail bondsmen).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">We have no doubt that on the facts alleged it would have been proper for the judge to disqualify himself from hearing the will contest. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>6 Cush. 333, 335 (1850). Indeed, if before trial the point had been called to his attention in the terms now alleged, it might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>well have been his duty to withdraw. See S.J.C. Rule 3:25, Canon 2(B), Canon 3(C) (1), effective January 1, 1973, 359 Mass. 842, 844 (1973); cf. <em>Lena </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>369 Mass. at 577. But discretionary relief by revocation of a decree allowing a will is to be exercised with very great caution. <em>Tucker </em>v. <em>Bowen, </em>354 Mass. at 34. After trial and final judgment, the policy against reopening the matter because of a supposed error in the determination of facts is a strong one. <em>Stephens </em>v. <em>Lampron, </em>308 Mass. 50, 52-53 (1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">The allegation of a \u201cdirect and continuing financial relationship\u201d between judge and counsel, \u201cdepending in part upon the outcome of the litigation,\u201d lacks the required particularity. Other allegations are that stockholders of a school had appointed the judge and one of the lawyers as trustees, that they were serving together at the time of trial, and that the judge was paid for his service. It is not alleged that the school was not a charitable institution. See <em>Matter of DeSaulnier (No. 4), </em>360 Mass. at <em>812; </em>S.J.C. Rule 3:25 Canon 5(B), 359 Mass. 848 (1973); cf. G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 6. There is nothing to show how the \u201ccontinuing financial relationship\u201d depended \u201cin part upon the outcome of the litigation.\u201d It is alleged that the other lawyer \u201chad achieved a position of virtual control\u201d over the school, that he had \u201cprevailed upon the stockholders\u201d to appoint the judge, and that the payments to the judge were made at the other lawyer\u2019s \u201cbehest\u201d; but no specifics are shown as to the \u201cvirtual control,\u201d how he \u201cprevailed,\u201d or the \u201cbehest.\u201d Most important, and we think fatal, is the absence of any allegation that the judge knew of the control, the prevailing, or the \u201cbehest.\u201d Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Leventhal, </em>364 Mass. at 725. The demurrers should therefore have been sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">3. <em>Disposition. </em>As in <em>Charbonnier </em>v. <em>Amica, </em>367 Mass. at 153-154, we cannot say that when the contestants\u2019 counsel reexamine the facts and law they will be unable to state a claim. We think it best to afford them an opportunity to reframe their petition. G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 52, as amended by St. 1975, c. 377, \u00a7 86. The orders overruling the demurrers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>are reversed and the contestants are to have leave to file an amended petition in the Probate Court within forty days of the date of the rescript. The proponent and beneficiaries of the will may then make appropriate response.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
