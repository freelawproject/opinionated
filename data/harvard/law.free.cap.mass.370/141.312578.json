Thereafter, he filed a motion to revise or revoke the sentences or, in the alternative, to withdraw his pleas of guilty (see G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29C), which motion was denied by the judge who had sentenced him. The case is before us on the defendant\u2019s bill of exceptions, his sole exception being to the denial of his motion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">We summarize the relevant facts. The defendant was charged with various offenses in eleven separate indictments.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On October 8, 1974, the defendant\u2019s counsel<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> conferred with the prosecutor assigned to try the cases against the defendant in an effort to reach an agreement as to the sentence the prosecutor would recommend to the judge if the defendant entered pleas of guilty to the indictments. After the conference, the prosecutor agreed to make recommendations to the judge for the disposition of the charges in a manner resulting in an aggregate sentence to total not more than two years in the Billerica house of correction.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">The defendant was informed of the agreement by his counsel, and he thereafter pleaded guilty to all of the indictments. It is alleged in the defendant\u2019s bill of exceptions, and apparently not disputed by the Commonwealth, that \u201c[t]he agreement was the substantial inducement of the pleas, in that the defendant, on advice of counsel, had a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>reasonable expectation that the recommendations would either be accepted by the court or that the sentences imposed would in any event not materially differ from the recommendations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">On pleading guilty the defendant was questioned extensively by the judge. The matters into which the judge inquired are discussed <em>infra. </em>When this inquiry had been completed, the judge accepted the pleas except as to several indictments not involved in the issue presented herein. The prosecutor then recommended to the judge, as agreed, a two-year aggregate sentence in the Billerica house of correction. The judge declined to follow this recommendation, however, and instead sentenced the defendant to two terms of five to ten years and several shorter terms, all to be served concurrently in the Massachusetts Correctional Institution at Walpole, to be followed by a sentence of two years in a house of correction from and after the Walpole sentence, the two-year sentence being suspended and the defendant being placed on probation for two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">In reviewing the propriety of a judge\u2019s acceptance of guilty pleas offered by a defendant, we employ the test formulated by the Supreme Court of the United States in <em>Boykin </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>395 U.S. 238 (1969). The <em>Boykin </em>case held, as we recently noted in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>368 Mass. 100, 102 (1975), \u201cthat, as a matter of constitutional due process, a guilty plea should not be accepted, and if accepted must be later set aside, unless the record shows affirmatively that the defendant entered the plea freely and understandingly.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morrow, </em>363 Mass. 601, 603 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">The transcript in this case,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> pertinent portions of which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>are reproduced in the margin,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> discloses a thorough and searching inquiry directed to the defendant by the judge prior to acceptance of the pleas. This inquiry included several questions designed to determine, inter alla, (a) the factual basis for the defendant\u2019s pleas, (b) whether the pleas were voluntary, and (c) whether the defendant understood fully the constitutional rights which he waived by pleading guilty, the nature of the crimes charged, the maximum sentences which could be imposed, and the fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>that the judge was not bound by any recommendation made by the prosecution as to the sentences to be imposed. The transcript further discloses that all of the questions propounded by the judge were answered by the defendant in words consistent with understanding and voluntariness. We conclude that the record in this case was sufficient to satisfy the requirement in the <em>Boykin </em>case of an affirmative showing of understanding and voluntariness. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morrow, </em>363 Mass. 601, 603 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">The defendant urges, however, that we break new ground <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>in this Commonwealth in the area of pleas and adopt, by a decision of this court, a formal rule on the subject of plea bargaining which would include a provision that when a criminal defendant pleads guilty to a crime, after being promised by the prosecution that it will recommend a certain sentence to the judge, he is entitled either to receive a sentence which substantially conforms to the recommendation or, in the alternative, to an opportunity to withdraw his pleas of guilty. The defendant concedes that the principle which he urges us to adopt by rule \u201cis not yet generally established law,\u201d but cites a \u201cgrowing list of cases in other jurisdictions\u201d in which it seems to have been adopted. He draws our attention to a \u201cplethora of recent proposals,\u201d including that of the Executive Committee of the Massachusetts Criminal Rules Advisory Committee,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which favors a rule which would accomplish what the defendant asks us to do now by decision. While we are aware that the implementation of a rule of this nature would have many proponents and opponents, we are not persuaded that it is constitutionally required or that we should use the present case as the vehicle for accomplishing a result which is more appropriately one to be accomplished under the rule-making process. This is a subject which will receive our attention in due course when the final report and recommendations of the Massachusetts Criminal Rules Advisory Committee are placed before us for our consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">We hold that in the circumstances of this case there was no error in the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to revise or revoke his sentences or, in the alternative, to withdraw his pleas of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b156-7\"> The defendant\u2019s bill of exceptions was originally entered in the Appeals Court and was thereafter removed by us to this court for direct appellate review. G. L. c. 211 A, \u00a7 10 (A), inserted by St. 1972, c. 740, \u00a7 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b156-8\"> The indictments charged the defendant with negligent operation of a motor vehicle (No. 69624); speeding (No. 69625); unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle (No. 69626); use of a motor vehicle without authority (No. 69627); attempted larceny of a motor vehicle (No. 69628); possession of burglarious instruments (No. 69629); use of a motor vehicle without authority (No. 70177); malicious injury (No. 70178); possession of burglarious instrumente (No. 70179); receiving a stolen vehicle (No. 77127); attempted larceny of motor vehicle parte (No. 77128).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b156-9\"> The defendant was represented by counsel from the Massachusetts Defenders Committee with respect to two of the indictments (Nos. 77127 and 77128) and by private counsel with respect to the remainder of the indictments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b157-8\"> The case being before us on the defendant\u2019s bill of exceptions, we ordinarily would not <em>go </em>beyond the matters contained in such bill in our consideration of the case. However, the bill in this case is obviously incomplete with respect to matters which we deem indispensable to a proper consideration of the case. We have therefore examined the transcript of the proceedings wherein the defendant pleaded guilty, which transcript was not made a part of the defendant\u2019s bill of exceptions but was furnished to us at our request after oral argument. We consider this transcript, along with the bill, as comprising the record before us in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b158-5\"> The proceedings wherein the defendant entered his pleas of guilty, included a dialogue, reproduced in pertinent part, consisting of the following questions by the judge and answers by the defendant relative to the issue whether the defendant\u2019s pleas were offered voluntarily and with understanding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-6\">Q. \u201cHow old are you?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-7\">A. \u201cTwenty-four.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-8\">Q. \u201cHow far did you go in school?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-9\">A. \u201cFinished the ninth grade.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-10\">Q. \u201cDo you have any trouble reading or understanding English?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-11\">A. \u201cNo, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-12\">Q. \u201cHave you ever been treated for a mental condition?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-13\">A. \u201cNo, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-14\">Q. \u201cAre you addicted to drugs of any kind?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-15\">A. \u201cNo, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-16\">Q. \u201cYou heard the indictments read specifying the crimes with which you are charged.
