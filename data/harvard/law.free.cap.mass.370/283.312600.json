Donovan, Jr. A verdict of guilty was returned by a jury of six. The defendant was sentenced to two years in a house of correction, suspended until May 13, 1977. In this appeal the defendant\u2019s bill of exceptions raises a single issue, viz.: that the judge improperly excluded, over the defendant\u2019s exceptions, certain questions addressed by defense counsel on cross-examination in an attempt to show bias of prosecution witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">We agree that there was error in the exclusion of the questions, and that there must be a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-10\">We summarize the evidence as presented by the Commonwealth. This evidence consisted of the testimony of two witnesses, Officers Daniel Donovan and Joseph Dono-hue of the Newton police department. They testified that on May 27,1974, they entered McGoo\u2019s Tavern in Newton while on their regular patrol. Officer Donovan noticed the defendant seated at a table, and saw the defendant make an obscene gesture toward him. A few minutes later, the defendant jumped up and said, \u201cI\u2019m tired of you f...... pigs talking about me.\u201d The defendant ran toward the officers with a bar stool in his hands and, when he was within about ten feet of them, threw it in Officer Donovan\u2019s direction. Officer Donovan, however, was able to avoid being struck by the bar stool.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-13\">The defendant then turned to run, but the manager grabbed him and put him out of the tavern. Outside, the officers told the defendant to leave the area, but when he continued to yell obscenities at them and refused to leave, they placed him under arrest. The defendant thrashed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>about and struck Officer Donohue with his knee. Finally the defendant was subdued and taken into custody as an incapacitated person. At some time during the night the defendant was released from custody. The next morning, Officer Donovan took out a complaint against the defendant for assault with a dangerous weapon, alleging that the defendant assaulted him with a chair at the tavern.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">During cross-examination of Officer Donovan, the defendant\u2019s counsel asked if Donovan was aware that the defendant had applied for a civilian complaint against him and his partner before the defendant left the police station on the night of May 27. The judge excluded this question. Counsel then asked if anything had happened which affected the officer\u2019s bringing the criminal complaint between the time the defendant left the station that night and the time the officer made application for the complaint against the defendant. Donovan said there was, but again the judge excluded any answer to the question of what it was that so affected him. An additional question asking if Donovan recognized the application for a civilian complaint which the defendant had filed against him was also excluded by the judge. At a bench conference, the defendant\u2019s counsel made an offer of proof that the defendant had applied for a civilian complaint against the police officer after his release and prior to the officer\u2019s making a complaint against him. The judge said he did not think the defendant\u2019s application for a complaint against the officer was \u201crelevant\u201d and he would exclude anything about it. The defendant\u2019s counsel did not offer any grounds as to why this evidence should not be excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">Similar questioning took place with respect to the Commonwealth\u2019s second witness, Officer Joseph Donohue, Officer Donovan\u2019s partner on the evening of May 27. The defendant\u2019s counsel asked the witness if he was aware that the defendant had applied for civilian complaints against him and his partner prior to the bringing of the complaint against the defendant. The judge excluded the question and ordered the defendant\u2019s counsel to refrain from asking anything further about such civilian complaints. Again, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>defendant\u2019s counsel did not offer any grounds as to why this evidence should not be excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">The Commonwealth argues first that defense counsel stated no grounds for the admission of the disputed testimony, and for that reason the defendant\u2019s exceptions should be overruled. We note that ordinarily, with respect to questions asked on cross-examination, no offer of proof is required <em>(Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rudnick, </em>318 Mass. 45, 56 [1945]), but defense counsel nevertheless made an offer of proof in this case. The Commonwealth asserts, however, that where, as in this case, the judge is unable to see the relevance or purpose of a question, the cross-examiner may reasonably be expected to make not only an offer of proof <em>(Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Doyle, </em>323 Mass. 633, 635 [1949]), but also some explanation as to how he expects to show bias by means of the witness\u2019s answer. Cf. <em>Breault </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co., </em>364 Mass. 352, 357-358 (1973); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>348 Mass. 60, 63-64 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">We assume that there may be cases where such a burden should be placed on the cross-examiner, see, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Donahue, </em>369 Mass. 943, 950-951 (1976), but in our view the instant case is not one of them. From the sequence of facts then in evidence, it should have been apparent to the judge that the questions were relevant as to the issue of alleged bias. It was clear that the questions were designed to elicit testimony that the criminal complaint was sought by one of the policemen only after they learned that the defendant had sought civilian complaints against them. From this testimony, if admitted in evidence, the defendant could urge the jury to infer that the policemen had acted in a spirit of retaliation toward the defendant, or to induce him not to pursue his civilian complaint. In short, the relevance of the excluded inquiries was sufficiently apparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">The Commonwealth further argues that, while a defendant\u2019s reasonable cross-examination of a witness is a matter of right, a judge may in his sound discretion limit the scope of cross-examination, including the extent to which the credibility of a witness may be tested. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number><em>Sandler, </em>368 Mass. 729, 737-738 (1975). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Makarewicz, </em>333 Mass. 575, 593 (1956). See <em>Alford </em>v. <em>United States, </em>282 U.S. 687, 694 (1931). The Commonwealth contends that the judge\u2019s rulings here were within his discretion, particularly since much is left to the trial judge\u2019s discretion even in determining whether or not to allow particular questions testing bias. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>D\u2019Agostino, </em>344 Mass. 276, 280, cert. denied, 371 U.S. 852 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Again, we do not agree. A basic rule states that reasonable cross-examination for the purpose of showing bias and prejudice of the witness is a matter of right. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Russ, </em>232 Mass. 58, 79 (1919). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Byron, </em>14 Gray 31 (1859). This is not a case where the judge merely limited the scope of such examination, within his discretion; he excluded the total inquiry by his several rulings. The evidence, which was clearly relevant on the issue of the alleged bias of the witnesses, should have been admitted for the jury\u2019s consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">In view of our conclusions, it is not necessary for us to consider the defendant\u2019s further argument that the judge\u2019s rulings amounted to constitutional error. The defendant makes particular reference to the language in <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 308, 320 (1974): \u201c[The State] cannot require yielding of so vital a constitutional right as the effective cross-examination for bias of an adverse witness.\u201d See <em>Greene </em>v. <em>McElroy, </em>360 U.S. 474, 498 (1959); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferrara, </em>368 Mass. 182, 186-190 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
