Paul Ezra Rhoades has been convicted in three separate murder cases. For the murders of Susan Michelbacher and Stacy Baldwin, Rhoades was sentenced to death, and for the murder of Nolan Haddon he received an indeterminate life sentence based on a conditional plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-15\">On February 28, 1987, Stacy Baldwin was abducted from the convenience store where she was working near Blackfoot, Idaho. She was then taken to a secluded location and shot several times. She died approximately an hour and a half later.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-16\">The issues presented in this appeal are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-17\">I.Whether a prejudicial statement made by one juror to another should have been grounds for a mistrial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-19\">II. Whether the legislative abolition of the defense of mental condition in criminal cases violates the Idaho or United States Constitutions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-20\">III. Whether the trial court\u2019s failure to make a pretrial ruling on the constitutionality of the statutory abolition of the insanity defense was in error.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-21\">IV. Whether the prosecution\u2019s failure to turn over exculpatory evidence constituted reversible error.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-22\">V. Whether the trial court should have excluded testimony by a jailhouse informant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-23\">VI. Whether inculpatory statements made by Rhoades to the police should have been suppressed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-24\">VII.

Whether the death penalty was properly imposed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-27\">X. Whether the court erred in compelling a defense expert to prepare a written report or submit to an interview by the prosecutor before testifying.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-28\">XI. Whether the trial court abused its discretion in denying a motion for continuance to allow for the attendance of the defense's forensic expert.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-29\">XII. Proportionality of the sentence imposed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b832-30\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-31\">PREJUDICIAL STATEMENT BY JUROR</p>\n<p id=\"b832-32\">Rhoades asserts that the trial court should have granted a mistrial because of a prejudicial statement allegedly made by one juror to another. After the jury was selected, a deputy sheriff from Bingham County came forward and signed a statement stating that he overheard one juror make a prejudicial remark to another juror <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>during the jury selection process. The deputy testified in a special proceeding outside the presence of the jury, that during a recess he was six to eight feet away from the jury box when he heard a juror say, \u201cyou can just look at him and tell that he\u2019s guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b833-4\">Upon learning of this, the trial court undertook an extensive inquiry into the matter. Counsel was permitted to examine the deputy sheriff at length. Several questions were raised concerning the accuracy of his perceptions. The supposed remark did not mention the defendant\u2019s name, and the deputy sheriff did not hear any conversation either before or after the statement to indicate the context in which it was made. The court then took testimony from juror Webster, who supposedly made the prejudicial statement, Hinrichs, the juror to whom the remark was addressed, and all other members of the jury. Webster denied having made the remark. Hinrichs denied having heard it. The juror sitting directly in front of Hinrichs did not hear it, nor did any other juror or officer in the vicinity. The court inquired if the jurors were still able to be fair and impartial in their deliberations. Hinrichs and Webster both reassured the court of their ability to be fair and impartial jurors and to judge the case solely on the evidence presented. Based on this testimony, the trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion for mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">Appellant has failed to show that the court abused its discretion in denying the motion. The record does not support the contention that any remark was made that would prejudice the defendant. The trial court\u2019s finding is supported by the evidence, and accordingly, we hold that the defendant was not prejudiced by jury misconduct and was not entitled to a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">II.-III.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">LEGISLATIVE ABOLITION OF THE INSANITY DEFENSE AND PRETRIAL RULING ON THE AVAILABILITY OF THE INSANITY DEFENSE</p>\n<p id=\"b833-8\">In 1982 the Idaho legislature abolished the insanity defense in criminal cases, by repealing I.C. \u00a7 18-209 and enacting I.C. \u00a7 18-207(a), which provides that \u201c[mjental condition shall not be a defense to any charge of criminal conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b833-11\">In this case, prior to trial, defense counsel filed a \u201cRequest for Declaration that the Enactment of \u00a7 18-207, I.C., the Repeal of \u00a7\u00a7 18-208, 18-209, I.C. and the Repeal of Rule 12(g), I.C.R. are Unconstitutional.\u201d It was urged that the abolition of the defense deprives criminal defendants of due process rights under the state and federal constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-12\">Both parties extensively argued the issue of justiciability; that is, whether there was any factual showing on the record that would grant the court the authority to render a ruling in the nature of a declaratory judgment on the issue. Rhoades had been examined by a psychiatrist pursuant to his counsel\u2019s request. However, the defense did not introduce evidence indicating the psychiatrist\u2019s conclusions as to whether Rhoades might be suffering from any mental defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-13\">The defense contended that no showing was required under the unique circumstances of a capital case. The defense asserted that the court did have jurisdiction to render a declaratory judgment, in that the nature of a declaratory judgment is to clarify legal uncertainty, and having no legal definition of insanity made it impossible for a psychiatrist to render an opinion on whether Rhoades was legally insane.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-14\">The defense further argued that even if some showing was required, the prosecution and the court had waived the necessity of presenting preliminary evidence on Rhoades\u2019s mental condition when a defense request for psychiatric assistance at state expense was granted without the preliminary showing required. The defense argues that this constituted a waiver of any showing that might be required in the later request for a ruling on the existence of the insanity defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-15\">Finally, the defense urged that there was a sufficient factual showing on the record to bring Rhoades\u2019s sanity into issue. Noting that where the insanity defense is permitted it may be established by lay testimo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>ny, the defense cited the preliminary hearing testimony of one of the arresting officers to the effect that on the night Rhoades was arrested he was unstable and incoherent.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">The trial court held a hearing on the defense request for a \u201cdeclaration\u201d that the Idaho statutes were unconstitutional. During that hearing, the court inquired of counsel as to its assertion of any mental defect defense.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-5\">THE COURT: Gentlemen, I\u2019ve had the opportunity to read defendant\u2019s brief and also plaintiff\u2019s brief. I\u2019ve also had the opportunity to review in detail Judge Boyle\u2019s memorandum decision he entered in a companion case in Idaho Falls, where the same issue was raised. I\u2019ve looked at the Montana cases and also those cases you argue. It\u2019s my understanding, Mr. Parmenter, that your client does not at this time tender a defense of insanity?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-6\">DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Well, that\u2019s correct, Your Honor. And that\u2019s primarily because of the status of the law. What we\u2019re saying is that if we had that law to elect from, we might elect. But as of this point in time, that\u2019s correct. THE COURT: Okay. If that is the correct situation, ... there is no insanity defense tendered. Then I must look at it as a matter that presents an issue that is not before the court because the defense has never been claimed. We\u2019re actually asked to get into the area of dicta, or perhaps speculation in this matter. There\u2019s nothing before the court to indicate an insanity defense has been raised, or the court should act upon it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-7\">The court denied the defendant\u2019s request for a \u201cdeclaration.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b834-8\">We perceive the difficulty of the defense in obtaining an expert opinion on such a complex issue without the guiding framework of a legal standard. We also recognize that a psychiatric opinion on the mental condition of a defendant in a criminal case is forged by a long process of interaction between the expert and the defense, and that the result of that process will not generally be available during the pretrial stage of a criminal case.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-10\">However, the trial court did not require that the defense present an expert opinion as to the ultimate issue of Rhoades\u2019s sanity. The court requested any expression of opinion by the expert as to whether insanity might be an issue in the ease, or an assertion by counsel that he was raising the defense of insanity. The court did not require polished testimony concerning exact mental processes or precise cognitive abilities of the defendant. It would have sufficed for the expert to provide a summary affidavit stating that in his opinion, there was a viable issue of insanity involved in the case. Alternatively, the expert might have submitted an affidavit to the effect that it would be impossible for him to render an opinion without a guiding legal standard. Yet another option might be to offer an opinion based on the definition of insanity that Idaho had in place prior to the legislative repeal of the defense, restricting the affidavit to an <em>in camera </em>review in order to protect the defense from the consequences of prematurely offering an opinion from an improperly prepared defense expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-11\">The trial court found that the record did not create a justiciable controversy to support a ruling on the issue of the repeal of the insanity defense. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-12\">The authority to render a declaratory judgment is bestowed by statute. The Declaratory Judgment Act, contained in Idaho Code tit. 10, ch. 12, confers jurisdiction upon the courts the option to \u201cdeclare rights, status, and other legal relations, whether or not further relief is or could be claimed.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 10-1201. An important limitation upon this jurisdiction is that, \u201ca declaratory judgment can only be rendered in a case where an actual or justiciable controversy exists.\u201d <em>Harris v. Cassia County, </em>106 Idaho 513, 516, 681 P.2d 988, 991 (1984). This concept precludes courts from deciding cases which are purely hypothetical or advisory.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-13\">Declaratory judgments by their very nature ride a fine line between purely hypothetical or academic questions and actually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>justiciable cases. Many courts have noted that the test of justiciability is not susceptible of any mechanistic formulation, but must be grappled with according to the specific facts of each case. <em>Harris v. Cassia County, </em>106 Idaho 513, 681 P.2d 988 (1984); 22 Am.Jur.2d Declaratory Judgments \u00a7 33, at 697. This Court, in <em>Harris, </em>adopted the following language from the United States Supreme Court\u2019s definition of justiciability as a guiding standard in the context of declaratory judgment actions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7\">A \u201ccontroversy\u201d in this sense must be one that is appropriate for judicial determination. A justiciable controversy is thus distinguished from a difference or dispute of a hypothetical or abstract character; from one that is academic or moot. The controversy must be definite and concrete, touching the legal relations of parties having adverse legal interests. It must be a real and substantial controversy admitting of specific relief through a decree of a conclusive character, as distinguished from an opinion advising what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts. Where there is such a concrete case admitting of an immediate and definitive determination of the legal rights of the parties in an adversary proceeding upon the facts alleged, the judicial function may be appropriately exercised although the adjudication of the rights of the litigants may not require the award of process or the payment of damages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b835-4\"><em>Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Haworth, </em>300 U.S. 227, 240-41, 57 S.Ct. 461, 464, 81 L.Ed. 617 (1937) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">The same principle as pronounced by this Court provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-6\">The Declaratory Judgment Act ... contemplates some specific adversary question or contention based on an existing state of facts, out of which the alleged \u201crights, status and other legal relations\u201d arise, upon which the court may predicate a judgment \u201ceither affirmative or negative in form and effect.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-7\">\n<em>******</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-8\">The questioned \u201cright\u201d or \u201cstatus\u201d may invoke either remedial or preventative relief; it may relate to a right that has either been breached or is only yet in dispute or a status undisturbed but threatened or endangered; but, in either or any event, it must involve actual and existing facts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b835-12\"><em>State v. State Board of Education, </em>56 Idaho 210, 217, 52 P.2d 141, 144 (1935).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-13\">In the present case, there are no actual and existing facts on the record. The record before the trial court, and before this Court, contains nothing more than the statement of counsel that he desired to inquire into the viability of the defense, and that although Rhoades had been examined by a psychiatrist, no opinion in any form as to Rhoades\u2019s mental state could be forthcoming unless the court provided an operative legal definition of insanity.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-14\">The testimony of Officer Rodriguez concerning Rhoades\u2019s manner on the night of his arrest likewise does not suffice to create a justiciable controversy on the issue of insanity. The officer stated during the preliminary hearing that on the night of the arrest:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-15\">Paul Rhoades was either acting as if he was high on some kind of narcotic, or he was high on some kind of narcotics ... he really didn\u2019t have much stability ... he had to be helped to walk. He swayed back and forth when he sat down, almost in a drunken stupor. Didn\u2019t say too much, and when he did, he mumbled, as if, I would take it, he was not in control of his senses____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b835-16\">Other testimony confirms Officer Rodriguez\u2019s impressions of Rhoades\u2019s conduct on the night of the arrest, but there is no evidence in the record as to abnormal conduct at any other time. This testimony establishes that Rhoades was having physical difficulty on the night of his arrest, which was assumed by the officers to be the result of drugs or intoxication. The trial court appropriately concluded that such evidence alone does not rise to the level of a showing of the mental condition of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-17\">The defense argues that any showing that might be required was waived by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>the prosecution on the defense request for appointment of a psychiatric expert at state expense. The United States Supreme Court, in <em>Ake v. Oklahoma, </em>470 U.S. 68, 105 S.Ct. 1087, 84 L.Ed.2d 53 (1985), held that the defendant is constitutionally entitled to psychiatric assistance at state expense once a preliminary showing has been made that the mental condition of the defendant is likely to be an issue in the case. Defense counsel urges that the acquiescence by the prosecution and the court in the motion for a court appointed expert without requiring any preliminary showing on the defendant\u2019s mental condition, amounts to a waiver of the required showing on the issue. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">Justiciability is a question of the jurisdiction of the court over the matter at issue. <em>Baird v. State, </em>574 P.2d 713, 716 (Utah 1978); <em>Mountain West Farm Bur. Mut. Ins. v. Hallmark Ins., </em>561 P.2d 706 (Wyo.1977). It is axiomatic that a lack of jurisdiction may not be cured by means of stipulation or waiver by the parties. <em>Bowlden v. Bowlden, </em>118 Idaho 84, 794 P.2d 1140 (1990); <em>White v. Marty, </em>97 Idaho 85, 540 P.2d 270 (1975), <em>overruled on other grounds by Carr v. Magistrate Court of the First Judicial Dish, </em>108 Idaho 546, 700 P.2d 949 (1985). Therefore, this defense argument must be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">We uphold the trial court\u2019s determination that the record does not create a justiciable controversy to support a ruling on the issue of the repeal of the insanity defense. Having done so, we do not reach the constitutional issue of the legislative repeal of the insanity defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">WITHHOLDING OF EXCULPATORY EVIDENCE BY PROSECUTION</p>\n<p id=\"b836-8\">On May 15,1987, the defense filed a request for discovery, asking for \u201c[a]ll Bingham County and/or Blackfoot City Police reports or investigative materials relative to the Stacy Baldwin homicide which is alleged to have occurred in Bingham County.\u201d On July 2, 1987, the prosecution filed a Supplemental Response to Defendant\u2019s Discovery Request, listing the items that it had provided pursuant to the discovery request, including, \u201c[a]ll Bingham County and/or Blackfoot City Police reports\u201d relative to the Baldwin case.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-10\">Part of the materials submitted to the defense in this exchange was a supplementary police report by Detective Newbold of the Blackfoot Police Department, which detailed the confession of Kevin Buckholz to the killing of Stacy Baldwin. Buckholz had been arrested by Blackfoot Police Officer Love on March 14, 1987, for drunk and disorderly conduct. Love\u2019s brief report indicated that Buckholz stated he had \u201ckilled the girl at the mini barn.\u201d Later, while he was in the holding tank, Buckholz initiated conversation with Officer Larry Christian. Christian filled out the following report of the conversation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-11\">[A] prisoner in the holding tank started talking to me (Kevin Buckholt) [sic] said he \u201chad problems and needed to be put away cause he couldn\u2019t function in the regular world,\u201d he then proceeded to tell me he shot a girl twice in the back. I said what girl and he said \u201cYou know the one from the mini barn.\u201d I then asked how many shots did you fire, he said \u201cI don\u2019t know I shot several times, I hit her in the back twice.\u201d ... I then asked him what kind of gun he used and he said \u201ca \u201838\u2019 then said no a \u20189\u2019 mm I think____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b836-12\">Christian reported the incident to Detective Newbold, who summarized the statement in his report. That report was provided to defense counsel for Rhoades pursuant to the discovery request for Blackfoot Police reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-13\">Newbold\u2019s report mentions Christian\u2019s written report, and outlines that report in detail. However, neither Christian\u2019s nor Love\u2019s report was provided to the defense. On appeal, Rhoades argues that the prosecution\u2019s compliance with the discovery request was inadequate, and in violation of the prosecutor\u2019s duty to turn over all exculpatory evidence to the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-14\">? test by which to measure the prosecutor\u2019s duty to disclose evidence is the materiality of the information at issue. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>The determination of \u201cmateriality\u201d is guided by whether the information tends to create a reasonable doubt about guilt, <em>State v. Brown, </em>98 Idaho 209, 560 P.2d 880 (1977), or is otherwise \u201cobviously of such substantial value to the defense that elementary fairness requires it to be disclosed even without a specific request.\u201d <em>United States v. Agurs, </em>427 U.S. 97, 110, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 2401, 49 L.Ed.2d 342 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-4\">We don\u2019t believe that the outcome of the trial would have been different had the defense received the two other police reports. Officer Newbold\u2019s report provided enough detail to stimulate additional inquiry if the defense had been inclined to do so. The defense had the information that there was a confession to the Baldwin murder, the identity of the confessor, the details of the confession, and the name of the officer who heard the confession. With that information they could have contacted Officer Christian and Kevin Buckholz to determine whether the confession was worth pursuing. The defense claims that had they received the two additional reports from the prosecution then they would have made more of an effort to locate Buckholz. We believe that the defense could have made that determination without the other two police reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">JAILHOUSE INFORMANT TESTIMONY</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">David Holm testified at trial concerning conversations he had with the defendant while they were in the same cell. At that time, he stated that he had not been offered anything in exchange for his testimony. Later, at a post conviction hearing, Holm testified that he was dissatisfied with the sentence he received in his case, and that had he known the sentence he was going to receive, he would not have testified at the Rhoades trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-8\">Appellant asserts that this change is grounds for a new trial. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-9\">At the post conviction hearing, when questioned about what he thought he would receive in exchange for his testimony, Holm said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-10\">He [the prosecuting attorney] couldn\u2019t ever make any promises. Nobody ever did actually make it a promise____ They couldn\u2019t guarantee what the judges would do anyway____ I never did expect anything out of it. I hoped. Of course, I think anybody in my position in a situation that they\u2019re put under would hope that they would at least get some favorable consideration. But as far as a definite promise or a definite belief, no. I was just \u2014 all the time. I did hope. My attorney hoped. And that\u2019s about where we\u2019re at.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b837-15\">We fail to see why misplaced hopes on the part of a witness would be reason to grant a new trial. There is no evidence in the record that any type of reward was promised in exchange for the testimony. In addition, Holm\u2019s testimony at trial would not have differed. At the post conviction proceeding, Holm stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-16\">I don\u2019t believe there would be any change in my testimony. As far as the case itself. I think the only change there would be as far as \u2014 I think would be maybe under the influence. The influences. That actually got me the courage, I guess. I was \u2014 you know, I just\u2014 I felt assured, You know, that what I was doing was the right thing. And I was assured that it may be in a sense that what I was doing was in essence paying back a debt to society.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b837-17\">The trial court found that this situation did not raise an issue of material fact. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-18\">Appellant further asserts that the trial court should have excluded David Holm\u2019s testimony altogether. He argues that jailhouse informants are inherently unreliable, and that Holm, in particular, had a reputation for untruthfulness.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-19\">We hold that it was not error for the trial court to admit the testimony of David Holm. It is up to the trier of fact to determine the credibility of witnesses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-20\">An appellate court may not substitute its judgment for that of the jury regarding the credibility of witnesses, the weight of their testimony, or the reasonable infer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>enees to be drawn from the evidence. <em>State v. Campbell, </em>104 Idaho 705, 718-19, 662 P.2d 1149, 1162-68 (Ct.App.1983).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ARK\"><em>State v. Clay, </em>112 Idaho 261, 263, 731 P.2d 804, 806 (Ct.App.1987), <em>review denied.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">Allowing Holm to testify is not grounds for a new trial. It was the jury\u2019s responsibility to weigh the credibility of his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-8\">SUPPRESSION OF INCULPATORY STATEMENTS</p>\n<p id=\"b838-9\">Rhoades was arrested March 25, 1987. He was being sought as a suspect in an Idaho murder investigation, when his car was identified in Nevada. A Nevada Highway Patrol Officer, George McIntosh, drove to the scene with two officers from Idaho, Victor Rodriguez and Dennis Shaw. Two Nevada officers, Trooper Neville and Officer Miller, were holding Rhoades at the scene. Another Nevada officer, Shires, arrived at the scene as back up. Shaw testified that as he and Rodriguez approached Rhoades where he was being held against the car by Neville and Miller, Rhoades made a spontaneous statement of, \u201cI did it,\u201d without being directly addressed or questioned by any officer. Miller claims to have heard that first statement, although it was not included in his initial report of the arrest. Miller did include that fact in a supplemental report filed two months later. Officer McIntosh testified that he did not hear the statement, nor was it overheard by Trooper Neville.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-10\">After being read his rights, Rhoades was transported to the Highway Patrol Substation in Wells, Nevada. He did not make any statements <em>en route. </em>Officers Shires, Miller, Neville, McIntosh, Shaw, and Rodriguez were present at the station. Shaw made a statement to the defendant to the effect that if he\u2019d been apprehended earlier, the victims of his crimes might still be alive. Rodriguez testified that in response to that statement, Rhoades stated, \u201cI did it.\u201d This second statement at the station was not part of Miller\u2019s initial report, although he claims to have overheard it. Both Shires and Miller reported the statement in supplemental reports filed several months after the arrest. The statement was also not recorded by Officer Shaw in his report. Rhoades made no further statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-12\">Rhoades argues on this appeal that the trial court should have excluded those statements for three reasons: (1) the questionable reliability of the evidence, given the fact that several officers who claimed to overhear the statements failed to record them in their reports until months after the arrest; (2) the failure of the police to tape record the statements; and (3) the statements were the result of the violation of Rhoades\u2019s Miranda rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-13\">On the first point, the defense argues that due process under the state and federal constitutions requires an enhanced degree of reliability during the guilt determination stage of a capital prosecution. We reject this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-14\">The United States Supreme Court has imposed many procedural protections for capital cases. <em>See Lockett v. Ohio, </em>438 U.S. 586, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 57 L.Ed.2d 973 (1978). However, these cases do not go so far as to alter the types of evidence or establish a minimum degree of reliability of evidence that is admissible during the fact finding phase of a potential capital case. The prosecution is not required to prove the crime by any higher standard than the \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard used in other criminal cases. Admission of evidence is not governed by any separate rules applicable only to capital cases. Therefore, there is no reason to conclude that testimony which is questionable must be excluded during the guilt determination phase of a capital case. The credibility of evidence in a first degree murder case, as in all others, is an issue for the trier of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-15\">Likewise, we cannot accept the contention that in order to be admissible, statements made in custody must be tape recorded by the police. The defense cites an Alaska case, <em>Stephan v. State, </em>711 P.2d 1156 (Alaska 1985), holding that custodial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>confessions must be tape recorded in order to be admissible under the due process clause of the Alaska State Constitution. That case represents no more than the prerogative of each state to extend the protections of its own constitution beyond the parameters of federal constitutional guarantees. We decline to adopt Alaska\u2019s standard in Idaho.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-4\">We now turn to the issue of whether Rhoades\u2019s Miranda rights were violated by the police during his arrest and custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">There is some conflict in the record as to whether Rhoades was read his Miranda rights while in the custody of Nevada Officers Miller and Neville, or if he was given the Miranda warnings for the first time by Officer Rodriguez after Rodriguez, Shaw, and McIntosh arrived at the scene. Although the record does not support the trial court\u2019s finding that the first statement by Rhoades was preceded by a Miranda warning, that factual issue does not affect our conclusion that both statements were properly admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">The first \u201cI did it\u201d statement, while Rhoades was handcuffed in the parking lot was apparently spontaneous. So spontaneous in fact, that according to uncontested police accounts, Rhoades made the statement without being questioned or otherwise addressed by any of the officers present. As a spontaneous statement, it was admissible whether it occurred before or after Rhoades was read his Miranda rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">\u201cAny statement given freely and voluntarily without any compelling influences is, of course, admissible in evidence____ Volunteered statements of any kind are not barred by the Fifth Amendment.\u201d <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 478, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 1630, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). Although the statement lacked any context to make it meaningful, the trial court correctly concluded that it was for the jury to decide to what Rhoades referred when he said \u201cI did it\u201d at the scene of the arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-9\">The second statement at the station house, made in response to Shaw\u2019s comment, is also admissible. The trial court found that there was insufficient evidence in the record to support the inference that Rhoades asserted his right to remain silent at any time during the arrest and booking. Officer McIntosh did testify that after Rodriguez finished reading the Miranda rights, Rhoades nodded as if to indicate that he understood. Then McIntosh testified that Rodriguez said something else, which McIntosh could not hear, whereupon Rhoades shook his head. McIntosh took the gesture to mean that Rhoades was asserting his right to remain silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-11\">Those facts are the sole basis in the record for the contention that Rhoades did assert his right to remain silent. There is no evidence in the record as to what Rhoades was responding to when he shook his head negatively. On the strength of this evidence alone, the trial court declined to infer that the shake of the head indicated a desire to remain silent. That finding is not clearly erroneous, given the absolute lack of evidence to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-12\"><em>Miranda </em>teaches that, \u201c[o]nce warnings have been given, the subsequent procedure is clear. If the individual indicates in any manner, at any time, prior to or during questioning, that he wishes to remain silent, the interrogation must cease.\u201d <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 473-74, 86 S.Ct. at 1627.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-13\">In this case, based on the record before us, Rhoades did not assert his right to remain silent. If he had, Shaw\u2019s comment, properly found by the trial court to be \u201cthe functional equivalent of interrogation,\u201d would have been improper, and the second statement would not have been admissible. The requirement that interrogation must cease comes into play when the accused indicates in any manner that he or she does not desire to converse with the police, or that the presence of an attorney is desired. After rights are read to and acknowledged by the detainee and until the right to silence or counsel is asserted, the police may initiate questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-14\">The record indicates that Rhoades was read his rights before the second statement, and acknowledged that he under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>stood them. Although there is evidence that Rhoades was heavily influenced by narcotics at the time of the arrest, Officer Shaw testified that while searching his person, he engaged Rhoades in conversation to test his alertness and found that he had sufficient capacity to understand what was going on around him.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">In sum, Rhoades had been instructed upon and understood his rights at the time of arrest, and there is insufficient evidence to indicate that he asserted his right to remain silent. For the foregoing reasons we conclude that the second statement made in response to Shaw\u2019s \u201cinterrogation\u201d is not subject to suppression under <em>Miranda v. Arizona.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">ACCELERATED POST CONVICTION PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">Idaho Code \u00a7 19-2719 requires that in capital cases, post conviction relief must be requested within 42 days after the judgment is filed, and completed within 90 days after that. Appellant urges this Court to reconsider our decision in <em>State v. Beam, </em>115 Idaho 208, 766 P.2d 678 (1988), which held that I.C. \u00a7 19-2719 did not violate the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights under equal protection analysis. We decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">Defendant also claims that I.C. \u00a7 19-2719 violates his due process rights, which <em>Beam </em>did not address. Procedural due process issues are raised whenever a person risks being deprived of life, liberty, or property interests because of governmental action. The requirement is that there must be some process to ensure that the individual is not arbitrarily deprived of his rights in violation of the state or federal constitutions. This requirement is met when the defendant is provided with notice and an opportunity to be heard. <em>Armstrong v. Manzo, </em>380 U.S. 545, 85 S.Ct. 1187, 14 L.Ed.2d 62 (1965); <em>Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>339 U.S. 306, 70 S.Ct. 652, 94 L.Ed. 865 (1950). The United States Supreme Court provides us with a balancing test to determine if procedural safeguards are adequate in <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 96 S.Ct. 893, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976). The three factors to be weighed are: (1) the private interests at stake; (2) the government\u2019s interest; and (3) the risk that the procedures used will lead to erroneous results. U.S.C.A. Const. Amends. 5, 14. This Court has employed this due process test in <em>State v. Ankney, </em>109 Idaho 1, 704 P.2d 333 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-10\">First, obviously, the defendant\u2019s interest is in being afforded an adequate opportunity to present legal and factual issues in his defense. Second, the government\u2019s interest in enacting I.C. \u00a7 19-2719, stated by the legislature, is \u201cto accomplish the purpose of eliminating unnecessary delay in carrying out a valid death sentence.\u201d This was determined by this Court to be a legitimate goal in <em>State v. Beam, </em>115 Idaho 208, 766 P.2d 678 (1988). The focus, then, of our present inquiry, is the third prong of the <em>Mathews v. Eldridge </em>test, we must determine whether or not I.C. \u00a7 19-2719 provides an adequate process to prevent erroneous results and to ensure that death sentences are not carried out so as to arbitrarily deprive a defendant of his life.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-11\">The 'statute requires the defendant to file a petition for post-conviction relief within 42 days of the filing of the judgment imposing the sentence of death. These challenges arise out of the judicial proceeding just concluded. At this point, counsel has been closely involved with the case for some time, has been present at trial, and has had notice of all issues that are appropriate to be raised within this 42 day limit. All that counsel is required to do is to organize all challenges and issues that arose during trial and are appropriate for appeal within 42 days. That is not an unduly burdensome task. The statute provides adequate notice to the defendant of exactly what is required of him, and sufficient opportunity for all challenges to be heard. In addition, it serves the purpose of the legislature by preventing the unnecessary delays that occur with so much frequency in capital cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-12\">In <em>Stuart v. State, </em>118 Idaho 932, 801 P.2d 1283 (1990), this court remanded a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>second and subsequent petition for post-conviction relief to the district court for an evidentiary hearing. <em>Stuart </em>had only learned of the facts raised in the second petition after the first petition had been filed. We held that pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 19-4908, the second petition was not barred.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It was necessary for the trial court to hold an evidentiary hearing to determine if Stuart\u2019s constitutional rights were violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\">In <em>Stuart, </em>we cited <em>Palmer v. Dermitt, </em>102 Idaho 591, 635 P.2d 955 (1981) for the sole proposition that, under the appropriate circumstances, I.C. \u00a7 19-4908 did not bar ' successive petitions for post-conviction relief. At this point, it is important to understand some very important facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\"><em>Palmer </em>was decided pursuant to the waiver provisions of I.C. \u00a7 19-4908. Subsequent to <em>Palmer, </em>the legislature enacted I.C. \u00a7 19-2719 in 1984. This modified post-conviction proceedings in death penalty cases. Idaho Code \u00a7 19-2719(3) requires a defendant to \u201cfile any legal or factual challenge as to the sentence or conviction that is known or reasonably should be known.\u201d Idaho Code \u00a7 19-2719 limits post-conviction relief to one petition unless it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the trial judge that this issues being subsequently raised were not \u201cknown or reasonably should be known.\u201d Ineffective assistance of counsel is one of those claims that should be reasonably known immediately upon the completion of the trial and can be raised in a post-conviction proceeding.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">A careful reading of <em>Palmer </em>reveals that the defendant raised an ineffective assistance of counsel claim in a habeas corpus petition [treated as a petition for post-conviction relief] subsequent to his direct appeal and first post-conviction proceeding. After the direct appeal and first petition failed to produce favorable results, the defendant obtained new appellate counsel and brought a subsequent petition. This Court held that <em>because the defendant had filed a pro se petition immediately after trial raising the ineffective assistance claim, but which claim was omitted through no fault of his own, </em>the defendant had not waived his claims and the subsequent petition was not barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-12\">Therefore we hold that I.C. \u00a7 19-2719 provides a defendant one opportunity to raise all challenges to the conviction and sentence in a petition for post-conviction relief except in those unusual cases where it can be demonstrated that the issues raised were not known and reasonably could not have been known within the time frame allowed by the statute. The legislature has seen fit to appropriately limit the time frame within which to bring challenges which are known or which reasonably should be known. The process encompassed in I.C. \u00a7 19-2719 providing for review by the trial court and then this Court, provides adequate opportunity to present the issues raised and to have them adequately reviewed. Therefore, I.C. \u00a7 19-2719 is not unconstitutional under due process analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-13\">VIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-14\">VICTIM IMPACT STATEMENTS</p>\n<p id=\"b841-15\">We now turn to the issue of the victim impact statement contained in the presentence report. <em>Booth v. Maryland, </em>482 U.S. 496, 107 S.Ct. 2529, 96 L.Ed.2d 440 (1987), prohibits the introduction of victim impact statements during the sentencing phase of a capital case as violative of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. In <em>Booth, </em>there were two types of information presented in the victim impact statement. The first type consists of \u201ca description of the emotional trauma suffered by the family and the personal characteristics of the victims.\u201d The second type contains the \u201cfamily members\u2019 opinions and characterizations of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>crimes.\u201d Both types of information are excluded because, \u201cits admission creates a constitutionally unacceptable risk that the jury may impose the death penalty in an arbitrary and capricious manner.\u201d <em>Booth, </em>482 U.S. at 503, 508, 107 S.Ct. at 2533, 2535. Both types of information are present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">In the present case, the portion of the presentence investigation report containing the victim impact statements is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARH\">The victim, Stacy Dawn Baldwin, who was age 21 at the time of her death, was employed as a night clerk at the Mini-Barn Convenience Store in Blackfoot, Idaho. It was while she was discharging her duties in that capacity, that she was robbed, kidnapped and shot to death on 2/28/87. Mrs. Baldwin was married and resided with her husband Myron Baldwin, in Blackfoot, Idaho. She and her husband were active members of the LDS Church. She was athletic and maintained her physical fitness by exercise and swimming. He [sic] husband Myron, indicated that he and Stacy had met in high school in 1981. They had planned to marry after he completed a Mission for the LDS Church. He stated that he was sent on his mission to Canada in 1984, where he spent two years. He returned in April of 1986, and he and Stacy were married on 8/1/86. He indicated that he still suffers emotional stress caused by the senseless murder of his wife. He stated that he wants the maximum sentence given to the man who killed Stacy. He added that he believes in the death sentence. Mr. Baldwin further indicated \u201cI don\u2019t want him to ever have the chance to do this to anyone else.\u201d Mr. Baldwin indicated that on the night she was abducted and killed, he should have stayed with her at the Mini-Barn as he usually did on Friday nights, but he had been ill with influenza and she told him she would be OK and for him to stay home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b842-5\">Evelyn Baldwin, Myron\u2019s mother indicated that for several months after Stacy was killed, Myron \u201cShut the world out,\u201d but time has tempered his pain somewhat and he is again socializing with family and friends. She stated that the Baldwin family is satisfied with the outcome of the trial. She related that they favor a death sentence in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b842-7\">The victim\u2019s mother, Verna Taylor, recalled in an emotional interview that her daughter\u2019s murder was the \u201cbiggest shock of her life.\u201d She indicated that the victim had seven siblings all of who still grieve at the loss of their sister. She explained that \u201cStacy did everything right in her life and didn\u2019t deserve to die like that.\u201d She indicated that she has to deal with her feeling about Stacy\u2019s death everyday. Mrs. Taylor stated \u201cI hope he burns in hell for what he did to Stacy. I\u2019m glad she fought him.\u201d She added \u201cI approve of capital punishment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b842-8\">This is undoubtedly a victim impact statement of the kind contemplated in <em>Booth, </em>and as such, it was error for the trial court to admit it.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-9\">The next level of inquiry is to determine if the victim impact statement constitutes harmless error under the <em>State v. Paz, </em>118 Idaho 542, 798 P.2d 1 (1990), exception. In <em>Paz, </em>the Court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b842-10\">This decision should not be interpreted in any fashion to condone or permit victim impact statements in capital cases. Victim impact statements are clearly proscribed by <em>Booth v. Maryland </em>and <em>State v. Charboneau. </em>It is a rare capital ease where the inclusion of a victim impact statement will not fatally flaw the entire sentencing procedure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b842-11\"><em>Paz, </em>118 Idaho at 558, 798 P.2d at 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-12\">The test to apply to determine if the use of such statements was harmless is whether this Court is assured that \u201cit was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 828, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967). Here, three members of the victim\u2019s family commented. All three explicitly said that they favored the death penalty in this case. The victim\u2019s husband stated that \u201che wants the maximum sentence given to the man who killed Stacy,\u201d and \u201cthat he believes in the death sentence.\u201d The victim\u2019s mother-in-law said that the Baldwin family favors a death sentence in this case. The victim\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>mother stated, \u201cI hope he burns in hell for what he did to Stacy. I\u2019m glad she fought him____ I approve of capital punishment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b843-4\">We cannot determine from the record if the trial judge considered or relied on these statements in imposing the death sentence. Since the trial court allowed the victim impact statements to be filed for consideration, we must assume that he did consider them.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">In that the victim impact statements presented to the court were considered is error under the rule of <em>Booth v. Maryland, </em>482 U.S. 496, 107 S.Ct. 2529, 96 L.Ed.2d 440 (1987), and <em>State v. Charboneau, </em>116 Idaho 129, 774 P.2d 299 (1989), we must consider if this error requires reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">This Court, in <em>State v. Paz, </em>118 Idaho 542, 798 P.2d 1 (1990), relying on <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967), and <em>Satterwkite v. Texas, </em>486 U.S. 249, 108 S.Ct. 1792, 100 L.Ed.2d 284 (1988), held that victim impact statements included in the presentence report while error could, under appropriate circumstances, be harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">The trial court in this case carefully weighed the evidence, including aggravating and mitigating factors. There is no indication that the victim impact statements diverted the trial court from its primary function of considering the person being sentenced and not the victim or the victim\u2019s family.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-8\">Obviously, the trial court does not make decisions in a vacuum. By the time a judge is called upon to decide on a sentence, the judge has heard the testimony and evidence put on at trial, has seen the impact of the crimes on the victim\u2019s family and community, and has been closely involved with the details of the case, sometimes for years. It is evident from the findings of the trial court that the nature of this crime was such that the victim impact statements, if they were considered at all, were not a decisive factor in the decision to impose the death penalty. The facts recited by the court in passing sentence are facts that would have been known to the trial judge without the victim impact statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-9\">In reviewing the record in this case, we are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the victim impact statements in the presentence investigation report, describing the family of the victim and their recommendation of sentence, did not influence the trial court in its imposition of sentence. The error was therefore harmless, and the case need not be remanded for sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-10\">IX.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-11\">WHETHER THE DEATH PENALTY WAS PROPERLY IMPOSED</p>\n<p id=\"b843-12\">Appellant asserts that the trial court failed to adequately consider alternatives to the death penalty. In <em>State v. Leavitt, </em>116 Idaho 285, 775 P.2d 599 (1989), this Court reversed the imposition of the death penalty and remanded, because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AE1\">[T]he trial court failed to give adequate consideration of the alternatives which exist between the distant poles of \u2018rehabilitation and possible probation,\u2019 or the death penalty. Clearly, alternatives were and are available to a sentencing court, such as a fixed life sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AIS\"><em>Leavitt, </em>116 Idaho at 294, 775 P.2d at 608.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-13\">The Court in <em>Leavitt </em>did not specify what constitutes \u201cadequate consideration of the alternatives,\u201d or exactly what the trial court would have to say to show that the alternatives were adequately considered. Here, in the Findings of the Court in Considering Death Penalty the trial court did not discuss alternatives to the death penalty. However, after those findings were issued, the parties were allowed to file briefs in response to an evidentiary hearing and the defendant raised the issue of alternatives to the death penalty as required by <em>Leavitt. </em>The trial court then addressed this in the Supplement to Memorandum Decision and Order. He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-14\">The court carefully considered the objectives of sentencing and expressly finds that any rehabilitation that is possible is heavily outweighed by the need to protect society, deter the crime of murder and to punish and obtain retribution for the wrong committed. The court considered penalties less than death, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>determines that in this case the imposition of the death penalty would not be unjust but that the imposition of any other sentence would seriously depreciate the seriousness of the crime committed. If any situation ever warranted the death penalty, it is clearly manifest in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">We hold that this is sufficient to indicate that the trial court did consider alternatives to the death penalty and decided against imposing them after contemplating the unique circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">Defendant next argues that he is entitled to a new presentence report and a new sentencing hearing in order to have the opportunity to present new mitigating circumstances, such as witnesses attesting to his cooperation as a prisoner. We find no support for this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">In his Petition for Post Conviction Relief, defendant argued that the trial court did not weigh the mitigating circumstances against each aggravating circumstance as required by <em>State v. Leavitt, </em>116 Idaho 285, 775 P.2d 599 (1989), and <em>State v. Charboneau, </em>116 Idaho 129, 774 P.2d 299 (1989). <em>Charboneau </em>set out the requirement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-7\">[Tjhat all the mitigating circumstances presented must be weighed against each of the aggravating circumstances separately. We hold that the trial court may sentence the defendant to death, only if the trial court finds that all the mitigating circumstances do not outweigh the gravity of each of the aggravating circumstances found and make imposition of death unjust.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b844-8\"><em>Charboneau, </em>116 Idaho at 153, 774 P.2d at 323.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-9\">Here, the trial court set forth four and a half pages of mitigating circumstances in his Findings of the Court in Considering the Death Penalty. He was well aware of the requirement in <em>Leavitt </em>and <em>Charboneau </em>and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-10\">In the weighing process, the court carefully avoids \u201cduplicating\u201d or \u201cstacking\u201d the statutory aggravating factors and weighs each and every mitigating factor found, both singularly and collectively, against each of the statutory aggravating factors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b844-13\">This statement, plus the extensive sections detailing the mitigating factors and aggravating circumstances, is sufficient to show that the trial court completed the weighing process satisfactorily. It would be tedious and repetitive for the court to state each mitigating factor over and over for the five aggravating circumstances found. It is enough to, as in this case, have one section setting forth all mitigating factors and one section setting forth all aggravating circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-14\">As for the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court engaged in impermissible speculation and overemphasized aggravating factors, appellant cites no specific examples in his brief, but says only that \u201ccertain comments indicate a predisposed negative attitude towards the defendant.\u201d We find no merit in this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-15\">The final issue presented by the defendant concerning the imposition of the death penalty is that he was improperly sentenced by a judge without jury input. This Court has held \u201cthat there is no federal constitutional requirement of jury participation in the sentencing process and that the decision to have jury participation in the sentencing process, as contrasted with judicial discretion sentencing, is within the policy determination of the individual states.\u201d <em>State v. Creech, </em>105 Idaho 362, 373, 670 P.2d 463, 474 (1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>465 U.S. 1051, 104 S.Ct. 1327, 79 L.Ed.2d 722 (1984). In addition, the United States Supreme Court held in <em>Clemons v. Mississippi, </em>494 U.S. 738, 745, 110 S.Ct. 1441, 1446, 108 L.Ed.2d 725 (1990), that \u201c[a]ny argument that the Constitution requires that a jury impose the sentence of death or make the findings prerequisite to imposition of such a sentence has been soundly rejected by prior decisions of this Court.\u201d In <em>Walton v. Arizona, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 110 S.Ct. 3047, 111 L.Ed.2d 511 (1990), the United States Supreme Court held that Arizona\u2019s statute which, like Idaho\u2019s, provides for sentencing by a judge in capital cases is not unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>X.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-4\">COMPELLING DEFENSE EXPERT TO PREPARE A WRITTEN REPORT OR TO BE INTERVIEWED BEFORE TESTIFYING</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">The defendant hired a ballistics and hair expert to examine the State\u2019s evidence. The expert did not prepare or provide any written reports to the defense. The prosecutor sought an order from the court requiring the defense to \u201cprovide the State with copies of reports of examinations conducted by the defense experts ... whom the defendant intends to call at trial,\u201d or in the alternative to allow the prosecutor to \u201cinterview the defense experts; if reports are not, or have not yet been prepared____\u201d The defense objected to this procedure. The trial court ruled that the expert must either provide a written report to the prosecutor or allow the prosecutor to interview him pursuant to Rule 16(c)(2) of the Idaho Criminal Rules, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aps\">Upon written request of the prosecuting attorney, the defendant shall permit the State to inspect and copy or photograph any results or reports of physical or mental examinations and of scientific tests or experiments made in connection with the particular case, or copies thereof, within the possession or control of the defendant, which the defendant intends to introduce in evidence at the trial, or which were prepared by a witness whom the defendant intends to call at the trial when the results or reports relate to testimony of the witness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">Idaho Criminal Rule 16(c)(2) clearly allows access to reports that the defendant intends to introduce at trial or that were prepared by a witness whom the defendant intends to call at trial. However, in ordering a defense expert to prepare a report for opposing counsel, or to submit to an interview by opposing counsel, the court overstepped the boundaries of the rule. The Washington Supreme Court interpreted an analogous criminal discovery rule, in <em>State v. Hutchinson, </em>111 Wash.2d 872, 766 P.2d 447 (1989), which involved a similar situation. They held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-8\">It is undisputed that the defendant may be required to disclose any existing expert\u2019s report he intends to use at trial. However, the rule does not say that an expert can be required to make a report at the request of the opposing party. Defense counsel claims that no written reports have been requested, received or written. The clear language of the rule does not authorize the trial court to require the defendant\u2019s experts to prepare written reports for the State when they have not been prepared for the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b845-9\"><em>Hutchinson, </em>111 Wash.2d at 877, 766 P.2d at 450.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-10\">However, we do not believe that this error resulted in prejudice to the defendant. This case differs from <em>Hutchinson, </em>because here, the defense did anticipate having the expert prepare a report, but told the prosecutor that it would not be available until a week before trial. The prosecutor was concerned that this would not be enough time in which to use the evidence to prepare for trial. In managing the trial procedure, the court set a deadline for the production of the expert report, which was within his authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-11\">XI.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-12\">DENIAL OF MOTION FOR CONTINUANCE</p>\n<p id=\"b845-13\">The defendant planned to call an expert witness, Mr. Fox, to counter the State\u2019s ballistic evidence. He was unable to attend due to prior commitments. The defense filed a motion for a continuance, which the trial court denied. The defense then made alternative arrangements with another expert, Ned Stuart, whose findings covered the same area as Fox\u2019s conclusions. During the course of the trial, one of Mr. Fox\u2019s commitments was taken care of, and he was available to testify. Defendant contends that had he called Fox, the State would then have called Stuart.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-14\">Rhoades asserts that it was an abuse of discretion for the trial court to deny the motion for continuance because it resulted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>in prejudice to the defendant. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">A decision to grant or deny a motion for continuance is vested in the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>State v. Richardson, </em>95 Idaho 446, 511 P.2d 263 (1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 1163, 94 S.Ct. 928, 39 L.Ed.2d 117 (1974). Here, the defendant has not shown that the trial court abused its discretion by denying the continuance. The purpose of the expert witness\u2019s testimony was to counter the State\u2019s ballistics evidence. This was done. We do not find prejudice to the defendant resulting in an unfair trial as a result of the testimony being given by one expert witness as opposed to another.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">XII.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">PROPORTIONALITY</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">Idaho Code \u00a7 19-2827(c)(3) requires this Court to determine in each capital case, \u201cwhether the sentence of death is excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the crime and the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b846-8\">Our perusal of the legislative history regarding the proportionality of sentences does not offer much guidance. The Statement of Purpose and the committee minutes for the bill that was eventually passed and codified as I.C. \u00a7 19-2827 expressed only a concern that the Idaho statute be updated to reflect recent ruling by the United States Supreme Court:</p>\n<p id=\"b846-9\">STATEMENT OF PURPOSE</p>\n<p id=\"b846-10\">Only a few years ago, the United States Supreme Court made new \u201crules\u201d concerning imposition of the death penalty for serious crimes. So that we conformed with this U.S. Supreme Court interpretation of the federal Constitution, the Idaho Legislature enacted in 1973 our present death penalty Sections 18-4003 and 18-4004, <em>Idaho Code. </em>Then, last year, the United States Supreme Court again changed the rules relating to capital punishment \u2014 after many states, like Idaho, had acted in response to its previous decision. The Court, in five</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-11\">cases, set forth new, more definitive rules concerning sentencing where the death penalty was sought to be imposed. The purpose of this bill is to codify into Idaho law these present requirements imposed on the states by these most recent United States Supreme Court decisions on capital punishment so that we will conform with this latest expression of the law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b846-12\">There is no mention of proportionality, or any expression by the legislature that we are required to review the proportionality of sentences with a special standard or test. The requirement that the death sentence not be disproportionate to \u201cthe penalty imposed in similar cases,\u201d is one of several considerations this Court must examine in each death penalty case. The legislature did not see fit to establish a separate standard for proportionality review of sentences when I.C. \u00a7 19-2827 was enacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-13\">This Court looked at the proportionality of death sentences in <em>State v. Creech, </em>105 Idaho 362, 670 P.2d 463 (1983), and reviewed several cases in which the death penalty had been imposed or could have been imposed. The Court compared the facts of the crimes with the facts of the case they were reviewing to determine whether or not the sentence was disproportionate. This is the procedure that has been followed by this Court. We must do likewise.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-14\">In this case, Paul Ezra Rhoades kidnapped Stacy Baldwin from the convenience store where she was working, forced her into a pickup truck and drove her to a secluded area where he attempted to attack her. The trial court found that Baldwin fought back, and:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-15\">[Fjinally as she was on hands and knees trying to get away, he shot at her with his pistol. The first shots missed her and made glancing marks in the snow. Finally his shots hit her. One ricocheting bullet lodged in her elbow and one bullet went through her back and through her lungs. The tread on the soles of his boots left their imprint as he walked towards Stacy, but then he left <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>while she was still alive. She lived for about one to one and one half hours and then died alone in the cold.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b847-4\">In considering this crime and this defendant, compared to similar crimes and similar defendants,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the record in this case and the district court\u2019s findings and conclusions in imposing the sentence, we hold that the death sentence is not excessive or disproportionate.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">XIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">After independently reviewing the record and transcript describing the character of the defendant, the nature of the crime of which he has been convicted, the circumstances of the crime of which he has been convicted, we hold that there existed an adequate basis for imposing the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-8\">The judgment entered and sentence imposed are affirmed. Upon issuance of the remittitur, the district court shall set a new execution date.

Fetterly </em>and <em>State v. Windsor; State v. Beam </em>and <em>State v. Scroggins; State v. Bainbridge </em>and <em>State v. Sivak. </em>Also, upon revisiting my dissent in <em>State v. Major, </em>it is seen as another case which the majority should refrain from citing. As to the companion cases, Fetterly, Beam, and Sivak are awaiting execution; Windsor, Scroggins, and Bainbridge will not suffer that fate. Further enlightenment is readily available in <em>Fetterly, </em>115 Idaho at 236, 766 P.2d at 706. Even more enlightening are the trial court\u2019s remarks at sentencing Karla Windsor to be executed, 110 Idaho at 425-27, 716 P.2d at 1197-99, under the heading of \u201cFindings of Facts and Argument Found in Possible Mitigation,\u201d and concluding with the imposition of the death sentence, plus the remainder of the sentencing remarks set out in Appendix B \u201cSentencing,\u201d 110 Idaho at 444, 716 P.2d at 1216. For the views of the sentencing judge following this Supreme Court\u2019s opinion which vacated the sentence of death and remanded for resentencing, see Part I of <em>State v. Fetterly, </em>115 Idaho at 232-33, 766 P.2d at 702-03.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-14\">In sum, it is submitted that Justice McDevitt\u2019s opinion for the Court is a first step in a better direction. <em>Ad hoc </em>assess<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>ments of a capital murderer\u2019s right to live in perpetual confinement, or be executed should eschew all prior notions (literally, not figuratively) of proportionality, in which this Court has, by rote citation, allowed itself to indulge. Justice McDevitt, at the close of his opinion, correctly observes that Justice Shepard in authoring the 1983 <em>Creech </em>opinion,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> reviewed several death penalty cases which in time were subsequent to the 1977 legislative amendment of Idaho\u2019s death sentencing provisions. Justice Shepard found and cited to <em>Creech, Lindquist, Needs, </em>and Osborn.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The 1979 <em>Creech </em>case was distinct from the 1983 <em>Creech </em>case, and Justice Shepard detailed the salient facts which led to imposition of death sentences, and concluded that Creech\u2019s murder of Dale Jensen was on a par with the murders committed by Osborn, Needs, and Lindquist. The recitation of the cases which he stated as having been reviewed was unnecessary.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">It is also high time to comply with our Idaho Constitution and put the awesome decision of life or death back in the hands of twelve tried and true jurors. It was ever thus prior to the adoption of the Idaho Constitution. Just three years ago, Justice Johnson, in <em>Steed v. Young, </em>115 Idaho 247, 252, 766 P.2d 717, 720 (1988), cited to <em>Christensen v. Hollingsworth, </em>6 Idaho 87, 93, 53 P. 211, 212 (1898), for the proposition that, \u201cart. 1, \u00a7 7 of our Constitution simply secures the right to jury trial \u2018as it existed at the date of the adoption of the Constitution.\u2019 \u201d Justice Huntley has stated the same, and added that in the context of a capital case the jury at the time of statehood had the power to decide between the penalty of life imprisonment, or death, by the degree of murder declared in the verdict. His views are perpetuated, along with my own, in <em>State v. Creech, </em>105 Idaho at 375-412, 670 P.2d at 476-513.</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b848-5\">. <em>State </em>v. <em>Creech, </em>105 Idaho 362, 374, 670 P.2d 463, 475 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b848-6\">. <em>State </em>v. <em>Creech, </em>99 Idaho 779, 589 P.2d 114 (1979); <em>State v.

The legislature copied this provision from the death sentencing scheme enacted in Georgia following the decision of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Furman v. Georgia, </em>408 U.S. 238, 92 S.Ct. 2726, 33 L.Ed.2d 346 (1972). Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 17-10-35(c)(3) (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-11\">In <em>Pulley v. Harris, </em>465 U.S. 37, 42-43, 104 S.Ct. 871, 875-76, 79 L.Ed.2d 29, 35-36 (1984), the Supreme Court differentiated between traditional proportionality and the proportionality to which I.C. \u00a7 19-2827(c)(3) refers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-12\">Traditionally, \u201cproportionality\u201d has been used with reference to an abstract evaluation of the appropriateness of a sentence for a particular crime. Looking to the gravity of the offense and the severity of the penalty, to sentences imposed for other crimes, and to sentencing practices in other jurisdictions, this Court has occasionally struck down punishments as inherently disproportionate, and therefore cruel and unusual, when imposed for a particular crime or category of crime. The death penalty is not in all cases a disproportionate penalty in this sense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-13\">The proportionality review sought by Harris, required by the Court of Appeals, and provided for in numerous state statutes is of a different sort. This sort of proportionality review presumes that the death sentence is not disproportionate to the crime in the traditional sense. It purports to inquire instead whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>penalty is nonetheless unacceptable in a particular case because disproportionate to the punishment imposed on others convicted of the same crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b849-4\">(Citations and footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">In <em>Pulley, </em>the Supreme Court ruled that the statutory proportionality review mandated by statutes such as I.C. \u00a7 19-2827(c)(3) is not required by the eighth amendment. <em>Id. </em>In <em>McCleskey v. Kemp, </em>481 U.S. 279, 306, 107 S.Ct. 1756, 1775, 95 L.Ed.2d 262, 288 (1987), the Supreme Court reaffirmed that this statutory proportionality review is not constitutionally required \u201cwhere the statutory procedures adequately channel the sentencer\u2019s discretion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ATQ\">Recently, the United States District Court for the District of Idaho noted that proportionality review is not constitutionally required but that <em>Pulley </em>and <em>McCleskey </em>\u201cmake clear that proportionality review <em>may </em>be considered and implemented by the states as an additional safeguard against arbitrarily imposed death sentences.\u201d <em>Beam v. Paskett, </em>744 F.Supp. 958, 960 (D.Idaho 1990) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">Therefore, I conclude that the review required by I.C. \u00a7 19-2827(c)(3) is entirely governed by the statutory intent of the legislature and not by any constitutional considerations. This statutory intent is revealed by the other provisions of I.C. \u00a7 19-2827 and by decisions of this Court applying the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">I.C. \u00a7 19-2827(g) provides that the Court \u201cshall collect and preserve the records of all cases in which the penalty of death was imposed from and including the year 1975.\u201d In <em>State v. Creech, </em>105 Idaho 362, 375 n. 2, 670 P.2d 463, 476 n. 2 (1983), the Court read I.C. \u00a7 19-2827(c)(3) and (g) together \u201cas requiring a comparison of the capital cases from 1975 to the present.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b849-8\">I.C. \u00a7 19-2827(a) provides that this Court must review a death penalty sentence \u201con the record.\u201d In <em>State v. Scroggins, </em>110 Idaho 380, 387, 716 P.2d 1152, 1159 (1985), the Court construed I.C. \u00a7 19-2827(a) and (c)(3) together to require \u201can independent review of the sentence on the record.\u201d In <em>Scroggins, </em>the Court concluded that the sentence of death imposed in that case was \u201cexcessive and disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the crime and the defendant.\u201d 110 Idaho at 387, 716 P.2d at 1159. The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b849-10\">We have painstakingly considered the record, and in so doing, have focused not only on the crime and the circumstances surrounding its commission but on the age, characteristics, criminal record and personal involvement of <em>this </em>defendant. We must conclude that the death sentence should not have been imposed in this case because in light of the following considerations, the death sentence as applied to this defendant was excessive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AoG\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-11\">Among the considerations discussed by the Court in <em>Scroggins </em>were that Scroggins did not have a history of violent criminal conduct, that his mental age was only 13.8 years, that he was under tremendous psychological pressure, and that he had failed to develop mature responses to stressful situations. 110 Idaho at 388, 716 P.2d at 1160.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-12\">In <em>State v. Windsor, </em>110 Idaho 410, 420-22, 716 P.2d 1182, 1192-94 (1985), the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b849-13\">Whenever the death penalty is imposed this Court is required to conduct an independent review of the record to insure ... that when both the crime and the defendant are considered, a sentence of death is not excessive or disproportionate. After careful consideration of both the crime and the defendant, we conclude that the sentence of death imposed in this case was excessive and disproportionate. We therefore set aside the death sentence and remand for resentencing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b849-14\">The concept of individualized sentencing is firmly entrenched in modern American jurisprudence. The familiar maxim that punishment should fit the crime has been broadened to provide that punishment should also fit the criminal. With this in mind, we now turn our focus to the defendant as an individual, outlining those factors in Windsor\u2019s background <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>and character which convince us that the death penalty was excessive in this instance. We begin by noting that Windsor, unlike the majority of capital defendants, has no formal criminal record nor significant history of prior criminal activity. There is no history of violent criminal activity, nor is there an indication that Windsor possesses any propensity toward violence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">(Citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">The Court then reviewed other circumstances of Windsor personally, including her skills and abilities, her education, her experience and training, her troubled childhood and serious problems in her home environment. 110 Idaho at 422-23, 716 P.2d at 1194-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">The trial court described the crime in this case in the findings of the court in considering the death penalty:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-7\">The Defendant Paul Ezra Rhoades ... was observed loitering around convenience stores in Blackfoot and Idaho Falls and watching the female employees. On February 28, 1987, the defendant entered [a convenience store] in Blackfoot, Idaho. He worked nearby as a drywaller and frequented the store, but on this evening, he stayed only a short time and then left.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-8\">Near midnight he returned and at gunpoint robbed the till and forced clerk, Stacy Dawn Baldwin, age 21, into his pickup and drove her to a secluded spot near the Snake River just off Rose Road in Bingham County. He attempted to attack her, she fought back, and finally as she was on hands and knees trying to get away, he shot at her with his pistol. The first shots missed her and made glancing marks in the snow. Finally his shots hit her. One ricocheting bullet lodged in her elbow and one bullet went through her back and through her lungs. The tread on the soles of his boots left their imprint as he walked toward Stacy, but then he left while she was still alive. She lived for about 1 to IV2 hours and then died alone in the cold.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b850-9\">The trial court described the defendant in this case in the findings of the court in considering the death penalty:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-10\">The defendant, male Caucasian, was born January 18,1957.

He attempted to enlist in the armed forces, but was rejected because of physical problems caused by polio during his early childhood. He went to work ... at 16 years of age, but was involved in an industrial accident and the tips of his fingers were cut off. When his fingers healed, the defendant went to work with his uncle and his father and later his brother in the drywall construction business. The defendant is considered an excellent craftsman.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-13\">The defendant describes his interests as fishing and boating and reading \u201cfantasy\u201d novels.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-14\">The defendant denies any serious relationships or romantic ties with women, although he has numerous female friends.

For ease of reference, I append a summary of the cases I have compared.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-8\">The cases I find most similar to this one so far as the crime is concerned are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-9\">1. <em>State v. Pizzuto </em>(death penalty imposed)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-10\">2. <em>State v. Searcy </em>(fixed life imposed)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-11\">3. <em>State v.

On the basis of this comparison of these case in which the crime was similar to the murder in this case, I find the death sentence imposed on Rhoades in this case not to be excessive or disproportionate.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-20\">The cases I find most similar to this one so far as the defendant is concerned are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-21\">1. <em>State v.
