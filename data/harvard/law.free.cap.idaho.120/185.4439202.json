(Clements) planted a crop of lima beans, with seeds which had been acquired from Shields Seed Company (Shields), a seed warehouse in Nampa, Idaho, who had purchased them from defendant appellant Ben Fish &amp; Son (Ben Fish). The crop failed to mature before the growing season ended, and thereafter Clements brought this action against Shields and Ben Fish alleging breach of implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose. The trial court found that Ben Fish had breached an implied warranty of fitness and rendered judgment in favor of Clements against Ben Fish. Ben Fish appealed this ruling to the Court of Appeals, which affirmed the decision of the district court. We granted Ben Fish\u2019s petition for review of the opinion of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">The issues in this case are framed by a series of transactions involving Ben Fish, a California seed producer; Clements, a Canyon County farmer; and Shields, a seed warehouse. The seed producer, Ben Fish, is a California enterprise which has developed numerous strains of proprietary lima bean seed to meet various agricultural needs. In order to test its products in differing climates, Ben Fish distributed its seed through warehouses in various parts of the country. Prior to 1985, Ben Fish sold one of its bean seed strains, known as GBL 8-78, to Shields for test growing in Idaho. Those prior seed crops had matured. Shields contracted with Clements to grow a lima bean seed crop from the GBL 8-78 seed. This crop did not mature. The following chronology describes the events leading up to this lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">On March 6, 1985, Clements entered into a contract with Shields, entitled \u201cContract for the Growing of Commercial Beans,\u201d in which Clements agreed to plant 9600 pounds of G-78 baby lima bean seed \u201cas the bailee of said seeds,\u201d and to plant those seeds on a particular 80 acres described in the contract, and to care for the crop, harvest the same, and to deliver back to Shields the harvested product which would meet certain conditions concerning quality, etc. Clements was to be paid $21.00 per hundredweight for those beans which met the contract standards. The contract provided that \u201ctitle and ownership of said beans to be grown under this contract shall at all times remain with Shields____\u201d The contract was a typical bailment/seed contract similar to contracts which this Court has had occasion to consider in the past. <em>See Washburn Wilson Seed Co. v. Alexie, </em>54 Idaho 727, 35 P.2d 990 (1934); <em>Smith v. Washburn Wilson Seed Co., </em>40 Idaho 191, 232 P. 574 (1925); <em>Thiel v. Pacific Fruit &amp; Produce Co., </em>51 Idaho 145, 4 P.2d 356 (1931); <em>Peterson v. Conida Warehouses, Inc., </em>98 Idaho 883, 575 P.2d 481 (1978); <em>Chapman v. Haney Seed Co., Inc., </em>102 Idaho 26, 624 P.2d 408 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-12\">The contract further provided that responsibility for any crop failure was Clements\u2019, and in the event of such failure Clements would pay Shields $37.00 per hundredweight for the seed stock furnished. The contract further contained a disclaimer by Shields of any warranties, express or implied, concerning the seeds furnished pursuant to the bailment contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-13\">Pursuant to that bailment contract, Shields delivered the seed to Clements on May 8, 1985. However, before the seed had been planted, Clements learned that Shields was in financial difficulty. Discussions ensued between Clements and Shields over whether Shields would be financially able to purchase the harvested crop in the fall. When these discussions did not satisfy Clements\u2019 concerns, it communicated directly with Ben Fish, the seed producer in California, exploring the possibility of a direct purchase agreement between Clem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>ents and Ben Fish that would avoid any risk of a future default by the Shields warehouse. Ben Fish\u2019s president flew to Idaho and met with Clements. As a result of those negotiations, Shields and Clements voided their March 6, 1985, contract on May 29, 1985, and Ben Fish and Clements signed a new contract on the same day, entitled \u201cBean Contract,\u201d consisting of an agreement typewritten on Ben Fish\u2019s letterhead. This new contract provided that Clements would plant, cultivate and harvest 80 acres of GBL 8-78 lima bean seed \u201cwith stock seed furnished by you at Shields Warehouse Co., Nampa, Idaho____\u201d Unlike the Shields contract, this was not a bailment contract by which title to the bean crop remained in Ben Fish, but was rather a contract whereby Clements agreed to plant, cultivate and harvest GBL 8-78 stock seed, and Ben Fish agreed to purchase the crop of beans which conformed to the U.S. No. 1 grade standards and other conditions. Delivery was to be at the warehouse of Shields of Idaho. In the event that Shields was no longer operating, the agreement required Clements to deliver the beans at Triangle Bean at Homedale, Idaho.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">The agreement which Clements signed further provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-8\">This agreement when accepted by you [Ben Fish] shall constitute a contract between us. There are no agreements or understandings regarding the subject matter of this agreement other than expressed above.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">The contract was written on Ben Fish <em>&amp; </em>Son letterhead. Immediately between the letterhead and the beginning of the \u201cBean Contract,\u201d and not surrounded by any other typing, was the following disclaimer which was written in smaller print than was contained in the balance of the contract:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-10\">Ben Fish &amp; Son warrants to the extent of the purchase price that seeds sold are as recognized on the container within recognized tolerances. Seller gives no further warranty, express or implied.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-13\">This new Clements/Ben Fish contract was signed on May 29,1985. The seed had already been delivered to Clements by Shields on May 8, 1985, pursuant to the original Shields/Clements contract; however, the seed had not yet been planted when the Shields contract was voided and the new contract with Ben Fish was signed on May 29, 1985. As the evidence later would show, the GBL 8-78 seed had an unusually slow maturation rate, rendering it more susceptible than most seed strains to crop loss in the event of a short growing season. The district court found that this unusual characteristic was not disclosed to Clements by Shields or by Ben Fish. Rather, the trial court found that Clements was simply advised by Ben Fish at the negotiations on May 29th to \u201cget [the bean seed] in the ground as soon as possible.\u201d After preparing a field for cultivation, Clements planted the GBL 8-78 seed in mid-June. The crop was ultimately lost because of frost before it had matured.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-14\">Clements brought this action against Shields and the seed producer, Ben Fish, seeking reimbursement for money spent in attempting to grow the ill-fated crop. The case against the warehouse, Shields, was dismissed prior to trial. With respect to Ben Fish, Clements asserted a breach of an implied warranty of fitness under the Uniform Commercial Code. Clements alleged that Ben Fish had represented the seed to be capable of maturing into a harvestable crop. Following a bench trial, the district court rendered judgment in favor of Clements against Ben Fish for compensatory damages and attorney fees. Ben Fish appealed, and the Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision. We granted review of the Court of Appeals decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-15\">Regarding our standard of review, where a case comes to us on a petition for review from the Court of Appeals, we review the opinion of the district court directly. While we accord the views of our Court of Appeals serious consideration, we are not bound by those views. <em>State ex rel. Evans v. Barnett, </em>116 Idaho 429, 776 P.2d 438 (1989). Additionally, the determi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>nation of a contract\u2019s meaning and legal effect are questions of law to be decided by the court where the contract is clear and unambiguous. <em>Galaxy Outdoor Advertising, Inc. v. Idaho Trans. Dept., </em>109 Idaho 692, 710 P.2d 602 (1985). On issues of law, this Court exercises free review. <em>Moses v. Idaho State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>118 Idaho 676, 799 P.2d 964 (1990); <em>Safeco Ins. Co. of America v. Yon, </em>118 Idaho 367, 796 P.2d 1040 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">We first address the trial court\u2019s holding that the Clements/Ben Fish contract was a contract of bailment<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and gave rise to an implied warranty of fitness by Ben Fish which was breached. Ben Fish argues that the May 29, 1985, contract between it and Clements was not a bailment contract. The Court of Appeals neither confirmed nor denied the trial court\u2019s bailment finding, stating simply that \u201cwe do not think the bailment controversy controls this ease,\u201d and affirmed the trial court on the alternative rationale that, while the U.C.C. did not apply directly to the contract, by analogy the remedies of the U.C.C. were available to Clements.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">First, it is clear that, unlike the original Shields/Clements contract, the Clements/Ben Fish contract was not a bailment/seed contract. Both the contract and the evidentiary record before us reveal that Clements was not a bailee of the bean seed <em>vis-a-vis </em>Ben Fish. The Clements/Ben Fish contract makes no reference either to bailment or to the title to the seed. The evidence in the record is uncontroverted that the seed, while initially produced by Ben Fish, was sold to Shields, who then delivered it to Clements on May 8, 1985, pursuant to the Shields/Clements bailment contract which was subsequently voided. While the Clements/Ben Fish contract does refer to \u201cstock seed furnished by you [Ben Fish] at Shields Warehouse Co., Nampa, Idaho,\u201d the uncontroverted facts are that, while Ben Fish initially furnished the seed to Shields, Clements received the seed from Shields pursuant to its March 6, 1985, bailment contract which was void on May 29, 1985. Clements received the seed from Shields on May 8,1985, was always in possession of it, and would no doubt have planted the seed pursuant to its contract with Shields had not Clements become concerned about Shields\u2019 ability to perform because of its financial problems. Thus, on May 29, 1985, when Shields\u2019 and Clements voided the March 6, 1985, contract, and when Clements and Ben Fish entered into their bean seed contract on that same day, Clements was agreeing to plant and harvest lima bean seed which it already had in its possession, and Ben Fish was agreeing to buy the harvested crop under the terms and conditions set out in the bean contract. The bean contract between Clements and Ben Fish was not a bailment contract, and the district court erred in treating it as such.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-11\">Based on that record, appellant Ben Fish asserts two main issues on appeal. Ben Fish first contends that there is no support for the trial court\u2019s finding that there was created an implied warranty of fitness from Ben Fish in favor of Clements, since Ben Fish was in essence the purchaser and not the seller under the May 29, 1985, contract. Secondly, Ben Fish argues that even if it were a seller under the bean contract, the contract has an express disclaimer of any warranty, express or implied. On this latter issue, we agree with appellant\u2019s argument and therefore vacate the decision of the Court of Appeals and reverse the decision of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-12\">Under the U.C.C., \u00a7 28-2-316, parties to a sales contract may effectively disclaim any warranties by an appropriate disclaimer in the contract. The trial court acknowledged the disclaimer, but concluded that the disclaimer contained in the Clements/Ben Fish contract was not sufficiently conspicuous and therefore did not meet the requirements of the U.C.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-13\">The U.C.C. provides that a warranty disclaimer is conspicuous when \u201cit is so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>written that a reasonable person against whom it is to operate ought to have noticed it.\u201d <em>I. C. </em>\u00a7 28-1-201(10). A disclaimer in a contract is conspicuous \u201cif it is in larger or other contrasting type or color.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cWhether a term or clause is \u2018conspicuous\u2019 or not is a question for the court.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 28-1-201(10). <em>Farmer v. International Harvester Company, </em>97 Idaho 742, 558 P.2d 1306 (1976). With respect to the disclaimer in this case, the trial court merely stated: \u201cIt is in fine print under the letter head at the top of the page. It is not conspicuous as required by the statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Fine print of itself, however, does not render a disclaimer inconspicuous. The statute says that disclaimers in \u201ccontrasting\u201d type are conspicuous; the statute does not say the type must be both contrasting and larger. Nor does the fact that the disclaimer is \u201cunder the letterhead,\u201d but above the body of the contract, detract from its conspicuousness; on the contrary, in this case it amplifies its visibility and increases the likelihood of discovery. The disclaimer is located in the middle of the front page of the contract and is set off by indentation. It is short, direct, and is not surrounded by any other language. We believe a reasonable person would have noticed the disclaimer and accordingly we hold that it was conspicuous. <em>Farmer v. International Harvester Company, </em>97 Idaho 742, 553 P.2d 1306 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">Additionally, the written portion of the contract, immediately preceding the signatures, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-9\">This agreement when accepted by you [Ben Fish] shall constitute a contract between us. There are no agreements or understandings regarding the subject matter of this agreement other than expressed above.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">There is nothing in the agreement which suggests that, in the event that Clements was not successful in raising a crop of beans which met the standards set out in the contract, Ben Fish would reimburse Clements for its expenses in attempting to raise the crop.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-11\">Accordingly, we hold that, based upon our independent review of the written contract and uncontroverted evidence in the record, the \u201cbean contract\u201d effectively disclaimed the implied warranty of fitness claimed by Clements. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment in favor of Clements is reversed and the cause remanded with directions to enter judgment in favor of appellant Ben Fish.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b223-12\">Costs to appellant.

A copy of the contract is attached as Appendix A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b222-6\">. Our prior cases indicate that a bailment seed contract occurs when a seed warehouse delivers seed to a farmer, retaining the title to the seed, under a contract by which the farmer agrees to grow the seed, usually to certain stated standards, and then redelivers the crop back to the seedman who, under the contract, retains title to both the original seed and the resulting crop.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b223-6\">. Since we have found the disclaimer in this case to be conspicuous within the meaning of the statute, we need not address the issue raised by Ben Fish that, under the May 29, 1985, contract with Clements, it was a buyer, rather than a seller, and therefore no implied covenant under the U.C.C., or by analogy, could occur.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"AFgU\">BISTLINE, Justice,</author>\n<p id=\"Ar_\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"AHH\">PART I.</p>\n<p id=\"AY11\">Narrowing down the factual scenario as portrayed in the Court\u2019s opinion to those necessary for a determination, there exists no reason for including Shields Seed Company. The legal relationship here pertinent involves only <em>two </em>parties and culminated in the signing of a written agreement entered into by only those <em>two </em>entities, Clements Farms, Inc., an Idaho corporation, and Ben Fish &amp; Son, which may or may not have been incorporated. The contents of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>written agreement, titled \u201cBean Contract,\u201d of May 29, 1985, spelled out the terms agreed upon, and those determine the exact nature of the relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">As the Court\u2019s opinion points out, prior to the two party contract of May 29 between Clements and Fish, there was a prior agreement between Clements and Shields, which the majority concludes was a \u201cbailment,\u201d all of which amounts to nothing more than an historical footnote. Clements was identified therein as the \u201cgrower\u201d and also as the \u201cbailee\u201d of the seed which Shields was obtaining from Ben Fish. Clements, as grower-bailee, was agreeing to take those seeds, to plant, cultivate, and harvest the crop. As noted, apparently on Shield\u2019s directions the Ben Fish stock seed had been shipped to Clements. The Clements/Shields contract referred to Clements \u201cas the bailee of said seeds,\u201d which were further described therein as consisting of \u201c9600 pounds of G-78 baby lima bean seed.\u201d The majority correctly states that the contract which involved those parties was mutually voided on May 29, 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">An entirely new transaction between Ben Fish and Clements was entered into, resulting in a written contract which is attached to the Court\u2019s opinion, and identified at trial as Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit 3. The Chief Justice declares this contract to not be a contract of bailment. Today, in authoring the opinion for the Court, the Chief Justice <em>could </em>suggest and urge the overruling of prior seedmen contract cases which were judicially construed as bailments. I would agree, and together we should be able to scrounge up a third vote.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Beyond that point, the Court\u2019s opinion is a conglomeration of errors and unfounded and/or unnecessary statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-12\">The language of the new contract, consisting of six paragraphs, could not have been more specific. It was short, to the point, and explicitly clear. The first three of the six paragraphs of the contract spelled out exactly what Clements would be agreeing to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-13\">(1) To raise for Ben Fish 80 acres of seed beans on Clements\u2019 land at Nampa, Idaho.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-14\">(2) To properly prepare and plant in 1985 such stock seed furnished by you [Ben Fish] at Shields Warehouse, Nam-pa, Idaho; to properly care for, cultivate and harvest the crop so as to secure the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>greatest return of quality beans, and to deliver all beans to your [Ben Fish] account at the Shields Warehouse, Inc. at Nampa, Idaho.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-4\">(3) To deliver all of said harvested beans in sound merchantable condition, ... you [Ben Fish] agree to pay the cleaning, storage and other warehouse charges.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">The fourth paragraph stated that Clements\u2019 share of the net proceeds of the venture would be computed at the rate of $21 per hundred pounds of marketable beans delivered according to the conditions of the contract. The fifth paragraph was a direction to Clements which would become effective on the contingency of Shields being out of operation at delivery time, in which event \u201cthe beans are to be delivered to Triangle Bean at Homedale.\u201d The sixth and concluding paragraph was a short statement that, \u201cThis agreement shall constitute a contract between us. There are no agreements or understandings regarding the subject matter of the agreement other than expressed above.\u201d There were no other paragraphs. The agreement was duly executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">Exactly that which I wrote thirteen years ago in <em>Peterson, </em>is again applicable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-7\">The parties essentially have entered into a joint venture, with the seed company supplying the seed beans, and the grower, here the Grimms, supplying the land in which the beans may be planted, together with all the labor which goes into planting, cultivating, harvesting, and hauling to the warehouse.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-8\"><em>Peterson, </em>98 Idaho at 888, 575 P.2d at 486.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The 1922 Supreme Court reached the conelusion in <em>D.M. Ferry &amp; Co. v. Smith, </em>36 Idaho 67, 209 P. 1066 (1922), that such an arrangement constituted a bailment, which was accomplished by taking the easy path of relying upon a similar Montana case. Of importance, the court did give consideration to the fact that the \u201cbailee\u201d was entitled to compensation, and ruled \u201caltogether immaterial\u201d whether that compensation was fixed at a definite sum of money, or a share of the net proceeds of the adventure, or was to be computed upon the product of the undertaking. The case upon which it placed sole reliance was another <em>D.M. Ferry </em>case which came out of the Montana Supreme Court, and two excerpts out of 6 Corpus Juris, at 1096 and 1139. <em>D.M. Ferry &amp; Co. v. Forquer, </em>61 Mont. 336, 202 P. 193, 195 (1921).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-12\">Applicable here from the Montana opinion, as adopted and utilized by the 1922 Idaho Supreme Court, is the statement that the compensation of the grower of the bean seeds \u201cis computed upon the product of the [joint] undertaking,\u201d or, equally valid, that the grower\u2019s compensation would be a share of the net proceeds of the joint venture.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> 36 Idaho at 73, 209 P. at 1067.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-13\">In the instant case Clements, had there been a marketable product, would have received as his compensation the contractually stipulated $21 per hundred weight. Of course, there was no product, and that was the heart of the lawsuit: to fix onto Ben Fish liability for the loss suffered by Clements by expending its money, time, and effort in attempting to raise for Ben Fish a crop which could not be nurtured to frui<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>tion, and accordingly should not have been planted, all of which was known to Ben Fish but not to Clements. The district court\u2019s decision was rendered by means of court-prepared findings of fact as augmented by a supplemental Memorandum of the same date:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-4\">The above cause came before the Court for trial without a jury on June 30 and July 1, 1987.

The contract creates a bailment. <em>Kent v. Campbell, </em>80 Idaho 57, 324 P.2d 399 [398] (1958). Under such conditions Ben Fish has the duty to know the growing season for the area to which the seed is being sent for planting and to supply a seed which has a reasonable chance to produce a crop. In the case at bar, seed was provided which had little chance of bearing a crop. This is tantamount to a breach of implied warranty of fitness. Idaho Code \u00a7 28-2-315 should be applied in this bailment case. The Idaho Supreme Court has noted that in proper circumstances the implied warranty of fitness should be extended to equipment leases. <em>All-States Leasing v. Bass, </em>96 Idaho 873, 538 P.2d 1177 (1975). <em>See also Glen [Glenn </em>] <em>Dick Equipment Co. v. Galey Const. Co., </em>97 Idaho 216, 541 P.2d 1184 (1975). The case at bar is one in which it is appropriate to extend the warranty to a bailment. See Anno: 4 A.L.R. 4th 85 <em>et seq. </em>Without question Ben Fish was in the best position to know and did know the growing time for its seed. Since Ben Fish should have known the available growing season in the Nampa area, under the circumstances of this case Ben Fish should bear the risk and consequence of a crop failure caused by lack of available growing season to produce a crop. The new contract signed by Plaintiff and Ben Fish is silent regarding which party takes the risk of a crop failure for any cause. The contract provides Clements will properly care for, cultivate and harvest the crop. Clements did care for and cultivate the crop. He did not harvest the crop because it was destroyed by the weather. The crop did not mature because the wrong seed was supplied in the first place and as the Court has held Ben Fish should have the risk of loss for that crop failure under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>Implied warranties of suitability can be disclaimed but courts tend \u2018to construe strictly language negating the implication of such a warranty.\u2019 <em>Glen [Glenn </em>] <em>Dick, supra </em>at p. 225 [541 P.2d 1184]. A disclaimer does appear on the parties\u2019 contract. Plaintiff\u2019s exhibit 3. It is in fine print under the letter head at the top of the page. It is not conspicuous as required by the statute. Idaho Code 28-2-316(2); nor does the disclaimer \u2018make it plain\u2019 that an implied warranty has been disclaimed. <em>Lee v.

Smith District Judge</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-8\">FOOTNOTE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-9\">See also 8 C.J.S. Bailments, Sec. 3(7), pp. 345 and 346; 8 Am.Jur.2d, Bailments, Sec. 38, p. 773. Such a contract was also held to constitute a bailment in <em>D.M. Ferry and Co. v. Smith, </em>36 Idaho 67, 209 Pac. 1066 (1922). The same position was expressed in <em>Smith v. Washbum-Wilson Seed Co., </em>40 Idaho 191, 232 Pac. 574 (1925). However, in a case where the interest of a landlord in a share cropping interest conflicted with the interest of a bailor who provided the seed to the tenant, the court overruled <em>Ferry v. Smith (supra). Washbum-Wilson Seed Co. v. Alexie, </em>54 Idaho 727, 35,P.2d 990 (1934). On the other hand in <em>Kent v. Campbell, </em>80 Idaho 57, 324 P.2d 398 (1958) the court again utilized the bailment theory. In <em>Peterson v. Conida Warehouses, Inc., </em>98 Idaho 883, 575 P.2d 481 (1978), the court again had to resolve conflicting interests arising between a crop sharing contractor and a seed providing bailor. The court then relied on <em>Washbum-Wilson Seed Co. v. Alexie </em>as being on all fours but declined an invitation by counsel to overrule <em>Kent v. Campbell. </em>However, two justices in <em>Alexie </em>severely attacked <em>Kent v. Campbell </em>believing it should be overruled. In <em>Chapman v. Haney Seed Co., </em>102 Idaho 26, 624 P.2d 408 (1981), the Supreme Court again declined an opportunity to overrule <em>Kent v. Campbell. </em>Hence, <em>the court having found no later cases has concluded Kent v. Campbell is still the law in Idaho.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-11\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b229-12\">The entire thrust and <em>ratio decidendi </em>of today\u2019s opinion by the Court is found in language which belongs more to a revival meeting: <em>\u201cWe believe </em>a reasonable person would have noticed the disclaimer____\u201d at 189, 814 P.2d at 921. In those ten words, four-appellate judges reject the meticulously written decision of the district judge. As happens more often than not, when the Chief Justice authors an opinion, that opinion immediately garners a majority, and thus the belief of the Chief Justice becomes the belief of four justices. Today four justices, each acting with reason, declare that they would have noticed the purported disclaimer \u2014 notwithstanding that it did <em>not </em>appear in the body of the contract and there was no language in the body of the contract incorporating it by reference. Moreover, the we-believers necessarily must also <em>believe </em>that the disclaimer is not just a free standing disclaimer as to any and all warranties, but is as to a specific warranty of fitness.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-15\">Unfortunately the four justices are remiss in failing to understand that this Court is <em>not </em>a fact-finding body. This Court sits to determine whether the lower trial courts have committed error. Fact finding is not the province of appellate courts. This Court nevertheless presumes itself authorized to decide a factual issue, namely whether or not Clements should have noticed the purported disclaimer. In so doing it errs grievously. When a jury has not been requested, the district court becomes the trier of fact. To Judge Smith, in the instant case fell, the obligation to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>decide from the evidence whether Ben Fish &amp; Son carried its burden of establishing that it had called Clement's attention to the purported disclaimer, or that the notice of disclaimer was reasonably conspicuous and should have been noticed. To the contrary, and not mounting to the level of conspicuous, and rather <em>in extremely fine print </em>appearing below the letterhead but above the word CONTRACT was the purported disclaimer.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">Moreover, the district judge, and he alone where there was no jury involvement, is the finder of fact, in which capacity he uses the ordinary common sense and knowledge which any juror as a fact finder would do. Yet, here we have four appellate justices taking it upon themselves to usurp the function of the trial court as the fact finder, and supplant his decision with their own notions of what a reasonable person would observe on reading plaintiffs Exhibit 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">The majesty of the majority opinion is found at 188, 814 P.2d at 920, where it is stated that Ben Fish\u2019s contract, a printed form with blanks provided for writing in names, contains an express disclaimer of any warranty, express or implied. The majority continues \u201cbelieving,\u201d and, accordingly \u201cagreeing,\u201d that Clements is chargeable with being put on notice of the purported disclaimer. Conceding to a lack of knowing all of the contents of the five hundred seventy-seven pages of the Uniform Commercial Code, which comprises all of Volume 5A of the Idaho Code, I am not unaware of subparagraph (10) of I.C. \u00a7 28-1-201. Believing it to be in the interest of justice and hoping to attract the attention of the three justices who may not have found time to peruse the transcripts and clerk\u2019s record, subparagraph (10) has been reduced to equal the size of the print which comprises the Ben Fish &amp; Son disclaimer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-6\">(10) \"ConapicuouB1\u2019: A term or cl&amp;uso b conspicuous when it is <em>do </em>written that a reasonable person ogalnot whom it b to operate ought to have noticed it. A printed heading In capitals (as: NON-NEGOTIABLE BILL OF LADING) Is conspicuous. Language in tho body of a form ui \u201cconspicuous\u201d if It U in larger or other contrasting typo or color. But in a telegram any stated term is \u201cconspicuous.\u201d Whether a term or clause \u00a13 \u201cconspicuous\u201d or not la for decision by the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">I.C. \u00a7 28-1-201(10).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">The greater majesty of the majority opinion is the cavalier manner in which it discounts Judge Smith\u2019s ruling that the purported disclaimer notice was inoperative because of the exceptionally fine print which rendered it not conspicuous. The Court seeks to accomplish this objective by reading into I.C. \u00a7 28-1-201(10) its <em>belief </em>that the section properly reads that a purported disclaimer will be considered \u201cconspicuous\u201d if it is in larger eye-catching letters, <em>and also if it is found in unreadable small print which is smaller than the body of the contract.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">Idaho Code \u00a7 28-1-201(10) simply does not authorize disclaimers utilizing very small lower case print, no matter what style of type, to fulfill the function of being conspicuous. The drafters did not leave to chance the ingenuity of clever minds. Idaho Code 28-1-201(10) provides an example of what amounts to being conspicuous: \u201cA printed heading in capitals (as NON-NEGOTIABLE BILL OF LADING) is conspicuous.\u201d To be somehow otherwise conspicuous, the same section (10) does allow that language appearing within the body of a form is \u201cconspicuous\u201d if such disclaiming language is in larger or other contrasting type or color. But in no way does subsection (10) state, suggest, or intimate that a disclaimer appearing in exceedingly small letters fulfills the requirement of being conspicuous to the same extent that capital letters do. It is statutory law which both requires and allows that capital letters serve the function of being conspicuous. In the case at hand there is no involvement of different colored ink, and but one single piece of paper is involved and it is blank on the reverse side. The letterhead, the purported disclaimer, and the heading <em>CONTRACT axe </em>all in black, and all on one side of a single sheet of paper. The \u201ccontract\u201d itself discloses at a glance that there are not contained therein, meaning in the body of the text, any words which in any way contrast with one another. The Court finds itself tampering with a statute, not a rule of the Court, and in so doing not only committing error, but doing a disservice to the district court and an injustice to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>Judge Smith correctly ruled that the purported disclaimer \u201cis not conspicuous as required by the statute.\u201d The Court\u2019s opinion acknowledges reading that conclusion, at 188, 814 P.2d at 920, and dismisses Judge Smith\u2019s finding and conclusion with a most outstanding pairing of an <em>ipse dixit </em>and a <em>non sequitur:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-5\">Fine print of itself, however, does not render a disclaimer inconspicuous. The statute says that disclaimers in \u2018contrasting\u2019 type are conspicuous; the statute does not say the type must be both contrasting and larger. Nor does the fact that the disclaimer is \u2018under the letterhead,\u2019 but above the body of the contract, detract from its conspicuousness; on the contrary, in this case it amplifies its visibility and increases the likelihood of discovery. The disclaimer is located in the middle of the front page of the contract and is set off by indentation. It is short, direct, and is not surrounded by other language. We believe a reasonable person would have noticed the disclaimer and accordingly we hold that it was conspicuous.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">The first sentence of that paragraph should gain a place in history as the most classic nullity flowing from an appellate review. Judge Smith had no concern as to whether fine print rendered a disclaimer <em>inconspicuous. </em>The Uniform Commercial Code likewise shows no concern for that which is <em>inconspicuous. </em>That word is not to be found in I.C. \u00a7 28-1-201(10). That Idaho statute deals with that which <em>is </em>conspicuous, and whether sufficiently so as to fulfill that requirement with regard to a disclaimer, the successful use of which may free a seller, a lessor, or a joint venturer furnishing unfit seeds, from liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">The second sentence which follows is equally nonpersuasive. Foremost, it is lacking in any HEADING which might possibly, and certainly not probably, bring to anyone\u2019s attention that it purports to be a disclaimer as to warranties. This, too, was not by the drafters of I.C. \u00a7 28-1-201(10) left to chance and man\u2019s ingenuity. The statute speaks in terms of what will be considered \u201cconspicuous\u201d insofar as there may be a claimed defense of disclaimer. The statute requires a heading. The statute is definite that a heading in capital letters be provided, and allows that the use of capital letters will fulfill the function of being conspicuous.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">This Court\u2019s opinion very carefully avoids any discussion of, or even mention of, the subsection (10) language providing that a printed HEADING in capitals is the first and foremost manner of evidencing some kind of an honest intent to call out to the reader, \u201ckindly observe our disclaimer policy.\u201d Various editions of dictionaries provide the definition of \u201cheading\u201d as: \u201cAn inscription, headline, or title standing at the top or beginning (as of a letter or a chapter).\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s New Collegiate Dictionary </em>(1977); <em>American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language </em>(1977). Subsection (10) also provides that \u201clanguage in the body of a form is \u2018conspicuous\u2019 if it is larger or other contrasting type or color,\u201d which statement is carefully not mentioned in the majority opinion. The reason is obvious, there simply is no use of contrasting or colored type in the body of the agreement. There simply is not any compliance with the statutory requirement provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-10\">The strongest point being promoted by the Court in attempting to justify its result is that the disclaimer is located in the middle of the front page of the contract and is set off by indentation. If there had been a capital letter disclaimer heading, and unless that disclaimer heading was directly <em>below </em>the two words \u201cBean Contract,\u201d it still \u201cis not within the four corners of the contract\u201d as years ago I heard older, wiser attorneys say.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-11\">Where the majority has already portrayed its rationale by diverting attention to what might be <em>inconspicuous, </em>it has also gone far afield in another negative statement as meaningless and brings little credit for being uttered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-12\">There is nothing in the agreement which suggests that, in the event that Clements was not successful in raising a crop of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>beans which met the standards set out in the contract, Ben Fish would reimburse Clements for its expenses in attempting to raise the crop.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">At 189, 814 P.2d at 921. The Clement\u2019s law suit, as pleaded and pursued at trial, neither alleged nor pursued such a claim as the basis for relief. The claim based liability for the reasons which the district court provided as set forth herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">PART II.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">In mounting an attack on the validity of the Court\u2019s opinion, it is in order to first observe the attack which it makes against Judge Smith\u2019s holding that the Clements/Ben Fish contract was one of bailment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-7\">We first address the trial court's holding that the Clements/Ben Fish contract was a contract of bailment and gave rise to an implied warranty of fitness by Ben Fish which was breached. Ben Fish argues that the May 29, 1985, contract between it and Clements was not a bailment contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-8\">First, it is clear that, unlike the original Shields/Clement contract, the Clements/Ben Fish contract was not a bailment/seed contract. Both the contract and the evidentiary record before us reveal that Clements was not a bailee of the bean seed vis-a-vis Ben Fish. The Clements/Ben Fish contract makes no reference either to bailment or to the title to the seed. [The evidence in the record is uncontroverted that the seed, while initially produced by Ben Fish, was sold to Shields, who then delivered it to Clements on May 8, 1985, pursuant to the Shields/Clements bailment contract which was subsequently voided. While the Clements/Ben Fish contract does refer to 'stock seed furnished by you [Ben Fish] at Shields Warehouse Co., Nampa, Idaho,\u2019 the uncontroverted facts are that, while Ben Fish initially furnished the seed to Shields, Clements received the seed from Shields pursuant to its March 6,1985, bailment contract which was void on May 29, 1985. Clements received the seed from Shields on May 8, 1985, was always in possession of it, and would no doubt have planted the seed pursuant to its contract with Shields had not Clements become concerned about Shields\u2019 ability to perform because of its financial problems.] Thus, on May 29, 1985, when Shields and Clements voided the March 6, 1985, contract, and when Clements and Ben Fish entered into their bean seed contract on that same day, Clements was agreeing to plant and harvest lima bean seed which it already had in its possession, and <em>Ben Fish was agreeing to buy the harvested crop </em>under the terms and conditions set out in the bean contract. The bean contract between Clements and Ben Fish was not a bailment contract, and the district court erred in treating it as such.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-10\">At 187-188, 814 P.2d at 919-920 (brackets supplied; emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-11\">ONE JUSTICE\u2019S ANALYSIS OF THE FOREGOING PARAGRAPHS</p>\n<p id=\"b232-12\">It is readily agreed that the Clements/Fish contract makes no reference or mention of the words \u201cbailment\u201d or of title to the seed. However, wholly immaterial and totally irrelevant is any mention or discussion of the voided, and thus rendered for naught, Shields/Clements contract. All of that above set out which I have enclosed in brackets amounts to nothing but superfluous filler, which is equally true of the full content of the second and third paragraphs at 188-189, 814 P.2d at 918-919.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-13\">The Chief Justice gets back on track with the statement that Clements had possession of the stock seed, it having been delivered to Clements on the direction of the owner, namely, Ben Fish &amp; Son, at a time when Ben Fish was contemplating a sale of the stock seed to Shields. That is correct and occurred when Shields and Clements had put together their negotiations for Clements to raise the seed as Shields\u2019 bailee, which did result in a contract, but which contract was later mutually voided and canceled. Purely extraneous to the underlying issue is the Chief Justice\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>hypothetical beliefs as to what might have happened except for the mutual voiding of the Shields/Clements contract. The Chief Justice then resumes with this statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Au2\">Thus, on May 29, 1985, when Shields and Clements voided the March 6, 1985, contract, and when Clements and Ben Fish entered into their bean seed contract on that same day, Clements was agreeing to plant the harvest lima bean seed which it already had in its possession, and <em>Ben Fish was agreeing to buy the harvested crop </em>under the terms and conditions set out in the bean contract. The bean contract between Clements and Ben Fish was <em>not </em>a bailment contract, and the district court erred in treating it as such.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AOzp\">At 188, 814 P.2d at 920 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">FURTHER ANALYSIS BY ONE JUSTICE</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">The choice of words in the paragraph directly above, however, is definitely not correct and is misleading. Clements may have had the stock seed in his possession, but it was not Clements\u2019 stock seed. That stock seed was the property of Ben Fish. The Chief Justice misleads himself, and three other learned justices in the process, with his statement that \u201cBen Fish was agreeing <em>to buy </em>the harvested crop____\u201d There is no validity whatever in that statement. No such language or anything faintly resembling that language is to be found in the contract. <em>Why would Ben Fish agree to purchase the product of his own stock seed? </em>No reason, and <em>a fortiori, </em>Ben Fish did not. To the contrary, Ben Fish, by the agreement which is drafted on his own letterhead stationery, exacted from Clements an agreement which obligated the latter to obtain possession and control of Ben Fish\u2019s stock seed for the sole purpose of sowing it in Clements\u2019 80 acres. That supply of stock seed which Clements would be furnished probably was, even as the Chief Justice asserts, then in storage which, by happenstance, was the Shields\u2019 warehouse. However, Shields, of course, was no longer involved, having entered into a mutual cancellation voiding the contract that Shields at one time had with Clements, which explains why the Ben Fish stock seed happened to be in the Shields warehouse when the Clement/Shields contract was canceled and the Ben Fish/Clements contract was executed. If the seed, or any part of it, had been <em>sold </em>to Shields in exchange for currency, later, on the mutually agreed cancellation of the Clements/Shields contract any money which Shields might have paid to Ben Fish would have been returned. The appellant\u2019s brief purports to state what the controversy is over:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-10\">This is an action for the loss of a lima bean seed crop to have been grown by the plaintiff during the crop year 1985. Initially the plaintiff contracted with Shields of Idaho, Inc. to grow the lima bean crop for Shields of Idaho, Inc. with seed purchased by Shields of Idaho, Inc., from the defendant. When the plaintiff learned that Shields of Idaho, Inc., was in financial distress, he refused to perform his contract to grow this seed for Shields of Idaho, Inc. Later, the Shields contract was voided and the plaintiff contracted with the defendant to grow the seed crop from the seed it had purchased from Shields of Idaho, Inc. The seed crop failed to mature and the plaintiff brought this action against the defendant, advancing several theories, including breach of implied warranty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-11\">Excerpt from the Appellant, Ben Fish <em>&amp; </em>Son\u2019s, opening brief, at 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-12\">The appellant\u2019s closing brief <em>purports </em>to restate and enhance what it had stated in the opening brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-13\">The [Ben Fish/Clements] contract, plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit 3, signed by the parties was not a bailment contract but was simply a contract for the sale and purchase of the 1985 lima bean crop of the plaintiff to the defendant. The seed which was planted [by Clements] was sold by the defendant [Ben Fish] to Shields of Idaho, Inc. The seed was not sold by the defendant [Ben Fish] to the plaintiff [Clements]. This contract is unlike that in <em>Kent v. Campbell, supra. </em>The defendant did not have title to the seed used. Title had previously passed to Shields of Idaho, Inc., when at an earlier time it was sold by defendant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>Shields of Idaho, Inc. [In turn title to the seed passed to the plaintiff when plaintiff purchased it from Shields of Idaho, Inc.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Excerpt from Appellant, Ben Fish &amp; Son\u2019s, brief, at 12. It is a simplistic factual scenario.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">The excerpts from the two briefs submitted by Ben Fish are disturbing and confusing. The contention being urged therein seems to be that Clements became the <em>owner </em>of the seed stock which initially had come into the possession of Shields and that instead of raising the crop of seed bean for Ben Fish, all according to the written Clements/Ben Fish contract. Clements was raising <em>his own </em>seed stock for himself. Ben Fish was only involved, so the two above excerpts from the Ben Fish briefs tell us, because, according to the terms of their contract, supposedly Ben Fish had agreed to purchase the product of the very seed stock which was his own.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">It is exceedingly strange that neither of the two excerpts found respectively at pages 1 of the opening brief and page 12 of the closing brief are supported by any citation to the record, to the transcripts, or to the exhibits. This is not a matter of small moment. Appellate judges have two options when a brief is so lacking in quality. The first, and the one which has taken our Chief Justice into camp, is to believe that the author of the brief would not have said it, if it were not true. The other option is for appellate judges to search the record painstakingly in order to ascertain if questionable assertions just might happen to be true. Compounding this unusual circumstance where we are left to wonder what is and what is not, on page 4 of the opening brief we are told that during the week of May 22-28, 1985, \u201cit was agreed that Ben Fish &amp; Son would enter into a contract with the plaintiff to purchase these beans that he was to grow for Shields____\u201d The only cite we see is \u201cPlaintiff\u2019s Exhibit 3,\u201d which, of course, we do have and which shows us a contract which is <em>not </em>a contract calling for Ben Fish to <em>purchase </em>any seeds! Rather, it is for Clements to raise those seeds for Ben Fish.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-11\">In a sentence preceding the foregoing, the Ben Fish brief mentioned some conversations between Clements and the defendants which took place between May 22 and May 28, which inferentially was supposedly in support of the above statement that \u201cit was agreed that Ben Fish &amp; Son would enter into a contract with the plaintiff to <em>purchase </em>these beans.\u201d The citation to the supporting conversations is Tr. Vol I, p. 39, L. 5-12. Looking at that passage produces the following question and answer, which takes place with Clements on the stand during direct examination in plaintiff\u2019s case in chief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-12\">Q. Does that refresh your recollection as to when you may have placed a call to Mr. Dompe in California?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-13\">A. Well, yes. On the 22nd of May and the 28th of May. It shows calls to Crows Landing, California. Both calls are to the same number and I\u2019m quite sure that number is their business phone down there. I\u2019m talking about Ben Fish company\u2019s business phone.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-14\">As is readily seen, that bit of testimony, does not provide any substantiation for the proposition that it was agreed that Ben Fish &amp; Son would enter into a contract with Clements to <em>purchase </em>these beans. The fact of the matter is that Clements was agreeing to devote 80 acres of his land to the raising of a seed bean crop for Ben Fish, including cultivating and harvesting, and delivery, all for a share of $21 per hundred pounds of beans.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-15\">The appellants seemingly go far afield in trying to be persuasive that Ben Fish &amp; Son\u2019s involvement was a promise \u201cto buy\u201d the ultimate crop (of which there was none) whereas in truth he was the actual owner of the seed stock and entered into a joint venture which would result in him owning all of the product derived therefrom, and subject only to his contract with Clements whereunder Clements would be recompensed for his time, effort, and expenses at a set figure of $21 per hundred weight of harvested beans.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-16\">Although the Chief Justice is correct in believing that the relationship between Ben Fish and Clements ought not to be con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>sidered a bailment, that one good suggestion pales in significance when he then proceeds to declare it to be a sales transaction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-5\">Thus, on May 29,1985, when Shields and Clements voided the March 6, 1985, contract, and when Clements and Ben Fish entered into their bean seed contract on that same day, <em>Clements was agreeing to plant and harvest lima bean seed </em>which it already had in its possession, and <em>Ben Fish was agreeing to buy the harvested crop under the terms and conditions set out in the bean contract.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AiU\">At 188, 814 P.2d at 920 (emphasis added). Paramount to the views of this \u201cone justice,\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the conclusion is belied by the then-existing facts and circumstances. It is true that Shields and Clements canceled their contract, and it is true that Clements was agreeing to plant and harvest the lima bean seed. It is <em>not true </em>that Ben Fish was agreeing <em>to buy </em>the harvested crop. Fish was agreeing to pay Clements for the use of his land and for his services, a share of the product computed at the contractually stipulated $21 per hundred pounds of harvested beans:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-6\">[T]he plaintiff contracted with the defendant to grow the seed crop from the seed it had purchased from Shields of Idaho, Inc. The seed crop failed to mature and the plaintiff brought this action against the defendant, advancing several theories, including breach of implied warranty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">Excerpt from the Ben Fish opening brief at 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">In declaring that the Clements/Ben Fish contract was not the bailment contract which Judge Smith had declared it to be the Chief Justice apparently had a lapse of memory, forgetting that not one of three other members of the court sitting on the <em>Peterson v. Conida, </em>98 Idaho 883, 575 P.2d 481, case joined either special concurrence. Judge Smith\u2019s views were based on the actual existing state of the law. While the two of us, Bakes, J. and Bistline, J., had urged the overruling of the prior cases which indulged in the fiction that a grower/seedman\u2019s contract <em>was </em>a bailment, with the seedman gathering in <em>all </em>of the product other than the grower\u2019s agreed share (if there was such a provision in the contract), there was no third vote. With the fiction having continued to exist, Judge Smith was not in error. Judge Swanstrom, in his dissenting opinion when the instant controversy was first decided by the Court of Appeals, made it abundantly clear that the unanimous opinion authored by Smith, J., joined by Keeton, C.J., and Porter, Taylor, and McQuade, JJ., still holds sway. <em>Kent v. Campbell, </em>80 Idaho 57, 59, 324 P.2d 398, 400 (1958). Judge Smith in his memorandum also makes that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-12\">This Court as constituted in 1958, set out pertinent portions of the contract, <em>none </em>of which contained the words bailment, bailor, or bailee:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-13\">The Company agrees to furnish the Grower with the stock seed for such purpose in the amount aforesaid, the title to such stock seed and to the seed crop produced therefrom to be and remain at all times in the Company except as otherwise stated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-14\">... The receipt of the crop by the Company shall not constitute acceptance thereof hereunder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-15\">It is agreed that the Company shall, after delivery to it of such crop, examine and test the same to determine whether it is merchantable seed and of satisfactory germination, and the Company\u2019s decision thereof shall be conclusive as to whether the crop shall be accepted or not. The Company shall after such determination, notify the Grower of the result thereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-16\">If the crop is accepted by the Company, the amount of merchantable seed thereof shall be determined by deducting from the amount delivered by the Grower such percentage as, in the judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>of the Company after examination, shall equal the amount of culls, unmerchantable seeds, splits, dirt and other foreign material contained therein. There shall then be deducted the amount of stock seed furnished the Grower by the Company hereunder, and the purchase price for the remainder at the rate per pound aforesaid shall then be forthwith payable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-4\">In case the crop is not accepted by the Company, the title thereto shall forthwith thereupon vest in the Grower, whether in his possession or not, and if in the Company\u2019s possession, it shall thereupon be subject to the Grower\u2019s disposition at his risk.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-5\"><em>Kent, </em>80 Idaho at 59, 324 P.2d at 400. The Court then went on in its opinion to state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASo\">The crop contracts as drafted recognize the theory of bailment. The growers, respondents, recognized title to the beans to be in appellant, bailor; and respondents, bailees, fulfilled the requirement of the bailment by their delivery of the beans to the appellant with title thereto reposing in appellant, bailor. Thereupon, the bailments terminated, for then, as stated in the conversion action of <em>D.M. Ferry &amp; Co. v. Forquer, </em>61 Mont. 336, 202 P. 193, 195, 29 A.L.R. 642,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-6\">... the preponderant authority and better reasoning support the rule that upon the termination of the bailment, the identical thing bailed, or the product of or substitute for that thing, together with the increments, earnings and gains which may have accrued to it during the period of the bailment, must be re-delivered, delivered over, or accounted for by the bailee in accordance with the terms of the contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Arn\"><em>Kent, </em>80 Idaho at 60, 324 P.2d at 401. The contract terms might or might not include a provision that the grower\u2019s compensation would be a set amount, or a share of a joint venture enterprise fixed, as here, at so much per hundred weight of beans delivered by the grower.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">I remain of the same view which Chief Justice Bakes and I shared thirteen years ago, <em>i.e., </em>that a seedman\u2019s contract with a grower is not truly a bailment. The law should not remain cluttered up with an ancient, outmoded, and fictional concept, but, unfortunately, it is and will remain so, until <em>Kent v. Campbell </em>and its ilk are overruled. That has yet to take place, and for that very reason it is shameful that a respected trial judge is, by an unthinking Court, this day inappropriately held in error for having accepted and applied what still remains to be case law precedent. Every time that this Court erroneously declares a trial judge in error, when he most assuredly is not, a serious disservice is done to the entire trial bench, inclusive of all trial judges no matter which echelon. Today it is <em>this </em>Court which is in error, not the district court, and the error is manifold and grievous, for which reasons I respectfully and strongly dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">In the spirit of attaching informative and helpful appendices, which is assisted by the majority opinion\u2019s attachment of a copy of the contract at issue, in this case, I include the opinion of the Court of Appeals. That opinion should have been the end of this lawsuit. I would have been honored to join that opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b236-11\">COURT OF APPEALS OPINION, ISSUED MAY 31, 1990, Ct.App. No. 17149</p>\n<p id=\"b236-13\">BURNETT, J.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-14\">This appeal arises from a dispute between a farmer and a seed producer. The issues are whether the district court correctly (a) ruled that the Uniform Commercial Code was applicable to this case; (b) found that the seed producer had breached an implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose under the UCC; (c) determined the extent of the farmer\u2019s damages; and (d) awarded attorney fees to the farmer. For reasons explained below, we affirm the judgment of the district court in all respects except the award of attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">The issues are framed by a convoluted sequence of transactions involving the seed producer, the farmer and a seed warehouse. The seed producer is a California enterprise doing business as \u2018Ben Fish and Son.\u2019 It has developed numerous strains of proprietary lima bean seed to meet various agricultural needs. In order to test its products in differing climates, the seed producer has arranged through seed warehouses to have the beans grown by farmers across the country. In 1985, the seed producer sent one of its bean seed strains, known as GBL 8-78, to Idaho for testing. The seed was stored at Shields Seed Company, a seed warehouse in Nampa. Shields then contracted with the farmer, Clements Farms, Inc., to grow a lima bean seed crop from the seed provided. The contract provided that the farmer would be paid $21.00 per hundredweight when the proper grade of harvested seed crop was delivered to the warehouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">In the early spring of 1985, before the seed had been planted, the farmer learned that the warehouse was in financial difficulty. Discussions ensued as to whether the warehouse would be able to purchase a harvested crop later in the year. When these discussions proved inconclusive, the farmer communicated with the seed producer in California, exploring the possibility of a direct bilateral agreement that would avoid any risk of a future default by the warehouse. The seed producer\u2019s president flew to Idaho and met with the farmer. With the knowledge and consent of the warehouse, the farmer and seed producer signed a new contract, consisting of a form agreement printed on the seed producer\u2019s letterhead. This new contract provided that the farmer would grow a crop from \u2018stock seed furnished by [the seed producer].\u2019 The farmer agreed to deliver the harvested crop to the seed producer, in care of the Shields warehouse; but if Shields was no longer in business by that time, delivery would be made at another warehouse. The new contract further provided for the farmer to receive from the seed producer the same price for a grown bean crop as the warehouse earlier had agreed to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">The new contract was signed on May 29, 1985. On that date, the seed was still unplanted. As the evidence later would show, the GBL 8-78 seed had an unusually slow maturation rate, rendering it more susceptible than most seed strains to crop loss if a frost occurred in the fall. The district court found that this unusual characteristic was not disclosed to the farmer by the seed producer or by the warehouse. Rather, the farmer was simply advised to \u2018get [the bean seed] in the ground as soon as possible.\u2019 After preparing a field for cultivation, the farmer planted the GBL 8-78 seed in mid-June. The crop ultimately was destroyed by frost before it had fully matured.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">The farmer brought this action against the seed producer and the warehouse, seeking reimbursement for money spent attempting to grow the ill-fated crop. For reasons not important here, the warehouse was dismissed from the case. With respect to the seed producer, the farmer asserted a breach of an implied warranty of fitness under the Uniform Commercial Code. The farmer alleged that the seed producer had represented the seed to be capable of maturing into a harvestable crop. Following a bench trial, the farmer received a judgment for compensatory damages and attorney fees. The seed producer appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b237-11\">We now turn to the issues raised by the seed producer. We deal first with issues relating to liability under the Uniform Commercial Code; then we focus on the questions of damages and attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-12\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b237-13\">The seed producer argues that the Uniform Commercial Code should not apply to the farmer\u2019s claim because the contract did not provide for a sale of goods to the farmer. If there was any sale, the seed producer contends, it was a prospective sale of the anticipated crop by the farmer to the producer; thus, the producer was never in the position of a seller under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>UCC. This argument overlooks the fact that the seed producer referred to itself as the \u2018seller\u2019 in the contract it signed with the farmer. In a purported disclaimer of warranties, the contract stated: \u2018Ben Fish &amp; Son warrants to the extent of the purchase price that <em>seeds sold </em>are as described on the container within recognized tolerances. <em>Seller </em>gives no further warranty, express or implied.\u2019 (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">More fundamentally, the seed producer\u2019s argument disregards the first phase of the transaction, in which the seed producer furnished goods (the seeds) to the farmer. The question is whether such furnishing of goods in a commercial transaction should be treated as a sale under the UCC. The district court addressed this question obliquely, characterizing the furnishing of goods as a \u2018bailment,\u2019 to which the UCC could be extended. The seed producer now attacks the \u2018bailment\u2019 characterization and argues, in any event, that the UCC does not apply to bailments.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">For reasons we will discuss in a moment, we do not think the bailment controversy controls this case. We pause, however, to acknowledge that many reported decisions have characterized seedman\u2019s contracts as bailments. <em>E.g., Washburn-Wilson Seed Co. v. Alexie, </em>54 Idaho 727, 35 P.2d 990 (1934); <em>Smith v. Washburn-Wilson Seed Co., </em>40 Idaho 191, 232 P. 574 (1925); <em>D.M. Ferry and Co. v. Smith, </em>36 Idaho 67, 209 P. 1066 (1922). On the other hand, this characterization has been questioned in some cases. <em>See Chapman v. Haney Seed Co., Inc., </em>102 Idaho 26, 624 P.2d 408 (1981); <em>Peterson v. Conida Warehouses, Inc., </em>98 Idaho 883, 575 P.2d 481 (1978) (Bakes, J., and Bistline, J., special concurring opinions). But the real linchpin of the district judge\u2019s decision is not his choice of bailment terminology; it is his underlying determination that the UCC and its warranty provisions should apply to the furnishing of goods in the commercial context presented here. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">Article 2 of the UCC applies generally to commercial transactions involving sales of goods. The courts also have applied the Code\u2019s provisions by analogy to a variety of transactions other than sales, such as leases, bailments and loans of goods. An-not., <em>What Constitutes a Transaction, a Contract for Sale, or a Sale within the Scope of UCC Article 2, </em>4 A.L.R. 4th 85 (1981 and later supplements). The Idaho Supreme Court has applied the UCC to a lease. <em>See All-States Leasing Co. v. Bass, </em>96 Idaho 873, 538 P.2d 1177 (1975). The Court thereby has expressed its disagreement with decisions in a few other states, where courts have refused to extend Code warranties to non-sale transactions without express legislative authorization. <em>See, e.g., R &amp; W Leasing v. Mosher, </em>195 Mont. 285, 636 P.2d 832, 835 (1981); <em>Baker v. Promark Products West, Inc., </em>692 S.W.2d 844, 846 (Tenn.1985). Such narrow decisions have been criticized as violating the intent of the UCC\u2019s drafters, who declared in section 1-102 that the Code should \u2018be liberally construed and applied to promote its underlying purposes and policies.\u2019 <em>See </em>Special Project, <em>Article Two Warranties in Commercial Transactions: An Update, </em>72 CORNELL L.REV. 1159 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">In <em>All-States Leasing, </em>our Supreme Court said that one purpose of applying UCC warranties by analogy is that \u2018implied warranties can be extended to many transactions which could not be defined as sales but which are so like other cases where warranties are implied that they should be treated similarly.\u2019 96 Idaho at 878, 538 P.2d at 1182 (quoting Farnsworth, <em>Implied Warranties of Quality in Non-Sales Cases, </em>57 COLUM.L.REV. 653 (1957)). In another lease case, our Supreme Court noted that \u2018reasoning by analogy does not require us to apply Article 2 in toto ...; rather we need apply only those provisions which are sufficiently analogous.\u2019 <em>Glenn Dick Equipment Co. v. Galey Construction, Inc., </em>97 Idaho 216, 222, 541 P.2d 1184, 1190 (1975). The Court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-10\">[W]e will look to the commercial setting in which the problem arises and ... use Article 2 as \u2018a premise for reasoning only when the case involves the same considerations that gave rise to the Code provisions and an analogy is not rebutted by additional antithetical circumstances.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Asj\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 222, 541 P.2d at 1190 (quoting Note, <em>The Uniform Commercial Code as a Premise for Judicial Reasoning, </em>65 CO-LUM.L.REV. 880, 888 (1965)).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Here, the furnishing of seed to the farmer closely resembled a sale of goods. The seed producer transferred the seeds, and the farmer received them, for valuable consideration. The fact that the consideration consisted of future services by the farmer, coupled with the seed producer\u2019s promise of future payment for a grown crop, does not defeat the logical application of the UCC to any issue regarding the seeds themselves. Although \u2018title\u2019 to the seeds may not have passed from the seed producer to the farmer, our Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in the lease cases have made it clear that passage of title is not essential to application of the UCC.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">In short, to paraphrase our Supreme Court\u2019s language in <em>Glenn Dick Equipment, </em>we have examined the commercial setting in which the bean seeds were furnished by the seed producer to the farmer. We believe this ease involves the same considerations that gave rise to the Code provisions. We perceive no circumstances antithetical to applying the Code. The UCC analogy fits. Therefore, we uphold the trial judge\u2019s ruling that the Code is applicable to this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">The next question, given the applicability of the UCC, is whether the trial judge correctly determined that the seed producer breached an implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose under UCC \u00a7 2-315, codified in Idaho as I.C. \u00a7 28-2-315. The seed producer argues that (1) an implied warranty was not created; (2) even if it was created, it was effectively disclaimed in the contract; and (3) even if it was not effectively disclaimed, there was no actual breach of the warranty. We will address each contention in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b239-10\">In order for a sale to create an implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose, the seller must have reason to know the buyer\u2019s particular purpose; the seller also must have reason to know that the buyer is relying on the seller to furnish appropriate goods; and the buyer must have relied upon the seller\u2019s skill or judgment. I.C. \u00a7 28-2-315; <em>All-States Leasing, </em>96 Idaho at 879, 538 P.2d at 1183. By analogy, the requirements here would be that the seed producer had reason to know the farmer\u2019s particular purpose for the seed; that the seed producer had reason to know the farmer was relying on the producer to furnish appropriate seed; and that the farmer did, in fact, rely upon the producer\u2019s skill or judgment regarding the seed. Each of these criteria frames a question of fact. Accordingly, we employ a clear error standard in reviewing the district court\u2019s determination that the warranty requirements have been satisfied. <em>Martineau v. Walker, </em>97 Idaho 246, 542 P.2d 1165 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-12\">It is self-evident that the seed producer knew the farmer\u2019s purpose for the seed. The farmer sought to grow the seed into a harvestable crop pursuant to a contract with the seed producer. The remaining questions focus on the reliance criteria\u2014 whether the producer had reason to know the farmer would rely, and whether the farmer actually did rely, on the producer\u2019s judgment in furnishing appropriate seed.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-13\">As noted above, GBL 8-78 was a proprietary bean seed. It was developed and owned by the seed producer. The producer knew the bean would not grow everywhere; in fact, the producer was testing the seed in the Idaho climate. GBL 8-78 required a 120-day growing season. The farmer testified that the usual growing season for beans in southwestern Idaho was 90 days. The district court implicitly found that where the seed producer had unique knowledge about the seeds, the farmer necessarily relied \u2014 and the producer was deemed to know that the farmer would rely \u2014 upon the producer\u2019s judgment as to whether the seeds would serve their intended purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-14\">It has been argued that both parties, in effect, had unique knowledge \u2014 the produc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>er as to the seed\u2019s unusual maturation rate, and the farmer as to the ordinary bean-growing time in southwestern Idaho. In our view, however, the ordinary bean-growing season was not information uniquely possessed by the farmer; it was information generally available. In contrast, the characteristics of the GBL 8-78 seed were proprietary information, not generally available. The farmer (Maurice Clements) testified that had he known the GBL 8-78 seed required a 120-day growing season, he would not have planted it. The record indicates that in order to avoid destruction by frost in the fall, it would have been necessary to plant the seed in mid-May. The contract between the farmer and the seed producer was executed on May 29, yet there was no disclosure to the farmer of the risk associated with planting after that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Upon these facts, we find no clear error in the district court\u2019s determination that the reliance criteria of UCC \u00a7 2-315 were satisfied. We conclude that there was an implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">We now consider the seed producer\u2019s argument that it effectively disclaimed any implied warranty of fitness. Our Supreme Court has stated that the implied warranty of fitness can be disclaimed, but that the courts will \u2018construe strictly language negativing the implication of such a warranty.\u2019 <em>Glenn Dick Equipment Co., </em>97 Idaho at 225, 541 P.2d at 1193. Disclaimers must be in writing and conspicuous. I.C. \u00a7 28-2-316. A trial court must determine whether the disclaimer is \u2018so written that a reasonable person against whom it is to operate ought to have noticed it.\u2019 I.C. \u00a7 28-1-201(10).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">In making this determination, the court must examine the entire document, comparing the disclaimer clause to the rest of the document for various relevant factors \u2014 location, type size, contrasting type, ink col- or, vagueness of terms, etc. None of these factors, standing alone, necessarily will determine the validity of a disclaimer clause. They must be weighed collectively. <em>See, e.g., Lee v. Peterson, </em>110 Idaho 601, 604, 716 P.2d 1373, 1376 (Ct.App.1986) (disclaimer found ineffective where language failed to state plainly that no implied warranty existed); <em>Snake River Equipment Co. v. Christensen, </em>107 Idaho 541, 549-50; 691 P.2d 787, 796-97 (Ct.App.1984) (review denied) (\u2018as is\u2019 disclaimer in upper case type on separately signed addendum found conspicuous); <em>J &amp; W Equipment, Inc. v. Weingartner, </em>618 P.2d 862 (Kan.Ct.App. 1980) (disclaimer printed in bold upper case letters near signature line found conspicuous); <em>P.E.A.C.E. Corp. v. Oklahoma Natural Gas Co., </em>568 P.2d 1273 (Okla.1977) (disclaimer in small print on back of document found inconspicuous). Because the weighing of these factors is essentially a fact-finding function, we again apply a clear error standard of review. <em>Martineau v. Walker, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">In the present case, as we have noted, the contract was written on Ben Fish &amp; Son letterhead. Beneath the letterhead, in print smaller than that used elsewhere in the document, appeared the purported disclaimer quoted earlier in this opinion. The trial judge rejected this disclaimer as inconspicuous, noting that \u2018it [was] in fine print under the letterhead at the top of the page\u2019 and that it failed to \u2018make it plain that an implied warranty [had] been disclaimed.\u2019 The disclaimer clause was not printed, so far as the record before us discloses, in a contrasting ink color. Upon these facts we find no clear error in the trial judge\u2019s determination that the disclaimer clause was inconspicuous. We therefore uphold the judge\u2019s conclusion that the disclaimer was ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-11\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b240-12\">Because the warranty was not disclaimed, the next question is whether it was breached. In an action for breach of an implied warranty, the buyer has a burden of establishing the breach by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Dickerson v. Mountain View Equipment Co., </em>109 Idaho 711, 716, 710 P.2d 621, 626 (Ct.App.1985). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>Whether the seed producer breached its warranty in this case was a question for the trier of fact. <em>Martineau v. Walker, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">The seed producer contends that there was no breach, although its argument\u2014 when closely examined \u2014 actually seems to be that if a breach occurred, it did not cause the farmer\u2019s crop loss. The seed producer maintains that failure of the seeds to produce a crop was due to the farmer\u2019s own error. Specifically, the producer points to the fact that the seeds were at the warehouse, and available for planting, as early as March. The farmer did not plant them until mid-June. The seed producer argues that if the farmer had planted the GBL 8-78 seed by mid-May, he would have obtained a harvestable crop. The difficulty with this argument is that it focuses on a time period when the farmer\u2019s contract was with the warehouse, not with the seed producer. Any delay during that period was occasioned by the farmer\u2019s legitimate concern over the warehouse's financial condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">Focusing more particularly on the farmer\u2019s transaction with the seed producer, the dispositive fact \u2014 as found by the district court \u2014 is that the producer signed a new contract directly with the farmer on May 29, even though the producer knew that the seed was not then in the ground. The producer implicitly recommended planting the seed after that date, and the farmer did so. The farmer\u2019s actions were consonant with a reasonable belief that the GBL 8-78 seed, like other bean seeds he was planting that year, would have a normal maturation period. Given these circumstances, we perceive no clear error in the trial judge\u2019s findings that a breach of warranty occurred and that it caused the farmer\u2019s loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">We now turn to the damage issue. The seed producer attacks the damage award on two fronts. First, the producer contends that the trial court applied an incorrect legal standard in measuring damages. Second, the producer disputes the sufficiency of evidence to support the sum awarded by the trial court. We will discuss these contentions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-11\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b241-12\">The seed producer argues that the trial court erred by allowing the farmer to claim reimbursement of expenses rather than lost profits, which would require the court to ascertain the difference between the value of the crop actually raised and the crop that would have been raised under normal conditions, less the costs of maturing, harvesting and delivering the crop. <em>See generally Casey v. Nampa and Meridian Irrigation Disk, </em>85 Idaho 299, 304, 379 P.2d 409, 411 (1963). Our examination of the record, however, reveals that the seed producer failed to raise this issue before the trial court. Although the seed producer vigorously disputed the expenses claimed by the farmer, it never argued below \u2014 so far as our record reveals \u2014 that the correct measure of damages was lost profits rather than reimbursement of expenses. In effect, the case was tried on the farmer\u2019s assertion of a reliance interest, rather than of an expectancy interest, in the seed-growing contract. <em>See generally Brown v. Yacht Club of Coeur d\u2019Alene, Ltd., </em>111 Idaho 195, 198-99, 722 P.2d 1062, 1065-66 (Ct.App.1986) (discussing these different interests and the recoveries pertinent to each).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-13\">An appellant is bound by the issues and theories upon which the case was tried below. Although a judgment may be sustained upon any legal theory, a new theory cannot be employed on appeal to attack the judgment. <em>Beaupre v. Kingen, </em>109 Idaho 610, 710 P.2d 520 (1985); <em>Heckman Ranches, Inc. v. State, </em>99 Idaho 793, 589 P.2d 540 (1979). Because the lost profits theory of damages was not framed below, it is not properly before this Court on appeal. We will not pursue it further.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-14\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b241-15\">The seed producer did effectively preserve its objection to the quantification of damages in light of the evidence presented. Damages for breach of contract need not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>be proved with mathematical exactitude; they simply must be proven beyond speculation. <em>Haener v. Ada County Highway Dist., </em>108 Idaho 170, 174, 697 P.2d 1184, 1188 (1985); <em>Wing v. Hulet, </em>106 Idaho 912, 684 P.2d 314 (Ct.App.1984). We will not disturb a judge\u2019s measure of damages unless it is clearly erroneous. <em>Davis v. Gage, </em>109 Idaho 1029, 712 P.2d 780 (Ct.App.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">Here, the dollar figures and supporting evidence need not be recounted in detail. It suffices to say that the farmer provided the court with a thorough breakdown of costs, calculated from extensive records, which the trial court accepted. Although the seed producer disputed many of the farmer\u2019s figures, the trial court found them to be reasonable. We find no clear error in the trial court\u2019s determination, and we will not disturb it.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">Finally, the seed producer challenges the trial court\u2019s award of attorney fees to the farmer. The court predicated this award upon a provision in I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3) which mandates a grant of attorney fees to the prevailing party in \u2018any civil action ... [on] any commercial transaction____\u2019 The reference to a \u2018commercial transaction\u2019 was added to I.C. \u00a7 12-120 on July 1,1986. We have held, in <em>Myers v. Vermaas, </em>114 Idaho 85, 753 P.2d 296 (Ct.App.1988), that the 1986 version of the statute may not be applied to a case filed prior to the effective date of the amendment. This case was filed in March, 1986. Consequently, the 1986 version of the statute should not have been applied. In fairness to the district judge, we note that he did not have the benefit of <em>Myers </em>when he made his ruling in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">Moreover, we do not think the case falls within the pre-1986 version of I.C. \u00a7 12-120. Although that version refers to \u2018any civil action to recover on ... [a] contract relating to the purchase or sale of goods,\u2019 this case \u2014 strictly speaking \u2014 did not involve a \u2018sale of goods.\u2019 As we have explained, the transaction between the parties closely resembled a sale, thereby justifying application of the UCC by analogy; but the policy reasons for analogous extension of UCC warranties do not carry over to attorney fee questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-11\">Neither do we believe this case warrants a discretionary award of attorney fees under I.C. \u00a7 12-121. An award under that statute could be made only upon a finding that the seed producer defended against the farmer\u2019s complaint \u2018frivolously, unreasonably or without foundation____\u2019 I.R. C.P. 54(e)(1). The district court made such a finding, but its explanation for doing so focused in part on the seed producer\u2019s failure to offer a settlement or to respond to any settlement offer by the farmer. Our Supreme Court has held that refusal to engage in settlement negotiations is not a permissible basis for awarding attorney fees. <em>See Ross v. Coleman, </em>114 Idaho 817, 836, 761 P.2d 1169, 1188 (1988). <em>Ross, </em>like <em>Myers, </em>was decided after the district court made its ruling in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-13\">An award of attorney fees under I.C. \u00a7 12-121 is a matter of discretion. Where, as here, such an exercise of discretion has been tainted by legal error, the proper appellate response usually is to remand the case for reconsideration in light of the proper legal framework. <em>Kunzler v. Kunzler, </em>109 Idaho 350, 707 P.2d 461 (Ct. App.1985). A remand is unnecessary, however, when the appellate court is convinced that the lower court\u2019s ruling is an abuse of discretion in any event. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b242-14\">Here, the issue of the seed producer\u2019s liability \u2014 predicated upon extension of the UCC by analogy \u2014 has been a fairly debatable question throughout this litigation. Attorney fee awards under I.C. \u00a7 12-121 are improper where the nonprevailing party has presented a \u2018genuine and fairly debatable\u2019 issue. <em>Wing v. Amalgamated Sugar Co., </em>106 Idaho 905, 911, 684 P.2d 307, 313 (Ct.App.1984). Moreover, we have held that an attorney fee award is inappropriate under I.C. \u00a7 12-121 if the case is not controlled by existing Idaho authorities but instead \u2018has helped to develop Idaho case law on the subject.\u2019 <em>Shelton v. Boydstun Beach Ass\u2019n, </em>102 Idaho 818, 641 P.2d 1005 (Ct.App.1982). Accordingly, with all due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>respect to the capable district judge, we hold that the award of attorney fees in this case was an abuse of discretion and must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">In summary, the judgment of the district court is affirmed with respect to liability and damages, but is reversed with respect to attorney fees. Costs (exclusive of attorney fees) are awarded on appeal to the respondent-farmer.</p>\n<judges id=\"b243-7\">WALTERS, C.J., concurs.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b225-7\">. In <em>Peterson v. Conida Warehouses, Inc., </em>98 Idaho 883, 575 P.2d 481 (1978), Justice Bakes wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-8\">In my view, the bailment theory accepted in <em>Kent [v. Campbell, </em>80 Idaho 57, 324 P.2d 398 (1958) ] should be rejected by this Court, and not merely sidestepped as we have done in this case. I agree with Justice Bistline that it is stretching the concept of bailment beyond its breaking point to assert that one may deliver beans to another to plant them and harvest the crop and still retain title to the crop produced by the planting.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-9\"><em>Peterson, </em>98 Idaho at 886, 575 P.2d at 484. Similar views were expressed in the specially concurring opinion which I had authored, also finding fault in the Court\u2019s opinion, but not the result reached:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-10\">While I have little trouble in agreeing that this is not a sale, to my mind it does not necessarily follow that it is a bailment. To indulge in the fiction of calling a bailment that which is not a bailment does very little to promote jurisprudence as a science. My vote for affirmance, therefore, should not be construed as implying any conviction that the arrangement between Grimms and Conida was a bailment. Obviously, once those seed beans were planted, it was impossible for the Grimms to return the 'bailed goods,\u2019 which, in my view, is always the right of a bailee. <em>Industrial Leasing Corp. v. Thomason, </em>96 Idaho 574, 532 P.2d 916 (1974).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AXHt\"><em>Peterson, 98 </em>Idaho at 887, 575 P.2d at 487. This was followed by a full discussion explaining how this Court initiated the theory that one hundred pounds of X\u2019s beans planted in Y's ground by Y creates an agreement of bailment whereunder the bailor X becomes the owner of <em>all </em>the bean crop grown on bailee Y\u2019s ground. The specially concurring opinion concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AR-\">I submit that it is unrealistic to continue to indulge in the fiction that a bean, which is irretrievably planted in the ground, and whose very existence as a bean ceases as it turns into a plant, may be the subject of a bailment, entitling the supplier of the bean to claim all the beans produced from that plant. The parties essentially <em>have entered into a joint venture, </em>with the seed company supplying the seed beans, and the grower, here the Grimms, supplying the land in which the beans may be planted, together with all the labor which goes into planting, cultivating, harvesting, and hauling to the warehouse. The Idaho court, in our <em>Ferry Co. </em>case, in quoting from the Montana <em>Ferry Co., </em>case, came close to the right answer where it spoke of <em>\u2018a share of the net proceeds of the adventure.' </em>36 Idaho at 73, 209 P. at 1067.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AM8s\"><em>Peterson, </em>98 Idaho at 887-88, 575 P.2d at 487-88 (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b226-9\">. Black's Law Dictionary, Centennial Edition (1891-1991), recognizes that \"joint venture\u201d and \u201cjoint adventure\u201d are interchangeable and describe the identical legal relationship with one definition being \u201ca one-time grouping of two or more persons in a business undertaking,\u201d and the other being \"an association of two or more persons to carry out a single business enterprise for profit, for which purpose they combine their property, money, effects, skills, and knowledge.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 52, 839 (6th ed. 1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b226-10\">. Thirteen years ago when I was the new kid on the block and Justice Bakes was the second newest, I honestly believed and felt certain that Justice Bakes did also, that our time and effort in writing special concurrences would divorce itself from the fiction that contracts for services rendered in planting seeds and harvesting bean crops are legally viewed as bailments, but would be recognized for the joint ventures they are and which in actuality is the correct terminology. A third vote failed to surface.</p>\n<p id=\"AVT\">Today with the Chief Justice and I being the two older boys on the block, will there be a third vote for abrogating the bailment fiction of the year 1922? There should be.
