The first motion was filed pursuant to I.R.C.P. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>12(b)(6), and the second was filed \u201con the grounds that the issues raised by the pleadings are moot as plaintiff Danny L. is no longer at State Hospital South.\u201d The second motion to dismiss briefly described the history of Danny L.\u2019s commitment to State Hospital South and concluded with the prayer that \u201cdefendant requests that this action be dismissed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b903-4\">The district court responded to both motions to dismiss, first concluding that the action was not moot. The district court\u2019s ruling presaged our recent opinion in <em>Bradshaw v. State, </em>120 Idaho 429, 816 P.2d 986 (1991), in which this Court held, in a similar case involving a commitment to State Hospital South, that the termination and release of an involuntarily committed patient from the state hospital did not necessarily moot his claim that his rights were violated in the course of that commitment. We find no error in that ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">The district court did dismiss the amended complaint \u201con the merits,\u201d concluding that \u201cneither statutory nor constitutional law afford plaintiff a basis for release.\u201d After reviewing the verified amended complaint, we conclude that the allegations contained in the verified amended complaint raise issues which cannot be resolved on a motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">The respondent argues that the motions to dismiss should be treated as motions for summary judgment as permitted by I.R.C.P. 12(b)(6) because the parties submitted other evidentiary matters for consideration by the court. <em>Cook v. Soltman, </em>96 Idaho 187, 525 P.2d 969 (1974), suggests that the trial court could have treated the proceeding as one for summary judgment. However, the trial court expressly stated that he was treating the motion as a motion to dismiss.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Even if we consider the motion to dismiss as a motion for summary judgment, we nevertheless conclude that on this record there were triable issues of fact which precluded the granting of a judgment of dismissal of at least portions of the verified amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-12\">Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b903-7\">. In the transcript, the trial court specifically stated, \"[I]t looks like to me the motion to dismiss is a 12(b)(6) motion. So we can get that in perspective. You have to weigh under the requirements of 12(b)(6) as far as the status of the pleadings.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
