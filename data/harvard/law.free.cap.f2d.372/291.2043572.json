He had owned and operated this club since January 1962.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-20\">During September and October 1964 and January 1965, appellant caused certain gambling supplies and paraphernalia to be shipped to him in Memphis by REA express from Chicago, Illinois.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-21\">The principal question on this appeal relates to the issue of entrapment, which appellant insists the district court should have decided in his favor as a matter of law instead of submitting it to the jury. Appellant contends that he was entrapped by agents of the Government into the commission of the offense for which he was charged, and that the district court committed reversible error in overruling his motion for acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-22\">The gambling supplies here involved were shipped to appellant from Chicago by Charles P. Stahl, doing business as Taylor &amp; Company. Appellant\u2019s defense of entrapment is based upon a \u201cconsent agreement\u201d or \u201ccease and desist agreement\u201d executed by Stahl after an investigation of his business by agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-23\">For some time prior to 1964, FBI agents had been conducting an investiga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>tion of Stahl\u2019s operations in Chicago. In 1964 Stahl signed an agreement to cease and desist from the manufacturing, printing, sale or distribution of certain items of gambling paraphernalia previously sold by him. A copy of this agreement is made an appendix to this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">Appellant contends that the dice, cards, chips and other paraphernalia shipped to him by Stahl were not included in the \u201ccease and desist\u201d agreement; that Government agents led Stahl to believe that he could ship such items legally in interstate commerce and could inform his customers to that effect; that the shipments from Stahl to appellant came about as a result of \u201cdeceitful representations and inducements\u201d on the part of Government agents; and that the Government devised this scheme to use Stahl as an agent to entrap appellant into violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1952.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">To establish the defense of entrapment as a matter of law, the controlling facts must be undisputed. Sherman v. United States, 356 U.S. 369, 78 S.Ct. 819, 2 L.Ed.2d 848; United States v. Thompson, 366 F.2d 167 (C.A. 6), cert. denied, United States v. Campbell, 385 U.S. -, 87 S.Ct. 512, 17 L.Ed.2d 436, United States v. Cooper, 321 F.2d 456 (C.A. 6). Where the evidence and the inferences properly deducible therefrom are conflicting, the issue of entrapment is a question of fact to be submitted to the jury. Osborn v. United States, 385 U.S. 323, 87 S.Ct. 429, 439, 17 L.Ed.2d 394, affirming United States v. Osborne, 350 F.2d 497 (C.A. 6); United States v. Head, 353 F.2d 566 (C.A. 6); United States v. Littwin, 338 F.2d 141 (C.A. 6), cert. denied, 380 U.S. 911, 85 S.Ct. 896,13 L.Ed.2d 797; United States v. Williams, 319 F.2d 479 (C.A. 6).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">On appeal, \u201cIn determining whether entrapment has been established as a matter of law, the evidence as well as inferences properly deducible therefrom should be considered in the light most favorable to the Government.\u201d United States v. Cooper, supra, 321 F.2d at 457, citing United States v. Berkley, 288 F.2d 713 (C.A. 6), cert. denied, 368 U.S. 822, 82 S.Ct. 41, 7 L.Ed.2d 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-11\">We hold that the \u201ccease and desist\u201d agreement executed by Stahl (appendix hereto) did not constitute entrapment as a matter of law, and that the defense of entrapment presented an issue of fact which properly was submitted by the district judge to the jury under the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-12\">Appellant further contends that the district judge, the Honorable Marion S. Boyd, committed reversible error in his charge to the jury and in rejecting special charges submitted by appellant. We hold that the charge, when read as a whole, sets forth an accurate statement of the law of entrapment. Sherman v. United States, supra, 356 U.S. 369, 78 S.Ct. 819; and Sorrels v. United States, 287 U.S. 435, 53 S.Ct. 210, 77 L.Ed. 413.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-13\">Since the district judge stated the applicable law of entrapment fully and fairly in his general charge, he did not commit reversible error in refusing the special instructions requested by appellant. Petro v. United States, 210 F.2d 49 (C.A. 6). In this situation, the trial judge is not required to instruct the jury in the exact language requested by appellant. United States v. Ball, 344 F.2d 925 (C.A. 6), cert. denied, 382 U.S. 907, 86 S.Ct. 245, 15 L.Ed.2d 160.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-14\">Appellant also raises questions concerning the validity of the search warrant and the admissibility of evidence as the result of an allegedly unlawful search. He further charges that the district court committed prejudicial and reversible error in permitting the United States Attorney to make an improper argument to the jury. These and all other contentions of appellant have been considered and we hold that there is no ground for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-16\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b341-17\">CONSENT AGREEMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b341-18\">WHEREAS, CARL P.
