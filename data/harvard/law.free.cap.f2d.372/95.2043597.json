The complaint alleges that the insurance carrier voluntarily undertook to provide safety inspection services for the benefit of the employer and its employees and that as a result of its negligence one, Frederick E. Gutowski, an employee was killed. The action is maintained by Plaintiff-Appellant as special administrator of the estate of the deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-17\">The District Court entered summary judgment for Defendant-Appellee, construing the Act as extending to the insurance carriers the immunity of the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-18\">We affirm for the reasons stated in the Opinion of the District Court, reported in Kotarski v. Aetna Casualty and Surety Company, 244 F.Supp. 547.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b143-19\">.
