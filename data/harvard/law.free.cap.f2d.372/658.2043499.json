Thompson, 372 F.2d 654, this day decided. This appeal challenges \u00a7 135 of the Uniform Traffic Regulation Code of the City of Jackson, Mississippi.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>pellants say that the Ordinance cannot be squared with Federal Constitutional standards and is thus void on its face. As the analysis to follow will reveal, we are compelled to agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">The suit likewise challenged Jackson City Ordinance No. 594, Revised 1938. The City points out, however, that this Ordinance was repealed by the enactment of the Uniform Traffic Code, so we need .consider it no further.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">We are aware that \u00a7 135 was involved in a decision of this Court [before another panel] in National Association of Colored People, et al. v. Thompson, Mayor of City of Jackson, 357 F.2d 831 (1966), in which Judge Whitaker, Senior Judge of the Court of Claims, sitting by designation, wrote a comprehensive, well balanced opinion. In that case, however, it was contended only that the Ordinance, along with others, had been unconstitutionally applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">The Supreme Court of Mississippi has not construed or defined the application of Ordinance 135. That Court did consider the general subject in King v. City of Clarksdale, Miss., 186 So.2d 228 (1966).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> There a Clarksdale ordinance prohibiting parading or marching without the written permission of the Chief of Police, but stating no rules or standards for its application or enforcement, was unanimously held invalid as conferring upon the Chief of Police unrestricted discretion as to who shall or shall not be permitted to parade or march on the sidewalks or streets of the City, with no standards as to time, place of marching or any other feature.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-10\">As in <em>Strother, </em>the Mississippi Legislature was about to be convened in extraordinary session, in June, 1965, in an effort [which met with success] to relax previously existing state literacy requirements as to registering and voting. Although the special session was called for the purpose of putting an end to restrictions and limitations which, for years, these plaintiffs had vigorously opposed, they nevertheless wanted to protest the session because they claimed it was for the purpose of circumventing voting rights legislation then pending in the Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-11\">After meeting in a church in the vicinity of downtown Jackson, about four hundred persons began a march to the State Capitol, where the Legislature was meeting or about to meet. Although warned that a parade permit would be needed, none was applied for. The march was principally upon the sidewalks and appears to have been orderly, at least until it was stopped. About one block from the Capitol Building the police halted the group and informed those persons at the head of the line that because they had no permit the marchers would have to disperse or be arrested. Steadfastly refusing to disperse, a large number of the marchers were arrested. From this episode, and similar ones which followed, came this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-12\">It is of interest that during the three year period immediately preceding this attempted parade without a permit there had been 13 parade permit applications filed in the City of Jackson and none had been denied. Almost half of those granted were for Negroes and/or civil rights demonstrations.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>In any event, the litigation necessitates a determination of whether \u00a7 135 as presently written is unconstitutionally void on its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">In approaching the problem we keep several indisputable principles well in mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\"> First, it is our duty, if possible, to construe the Ordinance so as to avoid the conclusion of unconstitutionality. We are not to assume that in passing it the City Council intended to or did grant unto itself the right in its sole discretion to violate or disregard any rights or liberties guaranteed by the Constitution. If such had been done we would have to look no further than the decision of the Mississippi Supreme Court in King v. Clarksdale, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">Second, as far back as 1940 the Supreme Court of Mississippi has held that where a power is granted to a public board to be exercised at \u201cits discretion\u201d, the grant means a legal and not an arbitrary discretion, Board of Mississippi Levee Commissioners v. Kellner, 189 Miss. 232, 196 So. 779. This was the rationale, supported by a specific decision of the Supreme Court of New Hampshire, on which the decision turned in Cox v. State of New Hampshire, 312 U.S. 569, 61 S.Ct. 762, 85 L.Ed. 1049, 133 A.L.R. 1396 (1941), as well as the approach taken in Poulos v. State of New Hampshire, 345 U.S. 395, 73 S.Ct. 760, 97 L.Ed. 1105, 30 A.L.R.2d 987 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">Lastly, no Federal Court has the authority to interfere with any municipality in the promulgation and lawful enforcement of reasonable regulations for maintaining the safety and convenience of all citizens in the orderly use of its public streets and sidewalks, so long as those regulations comply with Constitutional standards. We have in mind the language of Cox v. The State of New Hampshire, supra:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-9\">\u201cIf a municipality has authority to control the use of its public streets for parades or processions, as it undoubtedly has, it cannot be denied authority to give consideration, without unfair discrimination, to time, place and manner in relation to the other proper uses of the streets\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-14\">See also Poulos v. State of New Hampshire, supra, Cantwell v. State of Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296, 60 S.Ct. 900, 84 L.Ed. 1213 (1940); Schneider v. State of New Jersey Town of Irvington, 308 U.S. 147, 60 S.Ct. 146, 84 L.Ed. 155 (1939); Cox v. State of Louisiana, 379 U.S. 559, 85 S.Ct. 476, 13 L.Ed.2d 487 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-15\">Thus our sole concern in this case is and can only be whether \u00a7 135 in any material particular violates or fails on its face to comply with Constitutional standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-16\">In Cox v. State of New Hampshire, supra, the Supreme Court phrased it this way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-17\">\u201c * * * the question in a particular case is whether that control is exerted so as not to deny or unwar-rantedly abridge the right of assembly and the opportunities for the communication of thought and'the discussion of public questions immemorially associated with resort to public places [citations omitted].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-18\">The question may more specifically be stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-19\">Is \u00a7 135 so vaguely and broadly written that it purports to or may be construed' to, prohibit conduct, and punish offenders for conduct, which is protected by First Amendment Rights of the United States Constitution?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-20\">The latest guidance may be found in Ashton v. Kentucky, 384 U.S. 195, 86 S.Ct. 1407, 16 L.Ed.2d 469 (May 16, 1966) wherein it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-21\">\u201cHere as in the cases discussed above [<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] we deal with First Amendment rights. Vague laws in any area suffer a constitutional infirmity. When First Amendment rights are in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>volved, we look even more closely lest, under the guise of regulating conduct that if reachable by the police power, freedom of speech or of the press suffer. We said in Cantwell v. Connecticut, supra, that such a law must be \u2018narrowly drawn to prevent the supposed evil,\u2019 310 U.S., at 307 [60 S.Ct., at 905, 84 L.Ed. 1213], and that a conviction for an utterance \u2018based on a common law concept of the most general and undefined nature,\u2019 id., at 308, [60 S.Ct. at 905] could not stand.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">For example, in the <em>Terminiello </em>case, the City of Chicago had a city ordinance which read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-5\">\u201cAll persons who shall make, aid, countenance or assist in making any improper noise, riot, disturbance, breach of the peace, or diversion tending to a breach of the peace, within the limits of the city * * * shall be deemed guilty of disorderly conduct [with punishment prescribed upon conviction] .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">The trial court instructed the jury that any misbehaviour which \u201cstirs the public to anger, invites dispute, brings about a condition of unrest, or creates a disturbance\u201d violated the ordinance. The Supreme Court held the ordinance invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">The Constitutional difficulty with \u00a7 135 most acutely appears in its prohibition against conducting or participating \u201cin any parade or marching in which floats, banners, placards or other distracting agencies, noises, objects or vehicles are used; and for any person to engage in shouting, singing, orating, speaking, or any other distracting activity of any kind on any of the public streets and thoroughfares of the City of Jackson\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">It is at once noted that the Ordinance prescribes no definitions or standards as to what constitutes \u201cdistracting activity\u201d, nor does it mention \u201cshouting, singing, orating, speaking\u201d in any but the broadest and most encompasssing terms \u2014 at least the unlimited language is wide open to such an interpretation on the part of enforcement officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-10\">Moreover, the only way to avoid the prohibition is to obtain \u201cspecial permission for parades and other unusual activities on the streets, when [in the opinion of the City Council] such parades or other activities will not be distracting to the extent of disturbing the usual, normal, and customary use of the streets and would not constitute a disturbance to the people living or conducting businesses thereon\u201d. Obviously, this language is as vague, broad, and lacking in standards as that previously alluded to.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-11\">The undisputed proof in the record from a responsible police official is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-12\">\u201cThat the City Council in arriving at its decision [as to granting permits] considered the following problems: Traffic control along the proposed parade or march route; the size and number, length, number of vehicles, etc. that would be in the parade; the number of police and police vehicles that would be needed or required to handle the proposed parade; the time element in connection with any such proposed parade in order that such parade would not interfere with the normal flow of traffic.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-13\">This witness testified that the only reason for requiring a permit was in order that traffic could be controlled and law and order maintained during the parade.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-14\">These are, of course, objects of legitimate municipal concern, which, as already pointed out, the City clearly has the authority to handle in a constitutional manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-15\">The difficulty is that these standards and considerations do not appear in the face of the Ordinance. Nor would their presence cure present defects if the Council continued to be left with the authority to deny permits so that the \u201cactivity will not be distracting and disturbing to the usual, normal and customary use of the streets and would not constitute a disturbance to the people living or conduct<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>ing businesses thereon\u201d, as above set out.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">Measured by the Supreme Court decisions herein alluded to, we find no escape from the view that \u00a7 135 as presently written is unconstitutional. It would be useless for this Court to say otherwise; indeed it would only delay the drafting and enactment of an ordinance which in a constitutional manner would protect legitimate regulation of the activities here involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">In oral argument, we spent considerable time on the \u201capparent impossibility\u201d of municipalities enacting ordinances in this field which will meet constitutional standards and escape invalidation at the hands of the courts. Careful consideration reveals that such is not impossible. We invited supplemental briefs on this very question, which were filed, and which are available for use in the drafting and enactment of a valid ordinance. We do not discuss the subject any further at this time because it is not the function of the Courts to offer opinions on anticipated events or future controversies.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">This brings us to the question of injunctive relief. The proceedings below were on preliminary injunction only, so that, technically, there remains a prayer for permanent injunction. We would have considerable doubt that there is any further need for additional injunctive relief in view of the Orders called for in National Association for the Advancement of Colored People v. Thompson, supra. But we think this is a matter best to be left initially to the good judgment and discretion of the trial court, upon such showing as the parties may hereafter be able to make. If further relief is reasonably appropriate or required, there would, of course, be the necessity for the hearing of evidence on the permanent injunction. It would be far too soon for us at this time either to intimate or declare what the outcome would or should be.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">The Judgment of the District Court, affirming the validity of \u00a7 135 of the Uniform Traffic Regulation Code of the City of Jackson, Mississippi, is reversed and remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent herewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-11\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b707-6\">.
