We find no merit in the procedural point. Concerning the substantive decision of the Tax Court, it is not the task of this court to determine whether we would have reached the same result, but merely to determine whether the decision of the Tax Court was clearly erroneous. Applying this standard, we find that the decision was not clearly erroneous. It is therefore ordered that the decision of the Tax Court be, and hereby is, affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
