The court below denied his petition after a full hearing. The appellant first alleges that his confession was coerced. Since the confession was not introduced at trial, the appellant\u2019s constitutional rights were not violated. See Lynumn v. State of Illinois, 1963, 372 U.S. 528, 536, 83 S.Ct. 917, 9 L.Ed.2d 922. Hollifield next alleges that his trial was fatally infected by adverse pretrial publicity. There is no evidence in the record to support this contention. The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
