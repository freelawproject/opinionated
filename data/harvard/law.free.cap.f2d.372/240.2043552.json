(Lawrence M. Henry, U. S. Atty., David I. Shedroff, Asst. U. S. Atty., Mitchell Rogovin, Asst. Atty. Gen., Lee A. Jackson and Harry Baum, Attys., Dept, of Justice, on the brief), for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b289-6\">Before MURRAH, Chief Judge, and HILL and HICKEY, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b289-7\">HICKEY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">The sole issue to be determined on this review is whether funds distributed to appellants <footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>were taxable as ordinary income or as long term capital gain. The trial court determined that the transactions which made the distribution available constituted a corporate reorganization which did not qualify all of the distribution for capital gain treatment. The appellants contend the distribution was made pursuant to a complete liquidation of a corporation and it should, therefore, be taxed as long term capital gain under Section 331 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The facts are not in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-12\">Appellant, taxpayer, purchased 800 shares of the First State Bank of Wal-senburg<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> stock in 1954 for $255,800.00. The remaining 200 shares were owned by the President of the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-13\">In December of 1957 the Comptroller of Currency granted conditional approval for a National Bank in Walsenburg, Colorado.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-14\">On January 13, 1958, appellant purchased the remaining 200 shares of State Bank\u2019s stock from the President for $100,000.00. One hundred fifty of these shares were immediately sold to five persons for the same price paid by the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-15\">On January 14, 1958, appellant and these five persons adopted a plan to incorporate National Bank. The parties payed $250.00 per share for the stock and each received the same proportionate number of shares as their interest in State Bank. Appellant received 85% of the stock and 15% was distributed to the remaining five persons. On the same day the same six persons adopted a plan of liquidation of State Bank whereby the fiduciary assets and liabilities were to be transferred to National Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-16\">On January 23, 1958, the Comptroller of the Currency issued a charter for National Bank to commence business, and on January 25, 1958, pursuant to an agreement between the two banks, all the fiduciary assets and liabilities were transferred to National Bank in trust for the depositors of State Bank for such time as it required the depositors to affirm the transfer. The officers and employees of State Bank became the management of National; the business continued at the same location pursuant to a gratuitous lease covering the bank building; and all the furniture, fixtures and equipment continued under the National name. Thereafter, in September <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>1958, the State Banking Department of Colorado authorized a partial distribution of the remaining assets of State Bank.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">Subsequently, in October of 1958, appellant repurchased the 150 shares held by the other five persons and became the sole stockholder of State Bank.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">On November 3 and 30, 1958, the final distributions were authorized by the State Banking Department. Appellant was sole stockholder at this time. Taxes were paid by appellant, claims for refund filed and this action commenced when the claims were refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">Caldwell, former President of the State Bank, who did not participate in the transaction included in the plan, testified, \u201cThe primary reason for liquidation of State Bank was top-heavy capitalization.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">The primary reason thus established compels us to examine the transactions stripped of their technical niceties. The steps were: acquisition of a National charter; incorporation of a National Bank with the same stockholders owning the same amounts of stock they owned in State; the transfer of State\u2019s fiduciary assets to National; the operation of the banking business by National at the same place, with the same officers, employees and stockholders, using the same equipment with only a change of name; the dissolution of State Bank; and the distribution of assets not required to continue operation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">Considering the uncontradicted evidence recited above, we conclude the primary purpose of the transactions was to syphon off the excess capital of State Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">The transaction evolved a mere incarnation of a prior corporation. \u201cTransactions whereby the interests of two or more corporations become identified are susceptible of arrangment into four general groups * * *. The third type of combinations comprehends cases in which the new corporation is, either in law or in point of fact, the reincarnation or reorganization of one previously existing.\u201d 19 Am.Jur.2d Corporations, \u00a7 1491 at 873, 874.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-15\">Under absolute similar reincorporation transactions it was held \u201cThe law seems to be well settled that, where a corporation is the mere incarnation of a prior corporation, the new corporation must answer for all of the obligations of the old. [Citations omitted].\u201d McCarthy v. Liberty National Bank, 73 Okl. 275, 175 P. 940, 7 A.L.R. 137, 139. Therefore, it is irrelevant to the tax consequences that State Bank placed cash and securities in escrow with National Bank for the purported purpose of protecting its depositors.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-16\">Having determined the purpose to be accomplished, and having examined the vehicle utilized, we turn to the threshold issue of the tax consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-17\"> The substance rather than the form of the transaction is the controlling consideration. Gregory v. Helvering, 293 U.S. 465, 55 S.Ct. 266, 79 L.Ed. 596 (1935); Prairie Oil &amp; Gas Co. v. Motter, 66 F.2d 309 (10 Cir. 1933).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-18\">\u201cIn order to effectuate the intent of Congress the dividend, liquidation, redemption and reorganization sections of the Code must be examined and viewed as a functional whole. The basic framework by which Congress sought to tax corporation distributions is contained in sections 301(a), 301(e) and 316. Distributions of corporate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>funds to stockholders made with respect to their stockholdings must be included in their gross income to the extent that those distributions are made out of the corporation\u2019s earnings and profits. Such distributions are termed by the Code as dividends and are taxed as ordinary income.\u201d Da-vant v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 366 F.2d 874, 879 (5 Cir. 1966). \u201cIn Helvering v. Alabama Asphaltic Limestone Co., 315 U.S. 179, 62 S.Ct. 540, 86 L.Ed. 775 (1942), the Supreme Court affirmed an appeal from this Circuit in which this Court had held that a series of events must be construed as a single transaction coming within the reorganization provisions, even though they did not meet its literal language. The Supreme Court said [Citation omitted] \u2018The separate steps were integrated parts of a single scheme. Transitory phases of an arrangement frequently are disregarded under these sections of the revenue acts. [i. e., the liquidation and reorganization provisions] where they add nothing of substance to the completed affair. [Citations omitted]. Here they were no more than intermediate procedural devices utilized to enable the new corporation to acquire all the assets of the old one pursuant to a single reorganization plan.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-5\">Congress has attempted to provide for taxing the syphoning off of liquid assets in the course of a reorganization.\u201d Davant v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 366 F.2d 874, 883, 885.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">The trial court, adopting the determinations of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, found that appellant realized by the liquidation distribution $83,-450.00 in the taxable year 1958 and $63,-388.80 in the taxable year 1959 in excess of the basis of his State Bank stock. The court determined that these gains constituted ordinary income. It seems certain that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-7\">\u201c * * * despite the declaration of a \u2018liquidating dividend\u2019 followed by the transfers of legal title, * * * these were mere formalities designed \u2018to make the transaction appear to be other than what it was\u2019, in order to avoid tax liability. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-9\">To permit the true nature of a transaction to be disguised by mere formalisms, which exist solely to alter tax liabilities, would seriously impair the effective administration of the tax policies of Congress.\u201d Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Court Holding Co., 324 U.S. 331, 333, 334, 65 S.Ct. 707, 708, 89 L.Ed. 981 (1945).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-10\">The liquidation in the present case was the step in the series of transactions by which the purpose of reducing capital was accomplished.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-11\">\u201cThe Code provides no definition of \u2018complete liquidation.\u2019 We reject the simplistic argument of the taxpayer that the phrase refers only to the measures required by state law to terminate a corporation\u2019s legal existence. No reason is offered as to why the observance of such mechanical procedures would prompt Congress to treat as stock redemptions payments that are in reality dividends. A more convincing indication of what distributions are meant to be accorded favored treatment is found in an early report of the Senate Finance Committee. S. Rep. No. 398, 68th Cong., 1st Sess. 12 (1924). There a distribution in complete liquidation was analogized to a sale of stock in that the shareholder \u2018surrenders his interest in the corporation and receives money in place thereof.\u2019 The corporation must have ceased to be a going corporate concern, or if the enterprise is continued in corporate form, the shareholder must have disassociated himself from it. [Citation omitted]. If the liquidated business is not resumed by the new corporation as a continuation of a going concern, there is a \u2018complete liquidation.\u2019 \u201d Pridemark, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 345 F.2d 35, 41 (4 Cir. 1965).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-12\">The taxpayer did not disassociate himself from the banking business, but retained an 85% interest in the reincar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>nated National Bank. The mere fact that taxpayer made a separate purchase of National\u2019s shares does not alter this fact. His 85% interest in the fiduciary assets of State Bank continued after they had been transferred to National Bank which was the continuation of a going concern. The purchase of stock merely added additional value to the corpus of the National\u2019s corporate assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">The reincarnation of State as National, the trial court concluded, \u201cconstituted a reorganization within the meaning of Title 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 368(a) (1) (D).\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-5\">\u201cThe (D) reorganization provisions have never been confined to a strictly literal application.\u201d Davant v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 366 F.2d 874, 884.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-6\">\u201cIn general the reorganization sections of the Code, \u00a7\u00a7 351 through 381, are designed to permit certain corporate changes and adjustments to be made without tax consequences to the participating corporation or corporations or their shareholders. The congressional policy is that while such transactions may produce changes in the conduct of the business enterprise or in ownership, these changes are not sufficiently significant to warrant taxing the gain or allowing the loss which comes about by reason of the change * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-7\">But this is not the end of the matter. The statute also provides that pursuant to the plan of reorganization, * * * the stock or securities of the corporation to which the assets are transferred (new Reef) be distributed in a transaction which qualifies under \u00a7\u00a7 354, 355 or 356 of the Code. 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 354, 355, 356. Only \u00a7 354 is pertinent here. Section 356 is the \u2018boot\u2019 section applicable to either a \u00a7 354 or a \u00a7 355 situation.\u201d Reef Corp. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 368 F.2d 125 (5 Cir. Oct. 1966).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-12\">The conclusion of the trial court relative to the reorganization plan is based on the finding of the court \u201cthat National Bank acquired \u2018substantially all of the assets\u2019 of State Bank within the meaning of Title 26 U.S.C., \u00a7 354(b) (1) (a).\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-13\">This finding qualified the transaction as a reorganization under 368(a) (1) (D) and made section 356 <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the \u201cboot\u201d section applicable to the section 354 situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-14\">The liquidation resulted in a reincarnation of the State Bank as National. The taxpayer was not disassociated from the new corporation which resumed the business as a going concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-15\">Therefore, the appellant was properly assessed for the \u201cboot\u201d he received out of the transaction viewed in the light of the purpose which he sought to accomplish.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b289-17\">.
