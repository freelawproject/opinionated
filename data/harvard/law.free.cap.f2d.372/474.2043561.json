The principal question presented by the appeal is whether there was sufficient evidence of that gross negligence on the part of defendant Lee which is required by the Florida law to support a verdict in favor of a guest passenger, such as the plaintiff. It is also urged that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence which barred his recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-19\"> The Florida automobile guest statute, sec. 320.59, Florida Statutes Annotated, provides that \u201cthe question or issue of negligence, gross negligence, and willful or wanton misconduct, and the question of proximate cause, and the issue or question of assumed risk, shall in all such cases be solely for the jury\u201d. It is accordingly held in Florida that each such case must stand or fall on its own facts, Douglass v. Galvin (Fla.App. 1961), 130 So.2d 282, 283, all the circumstances entering into the particular happening being for the jury to consider in determining the existence of liability. Faircloth v. Hill, Fla., 1956, 85 So.2d 870, 872. We have carefully reviewed the testimony in the present ease in the light of the Florida law. No useful purpose would be served to recount it here. It is sufficient to say that while the evidence was conflicting in a number of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>respects there was testimony from which the jury could find, as it did, that defendant Lee was guilty of gross negligence and that the plaintiff was free from contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">The judgment of the district court is Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
