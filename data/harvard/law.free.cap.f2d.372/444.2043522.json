An election of Union officials was about to be held and Hart announced his support for one Nusser who was chosen to run for Thompson\u2019s position as assistant business representative. It was decided that Hart would nominate Nusser and would assist in managing his campaign. Upon learning of this activity Thompson insisted on Hart\u2019s discharge from the position he then held with Zinman. Hart then secured a position with Horn, and Thompson also brought about his discharge from that position.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-18\">The Board, in addition to the usual order to cease and desist, ordered that Hart be made whole for loss of pay and be restored to his position if it was still available.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-19\">By procuring the discharge of Hart for his activities within the Union, to wit, his support of a particular candidate for Union office, the Union violated Section 8 (b) (2) in causing Hart\u2019s employers to discriminate in violation of Section 8(a) (3). Local 138, Int\u2019l Union of Operating Engineers, AFL-CIO v. National Labor Relations Board, 321 F.2d 130, 136-37 (2d Cir. 1963); National Labor Relations Board v. Local 138, Int\u2019l Union of Operating Engineers, 254 F.2d 958 (2d Cir. 1958), enforcing 118 NLRB 669 (1957); Brewers and Maltsters Local 6 v. National Labor Relations Board, 301 F.2d 216, 218-24 (8th Cir. 1962). The Union and the Employers also violated Section 8(a) (1) and 8(b) (1) (A) by restraining or coercing Hart in violation of his Section 7 rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>The respondent Union\u2019s reliance on National Labor Relations Board v. Miranda Fuel Co., Inc., 326 F.2d 172 (2d Cir. 1963) and National Labor Relations Board v. Local 294, Int\u2019l Bhd. of Teamsters, 317 F.2d 746 (2d Cir. 1963) is entirely misplaced. In those cases there was nothing to indicate that the discharge of the employees was based upon or connected with any union activity. Here the discrimination against Hart was based solely upon his \u201cunion-connected activities\" (National Labor Relations Board v. Local 294, Int\u2019l Bhd. of Teamsters, supra, 317 F.2d at 749).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">Order enforced.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b493-10\">.
