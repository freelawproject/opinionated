BROWN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b365-18\">This appeal from a summary declaratory judgment, S.D.Fla., 1964, 236 F. Supp. 22, 40 N.Y.U.L.Rev. 366 (1965), holding that Appellees, partners engaged in the practice of law, have no duty under \u00a7\u00a7 203(b), (c), (f), 204 of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 [LMRDA], 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 433(b), (c), (f), 434 (1958) ed. Supp. V)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to file any report covering any of their activities during 1960 and 1961 on behalf of their Employer clients, presents a question of first impression as to the construction of these statutory provisions, the impact of the common-law at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>torney-elient confidential communication privilege on such construction, and the constitutionality of the provisions as construed. We reverse in part, affirm in part, and remand. In short, we hold that the evidence \u2014 viewed, as it must be on summary judgment, most favorably to the Government \u2014 clearly shows that Appellees have engaged in \u201cpersuader\u201d activities <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> on behalf of four employer-clients which must be reported under the 30-day and annual reporting requirements of \u00a7 203(b) and which are not exempt from these requirements by virtue of \u00a7\u00a7 203(c), (f), or 204. However, contrary to the position taken by the Government, we conclude that the statute does not require Appellees to include in their annual reports a statement of receipts from and disbursements on behalf of other clients for whom they performed only nonpersuader labor relations activities in regard to which no 30-day report is required. As so construed and applied, the reporting requirements of \u00a7 203(b) are constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">This suit was initiated by the Appel-lees in the District Court for a declaratory judgment that they were not subject in any manner to the reporting requirements of \u00a7 203(b) of the LMRDA. The Government counterclaimed seeking an injunction requiring Appellees to comply with the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">The Government contended that pursuant to arrangements with four of their clients,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellees had engaged in persuader activities and that within 30 days of each such arrangement they were required to report the terms and conditions thereof. Furthermore, the Government contended that under \u00a7 203(b) the Appellees were required to file annual reports as to each fiscal year within which payments were received pursuant to those agreements, and that these reports had to include a statement of receipts from, and disbursements on behalf of, all clients to whom Appellees had rendered any kind of labor relations services or advice, including but not limited to the four clients for whom Appellees had performed persuader activities. According to the Government, attorneys qua attorneys are not exempt from the reporting requirements and must file a 30-day report as to each persuader agreement. An attorney who confines his activities to those enumerated in \u00a7 203(e) need not file any report, but once he undertakes on behalf of any client persuader activities not within the scope of \u00a7 203(c), he must not only file a 30-day report covering these activities, but must file an annual report covering even those activities described in \u00a7 203(c). And he must do so as to all clients. The Government\u2019s construction of the Act is that the \u00a7 203 (c) exemption applies solely to \u201cwho\u201d must report rather than to \u201cwhat\u201d must be reported. If an attorney engages in persuader activities which are not exempt by \u00a7 203(c), this triggers the necessity for him to report all his labor relations activities on behalf of all his clients. Finally, the Government contended that neither \u00a7 203(f) nor \u00a7 204 exempt the Appellees from the reporting requirements of the Act. Section 204, in contrast, to \u00a7 203(c), limits \u201cwhat\u201d must be reported, not \u201cwho\u201d must report, for it comes into play only once a report is required to be filed. \u2022 And even then, it only exempts the attorney from reporting confidential communications within the traditional scope of the attorney-client privilege. According to the Government, the information required by his official report forms would not trespass on this privilege. As to \u00a7 203(f), there is simply no modification of the employer\u2019s rights under \u00a7 8(c) of the LMRA by requiring his attorney to report on labor relations activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>The Appellees, on the other hand, did not deny that their activities on behalf of the named clients were those of a \u201cpersuader\u201d or within the literal terms of \u00a7 203(b). Instead, they vigorously insisted that their activities were confined to those listed in \u00a7 203(c) because they were all things which a lawyer professionally and ethically might properly do in connection with, and in furtherance of, representation of their clients in administrative, judicial or collective bargaining proceedings. Furthermore, since these activities constituted a well-recognized part of the practice of labor law, they were exempted by virtue of \u00a7 204. And finally, Appellees attacked the Government\u2019s construction of the Act as unconstitutionally abridging their clients free-speech rights and their attorney-client privilege, the latter especially if they were required to report all nonper-suader activities on behalf of clients who hired them to do no persuader acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">With the lines of contention thus clearly drawn, the Government, over many obstacles, sought by pretrial discovery to factually establish the types of activities it alleged Appellees undertook on behalf of their four named clients. Introduced into evidence by the Government were many, many pages of depositions, requests for admissions and their answers, interrogatories and their answers, stipulations, etc. Appellees, however, apparently content to rely on their position that, regardless of the precise nature of their activities, they were not, as a matter of law, subject to the reporting requirements of the Act, introduced little, if any, evidence to contradict the factual assertions of the Government or the evidence introduced in support of those assertions. Insisting then, as they now do, that the depositions presented by the Government are irrelevant, the deposition proceedings were often a frustrating experience in the effort of discovery. Time and time again, at the taking of the depositions, the Appellees objected to the Government\u2019s questions as violative of the attorney-client privilege, as irrelevant and immaterial, as leading, as calling for a conclusion of the witness. Question after question, they repeated the same objection. All in all, the lawyers did more talking than the deponents. If, as Appellees now assert, the deponents\u2019 testimony was confused, unsure, and vague, the Appellees are certainly partly responsible for this state of things, for the deponents could scarcely get a word in edgewise. The Government\u2019s requests for admissions, motions for production of documents, and motion to compel one of Appellees\u2019 partners to answer on deposition met with the same kind of stubborn resistance. And many of Appellees\u2019 objections to these requests were sustained by the Court on the ground that the requests were irrelevant and immaterial \u2014 a result, we may add, which was consistent with the Court\u2019s concept of controlling substantive principles which we hold to have been erroneous. Although the Government now complains of these rulings, many of which we agree are of doubtful propriety, our view of this appeal makes decision thereon unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">Neither need we pass on the Government\u2019s more serious complaint that the trial Court ruled on Appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment without allowing it to complete its discovery and without ever definitively ruling on a number of its motions for discovery. For in any case, before completing discovery, the Government likewise moved for summary judgment stating the belief that it was so entitled on the basis of the evidence of record, even without the further discovery sought. The Government was at least half right. Construing the evidence most favorably to the Government,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we conclude that the trial Court erred in granting summary judgment to Appellees as to their duty to report persuader activities. It does not follow, however, that the Court erred in not granting the Government\u2019s motion. As to it, much may well turn out on remand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>to be established as a matter of law under the principles we announce. But it is better administration that the trial Court examine it in the light of such principles and then determine just what is so established and what remains for resolution by the trier of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">In granting Appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment, the District Court purported to accept the Government\u2019s version of Appellees\u2019 activities, 236 F.Supp. at 25, and to resolve all factual disputes in favor of the Government, 236 F.Supp. at 28. However, the District Court summarized these facts in such a general way that it is impossible to tell whether this was really so. The Court below summarized them in such a general fashion as to mask the real nature of Appellees\u2019 persuader activities. Because these facts vividly portray these activities and are so essential to the applicability of the Act, we deem it appropriate to describe in some detail Appellees\u2019 activities on behalf of the four named clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">L. D. Plante, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">In 1960, Appellees represented L. D. Plante, Inc., and Paul Saad, an attorney associate in the firm and an agent of Ap-pellees, performed certain services for that company. During a labor dispute arising out of a unionization drive <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Paul Saad, on at least two occasions, spoke to groups of employees during working hours. At one meeting, held in Mr. Plante's office, Saad, introduced as Plante\u2019s attorney, discussed the union that the employees were trying to form. Saad advised the four employees present that, under certain conditions, the Company would have the right to fire any employees who went on strike and that he would recommend that it do so. Saad also told the employees that, if they interfered with the railroad serving the Company, they could be put in the federal penitentiary. He also pointed out the benefits the Company was giving. At a second meeting, many of the plant employees were assembled to hear Mr. Saad. Saad discussed what the union would mean to those who joined it and what the employees would stand to gain and what they would stand to lose.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He raised the issue of strikes and what they would mean to the employees, and when the Company could replace employees on strike.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-15\">Plant City Steel Corp.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-16\">In 1956 a local of the Boilermakers filed a petition for an election at Plant City. The election was held in July 1957, and won by the Boilermakers. Thereafter, in November 1957, Appellees, attorneys for Plant City, notified the Boilermakers that it was intending to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>test the NLRB certification in court, and thus Plant City would not bargain.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">While the Boilermakers case was pending,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the Steelworkers began a union organizing campaign among the same employees of Plant City, in the summer or fall of 1960.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">Granville M. Alley, Jr., an Appellee, Glenn L. Greene, Jr., and Paul A. Saad, both associates in the firm and agents of Appellees, rendered services to Plant City during 1960-1961. In 1960, Saad and Greene attended group meetings of Plant City employees. Saad spoke to the employees assembled at those meetings. The foreman of one of the four departments of Plant City in late 1960 was directed to split his work force and to send half of the force at a time for a meeting. The men were to sit in chairs facing the speakers and the foreman was to sit so that he could see the men\u2019s faces, so that he could report the expressions on their faces as the lawyers asked them questions.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Saad was introduced by a company vice president as a company attorney. The meeting lasted from 35 minutes to three quarters of an hour and Saad did most of the talking. Employee attendance at this meeting was compulsory. Saad told the employees that it would be a year after the Boilermakers case, note 8, supra, was concluded before any new organizational activity could be carried out,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> that the company was paying its attorneys a large sum of money each year and that if there were no organizational drive that money could be in the employees\u2019 pay checks. Saad also told the employees that they could lose jobs over trying to organize the union. Saad also discussed the cost of dues and said that the employees might not gain anything by joining a union.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-18\">As had his activities at Plante, Saad\u2019s efforts at Plant City left no doubt in the minds of the employees who heard him that his purpose was to dissuade them from joining the Union.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Similarly, they resulted in an unfair labor practices proceeding before the Board.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-19\">Speed Sprayer Plant</p>\n<p id=\"b369-20\">Late in 1960, a union conducted an organizational drive among Speed Sprayer\u2019s employees. During 1960 and 1961, Appellees and Donald M. Hall, an associate in the firm and agent of Ap-pellees, rendered services to Speed Sprayer and during this period Hall appeared and spoke at several meetings with employees. At a meeting, held early in November or late in October 1960, one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>employee testified that Hall \u201ctold us that the union couldn\u2019t do anything for us and we had fair wage \u2014 we was getting fair wages and if we joined the union we would be just paying dollars and could be taxed money and some of the people was going to strike and we could be made to support them until they go back to work.\u201d A witness, called by the Appel-lees, testified that Hall \u201cmade it plain, you know, that the company could do more for us than the union.\u201d At another meeting, Hall talked about what the union was not good for and stated that the union was out after the employees\u2019 money. He also talked about the Kohler strike which had gone on for several years, and told the employees that they too could be thrown out on the street. He had talked about benefits which the Company gave and the union could not \u2014 \u2022 Blue Cross and Blue Shield, paid holidays, and picnics. At a third meeting Hall talked on \u201cWhat Can The Union Do For You.\u201d Hall told the employees that the Company could give them more benefits than the union could. At several of these meetings Hall, in addition to talking about the union, passed out to the employees a booklet entitled \u201cWhat <em>Are </em>Union Promises.\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"al-dedup-0\">One of the employees, who had been called by the shop authorities to attend a meeting during working hours at which Hall had spoken against the union, was later visited by Hall, in the company of a foreman, at his home. This visit occurred in the evening, without any invitation from the employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">Hall opened the conversation. Talking about what the union could do and could not do and generally speaking against the union, Hall told his reluctant host about an incident in which a truck driver who was a union man had broken into the home of another man\u2019s wife. He further talked about the cost of a union and that Speed Sprayer could have given its employees a raise if it were not for the union.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-10\">Another employee was also visited at his home by Hall, shortly before the election, in the company of a foreman. This visit was also in the evening and also without invitation. Hall asked the employee whether he thought things \u201cwould be all right now\u201d that a foreman had been changed and whether he was \u201cstill going for the Union.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-11\">Guild Industries.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-12\">In June 1960, organizational efforts at Guild were begun by the Carpenters Union. On August 3, 1960, the union filed an unfair labor practice charge against Guild which was disposed of by an informal agreement.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-13\">A petition for election was filed by the union on October 7, 1960, and on October 26, 1960, a charge was filed by the union alleging that Guild had deprived an employee of overtime work because of his union activity. A hearing was held on the petition for an election on October 28, 1960. On December 15, an amended charge was filed by the union in the unfair labor practice matter, and an additional charge was filed, alleging a discriminatory discharge of another employee. Saad, on or about November 25, 1960, interrogated employees of Guild individually, after first swearing them, with the testimony being recorded by a court reporter. Saad\u2019s interviews \u201ctore the plant\u201d and upset the employees, some of whom felt that Saad\u2019s purpose had been to determine whether they had been supporting the union with the effect of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>discouraging them from joining the union. On December 16, the union filed another charge, this time against Paul A. Saad as well as Guild, alleging that \u201cby interrogating, threatening, and spying, and by other acts and conduct [Guild] and its attorney, interfered with, restrained and coerced its employees.\u201d On December 29, 1960, the NLRB Regional Director set aside the informal settlement previously reached and issued a complaint against the company and Saad.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Shortly thereafter, .in early January 1961, a second interrogation of the employees took place. They were called into the office and asked questions by members and employees of Appellees\u2019 firm and then sworn and given questionnaires to fill out by the attorneys. On January 20, 1961, the prior complaint was amended to charge that Guild, by its attorneys, had on January 9-13, 1961, interrogated employees concerning their own union membership, activities and sympathies, and/or concerning the union membership, activities, and sympathies of other employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">As to both instances of interrogation, the Trial Examiner found against Guild and Saad. 1961, 133 NLRB 1721, 1724. The Board affirmed the decision of the Trial Examiner. 1961, 133 NLRB 1719, amended 1962, 135 NLRB 971.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">As to the first, reported, interrogation by Saad individually, this Court affirmed the decision of the Board as to Guild, but declined to hold Saad because \u201cour holding in Lindsay [N.L.R.B. v. Lindsay Newspapers, Inc., 5 Cir., 1963, 315 F.2d 709, which also involved Appellees\u2019 law firm] came long after this interrogation, and was not a basis for either charging or holding Saad. For that reason, and because it was a question of first impression, we will not apply it to hold Saad here.\u201d N.L.R.B. v. Guild Indus. Mfg. Corp., 5 Cir., 1963, 321 F.2d 108, 112-113.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">As to the second interrogation, we concluded :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-9\">The line between proper preparation of a defense in a proceeding of this type and conduct prohibited by the Act is fine indeed. In the main, much of what transpired in this interrogation was privileged on the basis of proper preparation but in sum, because of the posted company notice, the fact of the unsworn oral examination and the sworn questionnaire on the same questions, coupled with the anti-union animus present, it went beyond the pale of privilege. The Board was justified in holding it violative of .\u00a7 8(a) (1) of the Act in that it constituted conduct tending to discourage union membership and activity. The employees might well have thought that this was one of the legal means which the company had promised to use. Although not necessary, this finding too buttressed the order of the Board as it related to the 8(a) (1) violation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-14\">321 F.2d at 114.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-15\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-16\">From all these facts the District Court drew three common threads: (1) the Appellees were at all times representing the employers \u201con legal matters having to do with administrative or judicial proceedings or collective bargaining negotiations;\u201d (2) in each instance, \u201cthe employees * * * involved were specifically advised and knew that the attorneys were acting as the attorneys for the respective companies;\u201d (3) in each case, \u201cthe matters under discussion and the activities of the * * * attorneys were activities of a legal nature performed in the course of the attorney-client relationship.\u201d 236 F.Supp. at 26. With these broad, hardly descriptive, factual generalizations we do not take issue. We do,, however, with the Court\u2019s conclusion that each, in and of itself, made the Act inapplicable and relieved Appellees of any duty to report. Though purporting to \u201crationalize the provisions of Sections 203 and 204 of the Act into a coherent whole,\u201d id. at 28, the Court concluded that each of its factual generalizations when matched to a separate provision of the Act removed Appellees\u2019 duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>Primary reliance was placed on the exemption provisions, \u00a7\u00a7 203(c) and 204. First, the' Court held that Appellees were \u201cexpressly exempted\u201d from the reporting requirements because of the \u201cexplicit provisions\u201d of \u00a7 203(c) which were \u201cobviously designed to exempt the activities of attorneys performing services <em>as attorneys in connection with </em>judicial or administrative proceedings.\u201d Id. at 30. (Emphasis added.) Second, \u00a7 204 excludes from the reporting requirements \u201cactivities occurring in performance of the <em>normal attorney-client relationship.\u201d </em>Ibid. (Emphasis added.) Third, the exemptions of \u00a7\u00a7 203(c) and 204 aside, the reporting requirements of \u00a7 203(b) were designed to reach only undisclosed activities, not the open activities of persons who the employees expressly knew were acting on behalf of, and being compensated by, employers. 236 F.Supp. at 33-34. A careful consideration of the legislative history of the LMRDA and a candid reading of the literal language of the relevant sections convinces us that each of these legal conclusions is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">At the outset it is important to note that neither the Appellees nor the District Court ever asserted that the activities of Appellees were not those of a \u201cpersuader.\u201d Indeed, such an assertion would be impossible in light of facts set out in Part II. Without belaboring the point, we think it clear beyond doubt that Appellees pursuant to arrangements with their four employer-clients undertook, and, in fact, performed, activities with the object \u2014 and it is difficult to conceive of a case where the object could be more \u201cdirect\u201d \u2014 of persuading the employees not to join the unions.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> And though this is enough, as to Plant City (foreman watching expressions of employees at meetings and Saad taking notes), Speed Sprayer (Hall asking employee whom he visited at home whether he was still in favor of union), and Guild (interrogations of employees as to their union activity), it also seems clear that at least some of Appellees\u2019 activities had the object of supplying their clients with information concerning the union activities of the employees. These are the acts of a \u201cpersuader.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-11\">But the assertion is made that \u00a7 203(b) was not intended to reach disclosed persuasion. It is true, of course, that the McClellan Committee,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> in which the LMRDA had its genesis, was primarily concerned with management-hired labor spies and undisclosed middlemen who engaged in espionage and deceptive persuasion.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> But it is likewise true that from the first abortive predecessor of the LMRDA, the Kennedy-Ives Bill of 1958,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> on through the finished legislative product, Congress did not attempt to outlaw these abuses by so-called \u201clabor relation consultants.\u201d Rather the sanction was to expose them to publicity.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> And it is clear that this exposure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>was to include not only \u00a3he fact that the consultant was paid by management, but why he was paid, how much he was paid, and the practices he engaged in to earn his pay.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The aim was disclosure, but the method almost uniformly adopted to attain the end was reporting of these details, not the mere verbal acknowledgment by the consultant that he was hired by management as a persuader, a fact few employees would be too insensitive to grasp in its absence. Congress certainly knew how to exempt from the reporting requirements information which was already disclosed,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> but it did no such thing as to the reporting requirements of \u00a7 203 (b). The District Court wrongly concluded that disclosure, which according to its rationale would exempt nonlawyers as well as Appellees, is a substitute for what Congress expressly required \u2014 reporting.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">With \u00a7 203(b) thus covering Appel-lees activities on behalf of the four clients, the question as to the scope of the exemptions provided by \u00a7 203(c) and \u00a7 204 remains. In this regard the Act is something less than a model of statutory clarity. The problem with \u00a7 203(c) lies in the phrase \u201cby reason of.\u201d What is its grammatical function? Its meaning? The Government gives the section this reading: nothing shall require any person to file a report by reason of his giving advice to or representing an employer before any court. Thus, if an attorney does more than give advice or represent his client before a court or agency, he is required to report. Making \u201cby reason of\u201d modify \u201creport,\u201d the Government\u2019s reading emphasizes that \u201cgiving advice and representing\u201d are the only exempted activities. Appellees would read the section in its normal grammatical sequence: nothing shall require a person to file a report covering services by reason of his giving advice to, or representing before a court, etc., an employer. With \u201cby reason of\u201d modifying services, Appellees would assign it the meaning \u201cbecause of\u201d or \u201cin connection with.\u201d Thus, Appellees contend that any activities taken in connection with or arising out of representing or agreeing to represent clients are nonreportable. They, thus, emphasize that all their activities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>took place \u201cwhile\u201d administrative, judicial, or collective bargaining proceedings were occurring with regard to their employer-clients. They argue that any labor lawyer worth his salt would have done as much for his clients, that all of their activities were within the legitimate practice of labor law.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">Whether Congress considered directly arguing to employees the economic, rather than legal, consequences of unionization, passing out antiunion propaganda, interrogating employees as to their union sympathies, visiting employees homes to persuade them to vote against the union, etc., within the \u201clegitimate practice of labor law,\u201d it is clear that Congress meant for this type of activity to be reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">When Congress convened in 1959, a number of bills had been prepared for introduction which were directed toward the elimination of the evils which had been revealed by the McClellan Committee hearings. The first to be introduced was S.505, introduced by then Senator Kennedy, Senator Ervin, and others, which was introduced January 20, 1959. I Leg. Hist. (NLRB) 29-79;<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> 105 Cong. Rec. 871.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">S.505 provided in connection with labor consultants, essentially as does the Act as passed, that every consultant who undertakes activities when an object is, directly or indirectly, to persuade employees or supply an employer with information, shall file a report. The report required, however, was an annual one only. \u00a7 103(b), I Leg. Hist. (NLRB) 40-41. Section 103(c) of that bill was equivalent to Section 203(c) of the Act. I Leg. Hist. (NLRB) 41-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">S.748, the Administration bill, was introduced on January 28, 1959, by Senator Goldwater and others. I Leg. Hist. (NLRB) 80-150; 105 Cong. Rec. 1259. Section 206 of S.748 required an employer to report annually payments made to any person for the performance of an act whereby \u201c(i) any employee may be subjected to restraint, coercion, or interference in his exercise of rights guaranteed by Section 7 of the [NLRA] * * *, or (ii) information with respect to the exercise of any rights referred to in clause (i) is obtained or is sought to be obtained from any employee and furnished without his knowledge and consent to his employer.\u201d I Leg. Hist. (NLRB) 102, 103. No separate report was required from the person doing the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-14\">Other bills introduced early in the Session included H.R. 4473, introduced by Congressman Barden on February 16, 1959, which, in \u00a7 209(d), specifically exempted attorneys from the requirement that persons providing labor relation consultant services file a report of every transaction involving coercing, restraining or interfering with the rights of employees, etc., imposed by \u00a7 209(b). I Leg. Hist. (NLRB) 230-33; 105 Cong. Rec. 2431.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-15\">On March 25, 1959, Senator Kennedy, together with Senator Ervin and the other sponsors of S.505 and others, introduced S.1555, which was favorably reported by the Committee on Labor and Public Welfare on April 14, 1959. I Leg. Hist. (NLRB) 338-96, 397-515; . 105 Cong. Rec. 5137, 5877. As reported, S.1555 provided, in \u00a7 103(b), in virtually the exact language now enacted as \u00a7 203(b), that certain activities created an obligation to report. I Leg. Hist. (NL RB) 351; 105 Cong. Rec. 5976. The reporting requirement was somewhat different, however. Only an annual report had to be filed, which had to contain (1) the person\u2019s name, \u201c(2) receipts of any kind from employers on account of labor relations, advice or services, designating the sources thereof, (3) disbursements of any kind, in connection with such services and the purposes thereof; and (4) a detailed statement of the terms of such agreement or arrange<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>ment.\u201d Section 103 (c) of the bill was the same as \u00a7 203(c) of the Act. I Leg. Hist. (NLRB) 351-52, 105 Cong. Rec. 5976. The Committee Report noted, in describing the purpose of the bill, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-6\">In some instances, the matters to be reported are not illegal and may not be improper. But only full disclosure will enable the persons whose rights are affected, the public and the Government to determine whether the arrangements or activities are justifiable, ethical, and legal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">S.Rep.

In explaining the effect of \u00a7 103(b) and (c) of the bill (now \u00a7 203 (b) and (c) of the Act, so far as here material), the Committee noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-8\">\u201cUnder section 103(b) every person who enters into an agreement with an employer to persuade employees as regards the exercise of their right to organize and bargain collectively or to supply an employer with information concerning the activity of the employees or labor organizations in connection with a labor dispute would be required to file a detailed report. An attorney or consultant <em>who confines himself to giving legal advice, taking part in collective bargaining and appearing in court or administrative proceedings </em>would not be included among those required to file reports under this subsection. Specific exemption for <em>persons giving this type of advice </em>is contained in subsection (c) of section 103.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-10\">Id. at 12 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.

Further, as to the purpose of \u00a7 103(c), the Report stated that \u201c[t]he committee did not intend to have the reporting requirements of the bill apply to attorneys and labor relations consultants <em>who * </em>* * <em>do not engage in activities of the types listed in section </em>108(b).\u201d Id. at 40, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.

It noted that the minority had offered amendments in committee to effect its views on this topic, but that the majority had rejected these amendments. Id. at 82, U.S.Code Cong. <em>&amp; </em>Admin.

The first, to add a definition of \u201cLabor relations expert, adviser or consultant,\u201d specifically excluded an attorney engaged in the practice of law when first proposed. 105 Cong. Rec. 6555-56; II Leg. Hist. (NLRB) 1161; Leg. Hist. (Labor) 221-22. Senator Goldwater himself, however, modified his proposed amendment to remove the exclusion of attorneys. Ibid. In clarification of the proposed amendment, Senator Kennedy asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-5\">\u201cWhat effect would the Senator\u2019s amendment have on the requirement that attorneys be subject to the law when they are acting as Labor relations consultants?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">Senator Goldwater replied \u201cthey would be subject to the law.\u201d As so modified, the amendment was accepted by Senator Kennedy. Ibid.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">The second amendment offered by Senator Goldwater was what is now Section 204 of the Act. Senator Goldwater gave his reason for the amendment: \u201cI know that if I were involved in a situation in which an attorney was representing me, <em>and a report had to be made, </em>I would not want all of the intimate details of communications between the attorney and me to become public property.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Senator Kennedy said, \u201cThere is no doubt in my mind that the bill which was originally drafted by lawyers adequately protected them. Therefore, I do not feel that the amendment * * * is wholly necessary.\u201d As Senator Dirksen put it, in the exchange which followed, \u201cI think it is important to anchor the fundamental reason or purpose for protecting this relationship * * * \u2014the safeguard of the lawyer-client relationship was designed not to safeguard or protect the lawyer, but the client.\u201d With this understanding, the amendment was accepted by Senator Kennedy. 105 Cong. Rec. 6558, II Leg. Hist. (NLRB) 1163-64, Leg. Hist. (Labor) 534-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-12\">S.1555 passed the Senate on April 25, 1959, with no further amendments here relevant. 105 Cong. Rec. 6745; II Leg. Hist. (NLRB) 1257, I Leg. Hist. (NLRB) 531-32, 577.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-13\">The House of Representatives adopted a different approach. The House Committee on Education and Labor reported H.R. 8342 on July 30, 1959. I Leg. Hist. (NLRB) 687; 105 Cong. Rec. 14853. In \u00a7 203, H.R. 8342 provided for reporting by labor relations consultants keyed to activities which interfered with, coerced, or restrained employees in the exercise of their rights. I Leg. Hist. (NLRB) 710-13. It also provided, in \u00a7 204, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-14\">\u201cNothing contained in this Act shall be construed to require an attorney who is a member in good standing of the bar in any State, or any client of such an attorney, to include in any report required to be filed pursuant to the provisions of this Act any information which is confidential between the attorney and such client in the course of a legitimate attorney-cliept relationship, including but not limited to the existence of the relationship of attorney and client, the financial details thereof, or any information obtained, advice given, or activities carried on by the attorney within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>scope of the legitimate practice of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">I Leg. Hist. (NLRB) 713.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">\u201c After discussion on the floor of the House, an amendment by Congressman Landrum to substitute the text of H.R. 8400 for the text of 8342 was proposed, 105 Cong. Rec. 15702, II Leg. Hist. (NLRB) 1645, and adopted 105 Cong. Rec. 15859, II Leg. Hist. (NLRB) 1691-92. As thus amended, the bill was passed by the House on August 14, 1959, 105 Cong. Rec. 15891, II Leg. Hist. (NLRB) 1693-1702. The relevant sections of H.R. 8400 were exactly the same as those of H.R. 8342 as reported. I Leg. Hist. (NLRB) 640-44, 710-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">In conference, of course, the Senate approach to the problem was accepted and that of the House rejected, and the provisions of the consultant reporting section of the Act are essentially those of S.1555. See Conference Report, H.R. Rep. No. 1147, 86th Cong., 1st Sess. 32-33, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News 1959, p. 2503, I Leg. Hist. (NLRB) 936-37. The conference bill was adopted by the Senate on September 3, 1959, 105 Cong. Rec. 17919, II Leg. Hist. (NLRB) 1452-53, and by the House on September 4, 1959, 105 Cong. Rec. 18127, 18153, II Leg. Hist. (NLRB) 1738-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-15\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-16\">When we unravel these legislative threads, several patterns are sharply revealed. The first is that Congress, from the beginning to the end of the legislative process, was acutely concerned with the effect the reporting requirements would have on attorneys. Even in the House, where the Committee bill required the reporting only of activities which were intended to interfere with, coerce, and restrain employees, rather than those which were intended to persuade, and where the exemption of \u00a7 204 relieved both the attorney and his client from reporting any \u201cactivities carried on by the attorney within the scope of the legitimate practice of law,\u201d attempts completely to exempt attorneys (e. g., Congressman Barden\u2019s bill) were rejected. And in the Senate, Senator Goldwater was forced to abandon his attempt to exempt \u201cattorneys engaged in the practice of law\u201d and to concede that attorneys would be subject to the law when \u201cthey are acting as labor relations consultants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-17\">The second thing clear is that the Conference Committee, in all respects save one, adopted the approach of the Senate in S.1555. While the House bill required the reporting of interference, coercion, and restraint, the Act requires the reporting of any persuasion.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> While the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>House bill exempted the reporting by either attorney or client of any \u201cactivities carried on by the attorney within the scope of the legitimate practice of law,\u201d the Act exempts attorneys alone from reporting only \u201cinformation * * * lawfully communicated to such attorney by any of his clients in the course of a legitimate attorney-client relationship.\u201d The only exception where the House approach was somewhat adopted by the Conference Committee is \u00a7 203(f). The Senate bill contained no equivalent provision.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">The third thing that is clear is that the exemption of \u00a7 203(c) is not, as Appellees contend, \u201cas broad as the reporting requirement itself.\u201d Almost consistently, the purpose of \u00a7 203(c) was explained not to carve out a broad exemption <footnotemark>29</footnotemark> of activities which would otherwise be covered by \u00a7 203(b), but to make explicit what was already implicit in \u00a7 203(b), to guard against misconstruction of \u00a7 203(b).<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Generally it was felt that the giving of legal advice to employers was something inherently different from the exertion of persuasion on employees,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> and \u00a7 203(c) was inserted only to remove from the coverage of \u00a7 203(b) those grey areas where the giving of advice and participation in legal proceedings and collective bargaining could possibly be characterized as exerting indirect persuasion on employees, see note 27, supra, not to remove activities which are directly persuasive but indirectly connected to the giving of advice and representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-14\">For the purposes of this case, it is unnecessary for us to ascertain the precise location of the line between reportable persuader activity and nonreportable advice, representation, and participation in collective bargaining.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> We conclude only that not everything which a lawyer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>may properly, or should, do in connection with representing his client<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> and not every activity within the scope of the legitimate practice of labor law is on the nonreportable side of the line. At least some of Appellees\u2019 activities on behalf of each of their four clients \u2014 no matter how traditional, ethical, or commendable\u2014 were those of a persuader.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">It is likewise unnecessary for us to determine the precise meaning of \u00a7 203(f).<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> In view of the fact that the Act provides a considerably narrower proviso than the one contained in the House bill, see note 28, supra, we cannot accept Appellees\u2019 assertion that the pro-tection provided by \u00a7 203(f) is \u201cas broad as language can possibly make it.\u201d Ap-pellees argue that requiring them to report their persuasive arrangements interferes with their clients\u2019 unfettered right under \u00a7 8(c) of the NLRA to express \u201cany views, arguments or opinions\u201d to employees. This interpretation of \u00a7 203(f) renders the reporting requirements of \u00a7 203(b) meaningless, since it is difficult to conceive of any kind of persuader activities which do not consist of expressing the employer\u2019s views and opinions and since \u00a7 203(f) applies to employers and nonlawyer persuaders as well as to attorneys. There is nothing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>in the legislative history to indicate that \u00a7 203(f) was intended to have this enervating effect. It is enough to say that Appellees cannot escape all reporting requirements simply by virtue of \u00a7 203 (f). Section 203(f) grants full right to the employer to give voice, either directly or through agents including attorneys, to views protected by \u00a7 8(c). But if those statements are made by agents, the reports must be filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">Likewise, it is unnecessary at this time to determine the precise reach of \u00a7 204. It is clear from both the legislative history and the language of this 1 section that its provisions come into play only once a report is \u201crequired to be filed.\u201d Here we merely decide that a report must be filed and do not attempt to delineate its contents. The Government argues that neither the 30-day nor annual reports called for by \u00a7 203(b) require the Appellees to reveal any information which was communicated to them by their clients in the course of the attorney-client relationship, and that it is quite willing, at the appropriate time, to respect a proper claim of privilege predicated on \u00a7 204.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">But since any such reports to be meaningful must include as a bare minimum the name of the client, the terms of the arrangements, and the fees, we deem it appropriate to indicate our views as to what information \u00a7 204 does <em>not </em>prevent the disclosure of. As to the four clients on whose behalf Appellees performed persuader activities, we conclude that in spite of \u00a7 204 Appellees must report their names and the .fees received for any persuader arrangements.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> They must also describe the general nature of the activities they undertook pursuant to such arrangements.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">Several factors compel this interpretation. The first is a legislative intent to make \u00a7 204 roughly parallel the common-law attorney-client privilege. By the weight of authority, such privilege (1) belongs to the client and is not intended to protect the attorney; <footnotemark>37</footnotemark> (2) cannot be invoked to prevent disclosure of the client\u2019s name or the fees actually paid;<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> (3) protects the disclosure of confidential information only.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> The second is that in spite of this general intention to \u201canchor,\u201d as Senator Dirk-sen put it, the purpose of \u00a7 204 in the protection of the client, not the lawyer, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>\u00a7 204 by its terms may be invoked only by the attorney. Section 203(a) still requires the employer-client to report all persuader arrangements. This can only mean one of two things. Either Congress implicitly intended to honor the employer-client\u2019s invocation of the privilege as a barrier to reporting \u2014 for it would be meaningless to allow the attorney to keep secret what his client must report \u2014 or Congress intended \u00a7 204 to protect only that information which the <em>employer </em>is not required by \u00a7 203(a) to report. We prefer the latter explanation as being most consistent with the legislative utterances which accompanied the adoption of \u00a7 204.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> We conclude, therefore, that as to each persuader arrangement, the Appellees must report the name of their client, the receipts and disbursements pursuant to such arrangements, and the general nature of their activities on behalf of these clients. These activities cannot be considered as confidential information communicated from the clients to Appellees <footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">Thus far the Court is of a single mind. At this point a division arises whether the report must include services performed for <em>non </em>persuader clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">In holding that Appellees need not file even the 30-day reports on behalf of their four clients, the District Court found it unnecessary to pass on the Government\u2019s contention that the performance of persuader activities on behalf of these clients triggered the necessity to file annual reports covering all labor relations services including those rendered to clients for whom Appellees undertook no persuader activities. Nevertheless, the District Court alluded to this contention to exhibit the Government\u2019s \u201cstrained interpretation of the entire Act\u201d and found it to \u201cplay havoc with the obvious purpose of Section 203(c) (as well as Section 204).\u201d 236 F.Supp. at 34 n. 4. The Government urges that this dicta is contrary to the subsequent holdings of the Fourth Circuit in Douglas v. Wirtz, 4 Cir., 1965, 353 F.2d 30, cert. denied, 1966, 383 U.S. 909, 86 S.Ct. 893, 15 L.Ed.2d 665, and another District Court in Price v. Wirtz, N.D.Tex., appeal pending before another panel of this Court [No. 22630]. In both of these cases the attorneys conceded that they had performed persuader activities and agreed to file the 30-day report as to such activities, the sole question being whether they also had to file annual reports as to labor relations services to clients for whom they performed no persuader activities. In both cases it was held that they did. The majority of this Court disagrees and with deference declines to follow the holding of the Fourth Circuit.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">A contrary conclusion would mean that when an employer retains an attorney solely to perform nonpersuader activity (e. g., giving advice or representation in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>court proceedings) and when that attorney subsequently engages in persuader activities on behalf of another employer, the attorney\u2019s nonpersuader arrangement with the first employer would be subject to complete disclosure. In the Court\u2019s view the purposes of the reporting requirements, as revealed in the legislative history, do not justify such a harsh result.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">First, it is true that \u00a7 203(c) can be read, as the Government does, to deal only with those activities which do not trigger the necessity for filing a report rather than with those activities which need not be covered in a report which is otherwise required to be filed. But in explaining this section, the Senate committee report on S.1555 noted that it \u201c[pjrovides that no employer nor any other person shall be required to file a report <em>covering </em>the giving of advice by such person to such employer, representing the employer before any court * * S.Rep.No.187, 86th Cong., 1st Sess. 40 (1959), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News 1959, p. 2356, I Leg. Hist. (NLRB) 436. (Emphasis added.) Second, S.1555, as reported, required a single annual report containing (1) the name of the persuader, (2) receipts of any kind on account of labor relations advice and services, (3) disbursements of any kind in connection with such services, and (4) a detailed statement of the terms of such agreement. There was no indication that items (2) and (3) were to pertain to agreements other than those referred to in item (4).<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> On the floor S.1555 was amended to require a 30-day rather than an annual report. In Conference, it was agreed to require both a 30-day and an annual report, with items (1) and (4) being required in the 30-day report and items (2) and (3) in the annual one. It does not appear that the annual report was to cover agreements not covered by the 30-day report, the sole concern being the timing of the reports. Third, the primary purpose of \u00a7 204 was to protect employer-clients, who do not enter persuader agreements and who thus do not have to report under \u00a7 203 (a), from having their affairs disclosed by attorneys who, as persuaders for other employers, are obligated to report. See note 40, supra, and accompanying text.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">On the other hand, of course, is the fact that the potent weapon to Congress was glaring publicity. One might argue that Congress thought an effective way to discourage lawyers engaging in persuader activities was to disclose to the public intimate details of all of counsel\u2019s labor clients, both persuader and nonper-suader. In time clients who did not believe in such tactics would retain other counsel to achieve secrecy. The difficulty with this is that it does not distinguish between nonpersuader clients who do from those who do not know of the attorney\u2019s persuader work. Nor is it limited in point of time. A client could employ counsel at a time when the attorney performed no persuader work for anyone. And yet in the Government\u2019s reading, the first purposeful (i. e., non accidental) persuader work would trigger during the period the reports for all labor clients, new and old, aware or ignorant of these Congressionally discredited activities. We cannot believe that Congress could have intended to visit such consequences on such non involved employers.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">VIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-10\">As thus construed, we conclude that the reporting requirements do not infringe on any of Appellees\u2019 constitutional rights. Their free-speech, first amendment challenge is foreclosed by United States v. Harriss, 1954, 347 U.S. 612, 74 S.Ct. 808, 98 L.Ed. 989. In view of the fact that this is not a criminal prosecution for wilful failure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>to report and that Appellees\u2019 conduct clearly was that of a persuader, their contention that the reporting provisions are void for vagueness is equally merit-less.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">In reversing the judgment below, we do not attempt to blueprint, or even indicate, what action and relief will be appropriate upon remand. Having our view of the relevant statutory provisions and controlling principles, the District Court will have considerable leeway in disposing of Appellees\u2019 prayer for a declaratory judgment, the Government\u2019s request for an injunction, and in framing any injunctive orders to be entered. After the Government is allowed to complete its discovery, it may well be that as to a number of decisive issues, if not all, it will be entitled to full or partial relief by summary judgment, including appropriate injunctive, declaratory (or both) orders. On the other hand, as a minimum, Appellees are entitled to a declaratory judgment that they need not report activities on behalf of clients for whom they performed no persuader activities. To the extent persuader activities for one or more clients is not made out as a matter of law (on summary judgment or otherwise) Appellees are likewise free within the limits of F.R.

On the other hand, one can readily conceive of a situation where the giving of advice could be said to have the object of direct or indirect persuasion. At first the Department of Labor took the position that the reporting requirements covered an attorney\u2019s undertaking to draft speeches, letters, and other written material which are to be delivered or disseminated by the employer to employees for the purpose of persuading them with regard to the exercise of their rights. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>See Beaird, supra, at 294.

It may often be the case \u2014 and it may be so determined here on remand \u2014 that an attorney will in a single agreement for a single fee undertake to perform both persuader and nonpersuader activities. In such a case, we believe that the entire fee must (but perhaps with appropriate explanation and allocation) be reported in the annual report as payments are made. This gives meaning to the requirement of \u00a7 203(b) that the annual report contain a statement of \u201creceipts of any kind from employers on account of labor relations advice or services.\u201d To the extent that an attorney must report fees for nonpersuader activities on behalf of a client for whom he also performs persuader activities, this interpretation also adopts with respect to such clients, at least, the Government\u2019s position that the performance of persuader activities triggers the necessity to report nonpersuader activities otherwise exempted by \u00a7 203 (c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b380-8\">. The terms of an agreement or arrangement, without more, might well be considered a privileged \u201ccommunication\u201d from the client to the attorney. But where, as here, the agreement has been executed, partially or completely, the nature of the activities actually performed by the attorney can hardly be characterized as a \u201ccommunication\u201d from his client. In this case Appellees are required to report the general nature of what they did, not what they were \u201ctold\u201d to do. Without intimating decision, we would point out that if agency of the attorney for acts performed is denied by the employer-client the privilege as to instructions, express or implied, might not prevent inquiry.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b380-12\">.
