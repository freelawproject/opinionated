O\u2019Brien, in an action on an insurance contract issued by the appellee, Government Employees Insurance Company. Jurisdiction exists by reason of diversity of citizenship. As is conceded by the parties, the law of Virginia governs this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-10\">The allegations of the appellant\u2019s complaint, accepted as fact for purposes of this appeal, show that on June 19, 1964, while stationed with the United States Navy in San Juan, Puerto Rico, the appellant was struck by an uninsured automobile driven by one Thomas Colon-Fantuzzi, a resident of Puerto Rico, who is not a party to this litigation. As a result of the accident, the appellant suffered serious permanent bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-11\">At the time of the accident the appellant was insured by the appellee under a family automobile policy issued to the appellant while he was in Virginia. This policy contained an endorsement, required by the Virginia Uninsured Motorist Act,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (hereinafter the Act) wherein the appel-lee agreed <em>inter alia:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-15\">\u201cTo pay, in accordance with Section 38.1-381 of the Code of Virginia * * all sums which the Insured * * * shall be legally entitled to recover as damages from the owner or operator of an uninsured automobile * * * because of * * * bodily injury * * * sustained by the Insured * * * caused by accident and arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of such uninsured automobile [up to $15,000].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-19\">After the appellee refused appellant\u2019s demand for payment under the endorsement, this action was instituted by the appellant, who had become a Pennsylvania resident subsequent to release from active naval duty. The appellee answered, denying liability on the ground that the appellant failed to establish his legal entitlement to damages from the uninsured motorist in that he had not instituted an action and secured judgment against the motorist, this being a condition precedent to recovery under the policy. On motion by the appellee, the District Court, accepting the argument that under Virginia law a judgment against the motorist was a prerequisite to recovery, granted judgment on the pleadings against the appellant pursuant to Rule 12(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b384-20\">The appellee argues that the phrase \u201clegally entitled\u201d in both the endorsement and the statute <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> clearly denotes the establishment of a judgment in a separate action against the uninsured motorist. The appellant\u2019s construction is that this phrase requires merely that the burden of showing the liability of the uninsured motorist be met by appropriate proof in an action directly against the insurer. The phrase is insufficiently precise to compel either conclusion. Rather, we view the problem as one of deducing the purport of the language from the overall recovery mechanism prescribed by the Act. Consequently we can now dispose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>of two of the appellant\u2019s arguments. The first submission is that since the disputants are parties to a contract, it must be assumed that the appellant can sue his insurer directly unless the statute clearly bars such action. Assuming <em>ar-guendo </em>the correctness of this proposition,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> it does not reach the problem of whether a necessary element of the insurance company\u2019s contractual liability, subsumed by the phrase \u201clegally entitled,\u201d is a judgment against the uninsured motorist. The second argument is that since the statute specifies that nothing may be required of the insured except the establishment of legal liability,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> it follows that there is no warrant to compel him to seek a separate judgment against the motorist when he can offer appropriate proof of legal liability in a direct action against the insurer. Again, however, the argument assumes the very question before <em>us </em>\u2014 viz, what constitutes the establishment of legal liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-19\">The Virginia Uninsured Motorist Act, pertinent parts of which are set out in the margin,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> does not in terms either require or make unnecessary a judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>against the uninsured motorist. Counsel have not cited, nor have we been able to find any Virginia decision dispositive of this point. However, the Act sets forth two separate precedures for bringing an action against an uninsured motorist depending upon whether his identity is known or unknown.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">If the motorist is known, any insured intending to rely upon the endorsement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>must, \u201cif any action is instituted against the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle,\u201d serve process upon the insurer \u201cas though such insurance company were a party defendant.\u201d The insurance company then has a right to defend the action in the name of the defendant or in its own name, but shall not interfere with the known defendant\u2019s right to employ counsel and take appropriate action in his own behalf.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">If, however, the motorist is unknown, he is deemed uninsured,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and the insured may institute suit against him as \u201cJohn Doe,\u201d serving process by delivering a copy of the motion for judgment or other pleadings to the clerk of the court in which the action is brought and by serving such papers on the insurer. The insurer has the right to file pleadings and defend the action in the name of John Doe.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Should the owner or operator of the vehicle causing the injury become known, he may be joined in the action against John Doe.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">The existence of detailed provisions regulating suit by an insured against a known uninsured motorist indicates at the minimum that the Virginia legislature envisioned such a suit as part of the recovery mechanism. Moreover, had a direct action against the insurer been thought to be available, the most obvious situation for its application would have been the case where the motorist was unknown. Yet, for this occurrence the Virginia legislature created a John Doe procedure to simulate, as closely as circumstances will permit, a suit against a known motorist.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The failure of the legislature to employ the much simpler procedure of a direct suit against the insurer negatives its availability. While the appellant argues that the suit against the known motorist or \u201cJohn Doe\u201d is optional because of certain \u201cif\u201d and \u201cmay\u201d language in the statute,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> we think the District Court was clearly right in stating that such a reading would reduce the prescriptive provisions to mere surplusage :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-12\">\u201cIf the plaintiff already had the right to sue the insurance company directly, this court can think of no reason why the General Assembly of Virginia would have enacted the alternative procedure allowing the plaintiff to proceed against a fictional person. It would be especially absurd here where it is an avenue that is more cumbersome than making the insurance company the actual defendant.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-13\">The District Court also reasoned that the purpose of the John Doe procedure was to prevent the jury from being informed of the existence of insurance coverage so as to avoid prejudgment on the question of liability, and that the appellant\u2019s position would subvert this policy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-14\">\u201cThere can be no other reason for the John Doe procedure than to preserve Virginia\u2019s policy against informing the jury of the existence of insurance in a case of this kind. See Simmons v. Boyd, 199 Va. 806, 102 S.E.2d 292 (1958) ; Rhinehart &amp; Dennis Co. v. Brown, 137 Va. 670, 120 S.E. 269 (1923); 47 Va.L.Rev. 145, 159-60 (1961). It is difficult to imagine therefore that the legislature intended to vitiate this longstanding policy by allowing a plaintiff to sue the insurance company directly if the alleged tortfeasor is known when at the same time it was enacting the John <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>Doe scheme, the only purpose of which was to keep the fact of insurance from the minds of the jury.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">In answer to this persuasive position the appellant argues that the District Court overlooked a vital distinction between the case where the motorist is known and that where he is unknown. In the latter the prejudice to the insurer is said to be vastly greater because of (1) increased sympathy for the plaintiff in a hit-and-run case<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and (2) the absence of the most important witness for the insurance company, the defendant motorist. While the appellant\u2019s appreciation of the insurance company\u2019s increased disadvantage is for the most part correct, it is clear that the Virginia policy against notifying the jury of insurance coverage both antedates the unknown motorist problem and has been generally applied in cases where the alleged tort-feasor is known and is in fact the party defendant.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Moreover, strong evidence of this policy is found in Section 8-96 of the Virginia Code,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> prohibiting the joinder of an insurance company as a party in a negligence action on account of its issuance of liability insurance to a party to that action. Simply put, there is every indication that the Virginia General Assembly did not intend to restrict the insurer\u2019s anonymity to the John Doe action.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">Finally, the appellant advances two other points which we find without merit. First he argues that under \u00a7 38.1-381 (g) of the Act the <em>insurer </em>shall not be restricted from \u201c \u2018instituting legal proceedings\u2019 * * * against the uninsured motorist.\u201d However, that section in fact states that the <em>insured </em>shall not be so restricted. Then the appellant argues that it cannot be presumed that the Act contemplates two suits for the vindication of the insured\u2019s rights. But the Virginia Supreme Court has made it clear that absent agreement, two suits may indeed be necessary.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-11\">We also note that Virginia\u2019s sister state, South Carolina, has enacted an Uninsured Motorists Act,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> modeled after the Virginia Act, which contains provisions, including a John Doe procedure, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>identical to the Virginia Act in all respects material to the present case. Although the courts of that state have not passed upon the identical question involved here, there is no doubt that they view a judgment against the motorist as necessary to a suit against the insurer on the contract.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> For example, in Laird v. Nationwide Ins. Co.,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> the Supreme Court of South Carolina stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-4\">\u201cRecovery under the uninsured endorsement is subject to the condition that the insured establish legal liability on the part of the uninsured motorist. Such an action is one <em>ex delicto </em>and the only issues to be determined therein are the liability and the amount of damage. After judgment is entered against the uninsured motorist, a direct action <em>ex contractu </em>can be brought to recover from the insurance company on its endorsement, and policy defenses may be properly raised by the insurance company. Doe v. Brown, 203 Va. 508,125 S.E.2d 159; Rodgers v. Danko, 204 Va. 140, 129 S.E.2d 828.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-11\">And in Vernon v. Harleysville Mut. Cas. Co.,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> the obligation of the insurance company under the statute was characterized as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-12\">\u201c[T]he endorsement guarantees payment, within specified limits, of a judgment recovered against an uninsured motorist on his tort liability.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-13\">Language reflecting this same conception of the operation of the act can be found in many other opinions.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-14\">Absent any definitive pronouncement of the Virginia courts settling the issue posed herein,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> we are constrained to think that they would hold that recovery under the Virginia Act and thus under the endorsement requires that the insured first obtain judgment against the uninsured motorist. Hence the judgment of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania dismissing the appellant\u2019s action on the pleadings will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b384-12\">.

A John Doe action need not always involve a hit and run case since it has been held that a motorist may be \u201cunknown\u201d if the insured under certain circumstances fails to take his name at the scene of the accident.

The Virginia policy against disclosure of insurance coverage is not, however, inflexible, but is tempered by an appreciation that many jurors will assume the involvement of some insurance coverage even without being told so. Thus disclosure to the jury may not necessarily constitute reversible error. Ames &amp; Webb, Inc. v. Commercial Laundry Co., Inc., 204 Va. 616, 133 S.E.2d 547 (1963) ; Simmons v. Boyd, 199 Va. 806, 102 S.E.2d 292 (1958). However, the problem here is not one of deciding what constitutes <em>reversible </em>error <em>after </em>a trial has taken place, but one of recognizing that as long as it be error, it should be obviated before trial. In particular, the foregoing cases place emphasis on whether the disclosure of insurance coverage was purposeful or inadvertent and on whether the insurance company\u2019s precise role as the loss-bearer was made known to the jury. Not only would both these elements be present were we to allow a direct suit here against the insurer, but also it should be noted that in the <em>Simmons </em>and <em>Commercial Laundry </em>cases, sujira, there was an actual defendant other than the insurance company involved, while here the insurance company would be the only defendant and the center of the jury\u2019s focus.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b388-13\">.

We are aware of incidental problems in the multistate application of the Virginia Uninsured Motorist Act due to the failure of that Act to address itself to such application under certain circumstances. For example, if the motorist here were unknown, the appellant could have brought a John Doe action in Virginia and thus avoided Puerto Rican litigation. Hodgson v. Doe, 203 Va. 938, 128 S.E.2d 444 (1962). In light of a Virginia decision that a motorist may be \u201cunknown\u201d if only because the insured failed, in certain circumstances, to get his name at the scene of the accident, Mangus v. Doe, supra note 15, our decision disallowing a direct suit against the insurer may encourage fraudulent claims that the motorist was unknown, for the purpose of avoiding the trouble and expense of distant litigation through the institution of a John Doe action. This would also result in the insurer\u2019s being denied the name of the adverse motorist, its best potential witness.
