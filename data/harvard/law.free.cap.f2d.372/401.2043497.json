In the post-remand proceedings, the Commission, treating the petitioner\u2019s \u201cgrandfather application\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as a <em>de novo </em>request, heard additional testimony and received additional exhibits to supplement the record originally before the Commission. Petitioner and protestant-in-tervenors were afforded an opportunity to \u201cpresent anything at all in reference to these particular findings.\u201d Acting on the entire record, the Commission concluded that petitioner was not bona fide engaged in the transportation of passengers in motor vehicles with a seating capacity in excess of eight passengers, exclusive of the driver, on or before March 22, 1961. Upon this finding, the Commission denied petitioner\u2019s application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-19\">The Commission concluded that the record established petitioner\u2019s business to be that of operating a sightseeing business by limousine and, as such, not transportation by bus within the terms of the grandfather clause of the Compact. The Commission reviewed the evidence before it, evaluated it and set forth its reasoning in two opinions with accompanying orders, No. 554, dated December 29, 1965, and No. 573, dated February 25, 1966. We are satisfied that the Commission\u2019s finding adequately took into account those factors outlined in our prior decision for its consideration and that its decision is otherwise supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-20\">Finally, we note that the Commission concedes that appellant may continue to operate in the future a sightseeing business by limousine, as well as with buses and drivers supplied by licensed bus operators. The decision of the Commission is, therefore, affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b450-10\">. Holiday Tours, Inc. v.
