He has appealed from his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">He contends that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 544 under which he was charged and convicted fails to define or vaguely or uncertainly defines the act or commission it purports to denounce and punish, in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and the right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation provision of the Sixth Amendment. Section 544 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-9\">\u201cIf any merchandise entered or withdrawn for exportation without payment of the duties thereon, or with intent to obtain a drawback of the duties paid, or of any other allowances given by law on the exportation thereof, is re-landed at any place in the United States without entry having been made, such merchandise shall be considered as having been imported into the United States contrary to law, and each person <em>concerned </em>shall be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than two years, or both; and such merchandise shall be forfeited.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-10\">The principal attack is on the use in Section 544 of the word \u201cconcerned\u201d in describing the prohibited acts of persons engaged in the unlawful importation of merchandise into the United States. Appellant contends that the statute thus does not provide an ascertainable standard of guilt adequate to inform persons accused of violating it of the nature and cause of the accusation against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-13\"> However, we do not agree that in this context use of the word \u201cconcerned\u201d is vague or indefnite, for it is evident that under the general terms of the criminal statute \u201cconcerned\u201d refers to each person \u201cinvolved,\u201d \u201caffected,\u201d \u201chaving a connecting relation,\u201d \u201can active or real part,\u201d \u201ca marked interest or regard arising through a personal relationship to the matter under consideration.\u201d We have no difficulty, therefore, understanding the ordinary and usual meaning of the word \u201cconcerned.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (4th ed.), Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-14\">It is not unusual to employ the word \u201cconcerned\u201d in criminal statutes to refer to persons who are participants in the prohibited acts denounced. An Arkansas court has held that the word \u201cconcerned\u201d as used in the criminal statute prohibiting unlawful sale of intoxicating liquors has the meaning of the word \u201cparticipants.\u201d State v. Bach Liquor Co., 55 S.W. 854, 856, 67 Ark. 163. An English statute punished every person who shall unship or assist or \u201cbe otherwise concerned in the unshipping of any goods which are prohibited to be imported.\u201d This statute was held to apply to the owner of a vessel who knowingly let his vessel be employed in a smuggling adventure. Attorney General v. Robson, 5 Exch. 790, 155 Eng.Repts. 346 [4 Eng.Law &amp; Eq. 405, 406]. An accused having commenced an altercation which later provoked the shooting in an ensuing dispute of some Mexicans by a companion was \u201cconcerned\u201d in the crime within the meaning of the California penal provision which provides that \u201cAll persons concerned in the commission of a crime, * * * whether they directly commit the act constituting the offense, or aid and abet in its commission, * * * are principals in any crime so committed.\u201d People v. Marty, 59 Cal.App. 503, 210 P. 964, 965. See also People v. Descant, 51 Cal.App.2d 343, 124 P.2d 864, 867, relating to a California statute punishing as principals all persons \u201cconcerned\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>with passing fictitious checks. A Virginia court held an accused guilty as being \u201cconcerned\u201d in managing a lottery who had possession of an envelope containing cash and numbers tickets evidencing chances in a lottery. Motley v. Commonwealth, 177 Va. 806, 14 S.E.2d 28, 29. In Connecticut, a person who furnished facilities for gambling on horse racing and assisted in transmission of money in the course of such business was held to be \u201cconcerned\u201d in the business within the meaning of the criminal statute prohibiting such gambling or being \u201cconcerned\u201d with it. State v. Harbourne, 70 Conn. 484, 40 A. 179, 182, 40 L.R.A. 607. In another Connecticut case, it was held that a person is \u201cconcerned\u201d in a matter relating to the statute penalizing any person \u201cconcerned in buying or selling\u201d a gambling pool when he has some connection with it and when it affects his interest or involves him. State v. Fico, 147 Conn. 426, 162 A.2d 697, 700. In Pennsylvania, \u201cconcerned in,\u201d as used in the statute prohibiting lottery, was held to mean \u201csubstantially engaged in\u201d and also \u201ctaking part in.\u201d Commonwealth v. Bufalini, 200 Pa.Super. 85, 186 A.2d 645, 648. In Maryland, the word \u201cconcerned\u201d was held to mean \u201c[r] elating to; pertaining to; affecting; involving; being substantially engaged in or taking part in.\u201d Jones v. State, 207 Md. 481, 115 A.2d 273, 276. In United States v. Scott, Cir.Ct., D.Ky.1895, 74 F. 213, the Court construed similar language in a criminal statute relating to solicitation of assessments for political purposes as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-4\">\u201c \u2018Being concerned in\u2019 is not a legal term or conclusion which needs a specification of facts for completeness of description. It is a colloquial expression, equivalent to \u2018being engaged in,\u2019 or \u2018taking part in,\u2019 and sufficiently informs the defendant of what the government intends to prove.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">A reasonable construction of the statute, therefore, compels a holding that the offenses referred to are definite and there is no unconstitutionality, for the word \u201cconcerned\u201d has wide use in criminal statutes and its definition is clear and well known. Cf. Screws v. United States, 325 U.S. 91, 65 S.Ct. 1031, 89 L.Ed. 1495 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
