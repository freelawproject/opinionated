Appellant is an applicant for a pension from the Fund. The Trustees denied his application on the ground that he had not established proof of twenty years\u2019 classified service in the Bituminous Coal Industry within the 25-year period immediately preceding his application for a pension. In the District Court the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>Trustees abandoned<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> this basis for denial of appellant\u2019s application, and urged his age at the time the application was filed as a bar. The District Court, after a trial <em>de novo, </em>dismissed appellant\u2019s claim for relief on this latter ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">In Danti v. Lewis, 114 U.S.App.D.C. 105, 312 F.2d 345 (1962), this court held that \u201cthe District Court\u2019s duty was to determine whether the material then before the Trustees was sufficient to support their decision,\u201d and not to try \u201cthe ease <em>de novo </em>on a factual issue not presented in the administrative record before it * * 114 U.S.App.D.C. at 109, 110, 312 F.2d at 349, 350. Under the circumstances, this court has no alternative but to vacate the judgment of the District Court and remand the case with instructions to remand it to the Trustees for resolution of the factual issue determined <em>de novo </em>by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">Since the Trustees perform their function as such pursuant to an Act of Congress in an area of social concern and importance, not only to miners like appellant who have applied for pensions, but to future applicants as well whose pension rights may be jeopardized by depletion of the Fund through improper disposition thereof, the proceedings before the Trustees should conform to at least elemental requirements of fairness, which requirements in these circumstances normally include, in addition to notice, a hearing at which the applicant is confronted by the evidence against him, an opportunity to present evidence in his own behalf, articulated findings and conclusions having a substantial basis in the evidence taken as a whole, and a reviewable record. If the Trustees for some reason are unable or unwilling to comply with these fairness requirements, in the interest of proper and prompt disposition of these pension claims, it may become necessary to reconsider our ruling in <em>Danti.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">So ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">TAMM, Circuit Judge, dissents.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b449-19\">. Apparently because of this court\u2019s opinion in Kosty v. Lewis, 115 U.S.App.D.C. 343, 319 F.2d 744 (1963).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
