Recovery is predicated on charges of unseaworthiness of the Ver-charmian and, particularly, of her boatswain\u2019s negligence in not warning Davila that the hatch was open. Also included were claims for maintenance and statutory penalties for \u201cwaiting time\u201d \u2014 delay in payment of wages. 46 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 596, 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">The admiralty judge denied all the claims and dismissed the libel. From his determination of no unseaworthiness or negligence, with refusal of damages, Davila appeals. We affirm on the findings and conclusions stated and filed by the District Judge. Davila v. SS Ver-charmian, 247 F.Supp. 617 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
