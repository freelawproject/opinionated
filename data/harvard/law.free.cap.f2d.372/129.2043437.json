He asserts uneonstitutionality of the relevant statutes of North Carolina and the applicable sections of Charlotte\u2019s Housing Code as arbitrary and unreasonable. This is premised upon a construction of their requirement of a building permit as a prerequisite to any and all repairs, however trivial, by a householder to his residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-15\">If the code was applied administratively to require formal permits for trivial repairs, a serious question of its constitutionality, as applied, would arise, but this record does not present the question. The repair and remodeling work undertaken by Walker was both major and extensive, and well within the reasonable reach of the code.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-16\">For the reasons stated in the opinion of the District Court,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> we find no unconstitutional infirmity in the building code as applied in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-17\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b178-25\"> Walker v.
