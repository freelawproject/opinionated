The three errors which he alleges all stem from a single contention, namely, that he was not proved to have had actual or constructive possession of the marihuana which he was charged with having obtained or otherwise acquired. We find no merit in this contention. On the contrary, the evidence presented to the jury by the Government disclosed a classical case of constructive possession by Gonzalez in which marihuana in the custody of de la Paz was completely subject to Gonzalez\u2019s disposal and was actually delivered at his direction to a federal narcotic agent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>by de la Paz. The district court did not err in instructing the jury as to the law of constructive possession, in permitting the marihuana in question to be offered in evidence, or in denying Gonzalez's motion for a directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
