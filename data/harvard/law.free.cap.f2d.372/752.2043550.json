Admittedly the Board's witnesses were not of the best, and unfortunately the examiner\u2019s report, which was accepted by the Board, offended somewhat our often repeated admonition that the examiner\u2019s primary duty is to make specific findings. It is appropriate to recite what various witnesses testified to, but at some point a resolution must be made. It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>not very helpful to say, \u201cWe need not credit fully * * * testimony * * * <em>in haee verba </em>* * * [of what respondent\u2019s manager said with respect to union activities.] But the Union * * * [was clearly in the manager\u2019s] mind * * Since his mind was disclosed only by what he said, the natural question is, to what extent was credit extended to the witnesses, if not fully?</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\"> On the other hand, the Board\u2019s case is to be measured in the light of respondent\u2019s. The examiner found that respondent\u2019s \u201ctestimony is marked by serious omissions and, to the extent that it was given, was fanciful to an extreme.\u201d This observation was well warranted. In such circumstances we will overlook some criticisms of the Board\u2019s case which, in all candor, we would not otherwise have done. We think on the record as a whole that the examiner sufficiently found the requisite state of mind on respondent\u2019s part.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">No useful purpose would be served in discussing the case in any greater detail. An order of enforcement will be made.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
