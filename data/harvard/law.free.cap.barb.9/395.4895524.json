The plea was non-assumpsit, accompanied with an affidavit of the defendant, alledging that no notice of nonpayment of said note had been received by him. The cause was tried before Justice Harris, at the St. Lawrence circuit, in June, 1849. The plaintiff gave in evidence a promissory note, made by Jacob M. Schriver, dated 20th September, 1834, for $808,71, payable six months after date to the order of James Jessup (the defendant) at the Ogdensburgh Bank, and indorsed James Jessup, \u00a1Edwin Church, T. L. Knapp. The question litigated on the trial was, whether the plaintiff had taken the requisite steps to charge the defendant, as indorser of the note. To prove this, John W. Judson, the teller of the bank, was introduced as a witness, and testified that when the note became due, in March, 1835, he was teller of the said bank, and clerk of David C. Judson, who was then a notary public. The witness testified that from the entries made by him in the memorandum book of the notary, it appeared that the note was presented at the hank for payment on the 2-3d March, 1835, and payment was refused, and that on the same day notice thereof was deposited in the post office at Ogdensburgh, addressed to the defendant, at his residence in B'rockville, in Canada. The hook of the notary was produced, in which these entries were contained, in the hand-writing of the witness. The usual course was for the notary to furnish a blank certificate of protest, signed by him, and the witness as his clerk filled it up as occasion required. It was so done in this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>The witness knew the fact that the maker had no funds in the bank; <em>but had no recollection of the demand or notice. </em>The plaintiff's counsel proposed to give the book in evidence. This was objected to, as being a mere private memorandum, and not admissible; but the judge admitted it, not as evidence <em>per se, </em>but as a book that might be referred to as the ground upon which the witness stated he did the act. The defendant\u2019s counsel excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-6\">The witness further testified that the notary was still living. The witness, as his clerk, was in the daily habit of protesting notes, and kept the book now produced, in which he made the entries in question. It was his usual practice to make the entries the same day he delivered the notices. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel then asked the witness what entries were made in said book in relation to the note in question. The defendant\u2019s counsel objected, but the judge decided that the entries were admissible, and competent to be read to the jury to show the grounds upon which the witness based his testimony; to' which the defendant\u2019s counsel again excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-7\">The witness thereupon read the entries from the book as follows : \u201c23 March, 1835, noticed James Jessup, Brockville, Edwin Church, Prescott, T. L. Knapp, Brownsville, indorsers, J. M. Schriver note for $808,71. Mo tice depos\u2019d in P. 0.\u201d The witness testified\u2014\u201c These are the notices. I deposited them in the post office according to the entry.\u201d Being further examined, the witness testified that he had no recollection of making the entries. \u201c I recognize them by the hand-writing, and <em>I know that the entries would not have been made if I had not done what is there stated. </em>I always presented the notes for non-payment before I protested.\u201d The notices sent purported to be signed by the notary. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel then proved the genuineness of the signatures of the several indorsers, and the amount due, and rested; and the learned judge thereupon charged the jury, \u201c that if they believed upon what had been stated to them by the witness Judson, that the note was presented, and the notices were sent as he stated, they should find for the plaintiff for the amount of the note.\u201d The defendant\u2019s counsel excepted to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>charge. The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff for $1614,89, the amount of the note; and the defendant moved for a new trial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b398-6\"><em>C. </em>G. <em>Myers, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b398-7\"><em>A.

Although, as remarked by Ch. J. Spencer, in <em>Bank of Utica </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>(18 <em>John. </em>240,) the law does not require the intervention of a notary to make a demand of payment, or to give notice of the non-payment of a note, yet these officers are in'the practice of doing so; and being commissioned by the government, their official acts are of a more solemn nature than those of individuals ; for the same reasons a notice of non-payment by a notary is also available; and it is the constant and uniform course, sanctioned by a long and continued usage. Since the case of the <em>Bank of Utica </em>v. <em>Smith, {supra,) </em>was decided, the powers and duties of these officers have been declared by statute. (2 <em>R. S. </em>283.) By the 44th section they have authority to demand acceptance and payment of foreign bills of exchange and to protest the same for non-acceptance and non-payment; and to exercise such other powers and duties, as by the law of nations, and according to commercial usage, or by the laws of any other state, government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>or country may be performed by notaries public. The 45th sec- \u25a0 tion declares that they may demand acceptance of inland bills of exchange, and payment thereof, arid of promissory notes, and may protest the same for non-acceptance or non-payment, as the case may require. But neither such protest, nor any note thereof, made by any notary in this state, shall be evidence in any court of this state, of any facts therein contained, except in the cases specified in the next section. The section alluded to is in these words : \u201c \u00a7 46. In case of the death or insanity of any notary public, or of his absence or removal, so that his personal attendance, or his testimony, can not be procured in any mode provided by law, the original protest of such notary, under his official seal, upon such seal and his signature being duly proved, shall be presumptive evidence of the fact, of any demand of acceptance or of payment, therein stated.\u201d The 47th section declares that any note or memorandum made by a notary public, in his own hand-writing, or signed by him at the foot of any protest, or in a regular register of official acts kept by him, shall in the cases specified in the last section, be presumptive evidence of the fact of any notice of non-acceptance or non-payment having been sent or delivered, at the time and in the manner stated in such note or memorandum. It was afterwards deemed expedient to make a notarial certificate of protest of promissory notes and bills of exchange presumptive evidence of the facts therein contained. This was done by the 8th section of the act of 1833, page 395, but it was expressly declared not to apply to any case in which the defendant should annex to his plea an affidavit denying the fact of having received notice of non-acceptance or of non-payment of such note or bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">The memorandum book was not evidence as the act of the notary, within the statute, because the notary was still living, and perhaps present in court, and because the entries were not made by him, nor were the acts done by him which the entries were intended to attest. Had the notary been examined as a witness he could have proved nothing material to the point in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">Neither the revised statutes, nor the act of 1833, recognize <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>the acts of the clerk of a notary, and the eighth section of the latter statute, in declaring the effect of the notarial certificate, uses language which seemsffo imply that the act which itauthenticates must be the personal act of the notary himself. It says, \u201c in all actions at law, the certificate of a notary under his hand and seal of office, of the presentment by i-iim of any promissory note, dec. shall be presumptive evidence of the facts contained in such certificate.\u201d The supreme court, in <em>The Onondaga County Bank </em>v. Bates, (3 <em>Hill, </em>53,) held, upon this statute, that a notarial certificate which stated that the notary <em>caused </em>the note to be presented for payment, was insufficient. They held that the statute contemplated that the act which the notary is authorized to certify, must be his own personal act, and not the act of his clerk, or of a third person. It results from this construction of the statute, that when it is intended that the notarial certificate of the pretest of a promissory note or inland bill of exchange, shall be used as the evidence of the facts therein contained, the acts which it attests must he those of the notary, and of him alone. . We think this is the correct construction of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">But a promissory note may be as well protested by a private citizen as by a notary. In the present case the note was protested by the teller of the bank, who was the clerk also of the-notary. It is presumed, though not stated, that the notary was the cashier of the bank. If the regular steps to charge the indorser-were taken by the teller, acting as clerk of the notary, they would be as effectual as if done by the notary himself. The only difference is in the mode of proof by which the fact is to be established. Had it been done by the notary in person, his entries in his register, signed by him, would have been secondary evidence, and presumptive evidence of the fact, in case of his death, insanity, absence or removal. But as the demand and notice were made and given by the teller, and not the notary, they do not fall within the purview of the statute, and must be proved by such evidence as is admissible at common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">The memorandum book of the notary was kept by the witness, and the entries were in the hand-writing of the latter, and were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>made at the time. It may be treated, therefore, for this purpose, as the memorandum book of the witness. It was not received as evidence <em>per se, </em>but the exception was taken to its admissibility for any purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">The cases where a witness is allowed to refresh his memory by referring to memoranda or entries, are in general of \u201ctwo kinds. (1.) Where the witness by referring to the paper, has his memory actually revived, so that he swears to an actual recollection of the facts. In this case, the paper thus used may be one made after the transaction, may be a copy and not an original, and need not be produced in court. (2.) When the witness, after referring to the paper, undertakes to swear positively to the fact; yet not because he remembers it, but because of the confidence he has in the paper; and here the paper must be produced to the court, must be an original, and made about the time of the occurrence. <em>(See </em>1 <em>Smith\u2019s Leading Cases, </em>286.) The case at bar falls under the latter head. It was therefore properly received by the learned judge. The oath of the party was the primary substantive evidence relied on. The credibility of the oath, however, depending on the justness of the witness\u2019s reliance on the written memorandum, the latter must be produced for inspection by the court and jury. It is required to be an original and contemporaneous entry. The doctrine on this subject is discussed by Cowen, J. in <em>Merrill </em>v. <em>Ithaca and Owego Railroad Co. </em>(6 <em>Wend. </em>586, 598.) See also <em>The Bank of Monroe </em>v. <em>Culver, </em>(2 <em>Hill, </em>531;) <em>Brewster </em>v. <em>Dana, (Id. </em>537;) <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Goldsmith, </em>(7 <em>Wend. </em>160;) 2 <em>Smith\u2019s Leading Cases, </em>282, <em>et seq. note to Price </em>v. <em>Torrington.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">There is another class of cases, where original entries have been made in the usual course of business, and are authenticated as such by the oath of the person who made them, though he can remember and testify to nothing about the facts recorded in the entries; in which cases such entries, thus verified by the oath of the person who made them, are admissible primary evidence of those facts, during the life of the witness. (1 <em>Smith\u2019s Leading Cases, </em>286. <em>Bank of Monroe </em>v. <em>Culver, </em>2 <em>Hill, </em>535, <em>and cases supra.) </em>But as the learned judge did not receive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>the hook in that manner, and to that extent, it is unnecessary to pursue the inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">I think the decision at the circuit was right, and that the motion for a new trial should he denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">New trial denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
