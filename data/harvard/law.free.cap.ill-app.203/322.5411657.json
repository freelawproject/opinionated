They resided with their mother for about a year, when she married one Bryant, a British subject, since which time they lived with her and Bryant at their home in Lake Forest, Illinois. About two years and seven months later, the defendant filed a petition praying that the care and custody of the children be changed to himself. After extended hearing the prayer was denied, but the decree was modified so as to give the defendant the right to visit and talk with the children and be with them on Saturday of each week from twelve o\u2019clock noon to six o\u2019clock in the evening free from interference or espionage of their mother or her agents, servants or others in her behalf, to be delivered to petitioner and returned by him at a specified place, with special provisions as to sickness, vacations, failure of petitioner to meet the children, etc. The order expressed the court\u2019s intent eventually upon proper showing to give the petitioner the right to have charge and control of the children at night as well as during the day, and also directed that they should be known by their father\u2019s name. The order found petitioner had become a sober, temperate man.</p><headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AJP\" pgmap=\"347\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AdI\" pgmap=\"347\">1.
