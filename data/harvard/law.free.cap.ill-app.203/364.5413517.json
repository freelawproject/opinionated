In an action by an employee against his employer, a corporation, to recover wages, where it appeared that plaintiff was in defendant\u2019s employ for seven or eight years and had been paid up to the time of leaving the employment without any question being raised as to certain absences from work, which were known to the employer and were in part with consent of the employer\u2019s president, and more than a year after his last absence the employer rendered him a statement of account which included the periods of absence, but without any deduction from his wages because thereof, and no objection on account of such absences was raised until after he had left the employment, evidence held sufficient to sustain the finding of the jury in favor of the plaintiff that no deductions from his salary for his periods of absence should be made.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b388-6\" pgmap=\"388\">Error to the Municipal Court of Chicago^ the Hon.
