Voorhees, complainant, against Truman A. Mason (Hannah E. Mason, executrix, substituted) and five others, defendants, for an accounting by the defendants as directors of a corporation in which complainant was also a stockholder. From a decree for accounting, defendants appeal and also bring error to review the whole record.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AO-G\" pgmap=\"652(172) 653(322) 654(17)\">The bill alleged the defendants had issued to themselves individually each thirty shares of stock in the corporation, each share of the par value of ten dollars and thirty income certificates, each of the par value of two hundred and ninety dollars, at one-half of the established price thereof, and that they had received ten per cent, commission on the par value of other shares of stock and income certificates sold by them. Their answer admitted these facts, but sought to justify by stating they were so authorized by a vote of the stockholders on account of compensation to them for services rendered. The bill was dismissed on hearing, but, on \"an appeal to the Appellate Court (148 Ill. App. 647), an accounting was directed, with order to charge each defendant with full price of stock and certificates held by each and dividends thereon and one-half dividends paid. On further appeal the Supreme Court (245 Ill. 256) remanded the case on other grounds, without reversing the order for accounting. A cross-bill was then filed claiming discharge of liability, and on demurrer- thereto being overruled the original bill was dismissed, but on appeal the Appellate Court (182 Ill. App. 569) sustained the demurrer and dismissed the cross-bill and ordered accounting as in first decree. March 2,1914, the case was referred to a master in chancery to state an account under such decree. January 13, 1915, the defendants filed a petition to modify the decree as to the value of the certificates and interest, and a new decree was entered, adhering to the former as to stating.an account of the stock and certificates, and directing a statement also of further details. Accounts were stated accordingly, showing particular amounts chargeable against each defendant as to stock, certificates and commissions, and that under the contracts for the stock and certificates payment after the first four payments, which amounted to the stock value at par, was voluntary. Decree was then rendered confirming report as conforming to the decree of March 2, 1914, and that the corporation recover the amount stated from each defendant, with interest. The board of directors thereupon, by majority vote, caused entry of a release of this money decree in favor of the corporation for the expressed consideration of one dollar, with a release to the corporation of all claims by the defendants for services rendered. Petition was filed by complainant alleging that the corporation because of the revolution in Mexico, where its properties were located, was worthless except for assets recoverable under the decree in this suit, and asking receiver and injunction against defendants from prosecuting suit for services passed upon by the former decree and order, and that the satisfaction of the decree be canceled. Decree was entered \u00e9xpunging the satisfaction of the former decree of record, allowing injunction as prayed, and appointing trustee to collect the proceeds of that decree; also denying complainant\u2019s prayer for solicitor\u2019s fees and expenses in the litigation.</p><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AY8a\" pgmap=\"654\">Abstract of the Becision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"A3K\" pgmap=\"654\">1.

Where the law compelled continued prosecution of a suit against the directors of a corporation for an accounting by them of the corporate funds for the benefit of the corporation, although prosecuted by a single small stockholder and against the wishes of the directors, officers, and all the other stockholders, held that neither the officers nor all of the stockholders, except the complainant, may release a decree rendered in such suit requiring the defendants to pay an account stated by a former decree therein as due from them to the corporation, and the confession by the corporation of errors assigned for reversal of a decree canceling such release would not warrant reversal of said decree.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"A9C\" pgmap=\"654(44) 655(114)\">2.

Where certain so-called income certificates issued by a corporation were treated by it as having a certain fixed value, although they had in fact technically no par, market or intrinsic value, and were so treated and acted upon by the court in rendering a decree against the directors of the corporation for an accounting as to such certificates, and an account stated was made in such decree upon the basis of such accepted value, held that the question that said certificates were of less value could not be raised in a subsequent proceeding on writ of error or appeal, and that the effect of a provision in. the contract under which such certificates were issued that payment on the certificates should be optional after certain partial payments had been made could not be questioned for the first time in such subsequent proceeding.</headnotes><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b654-5\" pgmap=\"654\">.
