St. Supp. 1916, \u00b65475(1) et seq.], wherein an award of $3,500 was made as compensation for the death of one Charles Brichacek.

Where the evidence before the Industrial Board upon which an award was based was conflicting as to whether the deceased was engaged in the course of his employment when he was killed, but was sufficient from which to reasonably infer that he was then so employed, held, on a petition for a writ of certiorari to review such award, that as the statute has conferred on said Board the sole right to pass upon questions of fact and the credibility of witnesses, the Appellate Court was powerless to disturb its findings, notwithstanding the Board attached undue weight to suspicious circumstances.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AqLv\" pgmap=\"456\">2.
