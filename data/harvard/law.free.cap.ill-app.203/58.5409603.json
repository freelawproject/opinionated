Where no proposition of law was submitted to the court trying a case without a jury, the only questions to be determined on assignment of errors are whether the court erred in its rulings on admission and refusal of evidence and whether the competent evidence in the record sustains the findings and judgment.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"A8f\" pgmap=\"83\">2.

On trial by the court without a jury, it is presumed the court only considered the competent evidence, and if such evidence sustains the court\u2019s finding and judgment, it is sufficient notwithstanding the court received incompetent evidence.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"ALz\" pgmap=\"83\">3.

Where plaintiff and defendant entered into a contract for exchange of lands which was fully executed by plaintiff but defendant failed to furnish an abstract showing his title to be good, as required by the contract, and plaintiff thereafter entered into a second contract with a third party for an exchange of the same lands he was to receive from defendant, which contained a like provision that plaintiff should furnish an abstract showing the title to said lands to be good, held, in an action on the first contract, on trial by the court without a jury, that the court properly found the second contract did not abrogate the first contract, and defendant was not relieved from his obligation under the first contract to furnish an abstract showing good title merely by reason of the second contract.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"ANp\" pgmap=\"83\">4.
