Where, in a suit in chancery, an order was entered requiring a- special commissioner to file his report by a certain date, held that it devolved upon the parties to close their proof within the time limited by the order, or so much earlier as to enable the commissioner to comply with the order to file his report, and upon the parties\u2019 failure so to close their proof and of the commissioner to file his report, that the cause might properly be dismissed for want of prosecution.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"Abv4\" pgmap=\"325\">3.
