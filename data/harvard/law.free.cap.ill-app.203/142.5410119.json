Witnesses, \u00a7 253<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when -weight of is for jury. The fact that a witness\u2019 testimony may not be of much weight because of remoteness does not destroy its competency, and its weight is for the jury.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"Av0\" pgmap=\"167\">3. Intoxicating liquors, \u00a7 249<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when instruction in language of statute in action for death of minor is not erroneous. Giving an instruction in the language of the statute, section 9 of the Dramshop Act (J. &amp; A. f 4609), in an action for the death of a minor due to intoxication and not directing a verdict, is not improper.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"AN0\" pgmap=\"167\">4. Intoxicating liquors, \u00a7 250<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when instruction authorising allowance of exemplary damages in action for death of minor is not erroneous. Where in an action for death under the Dramshop Act, see. 9 (J. &amp; A. If 4609), the evidence warranted a finding that plaintiff sustained actual damages and that liquor was sold to the deceased, a minor, in violation of statute, held that the defendant could not complain even if an instruction was broad enough to include exemplary damages.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"AOCC\" pgmap=\"167\">5. Intoxicating liquors, \u00a7 233<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014what damages are recoverabte in action for death of minor due to intoxication. The right of recovery under the Dramshop Act, sec. 9 (J. &amp; A. If 4609), for the death of a minor is not limited to the value of the deceased\u2019s wages, but if he contributed to the parent\u2019s support, and if plaintiff is injured in his means of support by reason of the unlawful sale of liquor and consequent intoxication, he may recover whatever loss the jury determines he has sustained.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"Ay2\" pgmap=\"167\">6. Intoxicating liquors, \u00a7 187<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when right of action exists in favor of persons sustaining loss due to intoxication.

Negligence, \u00a7 196<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when proximate cause is question for jury. Where there is evidence tending to show any particular thing could be the proximate cause of an injury, the jury are the judges of what constitutes such proximate cause.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"A-a\" pgmap=\"167(58) 168(16)\">8. Intoxicating liquors, \u00a7 245<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when verdict for damages for death of minor is not excessive. Where the evidence tended to show that the deceased was a good worker, capable of earning $2 a day, contributed much of his wages to the support of the father and the family dependent upon him, was seventeen years and six months old and of industrious habits, held a verdict for $1,500 damages for his death was not excessive.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"Aub\" pgmap=\"168\">9.
