Appeal and error, \u00a7 1411<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when verdict based upon conflicting evidence will not be disturbed. Where the evidence upon a question of fact was sharply conflicting and the verdict of the jury was not against the manifest weight of the evidence, such verdict should not be disturbed, unless other errors in the record require it.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"ANx\" pgmap=\"84(64) 85(36)\">2. Railroads, \u00a7 443<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when instruction on measure of damages in action for damages for construction and operation of road is erroneous. The true measure of damages in an action against a railroad company for damages because of the construction and operation of its road near the plaintiff\u2019s property is the difference in the fair cash market value of the property before and after such construction and operation, and an instruction which directs the jury to fix such damages as they may find them from the evidence, is erroneous and warrants reversal, unless it be supplemented and cured by other instructions.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b84-6\" pgmap=\"84\">Appeal from the City Court of East St. Louis; the Hon.

Instructions, \u00a7 159<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>-\u2014when considered as a series. The instructions given by the court are to be read and considered together, and if when so considered they state the law applicable to the case with substantial correctness, it is sufficient, notwithstanding some one instruction is in itself erroneous.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"Ahk\" pgmap=\"85\">4. Instructions, \u00a7 88<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when instruction as to determination of preponderance of evidence is not reversibly erroneous. An instruction as to determining the preponderance of the evidence should include the number of witnesses as one of the elements to be considered, but the omission of this element is not reversible error except where the element of the number of witnesses is shown to be important.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"A1B\" pgmap=\"85\">5. Appeal and error, \u00a7 1491<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when exclusion of evidence is harmless error.
