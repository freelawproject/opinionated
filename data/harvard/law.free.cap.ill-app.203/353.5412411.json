Where a statement of claim against a guarantor of payment for goods sold to a corporation set up that the goods were delivered \u201cto the defendant\u201d and that suit had been brought against the corporation for the debt, held that the words \u201cto the defendant\u201d were a clerical error and were shown by the entire statement to have referred to the corporation.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AbP\" pgmap=\"379\">2.
