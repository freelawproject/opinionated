In an action by a miner for damages for personal injuries sustained as the result of the collision of a train of empty cars on which he was riding down grade by gravity in a coal mine colliding with a motor-drawn train of empty cars, held that whether a light on the motor was a conspicuous light such as was required by the statute (J. &amp; A. If 7489), and whether the plaintiff would have been able to have observed a light of sufficient brilliancy and have known of the approach of the motor in time to have escaped injury were questions for the jury.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-6\" pgmap=\"188\">Appeal from the Circuit Court of Madison county; the Hon.

Negligence, \u00a7 196<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014what is question for jury. The question of proximate cause of an injury is for the jury.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"AzBP\" pgmap=\"189\">4. Mines and minerals, \u00a7 189<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when instruction quoting statute as to lights on cars is not erroneous. Where the only contention in an action by a miner for personal injuries was whether there was a white light on the front of a motor in a coal mine which struck a train of cars on which he was riding and a verdict was directed upon a finding there was such a light, an instruction quoting the whole of the statute referring to a red light as well as a white one (J. &amp; A. jf 7489), while there was no proof as to a red light, could not have misled the jury and was not objectionable.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"Apd\" pgmap=\"189\">5. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, \u00a7 12<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when instruction as to defenses employer electing not to operate under is deprived of is not erroneous. There is no error in giving an instruction fully advising the jury as to the defenses which an employer is deprived of by its electing not to operate under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, distinguishing the case of Price v. Clover Leaf Coal &amp; Mining Co., 188 Ill. App. 27.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"A0M\" pgmap=\"189\">6. Instructions, \u00a7 107<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when instruction merely presenting plaintiff\u2019s view of case is not erroneous. An instruction which does not direct a verdict but merely presents plaintiff\u2019s view of the case is not erroneous for not including the defense urged by the defendant, particularly where an instruction on behalf of the defendant fully advises the jury as to his rights.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"ABI\" pgmap=\"189\">7. Negligence, \u00a7 237<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when modification of instruction on proximate cause is correct. In an action for negligent injuries, held that an instruction offered by the defendant, to the effect that if the jury found the plaintiff was negligent and that his negligence was the proximate cause of his injury they should find the defendant not guilty, was erroneous, and that the court properly inserted the word \u201csole\u201d before the word \u201cpromixate.\u201d</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"AOu\" pgmap=\"189(21) 190(65)\">8. Damages, \u00a7 122<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when verdict for personal injuries as remitted is not excessive. In an action against an employer for damages for personal injuries, where the plaintiff was shown to have lost a leg and been sick and suffered severe pain for many months, had earned .a salary of $100. a month, and by the injury was wholly disabled from performing the work he was accustomed to or had prepared to perform, held that a verdict for $15,000 as remitted to $9,500, was not excessive.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
