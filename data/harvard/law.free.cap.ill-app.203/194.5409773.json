The action of the trial court in an action on a promissory note in finding against the defenses of lack of consideration and release from all liability cannot be considered on review where the defendants have not assigned cross errors.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AYg\" pgmap=\"219\">2.

In an action by a seller of good\u201es against the buyers on promissory notes given for purchases made, where it appeared that plaintiff, while the indebtedness was still in the form of an account, had notified defendants not to pay money to any agent or representative of the company, except on written authority, and defendants, in spite of such notices, made payments to an agent of the seller, and subsequently an agreement was made under which the notes sued on were executed and defendants undertook to recover from the agent the money improperly paid to him, evidence held insufficient to establish the defense of payment.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AmkD\" pgmap=\"219\">- 3.

Where purchasers of goods, ignoring notices by the seller not to make payment to an agent of the seller, make payment on an account, and, upon the seller\u2019s ascertaining that payment had been made to the agent contrary to its instructions, an agreement is made under which the notes are executed and the purchasers undertake to recover from the agent the money improperly paid to him, the postponement of payment constitutes a good consideration to support the notes.</headnotes> <footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b219-8\" pgmap=\"219\">See Illinois Notes Digest, Vols.
