From a verdict and judgment for plaintiff for $850, defendant brings error.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b362-8\" pgmap=\"362\">After considerable correspondence, in which defendant offered to sell to plaintiff the engine for $850, a pump for $39, a tank for $6, and a clutch and pulley for $25, making a total of $920, with a guaranty of the engine in certain respects and that it might be returned within a certain time and the purchase price would be refunded if it should prove not as represented, the plaintiff purchased the articles at the aggregate price given. Shortly after the engine was put in operation certain parts broke, whereupon plaintiff returned it, demanded return of the purchase price, and on refusal brought this action. There*was some evidence on the part of defendant of an oral change in the contract at the time of delivering the- order, which was denied by plaintiff. Defendant contended that its letter accepting the order constituted the contract irrespective of prior negotiations.</p><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"ALFL\" pgmap=\"363\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"Ayu\" pgmap=\"363\">1.
