A railroad company, defendant in an action by an employment agency to recover for breach of a contract for the furnishing of laborers, resulting in plaintiff being compelled to return registration fees to such employees, cannot avail itself of the defense that the names of such rejected employees were not placed upon the register of the employment agency so as to entitle the agency to a registration fee, where the names of such employees were not and could not legally be placed upon the register owing to the fact that defendant failed to comply with its agreement to take such laborers.</headnotes><attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b225-4\" pgmap=\"225\">Charles T.
