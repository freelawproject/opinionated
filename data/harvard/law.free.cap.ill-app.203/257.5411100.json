A delay of five days in presentation of checks for payment, held to be unreasonable and to constitute a payment or extinguishment of debt for which the checks were drawn, where the bank on which they were drawn failed before the checks were presented for payment.</headnotes><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b282-4\" pgmap=\"282\">These checks were given on a Monday, and plaintiff failed to deposit them in the bank in Chicag\u2019o until Wednesday or Thursday, and this resulted in a failure to present them to the bank in Niles, Michigan, on which they were drawn, until Saturday, the day the bank closed its doors. The defendant had on deposit with the bank at the time of its failure an amount in excess of the amount o.f the checks. The evidence further disclosed that it takes about two and a half hours to travel by. rail from Chicago, where the transaction took place, to Niles, Michigan.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b282-5\" pgmap=\"282\">Plaintiff, however, contended that as the defendant wrote him on the day of the bank\u2019s failure, saying that he hoped the checks had been paid, and, if not, he (defendant) was out that amount, and also in a conversation with plaintiff agreed to give a note for the amount of the checks, that these promises revived .defendant\u2019s obligation without any further consideration, and that it was immaterial whether defendant knew that by the rules of law the negligence of plaintiff to deposit the checks promptly would discharge him.</p><attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b282-6\" pgmap=\"282\">Edward A.

A new promise by a maker of checks who is discharged from liability because of the unreasonable delay of the payee thereof in presenting the checks to the bank on which they were .drawn for payment, which is made without a full knowledge of the facts out of which the discharge arose, does not constitute a waiver of the defense of delay in presentation of the checks for payment.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
