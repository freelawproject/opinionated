Landlord and tenant, \u00a7 477<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when notice by lessor\u2019s agent to quit at expiration of term does not affect character of tenure thereafter. Where a lease expired by its terms at a certain date, a notice by the lessor\u2019s agent that possession of the premises would be expected to be surrendered at that date would have, if authorized, no legal effect or bearing upon the character of the lessee\u2019s tenure after expiration of the lease, if the landlord assented to the holding over.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"Aj51\" pgmap=\"439\">2. Landlord and tenant, \u00a7 441<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when evidence sufficient to show holding over under terms of lease. Evidence held insufficient to show an oral agreement by lessor\u2019s agent to extend the lease to March 1, 1911, or his authority so to extend it, and sufficient to show a holding over on the terms of the lease without a new agreement, in an action to recover rent for such holding over.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"AtXI\" pgmap=\"439\">3.
