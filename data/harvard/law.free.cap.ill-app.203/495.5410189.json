Sadler, plaintiff, against Jacob P. Schnelbacher, defendant, to recover a commission as a real estate broker for effecting a lease of defendant\u2019s premises. From a judgment for plaintiff for $7,500, defendant appeals.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b519-10\" pgmap=\"519(179) 520(11)\">Plaintiff occupied an office with another real estate broker. They were not partners, but were frequently on opposite sides of deals. Plaintiff, learning from his office associate that the latter had a client wanting a business location, went to defendant, who showed plaintiff over his building and told plaintiff to have the party come there and he could do business. Plaintiff called again for more information which the party, through plaintiff\u2019s associate, wanted, and thereafter the party came to the city and was introduced by plaintiff to defendant, and at a meeting in the office of defendant\u2019s attorney a proposition for a lease was made by said attorney and at first accepted, whereupon plaintiff sug-gusted that defendant pay him a commission. Plaintiff\u2019s testimony was conflicting as to whether defendant then refused to pay any commission or to pay the amount asked by plaintiff. He later refused to pay any. The lease was abandoned at that time because of a mistake in figures, and was later concluded elsewhere as a result of negotiations between the parties and said attorney in which plaintiff had no part.</p><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AmOe\" pgmap=\"520\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"A30\" pgmap=\"520\">Brokers, \u00a7 88<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when evidence insufficient to show contract for sale of property on commission.
