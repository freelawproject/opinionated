D. Thompson Carnation Company, Helen T. Fish, Charles M. Fish, Fannie T. Quintero, P. W. Peterson, B. Wunderlich and Frank M. Fairfield, defendants, to recover six and one-half shares of the capital stock of the defendant company. From a decree finding the title to five shares of the stock to be in the defendant, Helen T. Fish, complainant appeals.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b549-10\" pgmap=\"549(56) 550(159)\">The bill claimed title to one and one-half shares of the stock under an agreement set out therein, and the decree found title to those shares to be in complainant, to which no cross error was assigned. The other five shares were claimed by complainant by purchase from her brother John D. Thompson during her father\u2019s lifetime, and were claimed by her sister Helen T. Fisli under a contract dated August 10, 1908, between herself, her father, who then owned the five shares, and her husband Charles M. Fish, all of whom were stockholders in the defendant company, the capital stock of which was nearly all owned by complainant, Helen T. Fish and Charles M. Fish. The father died intestate January 15, 1912, leaving as his only heirs at law complainant, Helen T. Fish and John D. Thompson. There had been no administration on his estate. The chancellor held that the contract was valid and enforceable, that it was not a testamentary disposition of property, and that the legal equitable right and title in and to the five shares vested in Helen T. Fish at the death of her father, subject to the payment of dividends and of a certain sum of money to complainant, as provided in the contract.</p><headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AbVH\" pgmap=\"550\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"A5G_\" pgmap=\"550(103) 551(56)\">1.
