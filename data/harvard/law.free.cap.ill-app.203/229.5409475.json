Saxes, \u00a7 366<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when fact that onion sets are not actually screened through sieve of required dimension does not bar recovery for breach of contract. Where a contract for the sale of a specified quantity of onion sets of specified varieties provides that the sets shall be screened through a sieve with a mesh of a specified dimension, the mere fact that the sets are not actually screened through a sieve with a mesh of such required dimension does not bar a recovery if the sets are of the size called for by the contract.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AzD\" pgmap=\"254\">2. Saxes\u2014when contract may not be rescinded. A slight or partial neglect on the part of one of the parties to a contract of sale to observe some of the terms or conditions thereof will not justify the other party in at once abandoning the agreement.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"Aft\" pgmap=\"254\">3.
