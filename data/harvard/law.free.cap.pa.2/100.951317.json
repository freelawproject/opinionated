The sheriff returned non est inventus as to McCredy, and served, as to the other two, and thirteen terre-tenants. Appearance was entered for McCredy, and a general plea on atwo day\u2019s rule, with notice at bar. The jury were sworn generally. A sheriff\u2019s sale subsequent to the writ having destroyed the plaintiff\u2019s title, the court directed a verdict for nominal costs and damages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A205\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>After verdict, plaintiff entered a nol. pros, as to all but the two defendants served, and judgment was entered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-4\">The exceptions were, 1. To the judgment, plaintiff having no title at the time of the trial. 2. No evidence of the possession of McCredy. 3. No issue as to several defendants. 4. Entering nol. pros, after trial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b101-5\"><em>Mattery, </em>for plaintiff</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AnND\">\u2014 The rule to plead only extended to those appearing, and who did plead is but matter of inference.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b101-6\">The jury could only have been sworn as to those pleading, and this uncertainty is error.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b101-7\">The judgment should have been taken against those not appearing, under act 1807. This leaves two liable for all costs and mesne profits.

The plea prevented us following the act of 1807. The nol. pros, was right; it amounted to an acquittal. Our action for mesne, profits is several, and there is no contribution, it being trespass.

But as a party, for whom particular provision is made, may waive the benefit of itj we see no reason why the plaintiff, in this instance, might not elect to go on only against the persons named in the writ. Nor would we, in any event, reverse, for a mere clerical omission which did not prejudice <em>them; </em>and <em>they </em>certainly had no interest in having additional parties who could not be made liable to contribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-12\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
