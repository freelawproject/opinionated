The court charged he could not recover, not having ascertained the true amount due on the judgment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b102-10\"><em>Dubois </em>and <em>Fox, </em>for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARtV\">\u2014 Under the statute Will. &amp; M., and our act, the proper course is to take judgment and execution for the penalty, and mark the real amount. 1 Dall. 377; Arrison <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 1 Watts, 374; Bennet <em>v. </em>Reed, 10 Watts, 396; Sergt. on Att. 95; 1 Dall. 378.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b102-11\">The writ of inquiry is merely to inform the court, and the garnishee cannot dispute the debt.

Rep. 58, n. For want of a chancery court, the same rule prevailed before the act, 4 W. C. C. R. 414; Robison <em>v. </em>Whiteside, 16 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 320; Bowes <em>v. </em>Nagel, 3 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 254.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b102-15\">Even at common law, damages must be ascertained by a jury before execution.

O\u2019Neal <em>v. </em>O\u2019Neal, 4 Watts &amp; Serg. 130. It seems, also, that he may take advantage of this objection, on the trial of the issue on the scire facias; for in Pancake <em>v. </em>Harris, 10 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 109, it was decided that the declaration, being in substance a declaration in assumpsit for goods sold and delivered, and the judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>ment not for a liquidated sum, the plaintiff could recover nothing from the garnishee, without executing a writ of inquiry; and he was allowed to take advantage of the objection on the plea of nulla bona; and the judgment for the garnishee in the court below was affirmed in error. We consider, however, the objection rather in the nature of a plea in abatement, on account of the irregularity in issuing the scire facias, and not as a plea in bar that concludes the plaintiff when his proceedings are made regular.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">Judgment affirmed, and record remitted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
