The only question argued here was, whether Grant was chargeable with a debt due by Seaton to the estate. The testator, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>by his will, gave $10,000 to said Seaton; and by a codicil, $5000 additional, which, by a subsequent codicil, he revoked and gave him a house in Chestnut street; he then added, \u201cThe said Henry Seaton will be indebted to my estate, at my demise, as will be seen by my ledger; the payment of said debt is to be made, when entirely convenient to him, free from any charge of interest.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-4\">Testator, in his will, released one Smith from all interest due on a debt to him, and directed him to pay the principal equally between his (Smith\u2019s) brothers, allowing twelve months for payment, without' interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-5\">The debt due by Seaton was upwards of $2000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-6\">The claim by the residuary legatees, was to charge the executors with this debt, on the ground that the will enabled Seaton to pay the debt; and that the account was a joint one.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-7\">The auditor was of this opinion, and considered the commissions due Seaton should be thus applied, tie charged \u201ccommissions disallowed on former account\u201d $11,771 Seaton\u2019s half of commissions on second account - - 2,075</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-8\">Seaton\u2019s half of commission on present account - - 82</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-9\">$13,928</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-10\">The court below (King, President) struck out these charges, considering the debt was not to be enforced during Seaton\u2019s life, and the legatees appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b259-11\"><em>Meredith, </em>for legatees.'</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Acm\">\u2014 The case of Shore <em>v. </em>Davidson, 3 Madd. 396, relied on by the judge, is not in point; for a discretion was there given to executors in compelling payment. But here Seaton occupied two positions, as executor and as debtor; in the former character no discretion is given; in the latter there are but two constructions of the words \u201c entirely convenient,\u201d if, in a popular sense, it has no meaning, being but the ordinary phrase of polite demand; if, in a legal sense, the only light in which the court can look at it here, it means ability. A class of cases shows this, in which the promises are to pay when convenient, &amp;e., debts discharged by law; as the stat. of limitations, bankruptcy, &amp;c., in which ability must be shown as a condition precedent. These cases are in Moore, Espinasse, and Tyrwhitt, cited on the other side. But here is an existing debt due, and this voluntary condition should not be so strictly construed. Even then we have shown ability. In Hagin <em>v. </em>Williamson, 5 Monr. 8, the words \u201cnot to be hastened,\u201d were held not to alter the liability. The word \u201c convenient\u201d has been defined to be what is legal, fitting, proper, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>Co. Litt. ss. 138, 139, 231, 269, 440, 665, 670; and the law always considers payment of debts of this character.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b260-3\">It is true, Grant could not have been chargeable but by consenting to file a joint account, especially when he paid the money to his co-executor, as here, though it has been disallowed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b260-4\">Williams, for Seaton.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AiH\">\u2014 Seaton being now dead, and according to the decision below, his estate chargeable, the only question is as to time of calculating interest. The words must give a discretion to the debtor; to construe them \u00a3\u00a3 when able,\u201d would contradict the intention, as that is very different from \u201c entirely convenient.\u201d The testator, in the case of Smith,0 has shown he knew how to explain his meaning. [ <em>CuHam. </em>\u2014 May it not be a discretion in the executor ?] They have never demanded it. 3 Esp. 159; 4 Esp. 36; Davis <em>v. </em>Smith, 12 Moore, 305; S. C. 4 Bing. 105, and Edmunds <em>v. </em>Downes, 4 Tyrw. 173, show, proof lies on the party claiming in such case.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b260-5\"><em>C. Ingersoll, </em>for Grant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_PI\">\u2014 -The disallowed commissions were paid to Seaton, and cannot be refunded, as he is dead, insolvent; and the question is, are the executors jointly liable ? It was said in M'Coy\u2019s Appeal, 17 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 57, after six years a joint account could not be altered; but here there was no joint charge; but a simple dis-allowance in a joint account; are the executors, under such circumstances, jointly chargeable ? M'Nair\u2019s estate, 4 Rawle, and 6 Watts, 250, show\u2019s the executor is not liable to a legatee for a payment to a co-executor. It makes a double charge, first of the commissions received and retained by Seaton, and next of a debt on the supposition of those commissions being in the power of the executors.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b260-6\"><em>March </em>10.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"A6H\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"A6O\">\u2014 Precedents cannot help us to arrive at the testator\u2019s meaning in a case like this. It must be drawn from his words, and the context of the whole will. Payment of the debt was to be made by Seaton, \u201cwhen entirely convenient to him, free from any charge of interest.\u201d Had the testator meant that the debt was to come out of the legacy, he would have said so; for it appears from his language in other bequests, that he knew how to speak with precision. It seems he spoke in general terms, because Seaton\u2019s necessities might have made the defalcation of the debt from his legacy much more than inconvenient to him. It is evident that the testator considered him to be a needy man, and meant to relieve him. Had he meant to give him a legacy less the amount of the debt owing to him, what was the use of saying the debt should not bear interest ? A legacy given in payment of a debt bears interest from the death, in order to counter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>balance the interest on the debt, and work an immediate extinguishment of it. It clearly seems to have been intended that Seaton should be under no obligation to pay at all. The object was to relieve him from embarrassment, making him the judge of its accomplishment, and leaving the rest to his conscience. Coinciding with the judge on the ground taken by him, it is unnecessary to consider whether it is too late to extricate Mr. Grant from the difficulty into which he brought himself by the perilous step of settling a joint account.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
