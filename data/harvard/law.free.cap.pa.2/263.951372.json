On this, judgment was entered in March, 1842. . Appellants subsequently obtained a judgment, on which the property was sold, and the question was as to the lien of the Loan Company, which the court decided bound the property.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b263-11\"><em>A. </em>Phillips, for appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A8_\">\u2014 In Gash <em>v. </em>Petterman, 3 Watts &amp; Serg. 351, it was held, the judgment was not revived. <em>[Chief Justice. </em>\u2014 No; only that he could not have judgment, as nothing was due at the suing out of the writ.] In Arrison <em>v. </em>The Commonwealth, a misrecital of the original judgment was held fatal. <em>[Chief Justice.\u2022 </em>\u2014 The judgment revived was not the same as that on which the writ issued.] In Pennock <em>v. </em>Hart, 8 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 379, the right to a new judgment under this writ was denied. <em>[Chief Justice. </em>\u2014 That was the first time it was doubted, but the practice had been such as not to be changed. For twenty years after the act of 1798, no other writ was used in the western part of the state, and numerous titles would have been disturbed by such a decision.]</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b263-12\">This court has held that where a new act of Assembly has reaffirmed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>a former one, the former practice must be amended to suit the direction of the legislature; Foreman v. Schricon, 8 Watts &amp; Serg. 43. The same thing occurs here.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b264-3\">The court declined hearing <em>St. G.

Though the practice of the profession was for many years irregular in this respect, we dare not disturb it, and the point must be considered as at rest.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
