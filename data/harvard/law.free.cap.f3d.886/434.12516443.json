The trustee opposed the debtors' request to strip the liens, arguing that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20506\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 506\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   expressly prohibits lien avoidance where no proof of claims have been filed. The bankruptcy court agreed and refused to strip the liens. The district court affirmed, holding that even if \u00a7 506(d) did not bar the debtors' effort to strip the liens, the text of \u00a7 506(a) still requires a proof of claim to be filed before a lien can be stripped.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We disagree and reverse. There is no question that the liens at issue are entirely without value making the creditor the holder of an unsecured claim under \u00a7 1322(b). Accordingly, the liens may be stripped regardless of whether a proof of claim has been filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Before turning to the merits, we discuss the relevant provisions of the bankruptcy Code and the factual and procedural history of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Bankruptcy Code contains two chapters aimed at individual debtors. Under Chapter 7, a debtor's estate is liquidated to pay creditors, after which he can obtain a discharge, eliminating personal liability for nonexempt debts. \u00a7\u00a7 726-727. Chapter 7 thus \"allows a debtor to make a clean break from his financial past, but at a steep price: prompt liquidation of the debtor's assets.\"\n   <em>\n    Harris v.

We, however, have held, \"consistent with every other circuit to have considered the question, that in a typical Chapter 13 proceeding, a bankruptcy court has the authority to strip off a completely valueless lien on a debtor's primary residence, thereby eliminating a lienholder's\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   rights against the collateral property.\"\n   <em>\n    Alvarez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3660501,3713853\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/733/136/\">\n    733 F.3d at 138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   This unique result in Chapter 13 is explained by the powers granted to bankruptcy plans under \u00a7 1322(b), including the ability to \"modify the rights of holders of secured claims, other than a claim secured only by a security interest in real property that is the debtor's principal residence, or of holders of unsecured claims, or leave unaffected the rights of holders of any class of claims.\" \u00a7 1322(b)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The limitation on modifying claims secured by a \"security interest in real property\" is referred to as \u00a7 1322(b)(2)'s antimodification clause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Bartee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11509101,1747623\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/212/277/\">\n    212 F.3d 277\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 287 (5th Cir. 2000). In line with the Supreme Court's reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Nobelman\n   </em>\n   , courts have understood a partially underwater lien as falling within the antimodification clause and thus not subject to lien avoidance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3571011,4177139\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/716/331/\">\n    716 F.3d 331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 335 (4th Cir. 2013) (surveying the approach of other circuits).

At the time, the Burkharts' principal residence was encumbered by four liens. In order of seniority these were: a $609,500 lien held by Chase Bank, a $49,411.80 lien held by Tri-County Bank, a $78,289.11 lien also held by Tri-County, and a $105,995.75 lien held by PNC Bank. Chase Bank and PNC Bank filed proofs of claim with the bankruptcy court. Tri-County did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Burkharts commenced an adversary proceeding to avoid the liens held by PNC and Tri-County. Their home was valued at $435,000, making the three junior liens unsecured and the senior lien only partially secured. The bankruptcy court entered a default judgment against the two banks, finding the liens completely underwater, and stripped PNC's lien. But the court refused to strip the liens held by Tri-County on the ground that \u00a7 506(d)(2) prohibits lien avoidance where no proof of claims have been filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Burkharts appealed to the district court, which also refused to strip the liens. The district court agreed with the bankruptcy court that in a Chapter 13 proceeding, a strip off cannot occur without application of \u00a7 506(d), but that \u00a7 506(d)(2) barred a lien from being voided when that lien is not an \"allowed secured claim\" due simply to the failure to file a proof of claim. The court added that it would reach the same result even if it accepted the debtors' contention that a lien strip can occur by application of \u00a7 1322(b)(2) alone. In the court's view, it could not turn to \u00a7 1322(b)(2) until after the claim had been valued under \u00a7 506(a), which in turn cannot occur until that claim has been filed and \"allowed.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Burkhart v.

To the contrary, bankruptcy proceedings routinely modify a non-participating creditor's rights, for example via \u00a7 362's automatic stay provision, or perhaps most saliently, by extinguishing the debtor's personal liability on the debt following plan confirmation pursuant to \u00a7 1327(c). We see no reason for a different result when it comes to avoiding an entirely unsecured lien.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   And while we have said that courts should look to \u00a7 506(a) to value collateral before proceeding to \u00a7 1322(b),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3571011,4177139\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/716/331/\">\n    716 F.3d at 335\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , we have never required strict compliance with the claim allowance process. Rather, the thrust of our instruction in\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   was to remind bankruptcy courts that whether \"a lien claimant is the holder of a 'secured claim' or an 'unsecured claim' \" under \u00a7 1322(b)(2) turns on \"whether the claimant's security interest has any actual 'value.' \"\n   <em>\n    In re Lane\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9395443,9394878\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/280/663/\">\n    280 F.3d 663\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 669 (6th Cir. 2002). Thus,\n   <em>\n    Nobelman\n   </em>\n   explained that the petitioners \"were correct in looking to \u00a7 506(a) for a judicial valuation of the collateral to determine the status of the bank's secured claim\" but made clear that such a \"determination does not necessarily mean that the 'rights' the bank enjoys as a mortgagee, which are protected by \u00a7 1322(b)(2), are limited by the valuation of its secured claim.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11800\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/324/#p332\">\n    508 U.S. at 328-29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11800,6525430\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/113/2106/\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In other words, the valuation process in \u00a7 506(a) does not determine a creditor's rights under \u00a7 1322(b)(2). Such rights turn on whether there is\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   value in the collateral.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 329,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11800,6525430\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/113/2106/\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Focusing on the value of the claim, rather than the claim allowance process as the trustee urges, explains why a secured creditor whose lien has real value may decide not to participate in the bankruptcy proceeding and rely only on its in rem right of foreclosure following the debtor's discharge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    U.S. Nat'l Bank in Johnstown v.

In the same vein, we think an entirely valueless lien may be stripped under \u00a7 1322(b) whether or not a proof of claim has been filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The trustee's contrary view would require us to ignore the plain fact that Tri-County's liens are entirely without value, and that such a creditor has no incentive to file a proof of claim. Moreover, while the Code permits a debtor to file a proof of claim where a creditor has not,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 501, requiring such an act merely so that a debtor may then strip the worthless lien only serves to drive up litigation costs. As things stand now, PNC, which filed a proof of claim, has had its lien stripped. But Tri-County, which did nothing, has had its lien survive. That cannot be the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   To summarize, the ability of a Chapter 13 debtor to strip off an underwater lien stems from \u00a7 1322(b) not \u00a7 506(d). The former provision permits plans to modify the rights of holders of unsecured claims. Whether a creditor has an unsecured claim turns on the value of the underlying collateral not the mere existence of a security\n   interest. And in making this determination, courts are not limited to valuing claims that have been filed and allowed. Where, as here, a senior lienholder is only partially secured, any junior lienholder is by definition the holder of an unsecured claim for purposes of \u00a7 1322(b), which may be stripped without the filing of a proof of claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The decision of the district court is therefore reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    REVERSED AND REMANDED\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    All section references, unless otherwise indicated, are to Title 11 of the United States Code.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    Section 501 provides that a creditor may file a proof of claim, but if the creditor fails to do so, then the debtor or trustee may file the claim. \u00a7 501(a), (c).

Under the new rules, a debtor may request a valuation of a secured claim directly in his Chapter 13 plan. Fed. R. Bankr. P. 3012(b). And any determination in a confirmed plan regarding the value of a secured claim is binding on the holder of the claim, \"even if the holder files a contrary proof of claim.\" Fed. R. Bankr. P. 3015(g)(1). Thus, the new rules plainly contemplate application of \u00a7 506(a) even when no formal proof of claim has been filed.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
