The district court dismissed Townsend's motion. Because Townsend's prior conviction for North Carolina assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill inflicting serious injury is categorically a violent felony under the force clause of the ACCA, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2010, Townsend was indicted for possession of a firearm by a felon under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1). The indictment also charged Townsend as an armed career criminal under the ACCA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e), alleging three prior instances of predicate felony conduct: (1) a 1998 conviction for robbery with a firearm; (2) 1998 convictions for assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill inflicting serious injury (\"AWDWIKISI\") and assault with a deadly weapon inflicting serious injury (\"AWDWISI\"); and (3) 1989 convictions for breaking and entering, breaking and entering of a motor vehicle, larceny, possession of burglary tools, and possession of stolen goods. Prior to trial, Townsend pled guilty to the \u00a7 922(g)(1) charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Before sentencing, probation prepared a presentence investigation report (\"PSR\") recommending that Townsend receive an enhanced sentence under the ACCA because of his three prior instances of felony conduct. Townsend challenged his classification\n   as an armed career criminal at sentencing, but he did not contest the representation in the PSR that he was convicted of AWDWIKISI or whether AWDWIKISI was categorically a violent felony. Over Townsend's objection, the district court found that Townsend qualified for the enhanced sentence under the ACCA based on his three prior instances of qualifying felony conduct and sentenced Townsend to 225 months of incarceration. Townsend appealed both his conviction and sentence, and we affirmed.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Townsend\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=453%20Fed.%20Appx.%20425\">\n    453 Fed.Appx. 425\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4th Cir. 2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2013, Townsend filed a \u00a7 2255 motion challenging his sentence and specifically challenging the applicability of the ACCA. In 2015, the United States Supreme Court issued its opinion in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , and Townsend amended his \u00a7 2255 motion to add a\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   claim. The Government moved to dismiss and produced state court sentencing sheets to show each of Townsend's predicate felonies under the ACCA. After Townsend amended his complaint, a magistrate judge issued a Report and Recommendation (\"R&amp;R\") recommending dismissal of Townsend's \u00a7 2255 petition but failing to specifically address whether Townsend's two North Carolina assault convictions qualified as ACCA predicates. The district court adopted the R&amp;R, declined to issue a certificate of appealability, and dismissed the petition with prejudice. Townsend then appealed, and this court granted a certificate of appealability on the issue of whether Townsend's prior felony convictions for North Carolina AWDWIKISI and AWDWISI qualify as violent felonies under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2)(B)(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As a threshold matter, Townsend asserts for the first time in this appeal that he has two convictions for AWDWISI rather than one for AWDWIKISI and one for AWDWISI. Townsend did not dispute the existence of his AWDWIKISI conviction in his underlying criminal case, on direct appeal, or while his \u00a7 2255 motion proceeded in the district court. Assuming without deciding that Townsend may challenge the factual basis of his conviction for AWDWIKISI for the first time in this appeal, we hold the record clearly shows that Townsend has one conviction for AWDWIKISI and one conviction for AWDWISI rather than two convictions for AWDWISI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The sentencing sheet at issue shows the two assault convictions and lists the same statute number (\"G.S. No.\")-14-32(b)-for both convictions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, the sentencing sheet also describes one conviction as \"Assault with Deadly Weapon W/Int to Kill Inflicting Serious Injury\" and the other as \"Assault W/Deadly Weapon Inflicting Serious Injury\" under \"Offense Description,\" lists felony classes (\"C\" and \"E,\" respectively) for each offense, and shows a sentence of 110 to 141 months. (J.A. 101.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Townsend argues the sentencing sheet is ambiguous because it lists the statute criminalizing AWDWISI for both convictions and the alleged ambiguity must be resolved under\n   <em>\n    Shepard v. U.S.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5879404\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/13/#p26\">\n    544 U.S. 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 26,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5879404\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/13/#p26\">\n    125 S.Ct. 1254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5879404\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/13/#p26\">\n    161 L.Ed.2d 205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005), by finding that Townsend has two AWDWISI convictions. Townsend's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Shepard\n   </em>\n   is misplaced.\n   <em>\n    Shepard\n   </em>\n   establishes which documents we may review when applying the modified categorical approach, but it does not limit courts in deciding whether a conviction actually exists.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Washington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4079092\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/629/403/#p412\">\n    629 F.3d 403\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 412 (4th Cir. 2011) (\"\n   <em>\n    Shepard\n   </em>\n   '\n   <em>\n    s\n   </em>\n   strictures do not fully apply when determining\n   the bare offense to which [the defendant] pled guilty.\"). Moreover, while this appeal was pending, the government notified the court pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28(j) that a North Carolina state court amended the sentencing sheet and corrected the statute of conviction for the offense described as AWDWIKISI from 14-32(b) to 14-32(a), the statute that criminalizes AWDWIKISI.

In\n   <em>\n    Grigsby\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court of North Carolina reversed the Court of Appeals of North Carolina and held that the evidence established the defendant's intent to kill where the defendant attempted to rob a convenience store, threatened to kill the store attendant, and eventually stabbed the store attendant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=526%20S.E.2d%20460\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=526%20S.E.2d%20460\">\n    at 461-62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The defendant tied up the attendant and continued threatening to kill the attendant even after the attendant obeyed the defendant's commands.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . The attendant and the defendant, who carried an assault knife made with finger holes for repeated stabbing, ultimately struggled over the defendant's knife.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=526%20S.E.2d%20460\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=526%20S.E.2d%20460\">\n    at 461-63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . During the struggle, the defendant stabbed the attendant, puncturing the attendant's lung, before fleeing the scene.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 461-62. The Supreme Court of North Carolina upheld an AWDWIKISI conviction because these facts showed that \"defendant's\n   <em>\n    intent was\n   </em>\n   not only to rob or to injure, but\n   <em>\n    to kill\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 463 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In contrast, the court held in\n   <em>\n    State v.

In\n   <em>\n    Irwin\n   </em>\n   , the court overturned an AWDWIKISI conviction because there was no specific intent to kill where an inmate held a jail employee at knife-point during an escape attempt.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 349-50. The court held that the evidence did not prove a specific intent to kill because the evidence showed only a conditional intent to kill, or as the court stated, \"a specific intent\n   <em>\n    not to kill\n   </em>\n   anyone if [the jail staff] complied with defendant's commands.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . (emphasis in original). These cases turned on whether the evidence showed that the defendant intended to kill by his violent act, and both required proving a specific intent to kill for an AWDWIKISI conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Further, evidence that AWDWIKISI requires a specific intent can be found in the available affirmative defenses.
