Campbell Company (\"WECCO\"), the insured. WECCO appeals several rulings by the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland against WECCO and in favor of United States Fire Insurance Company (\"U.S. Fire\") and St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Company (\"St. Paul,\" and collectively with U.S. Fire, the \"Insurers\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The main questions at issue in this appeal-concerning both the scope and limit of the Insurers' duties to defend and indemnify WECCO-were answered over a decade ago by this Court in\n   <em>\n    In re Wallace &amp; Gale Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9188130,1319380\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/385/820/\">\n    385 F.3d 820\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 833-34 (4th Cir. 2004). Unsatisfied with our precedent and the effect it would have on its cause of action, WECCO asks us to either consider these questions anew or certify them to the Maryland Court of Appeals. For reasons stated below, we decline to do either.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   For decades, WECCO-a now-defunct Maryland corporation-handled, sold, installed, disturbed, and removed insulation materials containing asbestos. By 1972, WECCO ceased the sale and use of asbestos-containing products in its operations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Since the mid-1980s, numerous individuals have sued WECCO alleging asbestos-related bodily injury stemming from WECCO's operations. From at least 1960 and through 1985, WECCO purchased and maintained comprehensive general liability insurance policies from several insurers, including St. Paul and U.S. Fire. Pursuant to those policies, St. Paul, U.S. Fire, and other insurers defended and indemnified WECCO against hundreds of asbestos-related bodily injury claims, paying claimants more than $60 million on WECCO's behalf over several decades. However, though many claims against WECCO remain pending, the Insurers now contend that, based on the aggregate liability limits set forth in their policies with WECCO, they no longer are contractually obligated to defend and indemnify WECCO against such claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The policies WECCO entered into with the Insurers are, for purposes of this appeal, nearly identical with respect to the type of coverage provided. Generally speaking, the policies differentiate between (1) claims involving bodily injuries that fall within the policies' \"completed operations hazard\" and \"products hazard\" and (2) claims involving bodily injuries that fall outside those hazards-often referred to as \"operations\" claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Both WECCO and the Insurers rely on one particular policy, issued by U.S. Fire, as an exemplar for the typical language contained in each policy. This policy, like\n   the others, first provides that it \"applies only to bodily injury ...\n   <em>\n    which occurs during the policy period\n   </em>\n   .\" J.A. 938 (emphasis added). The policy further provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   [t]he Company will pay on behalf of the insured all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury ... to which this insurance applies, ... arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of the insured premises and all operations necessary or incidental to the business of the named insured conducted at or from the insured premises ...,\n   <em>\n    but the Company shall not be obligated to pay any claim or judgment or to defend any suit after the applicable limit of the Company's liability has been exhausted\n   </em>\n   by payment of judgments or settlements.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9188130,1319380\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/385/820/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9188130,1319380\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/385/820/\">\n    at 941\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Not all claims are subject to the same \"applicable limit,\" however. In particular, the policy imposes an aggregate limit on the insurer's obligation to indemnify WECCO for claims that fall within the completed-operations and products hazards. The \"completed operations\" hazard is defined, in relevant part, to include:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   bodily injury ... arising out of operations ...,\n   <em>\n    but only if the bodily injury\n   </em>\n   ...\n   <em>\n    occurs after such operations have been completed or abandoned\n   </em>\n   and occurs away from premises owned by or rented to the named insured. \"Operations\" include materials, parts or equipment furnished in connection therewith.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9188130,1319380\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/385/820/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9188130,1319380\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/385/820/\">\n    at 947\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). And the \"products hazard\" is defined, in relevant part, to include:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   bodily injury ... arising out of the named insured's products ..., but only if the bodily injury ... occurs away from premises owned by or rented to the named insured and after physical possession of such products has been relinquished to others.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9188130,1319380\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/385/820/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   With respect to these two hazards, the policy provides that \"the total liability of the Company for all damages because of (1) all bodily injury included within the completed operations hazard and (2) all bodily injury included within the products hazard shall not exceed\" the aggregate limit set forth in the policy.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9188130,1319380\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/385/820/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9188130,1319380\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/385/820/\">\n    at 948\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Accordingly, claims involving bodily injuries that fall under the completed-operations and products hazards are subject to an aggregate limit. Every dollar the insurer pays out to indemnify WECCO against such claims counts against the policy's aggregate limit. Once the aggregate limit is reached, the insurer is no longer obligated to defend and indemnify WECCO for completed-operations and products hazard claims. On the other hand, operations claims-that is, bodily injury claims that do not constitute completed-operations or products hazards-are subject only to a \"per occurrence\" limit, meaning that there is no aggregate limit on the insurer's obligation to defend and indemnify WECCO against operations claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   WECCO and the Insurers disagree as to how to properly classify past, pending, and future bodily injury claims against WECCO. Specifically, WECCO contends that the Insurers have mischaracterized settled operations claims as settled completed-operations claims, resulting in a premature exhaustion of the policies' aggregate limits for completed-operations claims. Additionally, WECCO and the Insurers disagree over the manner in which coverage liability should be allocated among WECCO and the multiple insurance policies triggered by an asbestos-related\n   bodily injury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In 2003, the Insurers notified WECCO that the aggregate limits contained in the primary policies issued to WECCO had exhausted and that, as a result, the Insurers were no longer obligated to defend or indemnify WECCO under these policies. However, the Insurers continued to defend and indemnify WECCO under their umbrella/excess policies until U.S. Fire stopped in January 2009-after notifying WECCO that it had fully exhausted the aggregate limits contained in its umbrella/excess policies-and St. Paul stopped in June 2013-after doing the same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Despite receiving these notices, WECCO never challenged the Insurers' assertion that their policies' aggregate limits were exhausted until the instant action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In November 2012, one of WECCO's insurers, General Insurance Company of America (\"General Insurance\"), brought a declaratory judgment action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland against WECCO and several of WECCO's other insurers, including St. Paul and U.S. Fire. General Insurance asserted that (1) all the claims it had settled on behalf of WECCO fell under its policies' completed-operations hazards; (2) the hazards' aggregate limits had been exhausted; and (3) WECCO's other insurers were not paying their\n   <em>\n    pro rata\n   </em>\n   share of the liabilities arising from the asbestos claims against WECCO. Accordingly, General Insurance sought,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , a judicial declaration stating that it had fulfilled all of its obligations to WECCO and thus was no longer liable to defend or indemnify WECCO for any pending or future bodily injury claims. The insurer-defendants, including St. Paul and U.S. Fire, filed answers to General Insurance's complaint; many also asserted counterclaims and cross-claims with the intent of absolving themselves of any further obligation to indemnify WECCO for asbestos-related bodily injury claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   WECCO responded to General Insurance's suit by filing a parallel action in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, alleging that District of Columbia law, not Maryland law, applied to the coverage disputes. WECCO admits that it initiated the District of Columbia action solely as an attempt to avoid the district court's application of this Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    In re Wallace &amp; Gale\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9188130,1319380\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/385/820/\">\n    385 F.3d 820\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4th Cir. 2004). In\n   <em>\n    Wallace &amp; Gale\n   </em>\n   , this Court held that, under Maryland law, the completed-operations hazard found in policies similar to the ones at issue here encompass any bodily injury claim in which the claimant was injured by asbestos exposure attributable to an operation that the insured completed prior to the start of the policy period.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9188130,1319380\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/385/820/\">\n    385 F.3d at 833-34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . WECCO's District of Columbia action was subsequently removed to federal court, remanded back to state court, removed again, remanded again, and finally stayed by the state court during the pendency of this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   After its state-court action was stayed, WECCO filed a counterclaim in these proceedings\n   against General Insurance and asserted cross-claims against the other insurers, including St. Paul and U.S. Fire. WECCO subsequently settled with all of its insurers except St. Paul and U.S. Fire. Accordingly, the only remaining parties to the instant action-and this appeal, in particular-are St. Paul, U.S. Fire, and WECCO.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The current dispute concerns several primary and umbrella/excess comprehensive general liability coverage policies issued by the Insurers to WECCO between May 1, 1975, and April 1, 1983. During the proceedings below, WECCO and the Insurers sought several judicial declarations related to the proper interpretation of the policies. WECCO also brought a breach-of-contract action against the Insurers, alleging that they \"improperly allocated settled operations claims as settled completed operations claims, and subjected those claims improperly to the aggregate limit of liability in their policies,\" which caused the policies' aggregate limits of liability to exhaust prematurely. J.A. 1232-33. Extensive discovery ensued. Following the conclusion of discovery, the district court issued three separate orders granting partial summary judgment in favor of the Insurers, including several declarations relevant to this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   First, in a May 2015 Memorandum and Order, the district court declared that Maryland law governed the interpretation of the insurance policies issued to WECCO by the Insurers.\n   <em>\n    Gen. Ins. Co. of Am. v. Walter E. Campbell Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4361019\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/107/466/#p473\">\n    107 F.Supp.3d 466\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 473-78 (D. Md. 2015). Next, relying on\n   <em>\n    Wallace &amp; Gale\n   </em>\n   , the district court declared that, under Maryland law, \"[b]odily injury that occurs during an insurer's policy period,\n   <em>\n    and that arises from an operation that concluded prior to the inception of the policy period\n   </em>\n   , falls within the 'completed operations hazard' of that policy and therefore is subject to the aggregate limits of each such policy.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4361019\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/107/466/#p473\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4361019\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/107/466/#p473\">\n    at 473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). The practical effect of this ruling was that bodily injury claims brought by individuals first exposed to asbestos during WECCO operations that concluded prior to a policy's effective date were deemed completed-operations claims under that policy. Additionally, the district court declared that, \"[t]o avoid the application of the aggregate limit of any particular policy, WECCO bears the burden of proving that the bodily injury that occurred during that policy's policy period arose from asbestos exposure during a WECCO operation that was ongoing during such policy period.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4361019\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/107/466/#p473\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   One year later, in a May 2016 Memorandum and Order, the district court once again relied on\n   <em>\n    Wallace &amp; Gale\n   </em>\n   in declaring that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   [a]ny indemnity obligation an insurer may have to WECCO with respect to an asbestos bodily injury suit is to be allocated pro rata based on such insurer's triggered time on the risk as compared to the \"Allocation Period,\" which is the entire period during which the claimant's bodily injury occurred. The Allocation Period starts with the date of a claimant's first WECCO-related exposure to asbestos and ends with the manifestation of the claimant's asbestos-related disease, exclusive of any periods for which WECCO establishes that insurance for asbestos claims was commercially unavailable to WECCO for procurement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    Gen. Ins. Co. of Am. v. Walter E. Campbell Co.\n   </em>\n   , No. WMN-12-3307,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%202756524\">\n    2016 WL 2756524\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 n.5 (D. Md. May 12, 2016) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *6 (granting Insurers' requested declarations). In so doing, the district court rejected WECCO's argument that, under the language in the governing policies, each insurer was independently\n   obligated to indemnify WECCO for \"all sums\"-up to any applicable policy limit-WECCO was liable to pay because of bodily injury that occurred during a policy period. In addition, the district court declared that WECCO-not the Insurers-was liable for \"all pro rata shares of any judgment or settlement not allocable\" to the Insurers, including, among other things, \"indemnity allocable to any period in the Allocation Period for which ... the insurance procured by WECCO was issued by one or more insurers that are insolvent.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5 n.6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Finally, in March 2017, the district court granted summary judgment to the Insurers.\n   <em>\n    Gen. Ins. Co. of Am. v. Walter E. Campbell Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267717\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/241/578/#p599\">\n    241 F.Supp.3d 578\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 599 (D. Md. 2017). In so doing, the district court resolved several dispositive issues relevant to this appeal. First, the district court declared that St. Paul's indemnity payments for several claims alleged by WECCO to be mischaracterized were in fact properly characterized as completed-operations claims and thus subject to the aggregate liability limits for such claims.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267717\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/241/578/#p599\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267717\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/241/578/#p599\">\n    at 586-87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In rendering this declaration, the district court relied on its finding, based on the \"undisputed\" evidence, that WECCO had ceased all asbestos-related operations by 1972-years before any of St. Paul's policies issued.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267717\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/241/578/#p599\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Second, the district court declared that the aggregate limits of St. Paul's policies had been exhausted by the payments of those claims.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267717\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/241/578/#p599\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267717\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/241/578/#p599\">\n    at 589\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Third, and in the alternative, the district court determined that the applicable three-year statute of limitations barred almost all of WECCO's breach-of-contract claims against the Insurers.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267717\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/241/578/#p599\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267717\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/241/578/#p599\">\n    at 591-93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The district court entered a final judgment order on April 5, 2017.

On appeal, the parties agree that Maryland substantive law governs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   WECCO contends that the district court erred when it (A) interpreted the completed-operations hazard to apply to bodily injury stemming from an individual's exposure to asbestos during a WECCO operation that was completed at the time the insurance policy took effect, regardless of whether such operation was ongoing when the individual was first exposed; (B) placed the burden on WECCO to prove that an asbestos-related bodily injury claim is not subject to a policy's aggregate limit; (C) determined that St. Paul properly classified certain claims as \"completed operations\" claims; (D) declared that the aggregate limits of St. Paul's policies had been exhausted; and (E) concluded, in the alternative, that most of WECCO's breach-of-contract claims were time-barred.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   We affirm\n   the district court's judgment in its entirety, addressing each of WECCO's contentions in turn.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   WECCO's primary argument on appeal is that the district court erred in declaring that bodily injury that occurs during an insurer's policy period but arises out of a WECCO operation that concluded prior to the start of that policy period falls within the policy's completed-operations hazard and thus is subject to the policy's completed-operations hazard's aggregate limit. In WECCO's view, if a claimant was initially injured by asbestos exposure arising out of a WECCO operation, the claim is properly classified as an operations claim, regardless of whether the operation was ongoing or completed at the time of the policy's inception. Put differently, WECCO argues that the completed-operations hazard applies only in situations in which the starting point of a claimant's bodily injury occurred after WECCO operations completed. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Boiled down to its core, WECCO's argument amounts to an attempt to re-litigate this Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Wallace &amp; Gale\n   </em>\n   .

But WECCO's assertion that\n   <em>\n    Wallace &amp; Gale\n   </em>\n   's analysis lacks sufficient clarity to control this case runs contrary to WECCO's strategy throughout this litigation, which has been to seek to move these proceedings to other jurisdictions so as \"to avoid\n   <em>\n    Wallace &amp; Gale\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1088692\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/284/557/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   So, although WECCO may not believe the analysis in\n   <em>\n    Wallace &amp; Gale\n   </em>\n   is \"clear,\" it surely recognized that\n   <em>\n    Wallace &amp; Gale\n   </em>\n   's holding as to what claims fall within the completed-operations hazards of the Insurers' policies was sufficiently clear to guide WECCO's litigation strategy in these proceedings.

But WECCO's argument conspicuously ignores that\n   <em>\n    the very next sentence\n   </em>\n   of this Court's opinion unambiguously held that \"insurers who issued general liability policies to Wallace &amp; Gale for time periods wholly after Wallace &amp; Gale completed its asbestos installation work will only be liable to the extent of the aggregate limit contained in the policy.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9188130,1319380\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/385/820/\">\n    385 F.3d at 826\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, as to the relevant issue in this case-whether bodily injury claims arising from asbestos exposure during WECCO operations that completed prior to the issuance of a policy are subject to the policy's aggregate limit for completed-operations claims-this Court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Wallace &amp; Gale\n   </em>\n   resolved any ambiguity in the district court's opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In sum, we see no reason to depart from\n   <em>\n    Wallace &amp; Gale\n   </em>\n   's clear and controlling interpretation of the completed-operations hazard.

In support of their position, the Insurers relied extensively on\n   <em>\n    National Union Fire Insurance Co. of Pittsburgh v.

Like the present disagreement between WECCO and the Insurers, the parties in\n   <em>\n    National Union\n   </em>\n   disagreed as to whether, under Maryland law, \"demonstrating that a particular claim falls under the completed operations hazard or the operations hazard is properly part of the prima facie case (to be proven by Porter Hayden) or in the nature of an exclusion (to be proven by the Insurers).\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%20734170\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The district court concluded that Porter Hayden, as the\n   <em>\n    insured\n   </em>\n   , had the burden of showing when the operations hazard applies to a claim.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%20734170\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In so holding, the district court reasoned that \"[the] insured has the burden of proving every fact essential to his or her right to recover as part of its prima facie case, and identifying the hazard that provides coverage for a claim is part of that obligation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%20734170\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Below, in support of their motion for the aforementioned declaration, the Insurers argued that\n   <em>\n    Porter Hayden\n   </em>\n   's holding was controlling. In opposing the Insurers' motion, WECCO did not challenge the Insurers' proposed declaration; nor did WECCO dispute the Insurers' assertion that\n   <em>\n    Porter Hayden\n   </em>\n   was controlling. To the contrary, as the district court noted, WECCO instead sought to \"shift the focus to an issue not raised in [the] Insurers' motion,\" that is, whether the Insurers bear the burden of proving that the aggregate limits of the policies in question have actually been \"exhausted.\"\n   <em>\n    Gen.

As mentioned before, the district court correctly held that (1) bodily injury arising from WECCO operations that concluded prior to the start of a policy falls within the completed-operations hazard of the policy and (2) WECCO bears the burden of proving that a bodily injury arose from asbestos exposure during a WECCO operation that was ongoing\n   <em>\n    during\n   </em>\n   the policy's policy period.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Part II.A-B. After considering the evidence in the record, the district court concluded that several asbestos-related bodily injury claims paid by St. Paul on behalf of WECCO were completed-operations claims subject to aggregate limits. In reaching this conclusion, the court noted that there was \"no real dispute that WECCO had ceased the sale and installation of all asbestos products by no later than 1972.\"\n   <em>\n    Gen. Ins.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267717\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/241/578/#p599\">\n    241 F.Supp.3d at 586\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And it relied on WECCO's own statements admitting that it failed to identify any evidence indicating it handled, repaired, removed, or disturbed\n   asbestos-containing materials while St. Paul's policies were in place.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267717\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/241/578/#p599\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, the district court concluded that any bodily injury triggering coverage under a St. Paul policy occurred\n   <em>\n    wholly after\n   </em>\n   WECCO completed its asbestos-related operations and therefore falls within the completed-operations hazard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   On appeal, WECCO maintains that the actual date it ceased asbestos-related operations is irrelevant in determining whether a claim asserted against WECCO is a completed-operations claim. In particular, WECCO points out that a claimant may\n   <em>\n    allege\n   </em>\n   that he or she first suffered an asbestos-related bodily injury during a WECCO operation that took place after 1972, and if the insurer decides to settle, any payout to that claimant by the insurer should be classified as a payout for an operations claim, not a completed-operations claim. WECCO, however, has failed to put forward\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   competent evidence suggesting that St. Paul settled\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   claims for individuals alleging asbestos exposure during post-1972 WECCO operations. Accordingly, we need not-and thus do not-decide whether an\n   <em>\n    allegation\n   </em>\n   of asbestos exposure during post-1972 WECCO operations gives rise to a completed-operations or operations claim under the terms of the policies. Therefore, we agree with the district court that the undisputed evidence in the record establishes that St. Paul properly classified the claims at issue as completed-operations claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   WECCO also asserts that the district court erred in declaring that St. Paul had exhausted the aggregate limits for completed-operations claims within the policies it issued to WECCO.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Below, St. Paul claimed that it paid $32 million on WECCO's behalf to resolve asbestos-related bodily injury claims, thereby exhausting the sum total of its policies' aggregate limits. In support of its contention, St. Paul produced two \"loss runs\"-electronic insurance reports detailing the claims it paid on behalf of WECCO.

That the loss runs were printed out from Travelers' database for purposes of this litigation does not impact the admissibility of the loss runs because \"evidence that has been compiled from a computer database is also admissible as a business record, provided it meets the criteria of Rule 803(6).\"\n   <em>\n    U-Haul Int'l, Inc. v.

To determine whether WECCO timely filed its breach-of-contract claims, the district court first looked to the specific breach alleged in WECCO's complaint-that \"U.S. Fire and St. Paul improperly allocated settled operations claims as settled completed operations claims, and subjected those claims improperly to the aggregate limit of liability in their policies,\" resulting in the premature exhaustion of the aggregate limits.\n   <em>\n    Gen.

The district court then concluded that the statute of limitations began to run with respect to WECCO's claims when the Insurers informed WECCO that the aggregate limits of their polices had been exhausted.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267717\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/241/578/#p599\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267717\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/241/578/#p599\">\n    at 591, 593\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Specifically, with respect to the primary policies issued by the Insurers to WECCO, the district court found that the statute of limitations began to run on WECCO's breach-of-contract claims, at the latest, in 2003, when the Insurers first notified WECCO that the aggregate limits had been reached on those policies.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267717\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/241/578/#p599\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267717\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/241/578/#p599\">\n    at 589, 593\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And with respect to U.S. Fire's umbrella polices, the district court found that the statute of limitations began to run, at the latest, in January 2009, when U.S. Fire notified WECCO that its umbrella policies' limits were exhausted.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267717\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/241/578/#p599\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267717\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/241/578/#p599\">\n    at 593\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Given that WECCO did not assert breach-of-contract claims against the Insurers until January 14, 2013-more than three years after the Insurers' notices-the district court concluded that almost all of WECCO's\n   breach-of-contract claims were time-barred.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   On appeal, WECCO contends that the Insurers' notices amounted to nothing more than an anticipatory breach-giving WECCO the\n   <em>\n    option\n   </em>\n   to sue at that time. According to WECCO, the Insurers did not actually breach their contracts with WECCO until they first refused to defend and indemnify WECCO against asbestos-related bodily injury claims. Each claim the Insurers have declined to pay since that time constitutes a new breach, WECCO maintains, subject to a new statute-of-limitations period. Thus, as WECCO sees it, the Insurers have breached their contracts with WECCO as recently as February 2015, when they refused to make contractually obligated payments on behalf of WECCO. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   As the district court recognized, WECCO did not allege that the Insurers breached their contracts with WECCO by refusing to defend or indemnify WECCO against any particular claims alleging asbestos-related bodily injury. To the contrary, WECCO alleged that the Insurers \"breached their obligations under their policies\" by their \"improper\n   <em>\n    allocation\n   </em>\n   of settled operations claims as settled completed operations claims.\" J.A. 1233 (emphasis added). In determining at which point a cause of action begins to accrue, Maryland courts abide by \"the discovery rule, which now applies generally in all civil actions, and which provides that a cause of action accrues when a plaintiff in fact knows or reasonably should know of the wrong.\"\n   <em>\n    Hecht v.
