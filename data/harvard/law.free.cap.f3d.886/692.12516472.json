The district court construed Sisney's facial challenges to two distinct provisions of the policy as a single attack on the entire policy, and it granted his motion for summary judgment on this score. After invalidating the policy on its face, the court proceeded to resurrect a prior version of the policy and used it to resolve all but one of the as-applied challenges in Sisney's favor. The prison officials now appeal the partial grant of summary judgment to Sisney, and Sisney cross appeals. For several reasons, we find it prudent to decide whether the policy was constitutional as applied to Sisney before reaching his facial challenges. However, the district court erred in its as-applied analysis, so we vacate the summary judgment order and remand for it to consider, in the first instance, Sisney's as-applied claims based on the version of the policy he actually challenged and then to determine whether facial relief remains necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Sisney has been serving a life sentence at the South Dakota State Penitentiary (\"SDSP\") since 1997.

With the benefit of this experience, Sisney now raises a variety of challenges to the 2014 version of the South Dakota Department of Correction (\"SDDOC\") pornography policy (\"2014 Policy\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In relevant part, the 2014 Policy \"prohibits the purchase, possession and attempted possession and manufacturing of pornographic materials by offenders housed in [SDDOC] institutions.\" SDDOC, Policy No. 1.3.C.8,\n   <em>\n    Pornography\n   </em>\n   (2014). The term \"pornographic material\" is defined to include \"books, articles, pamphlets, magazines, periodicals, or any other publications or materials that feature nudity or 'sexually-explicit' conduct ... [as well as] photographs, drawings, etchings, paintings, or other graphic depictions of nudity or sexually explicit material.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5754920\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/581/639/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \"Nudity,\" in turn, is defined as \"a pictorial or other graphic depiction where male or female genitalia, pubic area, buttocks or female breasts are exposed,\" while \"sexually explicit\" covers both images and writings that depict actual or simulated sexual acts.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5754920\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/581/639/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Any material that qualifies as pornography under these definitions-including both incoming and outgoing correspondence-is treated as contraband and may be confiscated by prison staff.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5754920\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/581/639/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Moreover, prisoners found in possession of pornography are subject to disciplinary action.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5754920\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/581/639/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Inmates who disagree with a given classification, however, are entitled to appeal\n   the decision through an administrative process.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5754920\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/581/639/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Acting pursuant to the 2014 Policy, SDSP staff rejected a number of items that were mailed to Sisney. The prohibited materials included two erotic novels,\n   <em>\n    Thrones of Desire\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Pride and Prejudice: The Wild and Wanton Edition\n   </em>\n   , as well as four Japanese\n   <em>\n    manga\n   </em>\n   comics from a series called\n   <em>\n    Pretty Face\n   </em>\n   , nine images of Renaissance artworks depicting nudity, a book on Matisse and Picasso, and a poster featuring the iconic Coppertone suntan-girl advertisement. Sisney went through the prison grievance process to challenge the rejection of each of these items, but he was denied relief with only brief explanations as to why the materials were withheld.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In April 2015, having exhausted his administrative remedies, Sisney filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   complaint pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . His subsequent amended complaint included six claims: (1) a facial challenge to the policy \"as it completely bans all sexually explicit material, both pictorial and written\"; (2) a facial challenge to the policy \"as it bans not only [Sisney] to receive sexually explicit communications, but also prohibits [him] from sending out sexually explicit communications to those in the general public\"; (3) a due process claim not raised on appeal; (4) an as-applied challenge concerning the SDSP's \"overly broad and exaggerated interpretations of pornography, nudity and sexually explicit material\"; (5) an as-applied challenge to the rejection of the three books and four\n   <em>\n    Pretty Face\n   </em>\n   comics; and (6) an as-applied challenge to the rejection of the nine Renaissance images and the Coppertone poster. In his prayer for relief, Sisney requested declaratory relief as to the constitutionality of the ban on all \"sexually explicit\" material and the outgoing-mail regulation, declaratory relief concerning his as-applied challenges, injunctive relief requiring the SDDOC to prohibit only \"traditional forms of pornography and obscene materials,\" and injunctive relief ordering the prison to allow him to receive the rejected items.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Following a limited period of discovery, the corrections officials moved for summary judgment as to all claims. Beyond contesting Sisney's asserted \"constitutional right to receive sexually explicit communications,\" the officials cited a variety of district and circuit court opinions describing the general penological interests served by prison bans on sexually explicit materials, including institutional security, rehabilitation, and the prevention of sex crimes in prison, as well as a reduction in sexual harassment directed at staff. They then emphasized that the district court had found these same interests sufficient to uphold the 2000 version of the SDDOC pornography policy (\"2000 Policy\") in\n   <em>\n    King v. Dooley\n   </em>\n   , CIV. 00-4052 (D.S.D. June 16, 2003), suggesting that this decision was dispositive as to Sisney's \"facial challenge\" because the 2014 Policy is \"essentially the same.\" The officials provided no explanation, however, for modifying the policy and never suggested that the general penological interests from the cases they cited actually motivated the adoption of the 2014 Policy. Shortly thereafter, Sisney countered with his own motion for summary judgment. In it, he noted that the SDDOC policy had undergone significant revision since it was upheld in\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   . For example, the 2014 Policy banned written sexually explicit materials, expanded the definition of nudity, and extended the policy to outgoing correspondence. Sisney argued that these and other changes rendered the 2014 Policy unconstitutionally overbroad, even considering the legitimate interests promoted by other prison pornography-censorship policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The district court referred the cross motions for summary judgment to a magistrate judge, who issued a thorough report and recommendation (\"R&amp;R\") that found largely in favor of Sisney. First, the magistrate judge concluded that the 2014 Policy \"is much more sweeping and comprehensive than its predecessor which was analyzed in\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   .\" Accordingly, the R&amp;R rejected the defendants' claim that\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   was dispositive as to Sisney's \"facial challenge\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   to the 2014 Policy. The magistrate judge next considered the merits of the facial claims, evaluating the regulations on incoming mail under the Supreme Court's four-factor balancing test from\n   <em>\n    Turner v. Safley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6210045\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/482/78/\">\n    482 U.S. 78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6210045\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/482/78/\">\n    107 S.Ct. 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6210045\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/482/78/\">\n    96 L.Ed.2d 64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1987), and the regulations on outgoing mail under the stricter test from\n   <em>\n    Procunier v. Martinez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"84368\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/416/396/\">\n    416 U.S. 396\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"84368\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/416/396/\">\n    94 S.Ct. 1800\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"84368\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/416/396/\">\n    40 L.Ed.2d 224\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1974). Based on these separate analyses, the R&amp;R concluded that \"the current [2014] policy must be declared facially invalid\" in its entirety because the SDDOC provided no justification for the policy beyond emphasizing its similarity to the 2000 Policy upheld in\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   . Rather than concluding there, however, the magistrate judge proceeded to the as-applied challenges, offering no explanation for doing so beyond an unsupported assertion that the \"DOC policy may be enforced insofar as it comports with the policy approved of in\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   .\" Thus, applying the superseded 2000 Policy, the magistrate judge recommended granting the defendants' motion for summary judgment as to the\n   <em>\n    Pretty Face\n   </em>\n   comics and the Coppertone poster, while granting Sisney's motion for summary judgment as to all of the other rejected materials.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Given the breadth of objections to the R&amp;R, the district court reviewed the entire report\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   , ultimately adopting the recommendations and findings in nearly all respects. The court first observed that \"[t]he basic claim of the Defendants is that the current policy really is no different than the [2000] policy ... approved in\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   ,\" and it agreed with the magistrate judge's rejection of this argument based on the \"significant\" differences between the two policies. The district court then held that the \"new and overly broad policy goes far beyond what is necessary and is unconstitutional.\" With respect to the as-applied challenges, the court voiced concern about the R&amp;R's unique approach of resurrecting and applying the 2000 Policy but seemingly accepted it nonetheless:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   [The R&amp;R's] discussion of what is or is not censored under\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   is dicta and is only used to demonstrate some of the differences between the policies approved in\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   and the policies now before the Court. The R&amp;R does not treat the\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   discussion as dicta. This Court does consider the\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   discussions to be dicta because this Court does not believe that what there is of\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   policy in the present policy can be abstracted from the present policy to then apply those abstractions to the as-applied challenges. Nonetheless, this Court has applied the as-applied challenges under the\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   policy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As we understand it, the district court applied the 2000 Policy despite its misgivings and found for Sisney as to each of the rejected materials except the\n   <em>\n    Pretty Face\n   </em>\n   comics. The prison officials then appealed the adverse grant of summary judgment,\n   and Sisney cross-appealed the denial of relief as to the four comic books.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \"We review a district court's grant of summary judgment\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   , viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and giving the non-moving party the benefit of all reasonable inferences.\"\n   <em>\n    Murchison v.

First, the\n   <em>\n    Fox\n   </em>\n   approach appropriately reflects the deference we owe to corrections officials in prisoners' rights cases. As noted above, the need for restraint is only amplified here, given that both federalism and separation-of-powers concerns are implicated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Turner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6210045\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/482/78/\">\n    482 U.S. at 84-85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6210045\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/482/78/\">\n    107 S.Ct. 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second and relatedly, beginning with Sisney's as-applied challenges could allow for the fashioning of more limited relief. For starters, if Sisney were entitled to as-applied relief, his claims might be redressed without reaching the overbreadth issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jacobsen v. Howard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"834321\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/109/1268/#p1274\">\n    109 F.3d 1268\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1274-75 (8th Cir. 1997) (admonishing that \"the district court should have first considered the validity of the statutes as applied\" because then it \"would have found it unnecessary to consider the overbreadth issue\"). Moreover, even if the as-applied analysis did not fully resolve the case, the\n   <em>\n    Fox\n   </em>\n   approach might facilitate the severing of constitutionally suspect provisions instead of invalidating the entire policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fallon,\n   99 Cal. L. Rev. at 955 (\"[I]f the Court determines that a statute would otherwise be substantially overbroad under the First Amendment overbreadth test, it will normally sever the statute and hold it only partially invalid if ... it can identify a particular, precise way of severing the statute that cures the defect of substantial overbreadth.\"). Third, as the Supreme Court has cautioned, \"[c]laims of facial invalidity often rest on speculation. As a consequence, they raise the risk of premature interpretation of statutes on the basis of factually barebones records.\"\n   <em>\n    Wash. State Grange\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675723\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/552/442/\">\n    552 U.S. at 450\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675723\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/552/442/\">\n    128 S.Ct. 1184\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, Sisney challenges the outgoing-mail provision on its face, but he does not allege that any of his own correspondence was censored under the regulation. Given the speculative nature of his challenge to this provision, we are reluctant to rush into a broad constitutional ruling without a better understanding of how the regulation is actually applied, especially if as-applied relief or a different construction of Sisney's complaint would render such a ruling unnecessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Jacobsen v. Howard\n   </em>\n   , another overbreadth appeal involving the grant of both as-applied and facial relief, we similarly resolved to begin our analysis with the as-applied challenges.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"834321\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/109/1268/#p1274\">\n    109 F.3d at 1271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because we held that the challenged statutes in\n   <em>\n    Jacobsen\n   </em>\n   were unconstitutional as applied, we went on to vacate the separate finding of facial unconstitutionality as unnecessary and unwarranted.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"834321\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/109/1268/#p1274\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"834321\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/109/1268/#p1274\">\n    at 1274-75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We have taken this approach in other cases, as well.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Harmon v. City of Kansas City\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"633577\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/197/321/#p328\">\n    197 F.3d 321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 328 (8th Cir. 1999).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Here, however, we cannot adopt the district court's as-applied analysis because it was error to resurrect and apply the 2000 Policy. This was not the policy that Sisney actually challenged, nor was it the authority under which SDSP staff withheld the rejected materials. In fact, once the district court facially invalidated the 2014 Policy, there was nothing left to apply, given that new SDDOC policies supercede rather than amend previous provisions in their entirety.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , SDDOC, Policy No. 1.3.C.8. Moreover, even if we could take this approach, it would be imprudent to do so. As the district court itself correctly concluded, \"the differences [between the two policies] are significant,\" and further, the hypothetical application of the 2000 Policy is highly speculative in that it requires guessing what the prison would or would not have censured under the old policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In light of this error, we believe the best course is to vacate the summary judgment order in its entirety and allow the district court to reevaluate Sisney's as-applied claims based on the 2014 Policy-the version he actually challenged.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Montin v. Estate of Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4105081\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/636/409/#p416\">\n    636 F.3d 409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 416 (8th Cir. 2011) (\"Out of prudence, we believe it is appropriate to allow the district court to address this issue in the first\n   instance,\" particularly when a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   plaintiff's filings before the district court \"lacked clarity\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thornburgh\n   </em>\n   , 490 U.S. at 403-04, 419,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605806\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/401/\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1874\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (upholding a challenged prison censorship scheme on its face and endorsing the appellate court's decision to remand for the district court to evaluate the as-applied challenges in the first instance).
