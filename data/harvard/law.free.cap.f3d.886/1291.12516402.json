Thereafter, he incurred three convictions that are relevant to this petition for review: a conviction on March 8, 2007, for second degree theft in violation of Oregon Revised Statutes section 164.045 ; a conviction on December 31, 2012, for third degree theft in violation of Oregon Revised Statutes section 164.043 ; and a conviction on March 7, 2013, for third degree theft in violation of Oregon Revised Statutes section 164.043. All three convictions were based upon guilty pleas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) ultimately alleged that those were CIMTs. As a result, he was removable because he had been convicted of \"two or more crimes involving moral turpitude, not arising out of a single scheme of criminal misconduct.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A)(ii).

At the time he committed them, they were not CIMTs because for many decades (at least since 1947\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) the BIA had held that \"a theft offense categorically involves moral turpitude if-and only if-it is committed with the intent to\n   <em>\n    permanently\n   </em>\n   deprive an owner of property.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   We agreed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Almanza-Arenas v. Lynch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4147317\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/815/469/#p476\">\n    815 F.3d 469\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 476 (9th Cir. 2016) (en banc). At argument, the government also agreed with that assessment, and properly so. In fact, the BIA recently said that was the rule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Diaz-Lizarraga\n   </em>\n   , 26 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 849. But it went on to say more. It declared that \"a theft offense is a crime involving moral turpitude if it involves an intent to deprive the owner of his property either permanently or under circumstances where the owner's property rights are substantially eroded.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 853. It frankly admitted that it was changing the law, but stated \"we conclude that our early jurisprudence does not provide us with good reasons to persist in the rule that moral turpitude requires a taking involving a\n   <em>\n    literally\n   </em>\n   permanent intended deprivation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   And, finally, \"to the extent that any of our prior decisions have required a literal intent to permanently deprive in order for a theft offense to be a crime involving moral turpitude, those decisions are overruled.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 855. Simply put, the BIA changed the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The government, instead, argues that under the new rule Garcia's Oregon crimes are CIMTs because the new rule should be applied retroactively to this case. If the new rule does not apply retroactively, the BIA's decision in this case was in error.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   We recognize that the BIA can change its rules retroactively through adjudication,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   but that authority is not unconstrained. Rather, we must balance the reliance interests of those to whom the new rule will be applied against the mischief, if any, that would be caused if the rule is not so applied. In doing so, we balance a number of \"non-exhaustive\" factors, that is:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (1) whether the particular case is one of first impression,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (2) whether the new rule represents an abrupt departure from well established practice or merely attempts to fill a void in an unsettled area of law,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (3) the extent to which the party against whom the new rule is applied relied on the former rule,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (4) the degree of the burden which a retroactive order imposes on a party, and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (5) the statutory interest in applying a new rule despite the reliance of a party on the old standard.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    Miguel-Miguel v. Gonzales\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3699310\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/500/941/#p951\">\n    500 F.3d 941\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 951 (9th Cir. 2007). When we do so, that balance weighs heavily in Garcia's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   First, to the extent that the consideration is relevant in the immigration context,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   this surely was not a case of first impression.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Seventy years of application of the old rule tells us that.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Diaz-Lizarraga\n   </em>\n   , 26 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 849.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Second, on its face, the decision to abandon the literally-permanent deprivation test was a rather abrupt change in the law, to say the least. While there may have been some slight deviation from time to time when the BIA indulged in presumptions about intent in considering the law of a particular state,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   that does not square well with Oregon law which declares itself to be nondivisible in the theft area.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Or.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20164.025\">\n    Or. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 164.025\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Almanza-Arenas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4147317\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/815/469/#p476\">\n    815 F.3d at 475\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . More than that, the BIA did not overturn the requirement that a taking must be literally permanent until\n   <em>\n    Diaz-Lizarraga\n   </em>\n   itself. The law was not truly unsettled.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., Inc. v. FTC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1477898\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/691/1322/#p1333\">\n    691 F.2d 1322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1333 (9th Cir. 1982).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Third, if there were some arcane nuances lurking in some of the BIA's authorities, we do not doubt than an alien in Garcia's position would rely on the BIA's continual affirmation of the rule of literal deprivation which had existed for decades. Indeed we will presume\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   that he was aware of the then existing rule when he pled guilty to the theft crimes in Oregon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Fourth, there can be little doubt that the change in the rule-the new rule-will impose a new and severe burden\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   upon Garcia, who will be removed from this country and from the proximity of his family after living in this country for over thirty years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Fifth, we do not vilipend the BIA's interest in treating all aliens uniformly or look upon its interest in removing criminals from our midst with insouciance. However, we do not think those have a great deal of weight in a case like this one\n   where the BIA lived with the preexisting rule for seven decades and, in fact, until just a couple of years ago would have treated Garcia as a person who had not committed CIMTs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Thus, on balance, the above factors and basic fairness indicate that the changed rule should not be applied in this situation. Rather, for this case, the law should remain as it has been for many decades. In short, Garcia's thefts were not CIMTs, and his removal order must be set aside. Were we at all doubtful about our conclusion, we would take comfort from and be made more confident by a recent decision of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals which, after weighing the same factors, determined that the BIA's new CIMT rule did not apply retroactively.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Obeya v.

In any event, the BIA has changed or updated or revised its rule for the future.
