Doe also challenges the agency's denial of CAT relief.

In 2014, Doe pleaded guilty in the Southern District of New York to one count of conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute heroin, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20846\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 841(b)(1)(C) of the CSA. Doe cooperated with law enforcement upon his arrest in connection with this crime and provided information that helped the government convict the other individuals involved. Certified Administrative Record (\"CAR\") at 864. He entered his guilty plea pursuant to a cooperation agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After his conviction, Doe was charged as removable under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\") for having been convicted of a controlled substance offense, a drug trafficking aggravated felony, and a conspiracy to commit a drug trafficking aggravated felony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A)(iii), (B)(i) ;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B), (U). Before the IJ, Doe admitted the Government's factual allegations but contested removability. He applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and, as relevant here, CAT relief, alleging fear of the co-defendants in his criminal case (because he had cooperated) and of a rival family in the Dominican Republic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Although Doe's judgment of conviction specifies that he conspired to distribute heroin, the substantive statute underlying his conspiracy renders it a crime to distribute or possess with intent to distribute \"a controlled substance,\" meaning any substance listed in one of the five CSA Schedules.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20802\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6) (defining \"controlled substance\" for purposes of the CSA). In January 2015, during Doe's removal proceedings, the DEA removed naloxegol from these Schedules.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Schedules of Controlled Substances: Removal of Naloxegol From Control,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%203468\">\n    80 Fed. Reg. 3468\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 3469 (Jan. 23, 2015) (codified at 21 C.F.R. pt. 1308). Doe moved to terminate proceedings on the ground that after naloxegol was removed from the CSA Schedules, his conviction no longer categorically involved a controlled substance, as required for his removal. CAR at 357. That is so, argued Doe, because the Schedules were broader on the date of his conviction than at the time of his removal proceedings (because a person could be convicted of distributing naloxegol in 2014, when Doe was convicted, but not in 2015, when the Schedules were amended). Because of this mismatch, Doe asserted, he was no longer convicted of a crime categorically involving a federally controlled substance and therefore could not be removed on this basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The IJ disagreed. In a written decision, the IJ explained that Doe's motion to terminate was properly denied because\n   <em>\n    Matter of Ferreira\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20415\">\n    26 I. &amp; N.

Thus, at the time of his conviction, he was necessarily convicted of a crime relating to a federally controlled substance.\" CAR at 102-03. As relevant here, the IJ also denied CAT relief, noting that Doe had conceded that only one of his co-conspirators, a friend who posed no threat, was even aware that he had cooperated, and concluding that Doe failed to demonstrate that he would likely be tortured by his co-defendants or the rival Dominican family if returned to the Dominican Republic.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 104-06.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The BIA dismissed Doe's appeal. As to Doe's argument that his conviction no longer categorically constitutes a crime relating to a controlled substance, the BIA agreed with the IJ that \"the proper approach is to compare the statute of conviction with the federal drug schedules as they existed\n   <em>\n    at the time of conviction\n   </em>\n   ,\" not at the time of removal proceedings. CAR at 5 (emphasis in original). Regarding CAT relief, the BIA also discerned no clear error in the IJ's determination that Doe failed to show a likelihood of torture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Doe's petition for review argues (1) that he is not removable as charged under the \"categorical approach\" and (2) that as to CAT relief, the agency committed a legal error by concluding that Doe \"conceded that ... only [one] person[ ] knew that [Doe] cooperated with the authorities.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 105.

According to Doe, because the 2014 CSA Schedules, which included naloxegol as a controlled substance, \"criminalize[d] a broader swath\" of substances than the 2015 CSA Schedules in force at the time of his removal proceedings, Doe's 2014 conviction is no longer a removable offense pursuant to the categorical approach.\n   <em>\n    Descamps v.

This argument is unpersuasive. The INA provisions to which he points merely specify the crimes for which an alien may be removed and refer to different provisions of the United States Code for their definitions.

As the Supreme Court has explained, \"[b]y focusing on the legal question of what a conviction\n   <em>\n    necessarily\n   </em>\n   established, the categorical approach ordinarily works to promote efficiency, fairness, and predictability in the administration of immigration law.\"\n   <em>\n    Mellouli\n   </em>\n   , 135 S.Ct. at 1987. If the point of comparison is the CSA Schedules at the time of removal proceedings, however, it is impossible for either the Government or the alien to anticipate the immigration consequences of a guilty plea or conviction at trial at the point when these parties must determine how to proceed with the criminal case. For example, by Doe's logic, if at the time of conviction, an alien's state statute of conviction encompassed a broader range of drugs than the CSA Schedules,\n   then at that time the alien would not be categorically removable. But if the CSA Schedules were later expanded to encompass the same drugs as the state statute, the same alien could then\n   <em>\n    become\n   </em>\n   removable by the time removal proceedings commenced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Though \"we have held that the Supreme Court's language in [\n   <em>\n    Padilla v.

Without expressing any view as to the merits of Doe's CAT claim, we conclude that such legal error occurred in this case and that remand for further consideration is therefore required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Doe alleged in his removal proceedings that prior to a court appearance in his criminal case, the ringleader of the narcotics conspiracy in which Doe participated issued a general threat to his co-defendants that \"the person who cooperated was going to have problems once that person goes back to the Dominican Republic.\" CAR at 200. Doe also alleged that an individual approached his nephew in the Dominican Republic and informed him that if Doe left jail before the other co-defendants because he was a cooperator, Doe \"was going to have problems if [he] went back to the Dominican Republic.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 204.

This was a mistake. Neither Doe nor the co-defendant testified to that effect at the removal hearing. To the contrary, the co-defendant testified that the ringleader and at least three other co-defendants believed Doe had cooperated because Doe was released from prison early. Doe also points to the prosecutor's sentencing letter, which specifically affirms that Doe's \"information led to the conviction by guilty plea of all seven individuals about whom he provided information\" and that it is \"not mere supposition\" to conclude that Doe's assistance resulted in these pleas \"\n   <em>\n    because [Doe's] inculpation of those individuals was made public in the Complaint\n   </em>\n   , such that each of [his co-defendants] was well aware that [Doe] would likely be able to testify against them at any trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 843 (emphasis added). The IJ's decision does not acknowledge this letter, much less assess its significance to Doe's CAT claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In sum, we conclude that the agency overlooked key evidence and mischaracterized the record when it determined that Doe conceded that only one co-defendant knew about his cooperation. This fundamental legal error undermines the reliability of the agency's determination that Doe's application for CAT relief should be denied. Accordingly, and expressing no view as to the merits, we remand for the agency to determine whether Doe's allegations warrant deferral of removal under the CAT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   We have considered all of Doe's other arguments and find them to be either without merit or beyond our jurisdiction.
