Bennett was convicted of first degree murder. After a capital sentencing hearing, the jury returned a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Two state courts later vacated Bennett's first degree murder conviction, finding that the trial court erroneously instructed the jury that it could convict Bennett of first degree murder based on the shooter's intent to kill. Bennett never got relief; instead, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court reversed. Before us is Bennett's habeas corpus petition, asserting that the trial court's erroneous jury instructions deprived him of due process of law under the United States Constitution. Applying\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review, we agree and will grant the writ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Trial and Sentencing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Pennsylvania Supreme Court summarized the factual history of this case as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   [Bennett] conspired with four individuals, Michael Mayo, Kecia Ray, Kevin Wyatt, and Paul Johnson, to rob a jewelry store in Philadelphia at gunpoint. The store was selected because a salesperson, Ms. Ju Yang Lee, had made what the conspirators believed to be an insultingly low offer for a gold chain that Mayo and Johnson earlier had sought to pawn. Appellee Bennett supplied the loaded gun, but did not enter the store, remaining in the getaway car with Wyatt. Mayo and Johnson were caught on videotape entering and robbing the store. During the robbery, Mayo shot Ms. Lee with [Bennett]'s gun, killing her.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v.

The Commonwealth charged murder generally, and the trial court instructed the jury on first, second, and third degree murder, as well as voluntary manslaughter. The Commonwealth also charged conspiracy generally. The trial court instructed the jury that the objective of the conspiracy was murder, robbery, possession of an instrument of crime, and a firearms offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Bennett was tried jointly with two other non-shooters, Johnson and Wyatt. Johnson entered the jewelry store with the shooter. Wyatt, like Bennett, remained in the getaway\n   car.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . The fourth non-shooter, Ray, testified for the Commonwealth and later received a lenient sentence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mayo, the shooter, was initially on trial with Johnson and Wyatt, but during jury selection suffered \"an acute psychotic episode\" requiring hospitalization. App. 284.

An accomplice or conspirator cannot be convicted of first degree murder based on the specific intent to kill of the principal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v.

Rather, its theory was that he was guilty of first degree murder solely because he was an accomplice and conspirator of the shooter. In the Commonwealth's opening statement, the prosecutor told the jury that \"lest you think I am crazy for saying [Bennett, Johnson and Wyatt] are guilty of first degree murder, when I told you that Michael Mayo fired the fatal shots ... I will urge upon you that the law of conspiracy makes all of these defendants first degree murderers.\" App. 312-13. In closing, the prosecutor argued that \"accomplices are equally guilty with the principal. First degree murder, intent to kill. There is no doubt, there can be no doubt that [the shooter] Michael Mayo intended to kill [the victim]. ... Co-conspirators and accomplices are equally guilty with the principal.\" App. 591-92.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   This argument-that an accomplice or conspirator is \"equally guilty\" of first degree murder-was incorrect as a matter of state law. Nevertheless, the trial court echoed it in its jury instructions. Bennett's petition turns on these jury instructions, and so we describe them in detail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   First, the trial court charged the jury on criminal conspiracy, in relevant part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Where two or more join in the commission of an unjustified assault which results fatally,\n   <em>\n    all are guilty\n   </em>\n   regardless of which one inflicts the mortal wounds. When two or more combine to commit a felony or to make an assault, and in carrying out the common purpose another is killed, the one who enters into the combination but does not personally commit the wrongful act\n   <em>\n    is equally responsible for the homicide\n   </em>\n   as the one who directly causes it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Such responsibility ... extend[s] even to a homicide which is the consequence of the natural and probable execution of the conspiracy\n   <em>\n    even though such homicide is not specifically contemplated by the parties\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   App. 602-03 (emphases added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In response to a jury question the trial court later repeated this instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The trial court also instructed the jury on accomplice liability, in relevant part, as follows: \"[O]ne may be legally accountable for conduct of another not only if he is a coconspirator, but also if he is an accomplice who aids and abets the commission of a crime.\" App. 603. \"The degree of concert or collusion between parties to an illegal transaction means\n   <em>\n    the act of one is the act of all\n   </em>\n   .\" App. 604 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The trial court further instructed the jury on murder, beginning with this introduction:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Each defendant comes before you charged with murder and voluntary manslaughter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Now on this bill, you may find each defendant guilty of murder in the first degree, guilty of murder in the second degree, or guilty of murder in the third degree, or guilty of voluntary manslaughter, or not guilty.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   App. 605.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Five paragraphs later, the trial court instructed the jury on first degree murder, which it defined as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   A criminal homicide constitutes murder of the first degree when it is committed by an intentional killing. As used in this statute, intentional killing means among other things a willful, deliberate and premeditated killing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   A killing is willful and deliberate if the defendant consciously decided to kill the victim and it is premeditated if the defendant possessed a fully-formed intent to kill at the time when he acted and though there need not have been any appreciable amount of time between the time when the defendant first conceived the idea of killing and the time when he acted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   The design to kill can be formulated in a fraction of a second.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   In determining whether or not the defendants committed said kind of intentional killing required for first degree murder, you should consider the testimony of expert witnesses, as well as all other evidence which may shed light on what was going on in the defendant's mind at the time of the alleged killing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   If a defendant intentionally uses a deadly weapon on a vital part of the body, you may infer from this that the killing was intentional.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Specific intent as well as malice may be inferred from the use of a deadly weapon on a vital part of the body.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   App. 606-07.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The jury convicted Bennett of first degree murder and related charges.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   A penalty hearing followed. The Commonwealth sought the death penalty, despite stipulating that Bennett was nineteen years old at the time of the crime and had no significant criminal history. After additional deliberation, the jury returned a sentence of life imprisonment. On June 1, 1993, the trial court formally sentenced Bennett to life imprisonment without the possibility of\n   parole.\n   <em>\n    Bennett VI\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7311353,3901565\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/57/1185/\">\n    57 A.3d at 1189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Post-Conviction Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Bennett did not file a direct appeal. In 1995, he filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   petition under the Pennsylvania Post-Conviction Relief Act (PCRA), in which he asserted,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , two claims relevant to this appeal. First, Bennett asserted that the trial court violated his state and federal due process rights by instructing the jury that he could be convicted of first degree murder without the specific intent to kill. Second, Bennett asserted that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the trial court's erroneous jury instructions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In 1999, the trial court dismissed Bennett's PCRA petition. Bennett filed an appeal. In 2000, the Superior Court dismissed the PCRA appeal because post-conviction counsel failed to file a brief. Bennett subsequently filed a second PCRA petition seeking to reinstate his right to appeal his first PCRA petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Meanwhile, as Bennett's PCRA was winding through the courts, his conspirator, Wyatt, reached the Superior Court on post-conviction proceedings. Wyatt was the other man sitting with Bennett in the getaway car during the botched robbery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bennett VI\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7311353,3901565\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/57/1185/\">\n    57 A.3d at 1187\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The two were tried and convicted together. In 2001, the Superior Court granted Wyatt's PCRA petition and vacated his first degree murder conviction. The court found that that trial court's jury instructions \"improperly permitted the jury to find [Wyatt] guilty of first degree murder without evidence to support that finding,\" and that counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the flawed charge.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v.

Bennett appealed to the same Superior Court that had recently granted Wyatt's petition. In 2004, however, the en banc Superior Court denied relief on procedural grounds.

He raised two claims in the District Court: (1) that he was deprived of due process under the United States Constitution because the trial court's jury instructions erroneously relieved the Commonwealth of its burden to prove the specific intent to kill, and (2) that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the flawed jury instructions. Bennett asserted that he was entitled to\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review because the state court did not adjudicate his federal due process claim on the merits. In response, the Commonwealth argued that Bennett's claims had been decided on the merits, and that he could not overcome the standard of review of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The District Court referred the matter to a Magistrate Judge who issued a report and recommendation. As to Bennett's underlying due process claim, the Magistrate Judge agreed with Bennett that the conspiracy and accomplice liability jury instructions \"do seemingly relieve the Commonwealth of the burden of proving that Bennett had the specific intent to kill, rather than the intent to rob the store.\" App. 21. However, she recommended denying relief under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1). The Magistrate Judge nevertheless observed that numerous state judges had questioned \"the propriety of the charge given in this case in well-reasoned decisions,\" and so recommended granting a certificate of appealability \"on Bennett's due process claim.\" App. 30. The Magistrate Judge recommended denying Bennett's ineffective assistance of counsel claim without a certificate of appealability. The District Court adopted the Report and Recommendation and granted the certificate of appealability in part and denied it in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Bennett's Habeas Corpus Appeal to this Court\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Bennett filed this timely appeal. Consistent with the certificate of appealability, Bennett seeks our review of one claim-his federal due process challenge to the trial court's jury instructions. He does not appeal the denial of his ineffective assistance of counsel claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The Commonwealth's response is surprisingly incongruous. It has chosen not to respond to Bennett's due process claim-the only claim raised on appeal. Instead, it takes the unusual position that Bennett must be raising an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. The Commonwealth asserts as much repeatedly in its brief. For example, it contends that \"Bennett spends 40 pages arguing about the quality of the jury instructions [ ]presumably to make a point that trial counsel's decision not to object was a failure of performance.\" Br. for Appellees at 54. This is incorrect. Bennett addresses the quality of the jury instructions because the claim certified on appeal is a due process challenge to those instructions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The Commonwealth offers an equally unusual explanation for its approach. It asserts that Bennett's claim must be \"a\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   -ineffectiveness claim [because] [t]he Pennsylvania Supreme Court identified it as such in the first page of its opinion.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    at 24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

I will urge upon you that the law of conspiracy makes all of these defendants first degree murderers.\" App. 312-13. In closing, the prosecutor argued that \"accomplices are equally guilty with the principal. First degree murder, intent to kill. There is no doubt, there can be no doubt that [the shooter] Michael Mayo intended to kill [the victim]. ... Co-conspirators and accomplices are equally guilty with the principal.\" App. 591-92.

Moreover, to the extent the Commonwealth's\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   argument left open the question whether it was asserting harmless error, any such possibility was eliminated by the Commonwealth's Rule 28(j) letter of May 19, 2017. In this letter, the Commonwealth took the position that \"\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   prejudice and harmless\n   error are different, and it is the former standard that applies to the only claim properly before the Court.\" Appellees' 28(j) Letter at 1 (May 19, 2017).\n   <em>\n    But cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Whitney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9393091\" index=\"207\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/280/240/#p256\">\n    280 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   258 n.18 (suggesting that \"if a habeas petitioner meets the\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   test, then he/she need not also demonstrate that the error was harmful\").

In closing, the prosecutor argued that that \"[c]o-conspirators and accomplices are equally guilty\" of first degree murder. App. 592.

This is not so in Bennett's case.
