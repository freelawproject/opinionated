Having granted rehearing en banc to consider the matter of second-degree robbery, we are not convinced to depart from our traditional practice by considering a different issue that was not raised in the petition.

I do not dispute that the relevant language from\n   <em>\n    Lewis\n   </em>\n   constitutes dicta, but I take that dicta to mean what it says. In Missouri, according to\n   <em>\n    Lewis\n   </em>\n   : \"[W]here there was no physical contact, no struggle, and no injury, courts have found the evidence insufficient to support a [second-degree] robbery conviction. But where one or more of those circumstances is present, a jury reasonably could find a use of force.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6858350\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/466/629/\">\n    466 S.W.3d at 632\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). The most natural reading of this language is that \"in Missouri a defendant can be convicted of second-degree robbery when he has physical contact with a victim but does not necessarily cause physical pain or injury.\"\n   <em>\n    Bell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12175196\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/840/963/\">\n    840 F.3d at 966\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"[T]his is not the same as concluding the force used by such a defendant is not capable of causing physical pain or injury,\" but it is sufficient to conclude there is a \"reasonable probability\" that Missouri would apply the statute to conduct that does not amount to violent force.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12175196\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/840/963/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (cleaned up).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Furthermore, simply because a principle has been stated in dicta does not mean that lower courts will not rely on it when assessing a sufficiency-of-the-evidence argument; or that prosecutors will not rely on it when making charging decisions; or that defendants and their attorneys will not rely on it when deciding whether to plead guilty or go to trial. Because I believe that\n   <em>\n    Lewis\n   </em>\n   's description of second-degree robbery creates a realistic probability-albeit in dicta-that it will be applied to conduct that does not involve the use or threatened use of violent force, I respectfully dissent from the court's opinion overruling\n   <em>\n    Bell\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
