Graham appeals, arguing the state courts lacked jurisdiction because felony murder is not a crime in Canada. The State cross-appeals the district court's ruling that he has standing to challenge this alleged Treaty violation.

Graham remained in custody in South Dakota. In 2009, he was indicted by a Pennington County grand jury on state charges of premeditated murder and felony murder, with a predicate felony of kidnapping.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Article 2 of the Treaty, as amended, provides that \"[e]xtradition shall be granted for conduct which constitutes an offense punishable by the laws of both Contracting Parties by imprisonment or other form of detention for a term exceeding one year or any greater punishment.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Article 2 incorporates the international law doctrine of dual criminality-\"an accused can be extradited only if the alleged criminal conduct is considered criminal under the laws of both the surrendering\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   requesting nations.\"\n   <em>\n    Murphy v.

As is common, Article 12(1)(iii) also provides that the surrendering country may waive that Treaty limitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Before Graham's trial, the United States sent a diplomatic request to Canada for consent to try Graham on both South Dakota charges. In February 2010, the Canadian Minister of Justice replied:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Consent to Waiver of SpecialtyArticle 12(1)(iii) of the\n   <em>\n    Treaty on Extradition between Canada and the United States of America United States of America v. John Graham\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Having regard to the request from the United States of America dated December 18, 2009, (Diplomatic Note No. 852) and to the provisions of sub-paragraph 12(1)(iii) of the\n   <em>\n    Treaty on Extradition between Canada and the United States of America\n   </em>\n   , I hereby consent to the detention, prosecution and, if he is convicted, punishment of John Graham with respect to the offences which are set forth in the Indictment, No. 09-3953, filed on September 9, 2009, in the Seventh Circuit Court, County of Pennington, namely:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Count 1: Murder while in the Commission of any felony namely kidnapping, in violation of South Dakota Codified Law 22-16-9 and 22-19-1; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Count 3: Premeditated Murder, in violation of South Dakota Codified Law 22-16-4.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Graham was then tried. The South Dakota jury convicted him of felony murder and acquitted him of premeditated murder. He was sentenced to life in prison. On appeal, he argued the trial court lacked jurisdiction to prosecute him for felony murder because it was a different crime than the premeditated murder charge for which he was extradited. The South Dakota Supreme Court rejected this \"rule of specialty\" argument based on the explicit Canadian Consent to Waiver of Specialty.\n   <em>\n    State v. Graham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7068703\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/815/293/#p299\">\n    815 N.W.2d 293\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 299-301 (S.D. 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Graham then filed a state court application for post-conviction relief, arguing that his conviction violated the \"dual criminality\" provision in Article 2 of the Treaty because felony murder is not a crime in Canada. The Seventh Judicial Circuit Court concluded this claim was barred by res judicata because Graham had raised it on direct appeal. Graham sought to appeal\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   but the Supreme Court of South Dakota dismissed his motion for a certificate of probable cause because he did not serve a copy on the State, \"a prerequisite to the Court's jurisdiction to consider said motion pursuant to SDCL 21-27-18.1.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Graham then filed this timely petition for a federal writ of habeas corpus. In the claim at issue, he asserts that the South Dakota trial court lacked jurisdiction to try him because felony murder is not a crime in Canada and therefore is not an extraditable offense under Article 2 of the Treaty. A federal writ of habeas corpus will issue for a person who is in state custody \"in violation of the ... treaties of the United States.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Graham argues this appeal concerns the doctrine of dual criminality reflected in Article 2, not the rule of specialty reflected in Article 12(1). But we conclude the dual criminality issue turns on the legal effect of the Consent to Waiver of Specialty that United States diplomatic officials obtained from the Canadian Minister of Justice before Graham was convicted of felony murder in violation of South Dakota law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Our analysis begins with Graham's rule of specialty argument rejected by the Supreme Court of South Dakota on direct appeal, an issue that he exhausted but did not pursue in his federal habeas corpus petition. In\n   <em>\n    Rauscher\n   </em>\n   , a defendant extradited from Great Britain for prosecution on a charge of murder in the United States challenged his conviction in this country for a different crime, cruel and unusual punishment.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8299940\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/119/407/#p422\">\n    119 U.S. at 409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8299940\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/119/407/#p422\">\n    7 S.Ct. 234\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Like the Lanham Act claimant in\n   <em>\n    Lexmark\n   </em>\n   , Graham clearly has Article III standing to seek a writ of habeas corpus challenging his ongoing custody for a South Dakota crime.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12706985,12579076\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1377/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12706985,12579076\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1377/\">\n    at 1386\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Rather, as treaties like statutes are part of the law of the land, the question is whether Graham has what the Court referred to as \"statutory standing\" because his claim \"fall[s] within the zone of interests protected by the law invoked.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12706985,12579076\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1377/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quotation omitted). The Court explained that this question, though placed under the rubric of \"prudential standing\" in past cases, \"is an issue that requires us to determine, using traditional tools of statutory interpretation, whether a legislatively conferred cause of action encompasses a particular plaintiff's claim.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12706985,12579076\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1377/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12706985,12579076\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1377/\">\n    at 1387\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Of course, the analysis of statutory rights and treaty rights may differ significantly, but both are inquiries going to the merits of a plaintiff's claim, not to the plaintiff's \"standing\" to be in federal court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Graham's position is even more flawed. His argument is premised entirely on the dual criminality provision. Thus, it would necessarily apply if Canada had initially extradited him to be prosecuted for premeditated murder\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   felony murder. In that case, Graham would be asking a United States court to rule that Canada violated Article 2 of the Treaty by concluding that a United States charge of felony murder was \"conduct which constitutes an offense punishable by the laws of\" Canada. Such a ruling would be contrary to a basic principle of the act of state doctrine: \"the courts of one country will not sit in judgment on the acts of the government of another, done within its own territory.\"\n   <em>\n    Banco Nacional de Cuba v.

Thus, it is not\n   surprising that Graham cites no case in which a United States court granted such relief.

Article 12(1)(iii) limited the authority to consent to offenses \"covered by Article 2.\" Thus, in granting the Consent to Waiver of Specialty, the Minister of Justice \"necessarily determined that, in the light of the evidence presented, the conduct charged would have violated [Canadian] law (therefore satisfying the element [of dual] criminality) and was also an extraditable offense.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.
