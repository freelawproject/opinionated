They have driven the world's economy (particularly that of the United States) for over a century. Discovering marketable deposits, extracting them from the ground, refining them, and delivering them to consumers in useful form is big business, on one hand fraught with risk and on the other richly rewarding. That being so, it has attracted the attention of governments as a lucrative source of tax revenue as well as royalties, bonuses, etc., derived from government-owned reserves and as a way of directing public policy. Since oil and gas are the most energy dense\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and convenient of the fossil fuels, litigation and regulation abound with respect to them. But, in large measure mineral owners (private and public) and those involved with mineral producers have been free to contractually \"strike their own deals.\" Myriad matters are involved; here we are principally concerned with construing the language of leases in accordance\n   with prevailing law-both statutes and case law. Statutes, of course, properly direct policy. So do cases, more covertly, but no less dramatically.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Oil and gas law is rife with duties owed by the lessee to the lessor. Some of those duties are expressed in an agreement (the lease). Others duties are imposed by the courts as implied covenants.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   , 6 Peter Linzer, Corbin on Contracts \u00a7 26.1 (Joseph M. Perillo ed. 2010). This case involves the implied covenant to market gas. It benefits the lessor, in particular, by insuring that the lessee uses reasonable efforts to market potential production. That way the lessor can enjoy the benefits the lease provides. This case deals with that implied covenant, but more particularly with what has come to be known as the marketable condition rule. In its purest form, that advocated by appellants, it not only requires the lessor to market the gas, but to do so solely at its expense. Colorado has adopted a version of the marketable condition rule, which applies only when the lease does not provide otherwise. Years ago we predicted New Mexico would not adopt the marketable condition rule and so far neither the legislature nor the New Mexico Supreme Court has done so. Accordingly, our decision rests on the terms of the leases involved. We rely on the text of the leases and the meaning commonly ascribed to the language used (the essence of the common law, which reflects the practices of the community, rather than dictates practices to the community).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The San Juan Basin, located in northwestern New Mexico and southern Colorado, is a rich source of oil and natural gas. Energen owns and operates oil and gas wells in the Basin.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Its wells are subject to leases and other agreements (many of which are quite old) requiring it to pay a monthly royalty or overriding royalty\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   on production to the Anderson Living Trust, the Pritchett Living Trust, the Neely-Robertson Revocable Family Trust (N-R Trust), and the Tatum Living Trust. The royalty interests of the Anderson, Pritchett, and N-R Trusts (collectively the New Mexico Trusts) derive from wells located in New Mexico, the Tatum Trust's royalty interest from wells located in Colorado.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Believing Energen was systematically underpaying royalties, all of the Trusts filed a putative class action complaint against it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The New Mexico Trusts claimed Energen was improperly deducting from their royalties their proportionate share of (1) the costs it incurs to place the gas produced from the wells in a marketable condition (post-production costs) and (2) a privilege tax the State of New Mexico imposes on natural gas processors (the natural gas processors tax). They also alleged Energen had not timely paid royalties or interest thereon, as required by the New Mexico Oil and Gas Proceeds Payments Act. Both the New Mexico Trusts and the Tatum Trust further claimed Energen was wrongfully failing to pay royalty on the gas it used as fuel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The district judge dismissed the New Mexico Trusts' marketable condition rule claim for failure to state a claim under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) and entered summary judgment in favor of Energen on the remaining claims. All of the Trusts appeal from those judgments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Our review is de novo.\n   <em>\n    Birch v.

R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) is reviewed de novo).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   For the most part we agree with the district judge, particularly in the following respects:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , under New Mexico law, Energen had the duty to diligently market the gas for the benefit of the New Mexico Trusts but that duty\n   <em>\n    did not\n   </em>\n   prohibit it from deducting from their royalty payments their proportionate share of post-production costs-those costs necessary to make the gas marketable (i.e., the marketable condition rule does not apply in New Mexico).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , nothing in the New Mexico Natural Gas Processors Tax Act or other New Mexico law prohibited Energen from deducting the Trusts' proportionate share of the tax from their royalties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    Finally\n   </em>\n   , the Anderson and Pritchett Trusts' lease allows Energen to use produced gas as fuel without paying royalty on it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In some respects, we part ways with him. They relate to: (1) the fuel gas claims made by the N-R Trust and Tatum Trust and (2) the New Mexico Trusts' claim under the New Mexico Oil and Gas Proceeds Payments Act. As to the former, the N-R Trust's overriding royalty agreement requires royalty to be paid on all gas produced, including that gas used as fuel. And the Tatum Trust's leases explicitly prohibit Energen from deducting post-production costs (Energen treats its use of the fuel gas as an in-kind post-production cost). Moreover, the \"free use\" clauses and royalty provisions in the Tatum Trust's leases limit the free use of gas to that occurring on the leased premises. Because use of the fuel gas occurs off the leased premises, Energen owes royalty on that gas. With regard to the latter, the judge was right in permitting Energen to hold funds owed to the N-R Trust in a suspense account until a title issue concerning a well was resolved in favor of that Trust. However, he did not address whether the N-R Trust was entitled to statutory interest on those funds. It was so entitled, yet the current record (at least as we read it) does not show interest to have been paid on the funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   We now explain. Because all claims do not apply to all appellants, we discuss the issues separately, providing a brief background of the facts relevant to each.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Marketable Condition Rule-New Mexico Trusts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The gas\n   <em>\n    produced\n   </em>\n   from Energen's wells on the leased properties is not marketed (sold) at the wellhead.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   8 Howard R. Williams &amp; Charles J. Meyers,\n   <em>\n    Oil and Gas Law\n   </em>\n   , at 830 (2011) (defining \"[p]roduction of gas\" as \"[t]he act of bringing forth gas from the earth\"). It is first gathered, compressed, dehydrated, and treated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Energen contracts with third-party companies to perform these services. It then sells the\n   <em>\n    processed\n   </em>\n   gas at the tailgate of the third-party processing plants to various energy companies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Energen pays the New Mexico Trusts, as royalty, a portion of the downstream sales price. However, it deducts from that price each Trust's proportionate share of the fees it pays to third-party companies to make the gas marketable (post-production costs).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The New Mexico Trusts claim this deduction is improper because, in their words, New Mexico law imposes an implied duty on Energen to market the gas for the benefit of the royalty owners and that duty necessarily prohibits Energen from deducting post-production costs from their royalty payments (generally referred to as the marketable condition rule).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The New Mexico Trusts' leases set the basis for royalty payments as the \"market value at the well\" or the \"prevailing field market price.\" (Appellants' App'x at 342 (N-R Trust), 338 (Anderson and Pritchett Trusts).) Determining those amounts, however, is not straightforward, because Energen does not sell the gas it produces on these leased properties \"at the well.\" As we explained in\n   <em>\n    Abraham v. BP America Production Co.\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   In order to determine the market value of the unprocessed gas at the well, producers sell refined natural gas and NGLs [natural gas liquids] at the tailgate of the processing plant (i.e., after processing) to establish a base sales amount, and deduct from that amount costs for transportation, processing, etc. This is called a \"netback\" or \"workback\" method, and it is widely accepted as the best means for estimating the market value of gas at the well where no such market exists.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3902137\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/685/1196/#p1200\">\n    685 F.3d 1196\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1200 (10th Cir. 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Properly understood, the netback method is not a means of cost-shifting; it is a means of determining the net profit on the\n   oil and gas by \"netting\" the gross profit. The post-production expenses are not subtracted from the sales amount because the royalty owners are responsible for post-production expenses; they are subtracted as an accounting mechanism to determine the market value at the wellhead. Stated differently, \"value added\" to the gas produced at the wellhead solely through the effort and expense of the lessee must be deducted from an established market price of the improved product in order to make an accurate estimate of the value of the gas at the wellhead. In simple terms, if [A] the market value at the wellhead + [B] the value added in the production process (post-production costs)\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   = [C] the value of the processed natural gas (the sales price of the processed gas), then [C] - [B] = [A]. Subtracting [B] does not shift some of the costs of production to the lessors; it is an accounting adjustment designed to effectuate the intention of the parties as it is expressed in the parties' agreement-the lease. The Fifth Circuit explained this rationale years ago:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   [I]n the analytical process of reconstructing a market value where none otherwise exists with sufficient definiteness, all increase in the ultimate sales value attributable to the expenses incurred in transporting and processing the commodity must be deducted. The royalty owner shares only in what is left over, whether stated in terms of cash or an end product. In this sense he bears his proportionate part[ ] of that cost, but not because the obligation (or expense) of production rests on him. Rather, it is because that is the way in which [one] arrives at the value of the gas at the moment it seeks to escape from the wellhead.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    Freeland v.

Gas Used as Fuel-New Mexico Trusts and Tatum Lease\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   This issue requires us to meld statutory and case law with various provisions in an oil and gas lease. Those provisions include the royalty provision, which dictates how much the lessee owes the owner of the mineral rights for the right to extract and sell oil and gas from the land, and the \"free use\" clause, which governs the right of a lessee to use oil and gas (fuel gas) from the leased properties in its operations.

They further claim the \"free use\" clause limits Energen's free use of gas to that occurring on the leased premises. According to them, because the third-party companies' use of the gas occurs off the leased premises, the clause is inapplicable and they are entitled to royalty on that gas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The argument is problematic. The royalty language consists of two disparate parts. The first relates to \"gas only\" wells and requires royalty to be paid on \"gas marketed from each well\" and provides for a royalty of 1/8 of the market value at the wellhead when, as here, the gas is marketed off the leased premises. The provision relating to \"casinghead gas\" (gas produced from an oil well) is remarkably different and more specific-a royalty payment is due for \"casinghead gas produced from any oil well and used by lessee off the leased premises for any purpose or used on the lease premises by the lessee for purposes other than development and operation thereof.\" (Appellants' App'x at 338.) The record does not clearly reveal whether the wells at issue are gas only or oil wells producing \"casinghead gas.\" The parties and the judge seem to have assumed the gas at issue was produced from gas only wells.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   In their arguments to us, the Trusts rely on the \"casinghead gas\" royalty provisions, but by our reckoning they have never claimed or provided any evidence that the gas used as fuel in this case is \"casinghead gas.\" Accordingly, we look to the royalty provision relating to gas only wells.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   That royalty provision requires royalty to be paid only on \"gas\n   <em>\n    marketed\n   </em>\n   from each well\" (sold gas) and royalty is owed on the market value of the gas at the wellhead if, as here, it is marketed off the leased premises. As we have already explained (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 832-34 and note 12), this allows Energen to deduct its post-production\n   costs, including the fuel gas (which is an in-kind post-production cost), from the sales price of the gas to arrive at that value. Although the marketable condition rule would perhaps produce a different result, the New Mexico Supreme Court has not adopted that rule and we see no indication that it will or, if it does, it will apply the rule when the royalty provision requires royalty to be paid on the market value of the gas at the well, which allows for deduction of post-production costs from the downstream sales price to arrive at that value. Moreover, the fact the lease expressly imposes a royalty on casinghead gas \"used off the leased premises for any purpose\" strongly suggests royalty payments are not expected on the production from gas only wells, which contain no such restriction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The \"free use\" clause supports this conclusion. Since nothing else in the lease suggests otherwise, the \"free use\" clause is only self-limiting. The Trusts seem to agree, as their arguments focus only on the applicability of\n   <em>\n    Lyons\n   </em>\n   in assessing the\n   <em>\n    scope\n   </em>\n   of the \"free use\" clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   In arguing the \"free use\" clause obviates any requirement for it to make the royalty payment the Trusts seek, Energen relies on\n   <em>\n    Lyons.\n   </em>\n   In it, the New Mexico Supreme Court analyzed a \"free use\" clause in a\n   <em>\n    state lease\n   </em>\n   which granted the lessees \"the right ... to the free use of oil [and] gas ...\n   <em>\n    from\n   </em>\n   said lands\" \"for the sole and only purpose of exploration, development and production of oil and/or gas\n   <em>\n    thereon\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    therefrom\n   </em>\n   with the right to own all oil and gas so produced and saved therefrom and not reserved as royalty by the lessor ....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=299%20P.3d%20844\">\n    299 P.3d at 855\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation marks omitted). The New Mexico Supreme Court concluded this language gave the lessee the right \"to the free use of oil and gas produced\n   <em>\n    from\n   </em>\n   the leased premises,\n   <em>\n    regardless of where the use occurred\n   </em>\n   , so long as the oil and gas was being used to further the economical operations of said land.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 856 (first emphasis in original, second emphasis added). Because the gas used by the post-production service providers in\n   <em>\n    Lyons\n   </em>\n   was for the development and production of the leased premises, it was not subject to royalty.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The Trusts tell us\n   <em>\n    Lyons\n   </em>\n   does not control because it explicitly said its decision does not apply to private leases, only state leases. However, while the Court said \"[\n   <em>\n    t\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    his opinion\n   </em>\n   should not be interpreted as affecting private oil and gas leases agreements,\"\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 860 (emphasis added), it did so in its discussion of the marketable condition rule.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 860. It did not limit its analysis of the \"free use\" clause to state leases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The Trusts also argue\n   <em>\n    Lyons\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable because the \"free use\" clause in that case required the gas to be \"\n   <em>\n    from\n   </em>\n   said lands\" for the exploration, development, and production of oil and gas \"\n   <em>\n    thereon\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    therefrom\n   </em>\n   .\" They claim these terms imply a use away from the leased premises. In contrast, the \"free use\" clause found in their lease uses only the term \"thereon,\" which they claim implies the use will occur on the leased premises.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   \"Thereon\" means \"on that.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   https://www.merriamwebster.com/dictionary/thereon;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014) (defining \"thereon\" as \"[o]n that or them\"). Applying this plain meaning to the \"free use\" clause in the Anderson and Pritchett Trusts' lease, it seems the clause requires that the use of gas \"found on said land\" be for operations \"on that\" land. But in\n   <em>\n    Lyons\n   </em>\n   , the Court relied on\n   <em>\n    Bice v.

The record demonstrates the residue gas is used in furtherance of overall lease operations because it is used to fuel equipment which separates the oil, gas and water into separate streams, thereby allowing the [the processing plant] to process the gas into a marketable product and to recover other products sold at the plant tailgate.\n   <em>\n    Since the residue gas is used in furtherance of the leased operations, we conclude the district court did not err in determining the \"free use\" clause allowed Petro-Hunt to use the residue gas off of the leased premises to fuel the central tank batteries\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 503-04 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   By favorably citing\n   <em>\n    Bice\n   </em>\n   , the New Mexico Supreme Court seems to have suggested that if confronted with a \"free use\" clause similar to that in the Anderson and Pritchett Trusts' lease it would rule the same way. Thus, the phrase \"operations thereon\" in the Anderson and Pritchett Trusts' \"free use\" clause is not a limitation on where the use of the gas may occur but rather a limitation on the purposes for which the gas may be used-furtherance of the lease operations. That is an expansive provision, easily satisfied in this case. Gas is provided to third-party processors as partial payment for the services they render in making the gas marketable (and the Trusts' royalty payments are only reduced by their pro-rata share of the expense). That furthers the lease operations. Without it, there would be no viable market for the product. The Trusts do not contend otherwise. Instead, they attempt to distinguish\n   <em>\n    Bice\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   They claim the reason\n   <em>\n    Bice\n   </em>\n   held the \"free use\" clauses allowed Petro-Hunt to use gas free of cost to fuel its central tank batteries off the leased premises is because the functions performed by those tank batteries were those normally performed on the leased premises.

The New Mexico Supreme Court has interpreted similar language differently. The use of water from the leased premises to supply employee housing would, remotely, be a use in furtherance of the lease operations. But saying so strains credulity beyond elastic limits and is therefore unlike the use of gas in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Energen was entitled to summary judgment on the Anderson and Pritchett Trusts' fuel gas claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    N-R Trust\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   The N-R Trust's overriding royalty agreement requires Energen to pay \"at the prevailing field market price therefor at the time when produced a royalty in cash or oil amounting to seven and one half (7 \u00bd) percentum\n   <em>\n    of all oil and gas produced\n   </em>\n   from the lands embraced in said primary lease ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Appellants' App'x at 342 (emphasis added).)

True enough.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   The royalty provision is explicit: royalty is owed on\n   <em>\n    all oil and gas produced\n   </em>\n   from the leased lands. In other words, royalty is to be paid on all gas emerging from the wellhead of each well within the area described in the lease. The royalty provision does not exclude gas used as fuel and, unlike the Anderson and Pritchett Trusts' lease, this lease does not contain a \"free use\" clause. Energen has been using fuel\n   gas royalty free, as it could if the lease had a \"free use\" provision permitting it do so. Its practice is not only contrary to the royalty provision of the lease, it also impermissibly reads into the lease a \"free use\" clause that is not there.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thompson v.

But that is only half of the issue; the value of the fuel gas at the wellhead must be computed (as with the Anderson and Pritchett Trusts) using the netback method.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Although royalty is owed on all gas produced, it need be paid based \"at the prevailing\n   <em>\n    field market price ... at the time when produced\n   </em>\n   .\" The field market price at \"the time when produced\" is the value of the gas at the wellhead, where production occurs, when production occurs. In calculating that value, Energen may deduct the value of the fuel gas consumed as a post-production cost (along with other post-production costs), but it must also pay royalty on the wellhead value of the fuel gas consumed. Determining the wellhead value of the fuel gas consumed cannot be made on this record, given the myriad variables involved. For instance, the district judge voiced at least part of the valuation problem-lost volume. No royalty is due, he said, on lost gas volume.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Appellants' App'x at 1139-40. Perhaps so\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   ; we express no opinion. If correct, it underscores the need to determine the amount of fuel gas consumed, post-production, as well as its wellhead value. At the end of the day, the royalty owed on fuel gas may be small, but it must be determined. However, if the measurements necessary to compute the wellhead value of gas cannot be cost effectively made, reasonable estimates may suffice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   We have identified a unifying theme, not only here but for the Anderson and Pritchett Trusts' lease as well: royalties are to be calculated according to the lease terms and unless the lease provides otherwise the netback method should be used to determine the wellhead value of any gas at issue. We have every confidence that, aided by counsel, the district judge, who has demonstrated a comprehensive understanding of Oil and Gas Law, can find a way through the thicket.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   The summary judgment entered in favor of Energen on the N-R Trust's fuel gas claim was improper.

The leases have \"free use\" clauses, but a \"free use\" clause may be limited by other lease provisions (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 842-44). The Tatum Trust lease has exactly that kind of limitation: it provides the Trust \"shall not bear, directly or indirectly, any production or post-production cost or expenses, including ... cost or expenses for storing, separating, dehydrating, transporting, compressing, treating, gathering or otherwise rendering marketable or marketing the [gas], and no deduction or reduction shall be made for any such costs and expenses in computing any payment ... to be made to Lessor.\" (Appellants' App'x at 390, 403.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Energen seems to make \"heads I win, tails you lose\" arguments. For purposes of the New Mexico Trusts' fuel gas claims, it labels the fuel gas an in-kind post-production cost, which is deductible under the royalty provisions of those Trusts' agreements and New Mexico law (which does not apply the marketable condition rule). But it shies away from that label when discussing the Tatum Trust's fuel gas claim, most likely because Colorado prohibits oil and gas well operators like Energen from deducting from the royalty payment the costs necessary to render the gas marketable, unless the lease provides otherwise.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Garman\n   </em>\n   , 886 P.2d at 653-54, 659-60. These leases\n   <em>\n    do not provide otherwise\n   </em>\n   ; in fact, they explicitly prohibit Energen from deducting post-production costs from the Trust's royalty. Energen cannot have it both ways-treating the fuel gas as an in-kind post-production cost when convenient but ignoring that treatment when it is not. In any event, as we now explain, the \"free use\" clause does not help it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   \"Free use\" clauses are generally limited to the use of gas on the leased premises unless the clause expressly states otherwise. 3 Williams &amp; Meyers, \u00a7 661.4 at 763. In this case, applying Colorado's rules of contract interpretation, the plain language of the \"free use\" clauses and the royalty provisions lead us to conclude the general rule applies-the use of the gas must occur on the leased premises to be free of royalty.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pepcol Mfg. Co. v. Denver Union Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10428332\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/687/1310/#p1313\">\n    687 P.2d 1310\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1313 (Colo. 1984) (in construing a contract, we look to the contract as a whole and seek \"to ascertain and give effect to the mutual intent of the parties\"; \"[i]n the absence of contrary manifestation of intent in the contract itself, contractual terms that have a generally prevailing meaning will be interpreted according to that meaning\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   The \"free use\" clauses in the Tatum Trust's leases provide: \"[Energen] shall have free use of oil, gas and water from said land ...\n   <em>\n    for all operations hereunder\n   </em>\n   .\" (Appellants' App'x at 392, 483 (emphasis added).) The plain meaning of \"hereunder\" is \"under or in accordance with this writing or document\" or \"[a]s provided for under the terms of this document.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hereunder;https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/hereunder;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014) (defining \"hereunder\" as \"[l]ater in this document\" or \"[i]n accordance with this document\"). The term \"hereunder\" qualifies the phrase \"all operations.\" So, to be free of royalties, the use of the gas must be for operations \"under or in accordance\" with the lease or \"as provided for under the terms\" of the lease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Looking to the terms of the Tatum Trust's leases, the premises was leased \"for the sole and only purpose of exploring, drilling, and operating for and producing oil and gas and of laying pipelines,\n   storing oil and building tanks, telephone lines, roads and structures\n   <em>\n    thereon\n   </em>\n   to produce, save, care for, treat and transport said substances produced from the land leased hereunder.\" (Appellants' App'x at 403 (emphasis added).) As we read it, the purpose of the lease was to allow Energen to produce oil and gas\n   <em>\n    from the leased premises\n   </em>\n   and to store oil and build infrastructure\n   <em>\n    on the leased premises\n   </em>\n   . Thus, the operations called for by the lease are those occurring on the leased premises. As a result, the plain language of the \"free use\" clauses in these leases suggests only gas used on the leased premises is free of royalty. Fuel gas used off the leased premises is not a free use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   But even if the \"free use\" clauses do not supply a geographical limitation, the royalty provisions do. They differ from those appearing in the New Mexico Trusts' agreements. They provide:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-132\">\n   Lessee shall pay Lessor royalty ... on all gas ... produced from a well on the leased premises or on lands pooled with the leased premises and\n   <em>\n    sold or used\n   </em>\n   off the leased premises regardless of whether or not such [gas is] produced to the credit of Lessee or sold under a contract executed or binding on Lessee. Should [gas] be sold under a sales contract not binding on Lessor, Lessor's royalty shall be calculated by using the highest price paid for any of the [gas] produced from the well from which such [gas] was produced.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   (Appellants' App'x at 403 (emphasis added).) As the Tatum Trust argues, these provisions require Energen to pay it royalty on gas (1) produced from a well on the leased premises and (2) sold or used off the leased premises.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   Gas used as fuel by the third-party processing companies is \"used off the leased premises.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under the express terms of the royalty provisions, royalty is owed to the Tatum Trust on this gas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   The district judge imposed limitations on the royalty provisions not supported by the express language of the leases. First, he decided royalties were due only when Energen sells gas off the leased premises but the Trust receives no money for that sale. But the provisions explicitly apply not only to the sale of gas off the leased premises but also to the\n   <em>\n    use\n   </em>\n   of gas off the leased land. He further limited the royalty provisions to require royalty to be paid only on gas that is \"produced\" and (critically) concluded that fuel gas is not produced. Apparently, he equated \"produced\" with \"processed.\" The leases do not define \"produced.\" However, while the gas at the wellhead, including the fuel gas, may not be processed, it is produced.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   8 Williams &amp; Meyers, at 830 (defining \"[p]roduction of gas\" as \"[t]he act of bringing forth gas from the earth\"). Indeed, even Energen labels the fuel gas as an in-kind\n   <em>\n    post-production\n   </em>\n   cost.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Relying on\n   <em>\n    Lyons\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Bice\n   </em>\n   , Energen says the \"free use\" clauses should be interpreted\n   to allow it to use gas free of cost so long as the use is in furtherance of the lease operations, irrespective of whether that use occurs on or off the leased premises.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   <em>\n    Lyons\n   </em>\n   controls as to the Anderson and Pritchett Trusts' fuel gas claim. But because the Tatum Trust's interests lie in wells located in Colorado, its law controls the fuel gas debate. The district judge concluded Colorado would decide the issue similar to the New Mexico Supreme Court largely because the Tatum Trust produced no cases holding otherwise. But the converse is also true; the judge cited no Colorado cases adopting the\n   <em>\n    Lyons\n   </em>\n   rationale and we can find none. We are left with applying generally accepted principles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   In addition to interpreting a \"free use\" clause containing the phrase \"thereon,\"\n   <em>\n    Bice\n   </em>\n   , a North Dakota case, interpreted a \"free use\" clause giving the operator the right to \"free use of oil, gas and water from said land ... for\n   <em>\n    all its operations hereunder\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7086012\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/768/496/\">\n    768 N.W.2d at 503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). It concluded this clause allowed the operator to use the gas free of cost so long as the gas is used in furtherance of lease operations, regardless of where that use occurs.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . The only reason we relied on\n   <em>\n    Bice\n   </em>\n   in resolving the New Mexico Trusts' fuel gas claim is because it was cited favorably in\n   <em>\n    Lyons\n   </em>\n   . No Colorado case has done so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Energen also tells us our reading of the royalty provisions would nullify the \"free use\" clauses and argues the more specific \"free use\" clauses prevail over the broad language of the royalty provisions. But its arguments are based on there being a conflict between the royalty provisions and the \"free use\" clauses. There is no conflict. The royalty provisions require royalty to be paid on gas produced from the leased premises and sold or used off the leased premises. The \"free use\" clauses, on the other hand, suggest Energen may use gas from the leased premises free of royalty only when the use of the gas occurs on the leased premise or, at the very least, when the use accords with the other provisions of the leases, including their royalty provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   At first blush it may appear our resolution of the Tatum Trust's fuel gas claim is inconsistent with that of the Anderson and Pritchett Trusts' fuel gas claim. Any \"inconsistency,\" however, derives from the different state law and lease provisions applicable to each.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   We reverse the summary judgment and remand the Tatum Trust's fuel gas claim to the district court for reconsideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

Suppose a car salesman has a contract giving him a 10% commission per car, based on the price the dealership paid to acquire the car. Whether the car is marked up $5,000 or $10,000, his commission does not change, since it is based on what the dealership paid to acquire the car. One day he sells a car at a $5,000 mark-up for a gross profit of $25,000. When it is time to pay his commission, no one can find the bill giving the price the dealership paid for that car. But they all agree it was sold for $25,000 at a mark-up of $5,000. Of course, that is all they need. By subtracting the mark-up from the gross price, they figure out the dealership must have paid $20,000 for the car. The salesman gets his $2,000 commission. In that context, we see how little sense it would make to say that the salesman is \"bearing the cost\" of the dealership's mark-up, because we subtracted the mark-up from the gross profit. We only subtracted the mark-up to figure out what the dealership paid for the car, which is the contracted-for basis of the salesman's commission. This is also how the netback calculation works, and it makes just as little sense to say that the royalty owners are bearing the post-production costs. The point is to calculate the royalty payments based on the market value at the wellhead-the price that would have been paid at the wellhead if there were a market there.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-166\">\n    Colorado, on the other hand, appears to abide by what the parties' agreement says on the matter.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Garman v.

The parties do not provide copies of that lease but we assume the quoted language from the N-R Trust's overriding royalty interest accurately repeats the language of the federal lease, which is, of course, controlling. Production costs cannot be deducted from the overriding royalty interest; post-production costs may, however, if payment is to be made on the value of the gas at the well.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"23\">\n   <p id=\"p-181\">\n    The district judge concluded that even though the N-R Trust's lease did not contain a \"free use\" clause, New Mexico law allowing for the deduction of post-production costs to calculate the value of gas at the wellhead necessarily allowed Energen to the free use of fuel gas (because the fuel gas is an in-kind post-production cost that can be deducted to arrive at the value of the gas at the wellhead). He relied on language in\n    <em>\n     Lyons\n    </em>\n    , indicating that fuel gas is a post-production cost which is neither sold nor saved by the operator and therefore is not subject to royalty. But that statement from\n    <em>\n     Lyons\n    </em>\n    came in its discussion of a \"free use\" clause,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=299%20P.3d%20844\">\n     299 P.3d at 856\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , something the N-R Trust's lease does not contain. Moreover, as we have explained, the N-R Trust's royalty provision requires royalty to be paid on all gas produced,\n    <em>\n     not just gas that is marketed\n    </em>\n    . And, while the fuel gas can be deducted as a post-production cost from the sales price of the processed gas (non-fuel gas) to arrive at that gas's value at the wellhead, Energen must also pay royalty on the fuel gas (at its value at the wellhead).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"24\">\n   <p id=\"p-182\">\n    But compare the N-R Trust's royalty provision requiring royalty to be paid on all gas \"produced\" with the Anderson and Pritchett Trusts' lease, which requires royalty only on gas (from a gas well) \"marketed\" (sold). Does the former, but not the latter, require royalty to be paid on lost gas?\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"25\">\n   <p id=\"p-183\">\n    Energen argues the Tatum Trust waived any reliance on the royalty provisions because other than citing them, it does not otherwise provide any legal argument. We agree the Trust's argument is less than eloquent. However, the Trust does say \"the express terms of the royalty language in the ... Tatum leases ... address whether royalty is due on the value of natural gas\n    <em>\n     used off the lease premises\n    </em>\n    \" and then highlights the relevant portions of the leases. (Appellants' Op. Br. at 26-27.) It repeats this argument later in its brief: \"The royalty language in the Tatum lease states that royalty is due for gas 'used off the lease premises.' \" (\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    . at 34.) We consider the argument sufficiently raised.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"26\">\n   <p id=\"p-184\">\n    Nothing in our discussion should be read to apply to the use of gas to fuel post-production processes occurring on the leased premises.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
