In No. 16-16866, the Hospitals appealed the denial of retroactive relief, and in No. 16-17080 the Department cross-appealed the determination that its policies violated the dormant Commerce Clause. Also, in No. 17-15550, the Department appealed the grant of attorney's fees to the Hospitals.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201988\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).

Thus, we reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Hospitals filed a complaint in the Superior Court of the State of California on June 12, 2014, alleging that portions of the Department's reimbursement methodologies violated the dormant Commerce\n   Clause.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Department removed the action to the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. Thereafter, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, and the district court granted a partial summary judgment to the Hospitals. Specifically, the district court held that certain of the Department's reimbursement policies regarding out-of-state hospitals violated the dormant Commerce Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After the district court issued its summary judgment ruling, the parties met and conferred and the court issued another order entitled \"Order Re Outstanding Provisions\" which clarified and resolved several of the issues the court had raised in its summary judgment order and enumerated steps that the Department was required to take in order to ensure that its reimbursement methodologies complied with the dormant Commerce Clause. The district court later denied the Hospitals' request for retroactive monetary relief under California Civil Procedure Code section 1085 for certain reimbursements incurred between July 1, 2013, (the date on which the Department implemented its current methodology) and December 21, 2015 (the date on which the district court issued its summary judgment order).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Hospitals then filed a premature appeal to this court that was dismissed. Following that, the Department filed a motion for reconsideration of the summary judgment order on the grounds that the Hospitals had waived the federal claims and were relying solely on California Civil Procedure Code section 1085, which did not provide a basis for relief. In response, the Hospitals sought leave to file an amended complaint to add a civil rights claim as a basis for their constitutional and statutory claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The district court granted the Hospitals' motion to file an amended complaint. The court also granted the Department's motion for reconsideration and clarified that the Hospitals were not entitled to any relief under section 1085. The Hospitals moved for an award of attorney's fees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201988\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).

Of course, that is the very sort of issue that is faced regularly by insureds in the private insurance market. Finally, lest there be doubt, we note that, like any other market participant, the Department is subject to market pressures and conditions. It must, indeed, set its payment rates at a level that is \"sufficient to enlist enough providers so that care and services are available under the plan at least to the extent that such care and services are available to the general population in the geographic area.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(30)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   This program is very similar to the program endorsed by us when we decided that the State of Alaska was acting as a market participant when it instituted a milk-purchase plan. There, as here, the state received federal funds to purchase benefits for its citizens.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    Big Country Foods\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1867389\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/952/1173/#p1178\">\n    952 F.2d at 1175\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

It did not try to tell third parties what they could or could not do. That was so even though the state level government itself did impose rules on individual school districts-the actual buyers-because we deemed the districts to be the state for this purpose.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1867389\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/952/1173/#p1178\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1867389\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/952/1173/#p1178\">\n    at 1179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, the fact that federal funds (and regulations) were involved made no real difference because that alone did not deprive the state \"of the market participant exception to the dormant commerce clause.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1867389\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/952/1173/#p1178\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1867389\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/952/1173/#p1178\">\n    at 1180\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   It is worth noting, also, that the Medi-Cal program does not resemble a situation where a state has absolute monopoly over a resource and uses that monopoly to interfere with interstate commerce.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    W. Oil &amp; Gas Ass'n v. Cory\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1929513\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/726/1340/#p1342\">\n    726 F.2d 1340\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1342-43 (9th Cir. 1984). In\n   <em>\n    Cory\n   </em>\n   , the state was using the fact that it held title to the land underlying the ocean in order to impose what amounted to a tax on foreign and interstate commerce by those who chose to move product from sea to land and vice versa.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1929513\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/726/1340/#p1342\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1929513\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/726/1340/#p1342\">\n    at 1341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We held that the state's misuse of its monopoly could not be countenanced because it imposed an undue burden upon interstate commerce.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 1343. The Medi-Cal program gives the Department no such arbitrary power. No one is required to use or sell to the program, any more than anyone is required to participate in a private insurance plan. The Department is not autarchic; the market is.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Finally, we have not overlooked the Hospitals' argument that due to federal law\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   and their own state laws\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   they are required to render emergency services to everyone, including those who are indigent. That may include Medi-Cal beneficiaries. We fail to see how that removes the Department from the market participant category. The burdens imposed by the statutes are not imposed by the Department; they apply to everyone regardless of their wealth or insurance status, if any. That is, if a hospital desires payment by others, it must follow the policies of the entity paying them-whether that is the Department, or an insurance company, or another payor, or someone else. That alone does not serve to disqualify the Department from being a market participant along with all of the other participants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Thus, Alaska's purchase of milk for its citizens is not at all unlike the Department's purchases of medical services for its beneficiaries.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   The result, therefore, is the same-the exception remains applicable. The Department's reimbursement methodology does not violate the dormant Commerce Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The district court's resolution of the market participant issue was the foundation of its decision's whole edifice and with the demolition of that foundation, the whole edifice falls and shatters. Thus, we need not and do not opine on the questions presented by the other issues placed before\n   us in No. 16-16866 and No. 16-17080. Of course, with that determination, the attorney's fees award falls also; thus, we will not discuss the questions involved in No. 17-15550.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    REVERSED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    Those hospitals are encompassed by the entities listed in the caption of this case.
