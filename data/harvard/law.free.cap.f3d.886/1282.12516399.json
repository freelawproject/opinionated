The answer to this question will determine the outcome of this appeal, and there is no controlling precedent in the decisions of the California Supreme Court. Although we are mindful that our certification request adds to the substantial caseload of the California Supreme Court, this case raises an important question of California law which has important implications for Social Security claims, such as the one at issue here, as well as intestacy claims in California. Californians need to know how to make effective their wishes as to these supremely sensitive and important decisions. For these reasons, \"considerations of comity and federalism suggest that the court of last resort in California, rather than our court, should have the opportunity to answer the question[ ] in the first instance.\"\n   <em>\n    Mendoza v.

The couple was unable to conceive a child by natural means; the couple began fertility treatment involving in-vitro fertilization (\"IVF\") in October 1998.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On October 8, 1998, the Delzers executed a Patient Information and Informed Consent Form (\"Informed Consent Form\") consenting to \"In Vitro Fertilization and Embryo Transfer.\" The Informed Consent Form described a standard Assisted Reproductive Technology (\"ART\") procedure, explained the risks of a standard ART procedure, noted available alternatives to undergoing ART procedures, and provided that the Delzers consented to undergoing ART procedures and permitted their physician to perform \"any or as many of the procedures described above as they, in their professional judgment, believe are indicated.\" The Informed Consent Form also asked the Delzers to decide what to do with any embryos that were not immediately transferred to Ms. Delzer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   It provided that the Delzer's options included (1) cryopreservation\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   for their own future\n   use, (2) donation to another couple, or (3) disposition \"in an ethical and legal manner.\" In an addendum to the Informed Consent Form (\"Addendum\"), the Delzers indicated that they wished for the fertility care clinic to inseminate all harvested oocytes, transfer up to five embryos to Ms. Delzer, and \"cryopreserve\" (freeze) any remaining embryos \"for future transfer.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Because they elected to cryopreserve any surplus embryos, the Delzers also executed a \"Human Embryo Cryopreservation Information and Informed Consent Form (\"Cryopreservation Form\"). Like the general Informed Consent Form, it advised the Delzers of the risks\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and benefits of cryopreserving the embryos. The form explained that the Delzers were \"the owners of the frozen embryos in joint custody and must make all decisions regarding the disposition of the embryos. It also asked the Delzers to indicate what should be done with any cryopreserved embryos in the following instances:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   1. In the event of the death of both of us.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   2. One year after failure to pay storage fees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   3. If the marriage ends in divorce.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   4. If both of us fail to maintain contact with the program for a period greater than 1 year.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On the form, the Delzers stated that they were \"declaring [their] intention to continue using these embryos\" but that they requested the clinic to \"[d]iscard the embryos in a professional, moral, legal and ethical manner\" in any of the four enumerated circumstances. The form provided that the Delzers could change this decision \"by revising this consent in writing.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   About two weeks after executing these consent forms, Mr. Delzer deposited sperm at a fertility clinic to be used in the IVF procedure. Two vials of extra sperm were cryopreserved as \"back-up\" in the event the initial rounds of IVF failed. The IVF procedure produced embryos, including surplus embryos which were cryopreserved. Between October 1998 and March 1999, the couple attempted several cycles of IVF, without success.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In April 1999, Mr. Delzer was diagnosed with terminal cancer. He died on July 20, 1999, just four months later. On February 16, 2001, Mr. Delzer's cryopreserved sperm was used to fertilize eggs from Ms. Delzer. These resulting embryos, rather than any embryos which existed at the time of Mr. Delzer's death, were transferred to Ms. Delzer on February 19, 2001, and resulted in the twin pregnancy and birth of Ms. Delzer's two children, C.O.D.1 and C.O.D.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In February 2002, Ms. Delzer filed applications on behalf of C.O.D.1 and C.O.D.2 for child's insurance benefits\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   based on the wage earnings of their deceased father, Mr. Delzer. The Social Security Administration (\"Administration\") denied her claim on March 2, 2002. The Administration reconsidered her claims and again denied them on May 27, 2008.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   On July 22, 2008,\n   Ms. Delzer timely requested a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\"). On February 1, 2010, the ALJ rendered decisions in each of the Delzer children's cases. The ALJ held that the Delzer children could not satisfy \u00a7 249.5 because they failed to submit any \"paper that is signed and dated prior to the decedent's death that he consented to the use of his frozen sperm after his death.\" While the ALJ noted that the Informed Consent Form and Cryopreservation Form \"authoriz[ed] the use of the [Delzers'] frozen embryos after their death,\" he found that those forms were \"only for the continued use of the embryos[,] not the deceased's frozen sperm.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On January 19, 2012, Ms. Delzer filed an action in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California which sought review of the ALJ's decisions under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20405\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district court stayed the action pending a decision in the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Astrue v.

Cal. Feb. 15, 2012). The Supreme Court issued its decision in May 2012,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12189724\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/541/\">\n    566 U.S. 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12189724\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/541/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2021\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12189724\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/541/\">\n    182 L.Ed.2d 887\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and on July 26, 2012, the district court granted the Administration's motion to remand the action for further administrative proceedings. Dkt. 20, 12-cv-00094 (C.D. Cal. July 26, 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On remand, the ALJ held a hearing on July 24, 2013. The ALJ issued her Amended Recommended Decisions on January 9, 2014. The ALJ again found that the Delzer children did not qualify as children of Mr. Delzer under \u00a7 249.5. The claimants argued that the Informed Consent Form and Addendum satisfied \u00a7 249.5. But the ALJ again found that this writing was not sufficient because it was \"silent as to possible use ... of any extra sperm deposited by Mr. Delzer,\" and it was that sperm which was the \"genetic material\" used to conceive the Delzer children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California reopened the case on March 17, 2015, and the parties cross-moved for summary judgment. The magistrate judge issued his Report and Recommendation (\"R&amp;R\"), which affirmed the agency's denial, on October 22, 2015. Like the ALJ, the magistrate judge found that there was \"no written statement presented to the agency directly related to Mr. Delzer's sperm donation.\" On June 21, 2016, District Judge George H. Wu accepted the findings and recommendations of the magistrate judge. On August 22, 2016, Appellants timely filed their Notice of Appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    REASONS FOR CERTIFICATION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   To be entitled to child's insurance benefits under the Social Security Act, a claimant must prove that he or she is the \"child\" of the insured decedent.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20402\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1). The claimant is a \"child\" of the decedent, for purposes of the Act, if he\n   would qualify to inherit from the decedent under the intestacy laws of the state in which the deceased was domiciled at the time of his death.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20402\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 416(h)(2)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Here, there is no dispute that the Delzer children are entitled to the claimed benefits if they meet the requirements of California Probate Code \u00a7 249.5. That provision specifically addresses posthumously conceived children. It provides that, for probate purposes, \"a child of the decedent conceived and born after the death of the decedent shall be deemed to have been born in the lifetime of the decedent if the child or his or her representative proves by clear and convincing evidence that,\"\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , \"[t]he decedent, in writing, specifies that his or her genetic material shall be used for the posthumous conception of a child of the decedent\" and the \"specification [is] signed by the decedent and dated.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20249.5\">\n    Cal. Prob. Code \u00a7 249.5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because \u00a7 249.5 requires written proof of the putative \"specification,\" Mr. Delzer's intentions and desires are not relevant except as they are expressed in writing in the record. The only signed writings in the record that plausibly \"specify\" that Mr. Delzer intended for his genetic material to be used to conceive children after his death are the Informed Consent, Addendum, and Cryopreservation Forms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Appellants argue that \" Section 249.5(a) does not require that a decedent consent to a particular sample or type of genetic material-it requires only that a decedent consent to the posthumous use of his or her 'genetic material.' \" Therefore, they say, \u00a7 249.5 is satisfied as to C.O.D.1 and C.O.D.2 because Mr. Delzer \"clearly expressed\" in the Cryopreservation From \"that his wife would have the ability to use his genetic material\"-the cryopreserved embryos-\"to conceive children even after his death.\" The government answers that \"the consent forms that Mr. Delzer signed specifically addressed only the embryos that the couple had created, not his cryopreserved sperm and not 'genetic material' generally.\" The government argues that \"sperm and embryos are not the same thing,\" and therefore \"it was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   reasonable to assume that Mr. Delzer's written intentions regarding disposition of embryos created while he was alive would apply to frozen sperm that had not been used for fertilization during his lifetime.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \"As we read California law, we are uncertain whether the district court correctly or incorrectly interpreted the relevant statute[ ].\"\n   <em>\n    Mendoza v.
