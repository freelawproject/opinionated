Three federal agencies (collectively, \"federal defendants\"), joined by intervenor-defendants, challenge injunctions issued by the district court to protect the listed species. At the request of the National Wildlife Federation and the State of Oregon (collectively, \"plaintiffs\"), the district court ordered the agencies to conduct certain spill operations and fish monitoring operations at dams and related facilities in the Federal Columbia River Power System (\"FCRPS\"). The district court also directed the agencies to disclose to plaintiffs information on planned projects at certain dams in order to ensure that major expenditures do not bias the preparation of an environmental impact statement (\"EIS\") under the National Environmental Policy Act (\"NEPA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%204321\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 4347.

It flows for more than 1,200 miles from the Canadian Rockies to the Pacific Ocean, and it drains an area of approximately 258,000 square miles, including territory in seven states and one Canadian province. The Snake River is the largest tributary of the Columbia River. It flows for more than 1,000 miles from Yellowstone National Park until it meets the Columbia River in Washington, and it drains an area of approximately 108,000 square miles, including territory in six states.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Every year, salmon and steelhead (collectively, \"salmonids\") travel up and down the Columbia and Snake Rivers, hatching in fresh water, migrating downstream to the Pacific Ocean on their way to adulthood, and later returning upstream to spawn and die. The wild salmonid population has decreased significantly in recent years. Today, there are thirteen species or populations of Columbia River or Snake River salmonids that are listed as either endangered or threatened under the ESA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   When these fish migrate downstream to the Pacific Ocean, they face danger from dams in the FCRPS. The dams contain turbines that produce power from the flow of water. As the fish pass through the dams on their journey to the ocean, a high number die from swimming through the turbines. In light of this danger, each dam in the migration corridor of the mainstem Columbia and Snake Rivers has a bypass system to allow fish to avoid the turbines. At some dams, the bypass systems consist of screens in front of the turbine intakes that divert the fish into passageways through the dams and downstream. At others, the bypass systems divert the fish into barges for transportation around the dams.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The FCRPS includes eight multipurpose dams, reservoirs, and related facilities on the mainstem Columbia and Snake Rivers in Montana, Washington, Idaho, and Oregon. Three federal agencies coordinate to manage FCRPS dams: the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the \"Corps\"), the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (\"Reclamation\"), and the Bonneville Power Administration (\"Bonneville\"). The Corps operates the eight mainstem dams, Reclamation operates other FCRPS dams, and Bonneville markets and transmits power generated from the hydroelectric projects. States also play a role in dam management through the governance of water diversions from the rivers and through state conservation programs. A number of federally-recognized Indian Tribes retain treaty fishing rights in the waters of the Columbia and Snake Rivers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   This litigation, which has been ongoing since 2001, primarily concerns application of the ESA to the management of the FCRPS. Section 7 of the ESA requires federal agencies, in consultation with what is known as the \"consulting agency,\" to conserve species listed under the ESA. Section 7(a)(2) of the ESA requires each federal agency to \"insure that any action authorized, funded, or carried out by such agency ... is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification\" of a listed species' designated critical habitat.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201536\">\n    16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1536\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2). Section 7 and its implementing regulations delineate the consultation process for determining the biological impacts of a proposed action.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201536\">\n    16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1536\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) - (c) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20402\">\n    50 C.F.R. \u00a7 402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In brief, if a proposed federal action may jeopardize listed species or adversely modify critical habitat, the \"acting agency\" must consult with the \"consulting agency.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20402.13\">\n    50 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 402.13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 402.14. Here, the acting agencies are the Corps and Reclamation, and the consulting agency is the National Marine Fisheries Service (\"NMFS\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The consulting agency prepares a biological opinion (\"BiOp\") setting forth its conclusions about whether the proposed action will affect a listed species or its designated critical habitat.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201536\">\n    16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1536\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3)(A). An action jeopardizes a listed species if it \"reasonably would be expected, directly or indirectly, to reduce appreciably the likelihood of both the survival and recovery of a listed species in the wild by reducing the reproduction, numbers, or distribution of that species.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20402.02\">\n    50 C.F.R. \u00a7 402.02\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If the proposed action is likely to jeopardize a listed species' existence or adversely modify its critical habitat, the BiOp must set forth a reasonable and prudent alternative to the action (the \"Alternative\") that is not likely to jeopardize the species or adversely modify its habitat, if possible.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201536\">\n    16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1536\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   If the BiOp concludes that jeopardy is not likely and that there will not be adverse modification of critical habitat, or that the Alternative avoids jeopardy and adverse modification and that the incidental taking of endangered or threatened species will not violate section 7(a)(2), the consulting agency can issue an \"Incidental Take Statement.\" If followed, the Incidental Take Statement exempts the action agency from the prohibition on takings found in section 9 of the ESA.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201536\">\n    16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1536\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(4) ;\n   <em>\n    Aluminum Co. of Am. v.

The National Wildlife Federation (\"NWF\") challenged the 2000 BiOp, initiating this litigation. The district court ruled\n   that the BiOp was arbitrary and capricious and remanded to NMFS to issue a new BiOp.\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Wildlife Fed'n v.

NWF filed a second supplemental complaint challenging the 2004 BiOp, and it moved for a preliminary injunction. The district court granted the preliminary injunction. The injunction required the acting agencies to increase the amount of water that passed through spillgates on certain FCRPS dams during the summer of 2005, rather than passing the water through turbines for power generation. The increased spill was intended to decrease the mortality rate of fish passing through the dams. On appeal, we held that the district court had not abused its discretion in granting the injunction, but we remanded to the district court to determine whether the injunction should be more narrowly tailored.\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Wildlife Fed'n v.

As a result of additional administrative review, NMFS issued a supplemental BiOp in 2010. Those BiOps again concluded that operation of the FCRPS dams jeopardized listed species, but that a proposed Alternative would avoid jeopardy. In 2011, the district court rejected the 2008/2010 BiOp.\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Wildlife Fed'n v. Nat'l Marine Fisheries Serv.\n   </em>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    NWF IV\n   </em>\n   \"),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4151005\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/839/1117/\">\n    839 F.Supp.2d 1117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D. Or. 2011). The district court ordered NMFS to issue a new BiOp by 2014. In the interim, the court ordered the acting agencies to implement the 2008/2010 BiOp's Alternative and ordered increased spill to mitigate irreparable harm from dam operations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   NMFS issued its latest BiOp in 2014. The 2014 BiOp was a supplement to the 2008 BiOp. The 2014 BiOp again concluded that operation of the FCRPS dams would jeopardize listed species and adversely modify critical habitat. It again proposed an Alternative, consisting of a suite of 74 actions that cover a ten-year period (from 2008 to 2018). The Alternative included modifications to system operations and structures at the dams to improve fish passage and migration conditions; actions to reduce salmonid predation; actions to restore salmonid habitat; hatchery management; and research, monitoring, and evaluation of salmonids. The Alternative includes some spill in order to enhance the survival of migrating juvenile salmonids. The 2014 BiOp concluded that the Alternative would avoid jeopardy and adverse modification of critical habitat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Plaintiffs NWF and the State of Oregon filed supplemental complaints challenging the 2014 BiOp for violations of the ESA and arguing that the Corps and Reclamation had violated NEPA. In May 2016, the district court granted partial summary judgment to plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Wildlife Fed'n v. Nat'l Marine Fisheries Serv.\n   </em>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    NWF V\n   </em>\n   \"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=184%20F.%20Supp.%203d%20861\">\n    184 F.Supp.3d 861\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D. Or. 2016). The district court concluded that NMFS violated the ESA and the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\") in determining in the 2014 BiOp that the Alternative did not jeopardize listed species. It also concluded that the Corps and Reclamation violated NEPA by not preparing a proper EIS under NEPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   However, the court concluded that NMFS did not violate the ESA or APA in\n   determining that the Alternative does not adversely modify critical habitat and will not adversely affect Southern Resident Killer Whales. The court remanded to NMFS to issue a new BiOp by March 1, 2018. It stated that it retained jurisdiction over the litigation to ensure that the agencies develop mitigation measures to avoid jeopardy, issue a compliant BiOp, and prepare a compliant EIS. Federal defendants and intervenor-defendants initially appealed this order, but they have since dismissed those appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In July 2016, the district court entered a new remand order (the \"July 2016 order\"). That order approved a proposed five-year schedule for preparation of a proper EIS under NEPA. The order also extended the deadline for issuing a new BiOp to December 31, 2018. Finally, the order directed federal defendants to keep the 2014 BiOp in place and to continue to implement its Alternative until the new BiOp is issued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In January 2017, plaintiffs filed motions requesting injunctive relief for the ESA violations identified by the district court in\n   <em>\n    NWF V\n   </em>\n   . First, plaintiffs sought an injunction ordering the Corps to increase spill to the maximum level that meets, but does not exceed, existing total dissolved gas criteria allowed under state law (the \"gas cap\") from April to June at the eight mainstem FCRPS dams. The requested spill would commence in April 2017 and continue for the remainder of the BiOp remand period. The proposed injunction contained off-ramps to allow the Corps to reduce spill for reasons such as power emergencies, health and safety, or other issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Oregon also sought an injunction ordering federal defendants to operate juvenile bypass facilities and associated Passive Integrated Transponder (\"PIT\") tag detection systems at FCRPS dams beginning in March 2017. NWF sought an injunction under NEPA that would prohibit the Corps from making significant capital expenditures at certain FCRPS dams during the NEPA remand period absent court approval. Such expenditures, NWF argued, would bias the ongoing EIS process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In April 2017, the district court entered an amended order granting in part and denying in part plaintiffs' injunction motions (the \"April 2017 order\"). The district court first considered whether plaintiffs' motions were barred by Federal Rule of Procedure 60(b). The court held that, even if Rule 60(b) applied to plaintiffs' motions, it could grant the requested relief under Rule 60(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The district court granted the motions for injunctive relief under the ESA. The court held that there is no presumption of irreparable injury where there has been an ESA violation, but that the court was stripped of discretion to weigh other traditional equitable factors. The district court held that plaintiffs did not need to show that operating without the requested court-ordered spill during the two-year remand period would pose an imminent threat at the species level, nor that the Alternative's spill-related operations specifically are causing irreparable harm. Considering the evidence in the record-including findings from previous opinions and orders issued as part of this litigation-the court found irreparable harm sufficient to order increased spring spill. The court decided that implementing increased spill in spring 2017 was too rushed, and it delayed the new spill operations until April 3, 2018. It ordered the federal defendants, in collaboration with the parties and regional experts, to produce a spill plan and proposed injunction order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The district court also granted plaintiffs' PIT tag monitoring injunction, but it delayed implementation until March 1, 2018. Finally, the district court considered plaintiffs'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   NEPA capital expenditure injunction request. The court found that significant expenditures on FCRPS dams during the NEPA remand period were likely to cause irreparable harm by creating a substantial risk of bias in the NEPA process. The district court nevertheless denied plaintiffs' injunction motion, because it found that the balance of hardships and considerations of public interest favored allowing some expenditures. However, the court directed the Corps and Reclamation to disclose information to plaintiffs regarding planned expenditures at FCRPS dams. With this information, plaintiffs could file motions to enjoin projects that were not necessary for dam safety and that could substantially bias the NEPA process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Federal defendants and three intervenor-defendants timely appealed. We consolidated these appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) did not bar plaintiffs' January 2017 injunction motions, as federal defendants and intervenor-defendants contend. Defendants argue that\n   <em>\n    NWF V\n   </em>\n   was a final judgment, and thus plaintiffs' January 2017 motions for injunctive relief were subject to Rule 60(b). Defendants further contend that Rule 60(b)(6) -which the district court relied on in its April 2017 order-does not permit the motion. However, the May 2016 summary judgment and remand order was not a final judgment, and thus Rule 60(b) did not apply to the January 2017 injunction motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Rule 60(b) provides grounds for relief \"from a final judgment, order, or proceeding.\" Fed.

In that order, the district court expressly stated that it \"retains jurisdiction over this matter\" to ensure that federal defendants develop appropriate mitigation measures to avoid jeopardy, issue a new BiOp that complies with the ESA and APA, and prepare an EIS that complies with NEPA.\n   <em>\n    NWF V\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=184%20F.%20Supp.%203d%20861\">\n    184 F.Supp.3d at 950\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, federal defendants appear to have acknowledged that the May 2016 order did not preclude plaintiffs from moving for later injunctive relief. In July 2016, before the district court issued its NEPA remand order, federal defendants submitted a reply brief to the court in which they stated that plaintiffs \"are free to move the Court for [injunctive] relief if at some future point they deem it necessary.\" In light of the district court's retention of jurisdiction, the May 2016 order was not a final judgment, and Rule 60(b) did not apply to plaintiffs' January 2017 motions for injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   This conclusion is consistent with our past rulings on the finality of remand orders. A remand order is ordinarily final only for purposes of a\n   <em>\n    government\n   </em>\n   appeal under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    HonoluluTraffic.com v.

A remand order may be final for purpose of a plaintiff's appeal in cases \"when the broad relief sought could not be achieved through the action the district court directed the agency to undertake.\"\n   <em>\n    Sierra Forest Legacy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3418432\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/646/1161/#p1175\">\n    646 F.3d at 1175\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For example, an \"extremely narrow\" partial remand for a \"mechanical recalculation\" does not preclude appellate review of a plaintiff's underlying\n   claims, because the district court's opinion is \"practically final.\"\n   <em>\n    Pauly v.

The May 2016 remand order was not \"extremely narrow\" or merely for a \"mechanical recalculation.\" It granted plaintiffs most of the relief they sought. The rare circumstances in which an order remanding to an agency can be final for purposes of a plaintiff's appeal do not apply here. Thus, the May 2016 order was not a final judgment, Rule 60(b) did not apply to subsequent injunction motions, and the district court did not err in considering plaintiffs' January 2017 motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The district court did not abuse its discretion in granting the spring spill injunction. Federal defendants and intervenor-defendants argue that the framework the district court used in analyzing the request for injunctive relief was incorrect as a matter of law and that the district court's findings of fact were clearly erroneous. Intervenor-defendant Northwest RiverPartners also argues that, even if plaintiffs have established irreparable harm to listed species, they have not established irreparable harm to themselves. Finally, federal defendants and intervenor-defendants argue that the district court's injunction was an abuse of discretion because it was not narrowly tailored to the irreparable harm found. After due consideration of these arguments, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in granting the spill injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   A plaintiff seeking a permanent injunction must show:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   (1) that it has suffered an irreparable injury; (2) that remedies available at law, such as monetary damages, are inadequate to compensate for that injury; (3) that, considering the balance of hardships between the plaintiff and defendant, a remedy in equity is warranted; and (4) that the public interest would not be disserved by a permanent injunction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <em>\n    Cottonwood Envt'l Law Ctr. v.

First, federal defendants argue that\n   <em>\n    NWF V\n   </em>\n   and the April 2017 order did not find that the 74 actions constituting the Alternative are likely to jeopardize the continued existence of listed species, because the only findings concerned\n   <em>\n    recovery\n   </em>\n   of listed species. Thus, federal defendants argue, the April 2017 injunction order did not support a finding that any listed species faced a threat of extinction in the short term.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   As discussed above, the district court did not need to find an extinction-level threat to the listed species in the short term. However, even if a focus only on short-term survival were required, the district court found that the continued low abundance of the listed species made them vulnerable to extinction. The district court found in\n   <em>\n    NWF V\n   </em>\n   that NMFS had failed to analyze properly how climate change \"increases the chances of an event that would be catastrophic for the survival\" of listed species.\n   <em>\n    NWF V\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=184%20F.%20Supp.%203d%20861\">\n    184 F.Supp.3d at 874\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

According to defendants, this mismatch is evidenced by\n   <em>\n    NWF V\n   </em>\n   's holding that NMFS's determination that the Alternative is not likely to adversely modify critical habitat was not arbitrary and capricious.\n   <em>\n    NWF V\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=184%20F.%20Supp.%203d%20861\">\n    184 F.Supp.3d at 933\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Federal defendants also cite the findings from NMFS's most recent five-year review of listed species, which plaintiffs have not contested, concluding that the \"risk trends\" for the relevant listed species are all either stable or improving. In light of these findings, federal defendants assert that the district court's finding of irreparable harm is not supported by the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   However, the district court properly concluded that the listed species remain in a \"precarious\" state, and that they will remain in such a state without further conservation efforts beyond those included in the 2014 BiOp. Although the district court declined to hold that NMFS's critical habitat determination was arbitrary and capricious, it nevertheless found that critical habitat, including \"the migration corridors [of the Snake and Columbia Rivers] are degraded, are not functional, and do not serve their conservation role.\"\n   <em>\n    NWF V\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=184%20F.%20Supp.%203d%20861\">\n    184 F.Supp.3d at 930\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The same is true of federal defendants' argument about the five-year review allegations, which establish some improvement but do not negate a finding of continued low abundance and vulnerability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Federal defendants also assert that the district court's finding of irreparable harm was insufficient because its use of labels like \"precarious\" was not grounded in evidence beyond the fact that the species remain listed. However, the district court did not rely merely on the fact that the species remain listed. It relied on earlier findings that the low abundance levels of the listed species rendered them subject to sudden shocks from, e.g., climate change; and it relied on findings that highlighted specific threats to the listed species beyond the mere fact of their low abundance.

The district court acknowledged that federal defendants provided expert testimony expressing \"concerns regarding increased spill,\" but it concluded that the evidence opposing increased spill was \"not as compelling as the evidence supporting additional spill,\" and that federal defendants' concerns could be addressed by narrowly tailoring the injunction. The court's finding that \"there is sufficient scientific support for a limited injunction requiring increased spill to benefit the listed species\" is not clearly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Federal defendants argue that plaintiffs only identified vague and hypothetical survival benefits from increased spill. This is incorrect. In support of its injunction motion, Oregon presented expert declarations attesting that increased spill would improve juvenile survival and adult returns. This evidence is not of \"potential\" or \"hypothesized\" survival benefits; it includes significant evidence from decades of studies showing that spill volumes higher than those proposed in the 2014 BiOp will lead to higher survival rates for outmigrating salmonids. Federal defendants attempt to relitigate the district court's consideration of the scientific evidence for and against increased spill.

The district court's order does not run afoul of these principles. The court ordered the parties to develop a spill operation plan and gave them a year of lead time to do so. This gave the agencies ample time to conduct short-term tests to consider the effects of increased spill, to evaluate what problems might arise, and to make adjustments to the spill operation plan without having to worry about violating a court order. This does not constitute an \"unbounded\" exercise of discretion, and it does not \"intrud[e] upon the administrative province.\" The scope of injunctive relief is well within the ambit of the district court's equitable authority.

As discussed, the district court's discretion in finding irreparable harm is not so limited. The district court's analysis of irreparable harm was not legally erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Federal defendants and intervenor-defendants also argue that this injunction was not based on findings in the record. However, the district court cited expert testimony stating that \"early monitoring will provide a biological benefit by providing an alternative to turbine passage for outmigrating fish during the pre-spill period and that the early and late tails of a run are particularly important for species diversity.\" The district court also cited Washington's expert, who supported early PIT tag monitoring and stated in a declaration that \"[t]here is strong scientific evidence that the tails of salmon and steelhead runs contain a disproportionate amount of the population traits that support adaptation to environmental changes, such as the conditions witnessed in 2015.\" The court noted that the defendants \"question the volume of fish that may be migrating early,\" but it apparently did not find this evidence more persuasive than the evidence presented by the plaintiffs. The district court's findings were not clearly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   The remainder of the arguments asserted against the PIT tag monitoring injunction repeat arguments discussed above, that the district court exceeded the bounds of its discretion by not deferring to the agencies' judgment as to how to manage the dams. For the same reasons that the spill injunction was not an abuse of discretion, the PIT tag monitoring injunction was also not an abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   V\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   The district court's NEPA disclosure order is not properly before us.

Here, the district court ordered the Corps and Reclamation \"to disclose sufficient information to Plaintiffs regarding the planned projects at each dam during the NEPA remand period, at appropriate and regular intervals.\" The court noted that plaintiffs could \"file a new motion with the Court to enjoin\" a planned project if they believed that it was not needed for safe operations of the dams and would substantially bias the NEPA process. Rather than granting \"some or all of the substantive relief sought by a complaint,\" which could qualify as an injunction, the disclosure order thus \"concern[s] the conduct of the parties or their counsel\" in litigation.\n   <em>\n    In re Lorillard Tobacco Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9243910\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/370/982/#p986\">\n    370 F.3d 982\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 986-87 (9th Cir. 2004) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Int'l Prods.

The disclosure order did not substantially change the terms of the NEPA injunction, nor did it alter the legal relationship between plaintiffs and the agencies. The order only required periodic disclosures with the court so that plaintiffs would have the option of seeking later injunctive relief if necessary. This does not constitute a modification of the existing injunction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cunningham v.

The district court's disclosure order is thus not appealable under \u00a7 1292(a)(1) and is not properly before us. If plaintiffs later seek to enjoin expenditures on FCRPS dam projects and the district court grants such relief, the agencies retain the option to appeal to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   VI\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   After a careful review of the record, we affirm the judgment of the district court.
