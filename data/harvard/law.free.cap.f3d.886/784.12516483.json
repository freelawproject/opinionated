SMITH, Circuit Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In this appeal, we consider whether the virtual game platform \"Big Fish Casino\" constitutes illegal gambling under Washington law. Defendant-Appellee Churchill Downs, the game's owner and operator, has made millions of dollars off of Big Fish Casino. However, despite collecting millions in revenue, Churchill Downs, like Captain Renault in\n   <em>\n    Casablanca\n   </em>\n   , purports to be shocked-shocked!-to find that Big Fish Casino could constitute illegal gambling. We are not. We therefore reverse the district court and hold that because Big Fish Casino's virtual chips are a \"thing of value,\" Big Fish Casino constitutes illegal gambling under Washington law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Big Fish Casino is a game platform that functions as a virtual casino, within which users can play various electronic casino games, such as blackjack, poker, and slots. Users can download the Big Fish Casino app free of charge, and first-time users receive a set of free chips. They then can play the games for free using the chips that come with the app, and may purchase additional chips to extend gameplay. Users also earn more chips as a reward for winning the games. If a user runs out of chips,\n   he or she must purchase more chips to continue playing. A user can purchase more virtual chips for prices ranging from $1.99 to nearly $250.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Big Fish Casino's Terms of Use, which users must accept before playing any games, state that virtual chips have no monetary value and cannot be exchanged \"for cash or any other tangible value.\" But Big Fish Casino does contain a mechanism for transferring chips between users, which can be utilized to \"cash out\" winnings: Once a user sells her chips on a secondary \"black market\" outside Big Fish Casino, she can use the app's internal mechanism to transfer them to a purchaser. Plaintiff-Appellant Kater alleges that Churchill Downs profits from such transfers because it charges a transaction fee, priced in virtual gold, for all transfers. In other words, Kater alleges that Churchill Downs \"facilitates the process\" of players cashing out their winnings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Kater began playing Big Fish Casino in 2013, eventually buying, and then losing, over $1,000 worth of chips. In 2015, Kater brought this purported class action against Churchill Downs, alleging: (1) violations of Washington's Recovery of Money Lost at Gambling Act (RMLGA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wash.%20Rev.%20Code%20%C2%A7%204.24.070\">\n    Wash.

Rev. Code \u00a7 19.86.010\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; and (3) unjust enrichment. The district court dismissed this case with prejudice, holding that because the virtual chips are not a \"thing of value,\" Big Fish Casino is not illegal gambling for purposes of the RMLGA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Kater moved for reconsideration, but the district court denied her motion.

Big Fish Casino's Virtual Chips Are a \"Thing of Value\" Under Washington Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The parties dispute whether Big Fish Casino's virtual chips are a \"thing of value\" pursuant to Washington's definition of gambling. Pursuant to Washington law, a \"thing of value\" is:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   [A]ny money or property, any token, object or article exchangeable for money or property, or any form of credit or promise, directly or indirectly, contemplating transfer of money or property or of any interest therein, or involving extension of a service, entertainment or a privilege of playing at a game or scheme without charge.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wash.%20Rev.%20Code%20%C2%A7%209.46.0285\">\n    Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7 9.46.0285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Kater's primary argument is that the virtual chips are a \"thing of value\" because they are a \"form of credit ... involving extension of ... entertainment or a privilege of playing [Big Fish Casino] without charge.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wash.%20Rev.%20Code%20%C2%A7%209.46.0285\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   We agree. The virtual chips, as alleged in the complaint, permit a user to play the casino games inside the virtual Big Fish Casino. They are a credit that allows a user to place another wager or re-spin a slot machine. Without virtual chips, a user is unable to play Big Fish Casino's various games. Thus, if a user runs out of virtual chips and wants to continue playing Big Fish Casino, she must buy more chips to have \"the privilege of playing the game.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wash.%20Rev.%20Code%20%C2%A7%209.46.0285\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Likewise, if a user wins chips, the user wins the privilege of playing Big Fish Casino without charge. In sum, these virtual chips extend the privilege of playing Big Fish Casino.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Churchill Downs contends that the virtual chips do not extend gameplay, but only enhance it, and therefore are not things of value. This argument fails because, as alleged in the complaint, a user needs these virtual chips in order to play the various games that are included within Big Fish Casino. Churchill Downs argues that this does not matter, because users receive free chips throughout gameplay, such that extending gameplay costs them nothing. But because Churchill Downs' allegation is not included in the complaint, we do not further address this contention.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lee v. City of Los Angeles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11100379\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/250/668/#p688\">\n    250 F.3d 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 688 (9th Cir. 2001).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Notably, the only Washington court to analyze section 9.46.0285 supports our conclusion. In\n   <em>\n    Bullseye Distributing LLC v. State Gambling Commission\n   </em>\n   , the Washington Court of Appeals held that an electronic vending machine designed to emulate a video slot machine was a gambling device.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2464351\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/127/231/\">\n    127 Wash.App. 231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=110%20P.3d%201162\">\n    110 P.3d 1162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1163, 1167 (2005). To use the machine, players utilized play points that they obtained by purchase, by redeeming a once-a-day promotional voucher, or by winning a game on the machine.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=110%20P.3d%201162\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=110%20P.3d%201162\">\n    at 1163-64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In reviewing an administrative law judge's decision, the court concluded that the game's play points were \"things of value\" because \"they extend[ed] the privilege of playing the game without charge,\" even though they \"lack[ed] pecuniary value on their own.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=110%20P.3d%201162\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=110%20P.3d%201162\">\n    at 1166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because the play points were a \"thing of value,\" the machine fell within the definition of a gambling device, and therefore was subject to Gambling Commission regulation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=110%20P.3d%201162\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=110%20P.3d%201162\">\n    at 1167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Contrary to Churchill Downs' assertion, nothing in\n   <em>\n    Bullseye\n   </em>\n   conditioned the court's determination that the play points were \"thing[s] of value\" on a user's ability to redeem those points for money or merchandise. Instead,\n   <em>\n    Bullseye\n   </em>\n   's reasoning was plain-\"these points fall within the definition of 'thing of value' because they extend the privilege of playing the game without charge.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=110%20P.3d%201162\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=110%20P.3d%201162\">\n    at 1166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Based on the\n   reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Bullseye\n   </em>\n   , we conclude that Big Fish Casino's virtual chips also fall within section 9.46.0285's definition of a \"thing of value.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Churchill Downs nonetheless argues that Big Fish Casino cannot constitute illegal gambling based on the position of the Washington Gambling Commission and federal district courts that have analyzed similar games. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Churchill Downs argues that we should defer to the Gambling Commission's conclusion that Big Fish Casino is not illegal gambling. It cites to a slideshow deck used by two non-Commission members during a presentation to the Commission, and the accompanying meeting minutes,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   but these documents do not indicate that the Commission adopted a formal position on social gaming platforms, let alone Big Fish Casino specifically. It also cites to a two-page Commission pamphlet discussing online social gaming. But the pamphlet provides only \"general guidance,\" to which we do not defer because the pamphlet \"lacks an official, definitive analysis of the issue in question.\"\n   <em>\n    W. Telepage, Inc. v.

Each case Churchill Downs cites for this proposition involves the analysis of different state statutes, state definitions, and games.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mason v. Mach.

Kater Can Recover the Value of the Virtual Chips Lost Under the RMLGA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Since Big Fish Casino, as alleged in the complaint, constitutes an illegal gambling game, Kater can recover \"the value of the thing so lost\" from Churchill Downs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wash.%20Rev.%20Code%20%C2%A7%204.24.070\">\n    Wash.

Citing\n   <em>\n    Mason\n   </em>\n   , Churchill Downs argues that Kater did not lose money at gambling because there was no possibility of her winning money. In\n   <em>\n    Mason\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff could not recover money spent on virtual gold in a different game because the Maryland statute limited recovery to individuals who \"lose[ ] money at a gaming device,\" Md.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Code Crim.

As previously stated, this language encompasses the value of the virtual chips Kater purchased.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   We hold that Kater has stated a cause of action under the RMLGA.

She argues that the chips are a \"thing of value\" because users can sell them for money on the \"black market.\" However, Big Fish Casino's Terms of Use prohibit the transfer or sale of virtual chips. As a result, the sale of virtual chips for cash on a secondary market violates the Terms of Use.
