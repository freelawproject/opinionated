App. P. 34(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In 2016, a federal grand jury returned a superseding indictment charging Porter with three counts of theft concerning programs receiving federal funds, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20666\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 666\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(A), and one count of bribery concerning programs receiving federal funds, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20666\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 666\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(B). The indictment arose, in pertinent part, from Porter using his power and influence as mayor of Paintsville, Kentucky, to steer business and contracts to companies owned by his co-defendant, Eulas Crace, as well as to ensure payment of a fraudulent invoice to Crace's company. In return, Porter received payments disguised as loans. Porter made a motion for judgment of acquittal following the government's case-in-chief, which the district court denied. The jury found Porter guilty of two counts under \u00a7 666(a)(1)(A) and guilty of one count under \u00a7 666(a)(1)(B). The district court sentenced Porter to a\n   48-month term of imprisonment, and Porter timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Porter advances four arguments on appeal. First, he argues that his conviction under \u00a7 666(a)(1)(B) is unsupported by sufficient evidence. Second, he contends that the admission of a witness's prior statements to investigators violated his confrontation rights. Third, Porter argues that the admission of another witness's deposition testimony violated his confrontation rights. Finally, he contends that cumulative error requires the reversal of his convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Sufficiency of the Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Porter argues that there is insufficient evidence to support his conviction for bribery concerning programs receiving federal funds in violation of \u00a7 666(a)(1)(B). Specifically, he argues that the prosecutor failed to present evidence showing that he contemplated a quid pro quo, express or implied, \"in connection with\" any \"official act\" in his capacity as Mayor of Paintsville. \u00a7 666(a)(1)(B). Additionally, Porter contends that the government failed to present evidence demonstrating that he ever accepted \"anything of value ... intending to be influenced or rewarded in connection with any business, transaction, or series of transactions\" of the City of Paintsville.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20666\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Porter does not contest the sufficiency of the evidence with respect to his convictions under \u00a7 666(a)(1)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   When reviewing sufficiency-of-the-evidence claims, a court must determine \"whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n   <em>\n    Jackson v.

Specifically, Porter asserts that \u00a7 666(a)(1)(B) is a bribery statute in form and substance like its counterparts\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20201\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 1951 and, thus, a conviction under \u00a7 666(a)(1)(B) requires evidence of a quid pro quo \"in connection with\" any \"official act.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Porter's reliance on\n   <em>\n    McDonnell\n   </em>\n   is misplaced. In\n   <em>\n    McDonnell\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court limited the interpretation of the term \"official act\" as it appears in \u00a7 201, an entirely different statute than the one at issue here. Moreover, our precedent explicitly forecloses Porter's argument on this point. We have held that the text of \u00a7 666(a)(1)(B)\"says nothing of a quid pro quo requirement to sustain a conviction, express or otherwise: while a '\n   <em>\n    quid pro quo\n   </em>\n   of money for a specific ... act is sufficient to violate the statute,' it is 'not necessary.' \"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

We are bound by the holding in\n   <em>\n    Abbey\n   </em>\n   , as \"a later panel of the court cannot overrule the published decision of a prior panel ... in the absence of en banc review or an intervening opinion\n   <em>\n    on point\n   </em>\n   by the Supreme Court.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Accordingly, Porter's\n   <em>\n    McDonnell\n   </em>\n   -based argument is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Porter next argues that the government failed to meet its burden of production with respect to the specific-intent element of \u00a7 666(a)(1)(B). However, a review of the record reflects that Porter waived his sufficiency-of-the-evidence argument on this point. \"Although specificity in a Rule 29 motion is not required, where the defendant makes a Rule 29 motion on specific grounds, all grounds not specified in the motion are waived.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Chance\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11438789\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/306/356/#p369\">\n    306 F.3d 356\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 369 (6th Cir. 2002) ;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Here, defense counsel made the following Rule 29 motion following the government's case-in-chief:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   If I could just start off by saying that I would start with the bribery count first, and I would offer, Your Honor, that at this point in time [McDonnell] versus United States the-the United States has not offered any proof to support that there was a bribe or any agreement on the part of Robert Porter to do anything in his official capacity in this case as it relates to-and I believe that there were-bribes have to do with the three loans.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   So under the authority of [McDonnell] versus United States, I believe Count 4 needs to be dismissed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The remainder of defense counsel's Rule 29 motion pertained to the other counts contained in the indictment, which Porter does not contest on appeal. Thus, as it pertains to his indictment under \u00a7 666(a)(1)(B), Porter's Rule 29 motion was specifically limited to his\n   <em>\n    McDonnell\n   </em>\n   -based argument, and Porter has therefore waived all other sufficiency-of-the-evidence arguments. The district court therefore did not err by denying Porter's Rule 29 motion for judgment of acquittal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Admission of Witnesses' Out-of-Court Statements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Porter argues that his confrontation rights were violated when the district court permitted Detective Amos Mitch Atkins to testify about prior statements made by Chet Crace, Eulas Crace's son, to investigators during an interview on April 10, 2015. Chet Crace asserted his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination at trial. Thereafter, Detective Amos testified regarding Chet Crace's: (1) inability to explain discrepancies in two storage bills that his father's company had submitted to the City of Paintsville; (2) statements made concerning checks that had been written to Porter's wife; and (3) statement that certain billing records related to the storage invoices had been destroyed in a fire. The district court permitted Detective Amos's testimony regarding Chet Crace's various statements, determining that the testimony was not hearsay because it was offered to prove the making of the statements, whose falsity would later be shown.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   We review a district court's evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Griffin v.

The motion noted that Miller was scheduled for invasive surgery the week before she was expected to testify at trial. Counsel for the government subsequently emailed a letter from Miller's doctor to the district court and Porter's trial counsel. The letter explained that Miller was \"unable to appear in court\" due to her illnesses, which included stage IV tongue cancer, gynecologic cancer, and melanoma. The letter went on to say that Miller was \"quite ill and unable to present in court as a witness\" and that a recent surgical procedure had left Miller \"weak,\" \"unable to get out of bed,\" \"unable to travel outside of her home,\" and \"debilitated.\" The doctor further opined that it would be unsafe for Miller to try to appear in court and that her weakened condition would \"continue for an extended period of time (months to a year).\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Based on the foregoing, the government made a sufficient showing regarding Miller's unavailability to testify at trial.

Miller's doctor and counsel for the government both specifically articulated the nature and severity of Miller's health problems to the district court. Accordingly, because Porter was able to, and did, cross-examine Miller at her deposition, and because the government sufficiently demonstrated her unavailability to testify at trial, no Confrontation Clause violation occurred. The district court therefore did not abuse its discretion in admitting Miller's deposition at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Cumulative Error Doctrine\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Finally, Porter argues that the cumulative effect of the district court erroneously admitting Chet Crace's out-of-court statements and Jackie Miller's deposition testimony into evidence was so prejudicial as to warrant a new trial. \"A cumulative error claim alleges a violation of a defendant's due process right to a fair trial.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Eaton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4181999\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/784/298/#p310\">\n    784 F.3d 298\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 310 (6th Cir. 2015). \"However, cumulative-error analysis is not relevant where no individual ruling was erroneous.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Deitz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4042440\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/577/672/#p697\">\n    577 F.3d 672\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 697 (6th Cir. 2009). The district court did not err by admitting Chet Crace's statements and Jackie Miller's deposition testimony. Accordingly, cumulative error did not render Porter's trial unfair.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4042440\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/577/672/#p697\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Based on the foregoing, we\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRM\n   </strong>\n   the district court's judgment.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
