In\n   <em>\n    United States v.

We affirm. The restrictions imposed by \u00a7 538 do not apply to marijuana cultivation on federal land.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In September 2012, local authorities obtained a search warrant for a property in El Dorado County, California, based on a tip from hunters and confirmed by aerial surveillance, that marijuana was being cultivated there. On executing the warrant, officers found 118 marijuana plants on the property and detained three men-Russell Gilmore, Richard Hemsley, and John Mahan-near the grow site. Mahan told a detective that he rented the property with the intent to cultivate medical marijuana, that he hired Hemsley as a marijuana grower, and that he hired Gilmore as a security guard to protect the crop. The authorities determined from a parcel map that the marijuana garden was located on federal land, which was later confirmed by a BLM survey.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The government obtained a two-count indictment charging Gilmore, Hemsley, and Mahan with conspiracy to manufacture marijuana plants and manufacture of marijuana plants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), 846. Mahan pleaded guilty to the conspiracy count in November 2015, but Gilmore and Hemsley went to trial in April 2016. The jury failed to reach a unanimous verdict, so the district court declared a mistrial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After we decided\n   <em>\n    McIntosh\n   </em>\n   , Gilmore and Hemsley moved to enjoin the prosecution pursuant to \u00a7 538. The district court denied the motion, precipitating this interlocutory appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McIntosh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4350591\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/833/1163/#p1177\">\n    833 F.3d at 1172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Rather, as we noted in\n   <em>\n    McIntosh\n   </em>\n   , the provision applies narrowly, to those specific rules of state law that \"authorize the use, distribution, possession or cultivation of medical marijuana.\"\n   <em>\n    McIntosh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4350591\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/833/1163/#p1177\">\n    833 F.3d at 1178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nothing in California law purports to authorize the cultivation of marijuana on federal land. Even if state law tolerated marijuana cultivation on public land, federal law forbids such use.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201733\">\n    43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1733\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g). And enforcing that prohibition does not \"prevent\" California from otherwise implementing its medical marijuana regime.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McIntosh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4350591\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/833/1163/#p1177\">\n    833 F.3d at 1178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Congress could easily have drafted \u00a7 [538] to prohibit interference with laws that address medical marijuana or those that regulate medical\n   marijuana, but it did not. Instead, it chose to proscribe preventing states from implementing laws that authorize the use, distribution, possession, and cultivation of medical marijuana.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Gilmore and Hemsley argue that they substantially complied with California law, despite their inadvertent presence on federal land. Because \u00a7 538 does not apply to offenses committed on federal land, state law defenses are irrelevant. It is also irrelevant whether they knew the garden was on federal land; the government is not required to prove such knowledge to convict under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 846.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.
