Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   After a 1,900-mile journey from Venezuela to Paulsboro, New Jersey, the M/T\n   <em>\n    Athos I\n   </em>\n   , a single-hulled oil tanker, had come within 900 feet of its intended berth when it struck an abandoned anchor on the bottom of the Delaware River. The anchor pierced the\n   <em>\n    Athos I\n   </em>\n   's hull, causing approximately 264,000 gallons of crude oil to spill into the river.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The cost of cleaning up the spill was $143 million. We are presented with the question of how to apportion responsibility for that cost between three parties. The first party comprises not only the shipowner, Frescati Shipping Company, Ltd., but also the ship's manager, Tsakos Shipping &amp; Trading, S.A. (collectively, \"Frescati\"). Frescati, through an intermediary, contracted to deliver crude oil to the second party, which is made up of several affiliated companies-CITGO Asphalt Refining Company, CITGO Petroleum Corporation, and CITGO East Coast Oil Corporation (collectively, \"CARCO\"). The oil shipment was to be delivered to CARCO at its marine terminal in Paulsboro. After the oil spill, Frescati paid for the cleanup effort, and was eventually reimbursed $88 million by the third party to this litigation, the United States, pursuant to the Oil Pollution Act (OPA) of 1990,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202701\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 2701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   Frescati and the United States now seek to recover their cleanup costs from CARCO.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Facts\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The M/T\n   <em>\n    Athos I\n   </em>\n   was a single-hulled tanker ship, measuring approximately 748 feet long and 105 feet wide.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   As owner of the ship, Frescati chartered it to an intermediary which assigned it to a tanker pool.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   CARCO sub-chartered the\n   <em>\n    Athos I\n   </em>\n   from the tanker pool to deliver a shipment of crude oil from Puerto Miranda, Venezuela, to CARCO's berth in Paulsboro, New Jersey. CARCO was the shipping customer as well as the wharfinger who operated the berth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Athos I\n   </em>\n   , carrying CARCO's shipment, left Venezuela in mid-November 2004 under the command of the ship's master, Captain Iosif Markoutsis. CARCO had instructed the\n   <em>\n    Athos I\n   </em>\n   to load to a draft\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   of 37 feet or less in Venezuela, and provided a warranty that the ship would be able to safely reach the berth in Paulsboro as long as it arrived with a draft of 37 feet or less. When the\n   <em>\n    Athos I\n   </em>\n   left Venezuela, it had a draft of 36' 6?. Over the course of the\n   <em>\n    Athos I\n   </em>\n   's journey, the ship burned fuel and the crew consumed fresh water. As the ship grew lighter, it rode higher on the water. By the time it reached the entrance to the Delaware Bay, the\n   <em>\n    Athos I\n   </em>\n   was drawing 36' 4?. Because the fuel and fresh water were consumed from tanks located in the stern, or rear, of the ship, the\n   <em>\n    Athos I\n   </em>\n   was no longer sailing at an even keel; it was \"trimmed by the bow,\" meaning that the bow, or front of the ship, was deeper in the water than the ship's stern. To return the ship to an even keel, the\n   <em>\n    Athos I\n   </em>\n   took on approximately 510 metric tons of ballast to tanks in the rear of the ship. Although the parties dispute how much the\n   <em>\n    Athos I\n   </em>\n   was drawing as it approached CARCO's berth, the District Court found that the added ballast brought the ship's draft to 36' 7?.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Athos I\n   </em>\n   reached the entrance to the Delaware Bay without incident on November 26th. All vessels traveling north from the Delaware Bay to the Delaware River are required to use a Delaware River Pilot to navigate the waters. At the appropriate time, a local river pilot, Captain Howard Teal, Jr. boarded the ship and guided it up the Delaware River until it reached a section of the river near CARCO's berth. At that point, a local docking pilot, Captain Joseph Bethel, replaced Captain Teal and began to navigate the ship to its berth at Paulsboro. Captains Teal and Bethel both engaged Captain Markoutsis in conversations about the\n   <em>\n    Athos I\n   </em>\n   , its passage from the Delaware Bay to the Paulsboro berth, water depth, underkeel clearance, and other local conditions. The substance and sufficiency of those conversations are disputed by the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   CARCO's berth is on the New Jersey side of the Delaware River, directly across from Philadelphia International Airport. To reach the berth from the main river channel, ships must pass through an anchorage immediately adjacent to the berth. The anchorage, known as Federal Anchorage Number 9 or the Mantua Creek Anchorage, is a federally-designated section of the river in which ships may anchor; it is periodically surveyed for depth and dredged by the Army Corps of Engineers, as Corps resources allow. No government agency is responsible for preemptively searching for unknown obstructions to navigation in the anchorage, although the Coast Guard, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the Corps of Engineers work together to remove or mark obstructions when they are discovered. Anyone who wishes to search for obstructions in the anchorage may do so, but anyone wishing to dredge in the anchorage requires a permit from the Corps of Engineers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   It was in this anchorage on November 26, 2004, at 9:02 p.m., that the allision occurred.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   <em>\n    Athos I\n   </em>\n   was only 900 feet-not much more than the ship's length-from CARCO's berth. The ship was \"just about dead in the water\" as Captain Bethel slowly positioned it to dock. Suddenly, the ship began to list and oil appeared in the river. At the time of the allision, the ship was in the middle of a 180\u00b0 rotation, guided by tugboats, and moving astern and to port (backwards and to the ship's left). The path taken by the\n   <em>\n    Athos I\n   </em>\n   through the anchorage passed, at its shallowest point, over a 38-foot shoal. Most of the anchorage was deeper, and the depth of the river at the site of the allision was at least 41.65 feet at the time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Captain Bethel immediately called the Coast Guard to alert them to the spill, while Captain Markoutsis rushed to the engine room and transferred oil from the breached cargo tank into another tank. The crew of the\n   <em>\n    Athos I\n   </em>\n   was eventually able to stop the leak, but not before 264,321 gallons of crude oil had spilled into the Delaware River.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The cleanup effort began almost immediately. Although it was ultimately successful, it took months to complete and the efforts of thousands of workers at a cost of $143 million. The cause of the allision was not discovered until more than a month later, when an abandoned anchor was discovered on the riverbed. The search for the obstruction that caused the allision proved difficult. An experienced sonar operator using side-scan sonar conducted the first search shortly after the allision, but did not recognize the anchor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   A second search by the same operator, conducted several weeks later, eventually discovered the anchor with the use of side-scan sonar in combination with divers and magnetometers. The anchor weighed approximately nine tons and was 6' 8? long, 7' 3? wide, and 4' 6? high. It has since been removed from the river.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The parties dispute the positioning of the anchor at the time of the allision. An anchor like the one that punctured the\n   <em>\n    Athos I\n   </em>\n   has two stable positions. It can sit at rest in the \"flukes-up\" or \"flukes-down\" position. A flukes-up anchor stands almost upright on its crown, with the flukes pointed upward at a 65\u00b0 angle, while a flukes-down anchor has essentially tipped over, with both the crown and flukes of the anchor lying horizontally on the riverbed. In the flukes-up position, the anchor sticks up approximately seven feet above the riverbed, but in the flukes-down position, it rises only about 3' 5? above the riverbed. The District Court found that the anchor was flukes-up at the time of the allision, but CARCO asserts that the anchor was flukes-down, pointing to side-scan sonar data gathered as part of a geophysical study of the Delaware River that showed the anchor was flukes-down in 2001, three years before the allision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The anchor was\n   also flukes-down when it was discovered after the allision. Between 2001 and the allision in 2004, 241 vessels went to CARCO's Paulsboro berth, and many others have anchored in the anchorage over the years. The District Court theorized that one of those anchored ships could have dragged its own anchor chain along the riverbed, catching on the abandoned anchor and shifting its position. The court ultimately concluded that although the actual cause of the anchor's movement would never be known, at some point between the geophysical study in 2001 and the allision in 2004, the anchor shifted from flukes-down to flukes-up. A flukes-down anchor would not have allided with the\n   <em>\n    Athos I\n   </em>\n   if the\n   <em>\n    Athos I\n   </em>\n   's draft was less than 37 feet; a flukes-up anchor would have.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Now, more than thirteen years after the allision, the\n   <em>\n    Athos I\n   </em>\n   has been scrapped, the anchor removed from the river, and the oil spill cleaned up. What remains is this case for apportionment of cleanup costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   This case, like the\n   <em>\n    Athos I\n   </em>\n   , has been on a long journey. Over the past thirteen years, the matter has been to trial before two different judges and heard on appeal before two separate panels of this Court. We briefly summarize that history.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Litigation began shortly after the allision in January, 2005, when Frescati filed a \"Petition for Exoneration from or Limitation of Liability.\" CARCO and others filed claims for damages associated with the spill. Frescati then filed a counterclaim against CARCO for its damages. The United States eventually reimbursed Frescati for some of its cleanup expenses pursuant to the OPA, and filed suit against CARCO as a partial subrogee to some of Frescati's claims. The claims of Frescati and the United States against CARCO were consolidated with CARCO's counterclaims and defenses, forming the litigation as it exists today.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The case was first tried in a forty-one-day bench trial before the Honorable John P. Fullam. Judge Fullam found that CARCO was not liable for the casualty in contract, tort, or otherwise; Frescati and the United States appealed. On appeal, we affirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded the case because the District Court had failed to make appropriate findings of fact and conclusions of law as required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a)(1).\n   <em>\n    In re Frescati\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4048906\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/718/184/#p189\">\n    718 F.3d 184\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 189, 196-97 (3d Cir. 2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   We determined, among other things, that Frescati was a third-party beneficiary of CARCO's safe berth warranty, and that the allision occurred in the approach to CARCO's terminal, meaning that CARCO had an unspecified duty of care to Frescati in tort. We remanded for the District Court to determine whether Frescati met the conditions for the safe berth warranty to apply. We also asked the District Court, if necessary, to determine the appropriate duty of care CARCO owed Frescati and whether CARCO breached that duty.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4048906\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/718/184/#p189\">\n    718 F.3d at 214-15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Judge Fullam retired before the case was remanded. Upon its return to the District Court, the case was assigned to the Honorable Joel H. Slomsky as a successor judge pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 63. Under the terms of that rule, Judge Slomsky certified his familiarity with the record and recalled more than twenty witnesses over the course of a thirty-one-day proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The District Court held that CARCO was liable to Frescati, and the United States as Frescati's subrogee, for breach of contract. CARCO's contract included a provision known as a safe berth warranty, which, for purposes of this appeal, warrantied that CARCO's berth would be safe for the\n   <em>\n    Athos I\n   </em>\n   as long as the ship had a draft of 37 feet or less and Frescati did not cause the allision through bad navigation or negligent seamanship. The District Court concluded that CARCO breached the warranty because the\n   <em>\n    Athos I\n   </em>\n   had a draft of 36' 7? at the time of the allision, exercised good navigation and seamanship, and yet still hit an anchor within the geographic area covered by the warranty. On appeal, CARCO argues that the\n   <em>\n    Athos I\n   </em>\n   had a draft much deeper than the warrantied depth of 37 feet, and that Frescati demonstrated negligent seamanship by violating several federal maritime regulations relating to underkeel clearance and safe navigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The District Court also found CARCO liable in tort to Frescati,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   concluding that CARCO had a duty, as operator of the berth, to search for obstructions in the approach to its berth. Specifically, the District Court concluded that CARCO had a duty to use side-scan sonar to search for unknown obstructions to navigation in the approach to its berth, and to remove any such obstructions or warn invited ships-like the\n   <em>\n    Athos I\n   </em>\n   -of their presence. Because CARCO had not taken any action to search for obstructions, the District Court held CARCO liable in tort-for the same amount for which it was liable in contract. The District Court's contract and tort holdings independently support the judgment for Frescati.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   CARCO, in a motion for partial summary judgment before the District Court, asked that its liability, like Frescati's, be limited under the OPA. Because CARCO did not raise the defense until after the first trial and appeal, almost a decade into this litigation, the District Court held that the defense was waived, and in the alternative, that it failed on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The District Court did, however, partially credit CARCO's equitable recoupment defense against the United States. CARCO argued that the conduct of three federal agencies-the Coast Guard, NOAA, and the Army Corps of Engineers-misled CARCO into believing that the United States was maintaining the anchorage free of obstructions. In addition, CARCO argued that equity requires the United States to bear the cost of the cleanup rather than CARCO. The District Court ultimately reduced the United States' recovery against CARCO by 50%, rather than acceding to CARCO's request to eliminate its liability entirely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Finally, the District Court held that Frescati was entitled to prejudgment interest at the federal postjudgment rate rather than the higher U.S. prime rate requested by Frescati.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The District Court ultimately awarded Frescati $55,497,375.95\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   on the claims of\n   breach of contract and negligence, plus prejudgment interest of $16,010,773.75, for a total judgment of $71,508,149.70. The United States, after the court's 50% reduction, was awarded $43,994,578.66 on its subrogated breach of contract claim, with prejudgment interest of $4,620,159.98, for a total judgment of $48,614,738.64.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   All three parties now appeal. We will affirm the District Court's judgment in favor of Frescati on the breach of contract claim and the prejudgment interest award, as well as the District Court's denial of CARCO's motion for partial summary judgment on its limitation of liability defense. We will vacate the District Court's judgment in favor of Frescati on the negligence claim. We will affirm in part the District Court's judgment in favor of the United States with respect to CARCO's liability on the subrogated breach of contract claim, but because CARCO's equitable recoupment defense fails, we will reverse and remand for further proceedings to recalculate damages and prejudgment interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

The remaining issues, then, are whether the\n   <em>\n    Athos I\n   </em>\n   had a draft of less than 37 feet, and if it did, whether bad navigation or negligent seamanship by Frescati negated the warranty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    a. The Draft of the\n    <em>\n     Athos I\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The District Court found that the\n   <em>\n    Athos I\n   </em>\n   had a draft of 36' 7? at the time of the allision. The court based this finding on the undisputed draft of the\n   <em>\n    Athos I\n   </em>\n   at the time of its departure from Puerto Miranda-36' 6?-as well as expert testimony regarding the condition of the ship and its estimated draft at Paulsboro.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   CARCO challenges the District Court's determination of the\n   <em>\n    Athos I\n   </em>\n   's draft, arguing that the District Court improperly based its finding on a speculative assumption about the orientation of the abandoned anchor. Specifically, CARCO disputes the District Court's finding that the anchor shifted from a flukes-down position to a flukes-up position sometime between 2001 and the allision in 2004, a shift that caused the anchor to intrude within the 37-foot safe depth promised by CARCO. CARCO argues that the District Court failed to make a finding as to the precise mechanism by which the anchor shifted from flukes-down to flukes-up. The anchor's orientation matters; if the accident occurred while the anchor was flukes-down, the\n   <em>\n    Athos I\n   </em>\n   necessarily would have had a draft that exceeded the scope of CARCO's warranty.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Broadly speaking, the District Court made three findings of fact related to the anchor's orientation. First, the court and parties agree that, three years before the allision, the anchor was in the flukes-down position.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, the District Court found that at some point before the allision, the anchor shifted into the flukes-up position. Finally, after the allision, the anchor was eventually discovered back in the flukes-down position-perhaps unsurprising, given the force of its encounter with the\n   <em>\n    Athos I\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   CARCO attacks the second finding, arguing that there was insufficient evidence in the record to support the District Court's suggestion that a \"sweeping anchor chain\" could have caught the anchor and shifted it into the flukes-up position.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   We find CARCO's arguments unconvincing, primarily because the \"sweeping anchor chain\" theory, however plausible or implausible, is not necessary to sustain the District Court's finding. Let us imagine a piece of furniture (a sofa, perhaps, or an armchair) that has fallen off the back of a pickup truck onto a roadway. One driver reports seeing the furniture in the right lane. A while later, a second driver hits the furniture. The second driver asserts that the furniture was in the left lane when he struck it, and provides evidence to that effect. A highway patrolman shows up later and finds the furniture once again in the right lane. A court may find, without committing error, that the furniture was in the right lane and moved to the left without making a specific finding as to the precise method by which the furniture moved from one lane to the other. Perhaps another driver hit it; perhaps a pedestrian tried to move it out of the road but did not finish the job. When credible evidence shows that the second driver was driving in the left lane, a finding to that effect does not become error because the furniture was in the right lane when the first driver passed, or changed position after-or because of-the encounter with the second driver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Here, the record contains sufficient evidence to support the finding that the anchor was, in fact, flukes-up at the time of the allision. How exactly the anchor changed position does not impact our sufficiency determination. As an initial matter, the movement of the\n   <em>\n    Athos I\n   </em>\n   at the time of the allision and the damage to its hull are sufficient to show that the anchor was flukes-up. And substantial evidence unrelated to the anchor showed that the\n   <em>\n    Athos I\n   </em>\n   was drawing 36' 7? at the time of the allision-a draft at which the allision would not have occurred had the anchor been flukes-down. That is enough to support the District Court's finding that the anchor moved from flukes-down to flukes-up.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The movement of the ship and damage to its hull shows that the anchor must have been flukes-up. The District Court found that the\n   <em>\n    Athos I\n   </em>\n   was moving astern and to port at the time of the allision, a finding CARCO does not challenge. Based on that movement, the scoring left by the anchor on the hull, the size and shape of the two holes the anchor created, and the damage to the anchor itself also supported the District Court's finding that the anchor must have been flukes-up at the time of the allision. CARCO's own expert witness, on cross-examination, testified that if the\n   <em>\n    Athos I\n   </em>\n   were moving astern and to port, the damage to the\n   <em>\n    Athos I\n   </em>\n   's hull would necessarily require a flukes-up anchor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   JA at 1021-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Nor did the District Court base its finding of a 36' 7? draft on the flukes-up anchor alone. While CARCO argues that the anchor was flukes-down, and that therefore the\n   <em>\n    Athos I\n   </em>\n   must have had a deep draft, the reverse is also true. If the\n   <em>\n    Athos I\n   </em>\n   had a draft of 36' 7?, then the anchor must have been flukes-up. The District Court credited expert testimony that the ship had a 36' 7? draft. The ballast tanks contained no extra liquid that would have affected the ship's draft, a finding that CARCO does not challenge on appeal. The ship left Puerto Miranda with a draft of 36' 6?. Visual observation of the ship by experts and crewmembers immediately after the allision suggested the\n   <em>\n    Athos I\n   </em>\n   had a 36' 7? draft before the allision. And, on appeal, CARCO fails to offer any suggestion as to how the draft might have increased by more than a foot without the crew's knowledge or any evidence that the ballast tanks were faulty.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   We conclude there was no clear error in the District Court's determination that the\n   <em>\n    Athos I\n   </em>\n   had a draft of 36' 7? at the time of the allision. The ship was, therefore, within the scope of CARCO's safe berth warranty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Frescati's Seamanship\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   A safe berth warranty applies only in the absence of bad navigation or negligent seamanship. CARCO argues on appeal that Frescati violated several maritime regulations related to the operation of single-hulled tankers, and that those regulatory violations serve as sufficient proof of negligent seamanship. The District Court concluded that Frescati did not violate any relevant regulations, and enforced the safe berth warranty. We agree with the District Court that Frescati did not violate any relevant regulations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   On appeal, CARCO argues specifically that Frescati violated two federal regulations:\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20157.455\">\n    33 C.F.R. \u00a7 157.455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20164.11\">\n    33 C.F.R. \u00a7 164.11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

First, CARCO claims that Frescati failed to adequately plan the ship's passage. Second, CARCO claims that Frescati failed to estimate the\n   <em>\n    Athos I\n   </em>\n   's underkeel clearance. Finally, CARCO claims that Frescati failed to ensure that an adequate master-pilot exchange occurred, and made no log entry that would reflect such an exchange.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   With respect to planning the passage, CARCO argues that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20157.455\">\n    33 C.F.R. \u00a7 157.455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   requires a written voyage plan. Frescati allegedly violated that requirement by failing to finalize an official voyage plan document using the Tsakos Voyage Plan form contained in the Tsakos Vessel Operation Procedures Manual.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   JA at 1178-85.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The text of \u00a7 157.455 undermines CARCO's argument. The regulation does not itself require a\n   <em>\n    written\n   </em>\n   voyage plan. Paragraph (a) of the regulation requires that Frescati create \"written under-keel clearance guidance,\" which must contain \"factors to consider\" when evaluating draft, water depth, and weather conditions. Paragraph (b) requires that the master plan the ship's passage using those \"factors to consider\" in the guidance required by paragraph (a). Nowhere does this regulation require that the master's passage plan be in writing; the only reference to a writing in paragraph (b) comes in the requirement that some official log of the master-pilot conference be recorded. CARCO conflates the passage plan requirement of paragraph (b)-to consider certain relevant factors when planning-with the \"Voyage Plan\" form contained in Frescati's Vessel Operation Procedures Manual.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   JA at 1180. The Voyage Plan form focuses on plotting the course of the vessel from berth to berth; paragraphs (a) and (b) of the regulation, on the other hand, serve to create a reference list for the ship's master of relevant factors to consider when estimating underkeel clearance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Frescati satisfied the requirements of paragraph (a) by providing written underkeel clearance guidance in Section 3.4\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   of its Vessel Operation Procedures Manual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   JA at 1191. The Manual appropriately lists factors to consider, including \"sea state and swell,\" \"tidal conditions,\" and \"the effect of squat,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   and suggests to the master that 10% or 5% underkeel clearance margins would typically be appropriate.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20157.455\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Furthermore, Frescati satisfied the planning requirement of paragraph (b) because the\n   <em>\n    Athos I\n   </em>\n   's master, Captain Markoutsis, considered factors like the sea state, tidal condition, and the effect of squat. Even though CARCO provided a safe berth warranty for a draft up to 37 feet, Captain Markoutsis loaded the ship to only 36' 6? because he was \"afraid\" of a 37-foot draft, and eventually entered the Delaware River with a draft of 36' 7?.\n   <em>\n    In re Frescati\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4048906\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/718/184/#p189\">\n    718 F.3d at 204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The charts in the\n   <em>\n    Athos I\n   </em>\n   were marked with the 38-foot controlling draft in the anchorage. JA at 992. Captain Teal, the river pilot, testified that he and Captain Markoutsis discussed the draft, wind, visibility, and tides. We agree with the District Court that Frescati fully complied with the planning requirement of \u00a7 157.455(b) -that is, to use the factors listed in the Vessel Operating Procedures Manual when planning the passage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   CARCO's second argument is that Frescati violated \u00a7 157.455(b) because Captain Markoutsis failed to estimate the\n   <em>\n    Athos I\n   </em>\n   's underkeel clearance. The District Court did not err in finding that Captain Markoutsis had estimated underkeel clearance. Captain Markoutsis discussed the draft, tidal conditions, and anticipated underkeel clearance with Captain Teal. JA at 801-802. They estimated that the ship would have at least 1.5 meters' clearance-nearly five feet.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4048906\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/718/184/#p189\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Captains Bethel and Markoutsis also discussed the draft and believed they would have sufficient clearance. JA at 833, 837. CARCO highlights that there is no evidence of\n   <em>\n    written\n   </em>\n   underkeel clearance estimates, but \u00a7 157.455 does not require written estimates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Finally, CARCO argues that the master-pilot exchange required by \u00a7 157.455 and \u00a7 164.11 was inadequate. In general, master-pilot exchanges are intended to allow the master to share the navigational characteristics of his ship with the pilot who will be guiding it, and for the pilot to share local conditions such as weather, depth, and the tide with the master. Section 157.455(b) requires that \"[t]he tankship master and the pilot shall discuss the ship's planned transit including the anticipated under-keel clearance. An entry must be made in the tankship's official log or in other onboard documentation reflecting discussion of the ship's anticipated passage.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20157.455\">\n    33 C.F.R. \u00a7 157.455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). Section 164.11 requires that the master ensure that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   [i]f a pilot other than a member of the vessel's crew is employed, the pilot is informed of the draft, maneuvering characteristics, and peculiarities of the vessel and of any abnormal circumstances on the vessel that may affect its safe navigation. ...

The testimony shows that Captain Markoutsis did so, discussing all the relevant information with both pilots, and that he recorded the conversation on the signed Pilot Card, which served as sufficient documentation of the master-pilot conference. The District Court additionally credited Frescati's expert witness, Captain Betz, who observed both Captain Teal and Captain Bethel testify. Captain Betz opined that the master-pilot exchanges were adequate and customary in all respects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Frescati operated the\n   <em>\n    Athos I\n   </em>\n   with neither bad navigation nor negligent seamanship. Nevertheless, the allision occurred.

Wharfinger Negligence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   CARCO wore two hats in its dealings with Frescati, as a shipping customer and as a wharfinger. These dual roles exposed CARCO to liability under two independent legal theories. CARCO's first role, as a shipping customer that contracted with Frescati for delivery of a shipment of crude oil, resulted in CARCO's liability under the contractual safe berth warranty, discussed above. The second, as the wharfinger for the Paulsboro berth that was the\n   <em>\n    Athos I\n   </em>\n   's intended destination, resulted in the District Court's finding of negligence and CARCO's corresponding liability in tort.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Both theories of liability independently support the District Court's judgment against CARCO. As a result, our decision to affirm the judgment based on CARCO's contractual liability means that we are not required to delve into the District Court's tort analysis. However, having reviewed that analysis, we harbor serious doubts about the appropriateness of the court's proposed duty of care. For that reason, we are compelled to make clear that we will affirm the District Court's judgment based solely on CARCO's breach of contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   A wharfinger's duty is more limited than that of a shipping customer who has provided a safe berth warranty. As we previously wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   In the tort context, ... a wharfinger is not a guarantor of a visiting ship's safety, but is bound to use reasonable diligence in ascertaining whether the berths themselves and the approaches to them are in an ordinary condition of safety for vessels coming to and lying at the wharf. This is not an unconstrained mandate to ensure safe surroundings or warn of hazards merely in the vicinity. Instead, a visiting ship may only expect that the owner of a wharf has afforded it a safe approach. In being invited to dock at a particular port, a vessel should be able to enter, use and exit a wharfinger's dock facilities without being exposed to dangers that cannot be avoided by reasonably prudent navigation and seamanship.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <em>\n    In re Frescati\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4048906\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/718/184/#p189\">\n    718 F.3d at 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotations and citations omitted).

The court found that a general scan of the approach to CARCO's berth and the berth itself would have cost between $7,500 and $11,000, and would have prevented the allision. Yet in this very case, the targeted scan of the area where the allision occurred, conducted only eight days after the allision, did not identify the anchor. The first set of 93 side-scan sonar passes conducted by Frescati's expert, John Fish-at a cost of $38,577-identified a pump casing on the river bottom. The anchor, however, went unrecognized.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   We do not share the District Court's confidence that a general $11,000 scan of the approach and berth would have \"recognized\" the anchor with sufficient clarity to prevent the allision, given that a targeted $38,000 scan for obstructions failed to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Beyond the questionable utility of side-scan sonar as applied to this case, we doubt whether imposing a specific duty to require side-scan sonar would be useful for wharfingers in the ordinary course of their business. Single-hulled vessels like the\n   <em>\n    Athos I\n   </em>\n   present unique risks, and have been treated with special care by regulators.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20157.455\">\n    33 C.F.R. \u00a7 157.455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Today, as a result of those unique risks, such vessels are no longer permitted to operate in the waters of the United States.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   46 U.S.C. \u00a7 3703a (banning single-hulled oil tankers in the waters of the United States after January 1, 2015). Furthermore, side-scan sonar is not the only method available to detect and recognize obstructions, as the District Court pointed out.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   Even if we were to accept the court's balancing of cost, risk, and the magnitude of the potential harm, the high standard set forth in\n   this case-involving a risky single-hulled vessel-would not necessarily apply to future cases, which will necessarily involve only double-hulled vessels.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   We are not unsympathetic to the position in which we placed the District Court by asking it to specify the duty of care at play in this case. The District Court has conscientiously complied. And we stand by our previous holding that CARCO had some duty to use reasonable diligence to provide the\n   <em>\n    Athos I\n   </em>\n   with a safe approach to its berth-a duty it may or may not have breached.\n   <em>\n    In re Frescati\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4048906\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/718/184/#p189\">\n    718 F.3d at 211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Subrogation and Equitable Recoupment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   This litigation does not implicate the interests of only Frescati and CARCO. The United States reimbursed Frescati for $88 million in cleanup expenses above the liability limit established by the OPA. Consequently, the United States became subrogated to Frescati's claims, and joined the fray by filing suit against CARCO in 2008.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Frescati initially paid for the oil spill cleanup costs as a \"responsible party\" under the OPA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202702\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 2702\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

Under this scheme, Frescati's liability for the cost of the oil spill cleanup was limited to approximately\n   $45 million. The Trust Fund reimbursed Frescati for its remaining cleanup costs, which totaled approximately $88 million. The United States then became statutorily \"subrogated to all rights, claims, and causes of action that the claimant [Frescati] has under any other law.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202715\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 2715\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

Because CARCO was liable to Frescati in contract, it was also liable to the United States for the amount the Trust Fund had reimbursed Frescati: nearly $88 million. But CARCO asserted a defense against the United States it did not assert against Frescati-equitable recoupment-and in response, the District Court reduced the United States' judgment by 50%. Both CARCO and the United States appealed. CARCO argues that the District Court erred by not eliminating the United States' recovery, while the United States argues that the District Court should have left the contract judgment untouched and denied CARCO any equitable remedy. We conclude that the District Court erred by reducing the United States' judgment by 50%. The United States is entitled to a full recovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Subrogation and Subrogee-Specific Defenses\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   As an initial matter, we note that the dispute between CARCO and the United States presents an unusual question about the nature of subrogation. Subrogation itself is not unusual; in general terms, it \"simply means substitution of one person for another; that is, one person is allowed to stand in the shoes of another and assert that person's rights against a third party.\"\n   <em>\n    US Airways v. McCutchen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697067\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/88/\">\n    569 U.S. 88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 97 n.5,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697067\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/88/\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1537\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697067\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/88/\">\n    185 L.Ed.2d 654\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013). Most often, it arises in the insurance context as a procedural mechanism to allow an insurer (the subrogee) to step into the shoes of its insured (the subrogor) after it has compensated the insured for harm caused by a third party. The subrogee, having stepped into the shoes of the subrogor, is entitled to assert all of the subrogor's rights and claims against the responsible third party. Likewise, the third party-now defending an action brought by the subrogee-is entitled to assert every defense it otherwise could have raised against the subrogor. In that vein, the third party's liability to a subrogee cannot be greater than it would have been to the subrogor. Restatement (Third) of Restitution &amp; Unjust Enrichment \u00a7 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   All that is unexceptional. The unusual question presented here is whether a third party may assert a defense against a subrogee that it could\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   assert against the subrogor. As we discussed above, CARCO is liable to Frescati, the subrogor, in contract. Consequently, CARCO is liable to the United States, the subrogee, under that very same contract. But CARCO wishes to assert a defense against the United States-namely, that equitable recoupment requires the United States to bear the loss rather than CARCO because of the allegedly misleading conduct of three federal agencies-that it could not assert against Frescati.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   The United States makes a related argument. Its position is that the equitable recoupment defense, predicated as it is on the conduct of federal agencies rather than the contractual relationship between Frescati and the United States, violates the\n   statutory subrogation provision of the OPA. Specifically, the United States argues that it is entitled to \"all [of Frescati's] rights, claims, and causes of action\" under the OPA.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202715\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 2715\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Frescati's contractual right is not limited by CARCO's claims against the Coast Guard, NOAA, and the Army Corps of Engineers; the United States asserting Frescati's contractual right should also not be so limited, and to do otherwise would infringe on the United States' statutory entitlement. When Frescati has the right to a full recovery under its contract, the argument goes, so does the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   We agree. CARCO may only assert defenses against the United States' subrogated claims which it could have asserted against Frescati-including any equitable recoupment defense it could have asserted against Frescati. In its capacity as a subrogee, the United States should be subject to the same treatment as Frescati. Just as the United States, as subrogee, may only assert Frescati's claims, CARCO, as defendant, is not entitled to extra defenses because the United States asserts Frescati's claims rather than Frescati itself. Of course, no party is exempt from the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The United States is subject to the ordinary procedural rules governing counterclaims and third-party complaints, and the OPA does not bar CARCO from asserting whatever claims it has against the United States using those recognized procedural mechanisms where appropriate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   In this case, the only claim asserted by the United States is Frescati's contract claim.\n   <em>\n    In re Frescati\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4048906\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/718/184/#p189\">\n    718 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   189 ; JA at 390. It follows that CARCO's equitable recoupment defense must be directed toward the United States' contract claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4048906\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/718/184/#p189\">\n    718 F.3d at 214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (declining to preclude CARCO from raising \"equitable defense[s] to the Government's subrogation claims\"). If CARCO had other cognizable claims against the three federal agencies involved in regulating the Delaware River and the anchorage, sounding in tort or otherwise, it was free to assert them in a third-party complaint or counterclaim, just as the United States was free to pursue other claims against CARCO.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   In that light, we proceed to analyze CARCO's equitable recoupment\n   defense as it applies to the United States' contractual rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Equitable Recoupment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Equitable recoupment is a \"principle that diminishes a party's right to recover a debt to the extent that the party holds money or property of the debtor to which the party has no right.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    In re Frescati\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4048906\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/718/184/#p189\">\n    718 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   214 n.35. For an equitable recoupment defense to succeed, the defendant must possess a claim against the plaintiff arising from the same transaction or occurrence as the plaintiff's suit, seeking relief of the same kind as that sought by the plaintiff, in an amount no greater than that sought by the plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Livera v. First Nat'l State Bank of New Jersey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10539156\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/879/1186/#p1195\">\n    879 F.2d 1186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1195 (3d Cir. 1989).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   CARCO's equitable recoupment defense faces at least two serious obstacles. As an initial matter, the United States questions whether CARCO possesses a \"claim\" against it, rather than a generalized request for the court to balance the equities. Second, the United States questions whether CARCO seeks relief of the same kind as the United States. On both points, CARCO fails to meet its burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   CARCO's claim, such as it is, appears to be that the equities favor CARCO, and require the United States to bear the cost of the spill. CARCO argues that the United States, through the Coast Guard, NOAA, and the Army Corps of Engineers, had responsibility for maintaining the anchorage where the allision occurred free of obstructions. In the alternative, if the agencies were not responsible to preemptively search for obstructions, CARCO argues they should have more explicitly made clear that they were not conducting such searches. CARCO asserts that it reasonably believed, based on the agencies' conduct, that the agencies were maintaining the anchorage free of obstructions. Additionally, CARCO argues that equity requires the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund to bear the cost of the cleanup rather than CARCO.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Equitable recoupment requires more than just a request to balance the equities. CARCO points out that although equitable recoupment most often arises in the context of offsetting monetary claims, as in tax or bankruptcy cases, it is not necessarily limited to those situations.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Oneida Indian Nation of New York v.New York\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9437841\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/194/104/#p136\">\n    194 F.Supp.2d 104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 136-37 (N.D.N.Y. 2002) (allowing an equitable recoupment defense in the context of offsetting requests for declaratory judgments in a land rights case). But CARCO still must assert some cognizable claim, rather than simply a request for the Court to reduce the United States' damages in the interest of equity. Here, CARCO has failed to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Neither does CARCO seek the same kind of relief as the United States. The United States seeks contractual relief, to which it is entitled by operation of statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202715\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 2715\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . CARCO, by contrast, seeks equitable relief, or (on another reading) essentially tort-based relief grounded in misrepresentation by the agencies. The mismatched relief sought by CARCO and the United States does not support CARCO's equitable recoupment defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   The requirement that a defendant seek the same kind of relief as has been sought in the plaintiff's claim is a fundamental requisite for recoupment. The defense is not intended to be a catch-all to allow any claims otherwise barred by time, settlement, or statute to be heard as equity seems to require. Equitable recoupment is intended to allow only truly similar claims arising from the same transaction to offset one another in the interest of equity between the parties. As noted, equitable recoupment is well-suited for disputes in which two claims arise out of the same taxable event or the same contractual obligation, as often seen in tax or bankruptcy cases. When, as here, the plaintiff seeks relief on a contract, the defendant may not resort to equitable recoupment as a means to assert a non-contractual claim, whether sounding in an equitable-balancing analysis, in tort, or otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   CARCO has failed to meet its burden of establishing an equitable recoupment defense. It is liable to the United States in full.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   <strong>\n    VII. Limitation of Liability under the Oil Pollution Act\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   CARCO argues that a provision of the OPA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202702\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 2702\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(2)(B), limits its liability in this case to the same extent to which Frescati's liability was limited-approximately $45 million. Because CARCO did not raise this defense with the requisite clarity until nearly ten years after this litigation began, the District Court concluded that CARCO waived it. We agree that the defense was waived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   A District Court's holding that an affirmative defense has been waived is reviewed for abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Cetel v.

Waiver is appropriate if the party raising the defense did not do so at a \"pragmatically sufficient time\" and if the opposing party would be prejudiced if the defense were allowed.\n   <em>\n    Charpentier v.

CARCO argues that it first raised the limitation defense in its 2005 answer to Frescati's Amended Counterclaim by referring to the OPA. The District Court concluded that CARCO's answer contained nothing that would have put Frescati or the United States on notice that CARCO planned to rely on a limitation of liability defense. In general, \"[a]n affirmative defense ... 'need not be articulated with any rigorous degree of specificity, and is sufficiently raised for purposes of [ Fed. R. Civ.

Nevertheless, the party asserting the defense must actually do so, and in a way that gives fair notice of that defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   CARCO relies on the averment listed as its \"Seventh Separate Defense,\" which reads simply: \"The claims and causes of action set forth in the plaintiffs' Amended Counterclaim are barred in whole or in part by the provisions of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202701\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 2701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , et seq.\" JA at 355. Noticeably absent from this general averment is any specific citation to the limitation of liability defense or even a description of the nature of the defense. This is significant, because the OPA includes a number of potential affirmative defenses.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202702\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 2702\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) (limiting scope of damages for which the OPA imposes liability); \u00a7 2702(c) (excluding certain oil spills from OPA liability); \u00a7 2702(d)(1)(A) (shifting liability under the OPA to a solely responsible third party); \u00a7 2702(d)(2) (limiting the liability of certain parties under the OPA); \u00a7 2703 (\"Defenses to liability\"). CARCO's general reference to the entirety of the OPA did not provide adequate information from which Frescati could determine that CARCO was seeking to limit its liability under \u00a7 2702(d)(2)(B). Nor did CARCO develop this defense at any point before the first trial. For that reason, CARCO's unspecified reference to the OPA did not provide the requisite fair notice to Frescati.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Furthermore, Frescati would be prejudiced if the defense were allowed.

As to agency regulation and maintenance of the anchorage where the allision occurred, the District Court held that the agencies did not have a duty to maintain the anchorage free of obstructions. The United States does not preemptively search for obstructions in the anchorage, it is not responsible for doing so, and it did not tell CARCO that it would do so. To the extent CARCO believed otherwise, CARCO simply misunderstood the regulatory structure and the responsibilities (and indeed, the capabilities) of the agencies.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-192\">\n    Additionally, to the extent-if at all-that the Coast Guard, NOAA, and the Army Corps of Engineers were responsible for the\n    <em>\n     Athos I\n    </em>\n    oil spill, reducing the recovery of the United States in this case would not be equitable. Beyond our concerns relating to subrogation (equity would certainly not favor reducing Frescati's recovery under these circumstances), such a decision would impose liability on the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund, not the responsible agencies. Any recovery based on the United States' subrogated claim flows back to the Trust Fund, out of which the United States originally reimbursed Frescati.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209509\">\n     26 U.S.C. \u00a7 9509\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b)(3). The Trust Fund is not intended (or allowed by statute) to be used as a slush fund to cover the liabilities of federal agencies.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202712\">\n     33 U.S.C. \u00a7 2712\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"Uses of the Fund\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-193\">\n    As a final point, the purpose of the Trust Fund is not to absorb the cost of cleaning up oil spills; indeed, almost the opposite is true. The OPA creates a strict liability regime for responsible parties, while capping that liability at a set amount. But the Trust Fund was not designed to bear those costs indefinitely; the subrogation provision of\n    <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202715\">\n     33 U.S.C. \u00a7 2715\n    </extracted-citation>\n    allows the United States, on behalf of the Trust Fund, to pursue any claim a responsible party could have brought against a third party under any law, in order to recover the money paid out by the Trust Fund and preserve the Trust Fund's ability to respond quickly to spills in the future. The OPA is intended to quickly compensate victims of spills, minimize environmental damage, and internalize the costs of oil spills within the oil industry. The subrogation provision serves those purposes by letting cleanup costs fall upon the liable party, rather than with the Trust Fund.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"29\">\n   <p id=\"p-194\">\n    Allowing CARCO to assert the defense after failing to raise it at a practicable time wastes the District Court's resources as well.\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-195\">\n    Affirmative defenses must be raised as early as practicable, not only to avoid prejudice, but also to promote judicial economy. If a party has a successful affirmative defense, raising that defense as early as possible, and permitting a court to rule on it, may terminate the proceedings at that point without wasting precious legal and judicial resources.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-196\">\n    <em>\n     Robinson v.
