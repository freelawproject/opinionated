STRANCH, J. (pg. 591), delivered a separate concurring opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   In September 2015, police executed a warrant at Derek Tagg's residence, searching for child pornography. They found plenty of it-over 20,000 files, all stored on Tagg's computer. The search warrant was based primarily on digital evidence from an FBI operation showing that Tagg had spent over five hours browsing a website (\"Playpen\") that obviously contained child pornography. The district court found that the police lacked probable cause to search Tagg's house because the search warrant did not state that Tagg actually viewed any illegal images while on the site. Further, the court held that no reasonable officer would have relied on the warrant, and therefore suppressed all the evidence seized from Tagg's home. Because the warrant was supported by probable cause, we\n   <strong>\n    REVERSE\n   </strong>\n   the order granting the motion to suppress and\n   <strong>\n    REMAND\n   </strong>\n   the case for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This case arises out of federal and state investigations into child exploitation on the \"dark web.\" The \"dark web\" is a sophisticated, anonymous internet network used both by criminals and by other individuals who, for whatever reason, do not want to be identified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Until it was shut down by the FBI, Playpen operated a secret website on the \"dark web.\" Although we think of websites as \"out there\" in the ether, the physical location of an ordinary website is on a computer programmed to permit access by anyone connected to the internet. Typical internet users access websites by searching for subjects through search engines (e.g., Google) in widely available web browsers (e.g., Mozilla Firefox), just like the ordinary shopper can walk into a store and look for signs indicating the location of the goods they desire. Clandestine websites like Playpen, however, sometimes require\n   a \"mask\" before you can enter the computer(s) housing them. In this case, that \"mask\" is a web browser called \"Tor,\" which hides your online \"face\" from other people on the internet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Your online \"face\" is known as an \"IP address,\" a unique number assigned to every computer connected to the internet. To hide your identity, Tor effectively masks your IP address so that the people operating the website's physical computers cannot trace your IP address back to your personal identity or your residence. Because this makes it difficult for anonymous websites to track customer preferences or allow users to interact with one another, websites like Playpen require you to create an identifying \"pseudonym\" when you enter the website. Thus, Playpen knows what each user likes and what it has looked at, but it cannot discern who the user is outside the confines of the website.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Further, Tor can also hide a website from all search engines entirely. In other words, a website operating on the Tor network can require you to know the\n   <em>\n    exact\n   </em>\n   combination of letters and numbers comprising the website's URL\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   before permitting you to see its content. And unlike intuitive URLs like\n   <em>\n    cnn.com\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    nytimes.com\n   </em>\n   , the URL of a secret Tor website like Playpen is randomized-for example,\n   <em>\n    upf45jv3bziuctml.onion\n   </em>\n   . Absent some statistically impossible stroke of luck, a site like Playpen is \"an island that cannot be found, except by those who already know where it is.\" To access such a website, a newcomer must generally befriend someone who knows the URL, usually the website owner or another frequent user.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   But just like in real life, nothing on the internet can be kept totally secret. Police or malicious website owners have discovered ways to work around Tor's \"mask\" and identify the people who visit a website. This is done by embedding software in the fabric of the website, which creates a digital \"fingerprint\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   identifying each user's IP address. Police can then link the \"fingerprint\" to the user's \"pseudonym,\" and track what the person has viewed on the website. Police can also use a computer's IP address to discern its physical location through publicly available databases and\n   routine subpoenas to companies like AT&amp;T and Comcast. Thus, armed with the user's digital fingerprint, police can show a judge (a) what a user has viewed, and (b) where the user's computer is located in the real world.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    B\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   This case began when the FBI obtained access to the physical computer running Playpen's website. The warrant permitting the FBI to use a bug is the \"NIT warrant\" in the record here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Tagg does not really dispute that Playpen contained a significant amount of child pornography; neither does the government deny that Playpen also contained legal child erotica. After seizing Playpen's computers, the FBI kept the website running to try and catch some of its patrons. However, to identify Playpen's users, the FBI had to place a digital bug in the fabric of the website. Because this act counts as a Fourth Amendment \"search\" of the user's home computer-the bug creates a digital fingerprint that can identify the user-the FBI needed to obtain a warrant before embedding it.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Horton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276073\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/863/1041/#p1046\">\n    863 F.3d 1041\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1046-47 (8th Cir. 2017),\n   <em>\n    cert. pet. filed in\n   </em>\n   No. 17-6910 (Nov. 21, 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After collecting identifying data on the individual users of the website, the FBI and its local task-force affiliates sought separate, individual warrants for the homes of the identified users (\"Residential Warrants\"). To support these warrants, officers explained to federal magistrate judges how they cross-referenced the user's digital fingerprint with their pseudonym and IP address to connect three data points: (a) the user's identity, (b) the items the user had viewed on the website, and (c) the physical location and address of the user's computer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The affidavit supporting the Residential Warrant outlined Tagg's browsing history, which neither party disputes. The Residential Warrant therefore contained the following pieces of data. (1). Tagg spent around five hours logged into Playpen's website under the pseudonym \"derpderk.\" (2). Tagg opened the website's \"index\" and browsed them for topics of interest to him. (3). He clicked on the \"Pre-Teen Videos\" entry in the index. That link took him to a separate part of the index where he could browse \"Pre-teen Videos\" in more detail. (4). After browsing that topic, Tagg viewed a collection of pages under the heading \"Girls HC\"-which, in the pornography world, means explicit, penetrative sexual acts. (5). Tagg then accessed the message board \"video collection clow85.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (6). On other occasions, Tagg accessed pages titled, \"Drug(g)ed sleeping girl 10yo fuck-\", \"girl Toy3-8y&amp;man\", and \"PTHC\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   Anal dildo.\" The affidavit did not, however, state whether Tagg actually viewed or downloaded any illegal files.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The magistrate judge approved the Residential Warrant. The warrant indicated\n   that officers had established probable cause that Tagg violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(5) (access of a website with intent to view child pornography) and that evidence of the crime would be found at Tagg's residence. After searching Tagg's home, police found over 20,000 files of child pornography on his personal computers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    C\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Tagg was charged with one count of receiving child pornography and one count of possessing the same. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(2), (a)(5)(B). Tagg moved to suppress all the evidence seized by the government, claiming that both the NIT Warrant and his individual Residential Warrant violated the Fourth Amendment. As noted above, the district court only addressed the Residential Warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   After a hearing, the district court held that the Residential Warrant was invalid. Specifically, the court held that police could not establish probable cause to search Tagg's home for child pornography unless the supporting materials established that he actually clicked on or viewed an online file containing child pornography. Moreover, the court suppressed the evidence, reasoning that the good-faith exception did not apply because police acted recklessly and because no reasonable officer could have relied on the warrant. After its motion for reconsideration was denied, the government timely appealed.

That statute punishes any person who \"knowingly accesses with intent to view, any ... computer disk, or any other material that contains an image of child pornography.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(5)(B). It is elementary that an applicant for a search warrant need not allege facts establishing that a crime occurred.\n   <em>\n    Wesby\n   </em>\n   makes that perfectly clear.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12615996\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/577/#p584\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 586\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Instead, the magistrate must ask whether the facts in the affidavit justified an officer of reasonable caution in suspecting that Tagg had accessed Playpen with the intent to view child pornography, and that evidence of that crime would be found on his home computer. That standard is unquestionably met here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    1\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Tagg admits that he accessed the website. And the warrant application contained plenty of facts suggesting that he intended to view child pornography when he did so. First and foremost, it is unlikely that Tagg stumbled upon Playpen by accident. To access the site, he had to obtain the URL from someone \"on the inside\" who could provide the exact sequence of numbers and letters to enter into his browser. This creates an inference that Tagg deliberately accessed Playpen. Second, Tagg spent over five hours on the site, clicking on over 160 hyperlinks that were blatant advertisements for child pornography.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , R. 29-1, Residential Warrant, PID 445, 451-52;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 446 (\"Pre-teen Videos,\" \"Girls [Hard-Core]\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 452 (\"Drug(g)ed sleeping girl 10yo fuck-\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   (\"Girl Toy3-8y&amp;man\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   (\"[Pre-Teen Hard-Core] Anal dildo\"). Indeed, when viewed alongside the other facts in the affidavit, such conduct makes it even more likely that Tagg intended to view child pornography when he accessed Playpen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Further, the applicable criminal statute does not require a showing that Tagg actually viewed illegal content on the site. The access-with-intent offense is complete the moment that the elements of access and intent coincide. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(5)(B). Thus, even if the person never viewed illegal child pornography, knowingly accessing a child-pornography website with the intent to view illegal materials is itself a criminal act. It follows from this language that probable cause to search Tagg's house would exist even if he was \"curiosity shopping\" for child porn on\n   Playpen but never actually viewed an illegal image.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This is the most natural reading of the statute. Congress unambiguously set out to punish anyone who \"knowingly possesses,\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   knowingly accesses with intent to view, any ... computer disk ... or other material ... that contains an image of child pornography.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). Grammatically, the word \"accesses\" (the\n   <em>\n    actus reus\n   </em>\n   of the crime) is directed towards the repository containing child pornography, not the child pornography itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The person who completes the circle and views the image has, instead, committed the\n   <em>\n    actus reus\n   </em>\n   of possession.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

We agree with the Second Circuit that Congress intended the \"possessing\"\n   <em>\n    actus reus\n   </em>\n   to apply to someone who \"intentionally searched for images of child pornography, found them, and knowingly accepted them onto his computer,\" even if that acceptance was merely temporary.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3902348\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/685/120/#p130\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3902348\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/685/120/#p130\">\n    at 132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Indeed, the government conceded at oral argument that-in the absence of proof that a person actually viewed or possessed any child pornography-it may be difficult to prove intent beyond a reasonable doubt at trial. This is as it should be. Child pornography receives no protection from the First Amendment, but the Supreme Court has made it clear that a strict\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   is a key factor in policing overbreadth and ensuring that \"unwitting\" users are not punished for protected speech.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

But in the probable-cause context, we are content that on the facts of this case, a reasonable officer could infer that Tagg formed the required intent at some point during the five hours he spent browsing Playpen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Tagg insists that the affidavit \"did not offer facts to show [he] acted with specific 'intent to access' \" child pornography. This, again, conflates probable cause with proof; the affidavit need not \"show\" that Tagg had unlawful intent-it only needed to allege facts that create a reasonable probability that Tagg had an unlawful motive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wesby\n   </em>\n   , 138 S.Ct. at 586 (stating that probable cause does not require \"an actual showing\" of illegal conduct) (internal quotation marks omitted). Tagg tries to weaken this inference by pointing out that the site also distributed legal child erotica. He seizes on this fact to argue that he intended to view child erotica, not illegal child pornography, and therefore that the warrant could not establish probable cause. The Supreme Court disagrees.\n   <em>\n    Wesby\n   </em>\n   makes clear that the ultimate plausibility of an innocent explanation cannot be used to snuff out the objectively suspicious inference that can be drawn from the facts presented to a magistrate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 588. Tagg may or may not be guilty of a crime, and we reiterate that this would be a different case if the government sought to sustain a conviction based solely on the statements in this affidavit. But police need not \"rule out a suspect's innocent explanation for suspicious facts\" in order to establish probable cause, and Tagg may not litigate the issue of guilt or innocence on a motion to suppress.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In sum, the plain language of the statute penalizes anyone who knowingly accesses a website that contains child pornography\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   who intends to view that illegal content,\n   even if he never actually does so. It follows that a warrant may issue against someone like Tagg when law enforcement shows that the suspect (a) accessed a website containing actual child pornography, and (b) browsed the site for an extended period of time while clicking on links that were blatant advertisements for child pornography.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    3\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Tagg also challenges the nexus element of the search. He insists that the mere fact that he used a computer to commit a crime does not automatically justify a search of his residence. This, of course, is correct.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Peffer v.

He misapprehends the helpfulness of these cases, however, as they actually support the government's position. In fact, the Second Circuit extended our decision in\n   <em>\n    Frechette\n   </em>\n   to an unpaid registration for a pornographic website, reasoning that the mere act of signing up for a \"members-only\" child-pornography site was enough to establish probable cause to search the defendant's home.\n   <em>\n    Raymonda\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4074104\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/780/105/\">\n    780 F.3d at 115-16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (discussing\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In\n   <em>\n    Falso\n   </em>\n   , the warrant merely alleged that the defendant tried (possibly unsuccessfully) to access a website containing child pornography.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3842262\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/544/110/\">\n    544 F.3d at 121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The\n   <em>\n    Falso\n   </em>\n   panel held that probable cause could not exist under those circumstances unless the warrant contained \"specific allegations\" that the defendant actually viewed child pornography.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3842262\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/544/110/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In contrast, Tagg was a registered member of Playpen and successfully accessed the site for over five hours.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Thus, the Second Circuit's cases are even less favorable to Tagg than our own. Indeed,\n   <em>\n    Raymonda\n   </em>\n   endorsed a legal conclusion not yet present in our case law-that \"\n   <em>\n    the fact of membership\n   </em>\n   to a child-pornography website,\" paid or unpaid, creates probable cause to search the member's home computer.\n   <em>\n    Raymonda\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4074104\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/780/105/\">\n    780 F.3d at 116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Falso\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3842262\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/544/110/\">\n    544 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   121 ) (emphasis added by the\n   <em>\n    Raymonda\n   </em>\n   panel). Tagg was a member of Playpen in the sense that\n   <em>\n    Martin\n   </em>\n   used that word.\n   <em>\n    Raymonda\n   </em>\n   also emphasized that this fact was crucial in distinguishing between\n   <em>\n    Martin\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Falso\n   </em>\n   , since the\n   <em>\n    Falso\n   </em>\n   defendant had not subscribed to a members-only website.\n   <em>\n    Raymonda\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4074104\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/780/105/\">\n    780 F.3d at 115-16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <em>\n    Raymonda\n   </em>\n   's facts are also distinguishable. The warrant in\n   <em>\n    Raymonda\n   </em>\n   only alleged that on one afternoon, nine months ago, the defendant opened one or two pages of a website containing child-pornography files.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4074104\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/780/105/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4074104\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/780/105/\">\n    at 116-17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Second Circuit was simply not persuaded that this was sufficient to support probable cause for a residential search. In contrast, Tagg accessed Playpen for five hours over thirty days and viewed hundreds of pages containing child-pornography files. The facts here-critical in probable-cause determinations-simply do not compare.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Finally, Tagg stretches the Tenth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Edwards\n   </em>\n   to mean more than what it says. In\n   <em>\n    Edwards\n   </em>\n   , the affidavit only alleged that the defendant possessed and shared child erotica, not child pornography.\n   <em>\n    Edwards\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4089241\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/813/953/\">\n    813 F.3d at 960-61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Importantly, the warrant in that case never alleged that the suspect possessed, searched for, browsed, or made any effort to engage with actual child pornography.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4089241\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/813/953/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4089241\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/813/953/\">\n    at 962-63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In rejecting the government's arguments, the Tenth Circuit held that mere interest in child erotica or sexual attraction to children was insufficient, standing alone, to cause an officer of reasonable caution to suspect someone of a crime.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4089241\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/813/953/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4089241\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/813/953/\">\n    at 964-65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   We have rejected similar attempts by the government to use evidence of child molestation to support warrants for child pornography.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

However, the logic of\n   <em>\n    Edwards\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Hodson\n   </em>\n   does not apply to defendants, like Tagg, who interact with the child-pornography components of a website.

Although we have no cause to apply\n   <em>\n    Ramos\n   </em>\n   , I otherwise agree that the constellation of facts contained in the affidavit call for reversing the district court's suppression decision.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    \"URL\" stands for \"uniform resource locator,\" a combination of letters and numbers that comprise the digital \"address\" of a website.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    The technical details of how the FBI accomplishes this are mostly unimportant for the purposes of this appeal. Anytime you click on a website's content (e.g., a link, an image, a page), the website's host computer transmits data to your computer, allowing you to view the content that you requested. Ordinarily, this act is harmless, since most website owners are careful to give the user\n    <em>\n     only\n    </em>\n    what they requested. However, hackers and criminals sometimes embed secret \"viruses\" or \"malware\" in website content. If a user clicks on website content containing these nefarious programs, they are transmitted to the user's computer along with the requested content. Viruses can be programmed to do a broad range of things, from simply shutting down the user's machine to stealing information.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    What the FBI did here is obtain authorization to place a \"benevolent virus\" on the target website, which installs itself on the user's machine when he or she clicks on any website content. The virus, instead of wreaking havoc, obediently transmits only the information permitted by the warrant. In this case, the warrant only permitted the virus to transmit (a) information identifying the physical location of the user's machine, and (b) information distinguishing the user's machine from other computers at the same physical address. When a website is operating on the Tor network, this appears to be the only practical way for law enforcement to identify a website's users and gather necessary evidence.\n    <em>\n     See generally\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v.
