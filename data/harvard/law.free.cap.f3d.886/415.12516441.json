Thus, the district court reasoned that although Appellant received a sentence of six to eight months for the 1996 Conviction, \"his offense was punishable by imprisonment for more than a year\" because it was a Class I felony, which carries a maximum sentence of 15 months.

Section 2255(e) provides a means for petitioners to apply for a traditional writ of habeas corpus pursuant to \u00a7 2241. It states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   An application for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a prisoner who is authorized to apply for relief by motion pursuant to this section, shall not be entertained if it appears that the applicant has failed to apply for relief, by motion, to the court which sentenced him, or that such court has denied him relief,\n   <em>\n    unless it also appears that the remedy by motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e) (emphasis supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Appellant raises two main arguments as to why he is entitled to a merits determination of the \u00a7 2241 Petition. First, he contends the savings clause is not jurisdictional and therefore, because the Government argued in the district court that Appellant satisfied the savings clause, it has waived any such challenge and precluded the courts from considering the issue. Second, Appellant argues that he can satisfy the requirements of the savings clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    The Jurisdictional Argument\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On the jurisdictional argument, we first address the Government's shifting position in this case. In the district court, the Government took the position that Appellant met the savings clause requirements and was entitled to relief.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Gov't's Resp. to Pet'r's Mot. to Vacate, Correct, or Set Aside Sentence,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Wheeler\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:11-cv-603 (W.D.N.C. filed Nov. 29, 2013), ECF No. 14 at 1-2 (\"[T]he Government agrees that [Appellant] is entitled to relief under the savings clause and \u00a7 2241 and recommends that this Court resentence him.\"). Indeed, the Government argued that \"when a defendant was sentenced to an enhanced mandatory-minimum sentence based on a conviction that qualified under pre-\n   <em>\n    Simmons\n   </em>\n   decisional law, and\n   <em>\n    Simmons\n   </em>\n   was decided after the time for direct review and an initial collateral attack,\" and when a prisoner demonstrates that a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion is not available, \"th[e] procedural requirement [of the savings clause] is met.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 7-8. Further, it contended, \"Imposing a mandatory-minimum sentence based on the defendant's prior conviction,\n   when that conviction is legally ineligible to justify the mandatory term, is a fundamental error.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    at 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But now, on appeal, the Government has done an about-face, arguing that Appellant fails to satisfy the requirements of the savings clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   A party is not permitted to waive subject matter jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brickwood Contractors, Inc. v.

Therefore, our first task is to determine whether the requirements of the savings clause are jurisdictional. In\n   <em>\n    Rice v.

Appellant classifies this decision as a \"drive-by jurisdictional ruling\" with no precedential effect, and argues that the savings clause is not actually jurisdictional.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Appellant's Br. 2 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Arbaugh v.

Therefore, he contends, the Government is able to waive the savings clause requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Even assuming\n   <em>\n    Rice\n   </em>\n   lacks precedential effect, we hold that the savings clause is a jurisdictional provision.

In contrast, the Eleventh Circuit has held that \u00a7 2255(e)\"speaks in imperative terms regarding a district court's power to entertain a particular kind of claim\" and is therefore jurisdictional in nature.\n   <em>\n    Williams v.

First, \"there is a clear expression of congressional intent.\"\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3558837\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/713/1332/#p1340\">\n    713 F.3d at 1338\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Thus it \"commands the district court not to entertain a \u00a7 2241 petition that raises a claim ordinarily cognizable in the petitioner's first \u00a7 2255 motion except in ... exceptional circumstance[s].\"\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3558837\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/713/1332/#p1340\">\n    713 F.3d at 1338\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted). Indeed, a \"plain reading of the phrase 'shall not entertain' \" demonstrates that \"Congress intended to, and unambiguously did strip the district court of the power to act ... unless the savings clause applies.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 1339.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Second, the language at issue parallels language the Supreme Court has deemed jurisdictional. In\n   <em>\n    Miller-El\n   </em>\n   , the Court focused on the phrase \"unless [a COA is issued] an appeal may not be taken.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9191097\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/537/322/#p336\">\n    537 U.S. at 336\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9191097\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/537/322/#p336\">\n    123 S.Ct. 1029\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It held that this phrase \"mandates\" that until a COA has been issued, the courts of appeals \"lack jurisdiction to rule on the merits of [habeas] appeals.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Like this language, which strips a court of power to entertain an appeal unless a prerequisite is met, the savings clause language also strips the sentencing court of power to entertain a habeas corpus petition unless a prerequisite-i.e., a determination that a \u00a7 2255 motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of one's detention-is met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Third, the language is unlike the provisions the Supreme Court has labeled nonjurisdictional. In\n   <em>\n    Thaler\n   </em>\n   , the Court addressed the requirements for a COA: it may be issued upon \"a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\" and must indicate \"which specific issue or issues satisfy\" that showing.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186041,12445442\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/134/\">\n    565 U.S. at 143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186041,12445442\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/134/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 641\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting \u00a7 2253(c)(2), (c)(3) ). These provisions do not address the appellate court's power to entertain an appeal, but rather, list the criteria a proper COA should possess. Thus, the language of \u00a7 2253(c)(2) and (c)(3)\"does not ... refer in any way to the jurisdiction of the appeals courts,\" as \"[a] defective COA is not equivalent to the lack of any COA.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The savings clause is different-it does not concern criteria for a successful \u00a7 2241 petition; rather, it provides whether that petition may be entertained to begin with. Moreover, the provision at issue does not fit neatly with the other nonjurisdictional provisions. Unlike\n   <em>\n    Hamer\n   </em>\n   , this case involves a statute and not a rule; unlike\n   <em>\n    Kwai Fun Wong\n   </em>\n   , the savings clause does not provide a time limitation; and unlike\n   <em>\n    Arbaugh\n   </em>\n   , it is not an element of a claim for relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Finally, we find\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   to be unpersuasive.\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   reasoned that jurisdiction to resolve \u00a7 2255 claims derives from another statute, which gives district courts exclusive jurisdiction \"of all offenses against the laws of the United States.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203231\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1550615\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/425/386/#p388\">\n    425 F.3d at 388\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Thus, like the Seventh Circuit, the Sixth Circuit also recognizes the fundamental significance of a proper sentencing range. We agree with our sister circuits' view-and the view of Chief Judge Gregory's dissent in\n   <em>\n    Surratt\n   </em>\n   -that a sentencing error need not result in a sentence that exceeds statutory limits in order to be a fundamental defect.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   For all of these reasons, we hold that Appellant also meets the third requirement of the savings clause-that his sentence now presents an error sufficiently grave to be deemed a fundamental defect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <em>\n    The Government's Position in this Case\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Finally, we address the Government's reliance on the Eleventh Circuit's recent decision in\n   <em>\n    McCarthan v. Director of Goodwill Industries-Suncoast, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277796\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/851/1076/\">\n    851 F.3d 1076\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (11th Cir. 2017) (en banc). In\n   <em>\n    McCarthan\n   </em>\n   , a divided en banc court concluded that a petitioner could not proceed through the savings clause portal where controlling circuit precedent, overturned by a Supreme Court case, changed in such a way that one of the petitioner's prior convictions no longer qualified him for a sentencing enhancement under the Armed Career Criminal Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 1080. The Eleventh Circuit rejected its longstanding five part test similar to the one we established in\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   , and instead analyzed each term of the text of the savings clause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 1085-90. Ultimately, the court set a high bar for \"test[ing] the legality\" of one's conviction, explaining that McCarthan could have \"presented his claim and won relief in the Supreme Court\" but chose not to do so.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 1087. It also reasoned that \"[a]dverse circuit precedent\" does not\n   make the filing of a first \u00a7 2255 motion \"inadequate or ineffective.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The Government's reliance on\n   <em>\n    McCarthan\n   </em>\n   is inapt because the\n   <em>\n    McCarthan\n   </em>\n   court explicitly rejected a test similar to the\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   test, which the circuit had used for years. Only then could it proceed to analyze the full text of the savings clause anew, unrestrained by such a test. Here, however,\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   remains good law, a point the Government concedes in its brief-despite spending over 20 pages arguing why it was wrongly decided. And notably, though the Government claims it changed positions in this case because of the\n   <em>\n    McCarthan\n   </em>\n   decision, which \"offer[s] a far more extensive textual analysis than any prior circuit decision,\" Gov't's Br. 30, it fails to acknowledge that the 2011 Tenth Circuit opinion in\n   <em>\n    Prost v. Anderson\n   </em>\n   , written by then-Judge Gorsuch, provides a textual analysis just as thorough, if not more so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4102206\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/636/578/\">\n    636 F.3d 578\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (10th Cir. 2011). It is curious then that the Government chose now-literally in the middle of Appellant's case-to completely change course. It appears the timing of\n   <em>\n    McCarthan\n   </em>\n   was nothing more than a convenient escape hatch.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   In sum, we hold that \u00a7 2255 is an inadequate and ineffective means to test the legality of Appellant's detention, which is based on a sentence issued with an erroneously increased mandatory minimum.
