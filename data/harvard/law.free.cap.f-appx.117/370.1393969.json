However, given the colloquy at sentencing between the district court and defense counsel, the record does not support Meraz-Amado\u2019s contention that the district court misunderstood its discretion to impose consecutive or concurrent sentences. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>250 F.3d 923, 925-29 (5th Cir.2001). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b399-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
