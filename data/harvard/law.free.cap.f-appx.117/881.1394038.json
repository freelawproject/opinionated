The order is not appealable unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that her constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Redditt has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny her motion for a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We also deny Redditt\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel, motion to withdraw her Fairfax County <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>court appointed attorney, motion to show cause for the warrant, and motions for trial transcripts at the government\u2019s expense. We deny as moot the motion to resume consideration of the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
