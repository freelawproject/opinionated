Liu contends first that the IJ violated his right to due process because he rejected Liu\u2019s past persecution claim without making any reference to the medical report of Qing Yeh, M.D. We find this claim to be without merit because the record reveals that the IJ in fact considered the report and Liu, in any event, cannot show prejudice from the alleged oversight. <em>See Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 324 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-23\">Next, Liu asserts that the IJ erred in relying on the 2001 State Department Country Report. We find that we are without jurisdiction to consider this claim because Liu failed to raise it before the Board and thus did not properly exhaust admimstrative remedies. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d) (2000); <em>Asika v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 264, 267 n. 3 (4th Cir.2004), <em>petition </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number><em>for cert. filed, </em>73 U.S.L.W. 3135 (U.S. Aug. 23, 2004) (No. 04-256).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">We accordingly deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
