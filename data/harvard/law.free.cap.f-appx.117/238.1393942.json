In its decision, the Board found that Bangura had not established a well-founded fear of persecution based upon his political beliefs and opinions if he returned to Sierra Leone. To obtain reversal of this decision, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Bangura has not shown that the evidence compels a different result. Bangura thus cannot also meet the higher standard for withholding of removal. <em>See INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-11\">We also reject Bangura\u2019s claim that the Board\u2019s summary affirmance procedure violates his right to due process because the Board did not give detailed consideration of his claim. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(a)(7)(2004). We have previously held that the summary affirmance procedure comports with due process and after reviewing the record, we find nothing in Bangura\u2019s case that suggests his claim was not handled with the required consideration. <em>See Blanco de Belbruno v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 272, 281-83 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-12\">Because we find that substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s denials and Bangura\u2019s right to due process was not violated by the summary affirmance procedure, the petition for review is</p>\n<p id=\"b267-13\">\n<em>DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
