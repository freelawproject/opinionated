Elbashlli argues that the BIA erred in determining that she had not established entitlement to asylum and withholding of removal under both the INA and the CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">This court will uphold the factual findings that an alien is not eligible for asylum or withholding of removal if those findings are supported by substantial evidence. <em>Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78-79 (5th Cir. 1994). The substantial evidence standard requires that the decision be based on the evidence presented and that the decision be substantially reasonable. <em>Carbajal-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>78 F.3d 194, 197 (5th Cir.1996). The BIA\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence, and the record does not compel a contrary conclusion as to either Elbashlli\u2019s INA claims or her CAT claim. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, Elbashlli\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b403-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
