His sole issue on appeal is that there was insufficient evidence to support the district court\u2019s finding that he possessed marijuana with the intent to distribute it. We do not find that the district court abused its discretion by finding that Gillis violated his supervised release in this manner. <em>United States v. Copley, </em>978 F.2d 829, 831 (4th Cir.1992). This court does not review credibility determinations on appeal. <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 863 (4th Cir.1996). Accordingly, we affirm Gillis\u2019 conviction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
