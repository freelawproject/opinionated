He argues that in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), the sentence enhancements he was assessed for obstruction of justice and having an aggravating role were unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-21\">Beltran\u2019s argument is foreclosed by this court\u2019s opinion in <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>377 F.3d 464, 473 (5th Cir.2004), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1003, - L.Ed.2d -, 2005 WL 124197 (U.S. July 14, 2004)(No. 04-5263), in which we held that <em>Blakely </em>does not apply to the federal sentencing guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-25\">Beltran alternatively contests his sentence, arguing that the district court erred by enhancing his sentence based on his having an aggravating role in the offense. We review the district court\u2019s factual determination that Beltran played an aggravating role for clear error. <em>See United States v. Turner, </em>319 F.3d 716, 724 (5th Cir.), <em>ant denied, </em>538 U.S. 1017, 123 S.Ct. 1939, 155 L.Ed.2d 857 (2003). The uncontroverted information provided in the PSR and the testimony adduced at the sentencing hearing confirm that the district court did not clearly err in assessing Beltran an aggravating role in the offense. <em>See id. </em>at 724-25. Given this conclusion, we further hold that there was no error, plain or otherwise, in Beltran\u2019s not receiving the minor-role adjustment. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, comment. (n.3(A)); <em>United States v. Guerrero, </em>5 F.3d 868, 870 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>Beltran also contends that the district court erred in assessing him a two-level adjustment for obstruction of justice. We review the district court\u2019s factual finding of obstruction of justice under the dear-error standard. <em>See United States v. Odiodio, </em>244 F.3d 398, 404 (5th Cir.2001). Beltran\u2019s own testimony at the sentencing hearing established that he remained in Mexico to avoid judicial process in this country. The district court did not clearly err in determining that the adjustment for obstruction of justice assessment was warranted. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, comment. (n.4(e)); <em>Odiodio, </em>244 F.3d at 404.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-4\">Finally, Beltran argues that the district court erred by concluding that he was not eligible for application of the safety-valve provision of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2. As Beltran was an organizer/Ieader in the offense, he did not meet the requirements for application of the safety valve. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 501.2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-5\">Beltran\u2019s conviction and sentence are, in all respects,</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1009-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
