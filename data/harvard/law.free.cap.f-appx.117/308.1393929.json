Forpa does not qualify for relief because the IJ made a negative credibility determination that is amply supported by the record and is entitled to deference. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4) (2000); <em>see Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004); <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 323 (4th Cir.2002). We conclude, however, that the record does not support the conclusion that Forpa knowingly filed a frivolous application. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(d)(6) (2000); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.20 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-10\">Accordingly, although we deny the petition for review, we vacate the Board\u2019s decision insofar as it finds Forpa\u2019s application frivolous. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-11\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED; VACATED IN PART</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
