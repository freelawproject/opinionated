White argues that the transcript of the trial held in state court shows that the defendants\u2019 averments that he was arrested for state-law violations before he was searched are lies. He also argues that the district court erred in dismissing his complaint without considering his response to the summary-judgment motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-19\">The defendants\u2019 affidavits averred that White had been stopped and arrested for traffic violations before the search incident to the arrest revealed the cocaine. The affidavits submitted by the defendants met their burden as the moving party of establishing that there was no genuine issue of material fact. <em>See Whren v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 806, 810, 116 S.Ct. 1769, 135 L.Ed.2d 89 (1996); <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 324, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986); <em>Gustafson v. Florida, </em>414 U.S. 260, 266, 94 S.Ct. 488, 38 L.Ed.2d 456 (1973); <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>120 F.3d 564, 573 (5th Cir.1997). White\u2019s response to the summary-judgment motion did not create a genuine issue of material fact precluding summary judgment because he did not dispute that the defendants had pulled him over for a valid traffic stop, nor did it dispute the fact that the defendants had probable cause to arrest him for the traffic violations. <em>See Little v. Liquid Air Corp., </em>37 F.3d 1069, 1075 (5th Cir.1994) (en banc). Therefore, the district court was correct in granting the summary judgment motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-20\">Although in granting the summary-judgment motion, the district court initially overlooked White\u2019s response, after White\u2019s motion for relief from judgment, the district court considered White\u2019s response and appropriately concluded that White had not carried his burden to defeat the summary-judgment motion. The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b941-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited, circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
