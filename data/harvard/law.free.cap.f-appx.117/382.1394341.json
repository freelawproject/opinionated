Merrill has asserted that he has attempted to comply with the court\u2019s orders to pay the fee but officials at the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) where he is imprisoned have not complied with his requests for a withdrawal from his inmate trust account. Merrill has also filed a motion for a restraining order and protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>Although the district court dismissed Merrill\u2019s suit without prejudice, he is effectively barred from refiling one of his personal injury claims because of the two-year statute of limitations. <em>See Long v. Simmons, </em>77 F.3d 878, 879-80 (5th Cir.1996)(statute of limitations can cause a dismissal without prejudice to operate as a dismissal with prejudice); <em>Owens v. Okure, </em>488 U.S. 235, 249-50, 109 S.Ct. 573, 102 L.Ed.2d 594 (1989) (the general provision injury statute of limitations for the forum state is used for 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claims); Tex. Civ. Prac. <em>&amp; </em>Rem.Code Ann. \u00a7 16.003(a) (West 1998)(two-year injury limitations period in Texas). It does not appear from the face of the record that Merrill\u2019s failure to pay the filing fee resulted from \u201cdelay or contumacious conduct.\u201d <em>See Colle v. Brazos County, Tex., </em>981 F.2d 237, 243 (5th Cir.1993). It is therefore ORDERED that the judgment of the district court dismissing Merrill\u2019s complaint be VACATED and that the case be REMANDED for further proceedings. Merrill\u2019s motion for a restraining order and protection is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">VACATED AND REMANDED; MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b410-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
