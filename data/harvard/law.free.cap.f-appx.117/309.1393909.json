Allsbrook appeals the district court\u2019s order denying relief on his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2000) complaint. We issued a decision on August 18, 2004, affirming the district court\u2019s order in part, but also vacating in part, and remanding for further consideration. <em>Allsbrook v. Terrangi </em>105 Fed.Appx. 520 (4th Cir.2004) (unpublished). The Appellees then petitioned for rehearing, which we have granted by separate order. We now affirm the district court\u2019s order in all respects. As to Allsbrook\u2019s claim he received inadequate medical care, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying relief. As to Allsbrook\u2019s claim that the prison drug rehabilitation program was unconstitutional under the First Amendment because it required participants to recite a creed, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying relief. As to Allsbrook\u2019s assertion that the prison drug rehabilitation program was unconstitutional under the First Amendment because it required him to watch a video recommending participation in a Christian or religious fellowship group, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of this claim for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. While the record reveals that on November 8, 2002, Allsbrook filed an informal complaint regarding this claim, Allsbrook provided the district court no documentation proving that he pursued a formal grievance or his available appeals. We note that, because the district court dismissed this claim without prejudice, Allsbrook may yet be able to provide the requisite proof to pursue this claim. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process. Allsbrook\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
