Deckard argues that the district court erroneously denied his motion to suppress evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-16\">In reviewing the denial of a motion to suppress evidence obtained pursuant to a search warrant, we determine: (1) whether the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule applies; and (2) if not, whether probable cause supported the warrant. <em>United States v. Cavazos, </em>288 F.3d 706, 709 (5th Cir.2002). Deckard argues that the good-faith exception does not apply because the affidavit on which the search warrant was based was so lacking in indicia of probable cause that no reasonable officer could rely on the warrant in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-17\">The warrant affidavit indicated that the police had learned from two confidential informants that Deckard was a substantial cocaine supplier and that one of the informants had delivered cocaine to Deckard\u2019s residence within the previous two years. The affidavit also indicated that the police had been investigating Deckard for six months, and stated that within hours before applying for the warrant, the officers personally examined abandoned trash placed at the curb of Deckard\u2019s residence and discovered materials used in the packaging of narcotics. In addition, a field test for cocaine residue proved positive, and the police had discovered correspondence, bills, and a prescription bottle in the names of Deckard and his girlfriend, thereby linking the trash to Deckard. Deckard\u2019s challenge to the warrant affidavit is without merit, and the district court did not err in denying the suppression motion. <em>See United States v. Satterwhite, </em>980 F.2d 317, 321 (5th Cir.1992); <em>United States v. Raborn, </em>872 F.2d 589, 596 (5th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>Cir.1989); <em>United States v. May, </em>819 F.2d 531, 536 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b379-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
