Johnson, </em>No. 03-7128 (4th Cir. Nov. 4, 2003) (unpublished). <em>See United States v. Aramony, </em>166 F.3d 655, 661 (4th Cir.1999) (discussing doctrine and exceptions thereto); <em>see also S. Atl. Ltd. P\u2019ship of Tenn. v. Riese, </em>356 F.3d 576, 583 (4th Cir.2004) (discussing mandate rule). Accordingly, we affirm this portion of the district court\u2019s order on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-12\">Turning to the district court\u2019s denial of Johnson\u2019s motion to recuse, we have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. <em>See Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 555, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994); <em>United States v. DeTemple, </em>162 F.3d 279, 286 (4th Cir.1998). Accordingly, we affirm this portion of the order for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>No. CR-01-167, 2001 WL 1414393 (E.D.N.C. filed June 30, 2004 <em>&amp; </em>entered July 2, 2004). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-15\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b923-13\"> In his informal brief filed in this court, Johnson appeals the district court\u2019s order denying his objections as moot. <em>See Smith v. Barry, </em>502 U.S. 244, 245, 112 S.Ct. 678, 116 L.Ed.2d 678 (1992) (holding that document filed within appeal period and containing information required by Fed. R.App. P. 3(c) is functional equivalent of notice of appeal). However, Johnson fails to challenge the ground on which the district court relied to deny the objections and has therefore waived appellate review. 4th Cir. R. 34(b) (\u201cThis Court will limit its review to the issues raised in the informal brief.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
