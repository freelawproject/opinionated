Rubio\u2019s underlying request for cancellation of removal was denied because it was determined that he had not established five years of lawful, continuous, physical presence in the United States. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">\u201cThe BIA\u2019s factual findings are reviewed for substantial evidence; rulings of law, <em>de novo, </em>deferring to the BIA\u2019s interpretation of the immigration statutes.\u201d <em>MirelesValdez v. Ashcroft, </em>349 F.3d 213, 215 (5th Cir.2003) (internal citation omitted). Denial of a motion to reopen in an immigration proceeding is reviewed only for abuse of discretion. <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">\u201cCongress explicitly granted federal courts the power to review \u2018final order[s] of removal\u2019 in [8 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1252(a)(1), and \u2018implicit in this jurisdictional grant is the authority to review orders denying motions to reopen any such final order\u2019.\u201d As<em>saad v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 471, 474 (5th Cir.2004) (quoting <em>Patel v. United States Attorney General, </em>334 F.3d 1259, 1261 (11th Cir.2003)). However, \u201cwhere a final order of removal is shielded from judicial review by a provision in [8 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1252(a)(2), so, too, is [the BIA\u2019s] refusal to reopen that order\u201d. <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations omitted). Because the denial of Ru-bio\u2019s cancellation of removal request was based on a determination that he was not statutorily eligible for that relief, we would have jurisdiction to review that determination if it were currently before us. <em>Mireles-Valdez, </em>349 F.3d at 216-17 (interpreting \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)). Given that fact, we have jurisdiction to review the denial of Rubio\u2019s motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-15\">Rubio\u2019s motion to reopen was based on his assertion that he received ineffective assistance of counsel during his removal proceedings. Rubio contended that, absent counsel\u2019s poor performance, he would have been found statutorily eligible for cancellation of removal and would have been granted that relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-16\">Based on our review of the record, there was substantial evidence to support the BIA\u2019s finding that Rubio did not enter this country until after 1 January 1982 and, therefore, was not properly admitted for lawful residency. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255a(2). Accordingly, Rubio did not meet the statutory requirements for cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a). Because Rubio has not shown that his former counsel\u2019s actions denied him a fair hearing or due process, his ineffective assistance of counsel claim fails. <em>See Matter of Lozada, </em>19 I <em>&amp; </em>N Dec. 637, 638 (BIA 1988). Therefore, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-17\">\n<em>DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b407-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
