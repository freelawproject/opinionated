We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Marshall has not made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>(2000). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b297-17\"> We decline to consider the issues Marshall has raised for the first time in his informal brief that were not first presented to the district court. With regard to Marshall\u2019s claim pursuant to the recent Supreme Court case of <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>- U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), even if properly before this court for consideration, <em>Blakely </em>would offer Marshall no relief because, <em>inter alia, </em>the Supreme Court has not made its ruling in <em>Blakely </em>retroactive to cases on collateral review. <em>See In re Dean, </em>375 F.3d 1287, 1290 (11th Cir.2004); <em>see also United States v. Sanders, </em>247 F.3d 139, 151 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>(4th Cir.2001) (holding that the rule announced in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), the precursor to <em>Blakely, </em>is not retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
