He argues that the district court erred in imposing a 12-point enhancement, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B), based on the determination that his prior felony conviction under California Health and Safety Code \u00a7 11352(a) was a \u201cdrug-trafficking offense\u201d within the meaning of the guideline. Varela contends that the statute of conviction is overly broad, criminalizing behavior such as simple possession, and cannot support the enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B). To the extent that Varela seeks reversal of his sentence based on a categorical rejection of a \u00a7 11352(a) offense as a \u201cdrug-trafficking offense\u201d for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B), his argument is without merit. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez-Duberney, </em>326 F.3d 613, 617 (5th Cir.), cert. <em>denied, </em>540 U.S. 903, 124 S.Ct. 259, 157 L.Ed.2d 187 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>Because Varela did not object in the district court to the legal sufficiency of the PSR to sustain the enhancement, review as to this issue is for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Calverley, </em>37 F.3d 160, 162-64 (5th Cir.1994) <em>(en </em>banc). Even if the district court erred in relying on the legally inadequate PSR to sustain the enhancement, Varela cannot show that the error affected his substantial rights so as to establish plain error because the uncontested record evidence demonstrates that his prior conviction was for selling cocaine; the record lacks any evidence that he merely possessed cocaine. <em>Cf. United States v. Martinez-Cortez, </em>988 F.2d 1408, 1416 &amp; n. 37 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">Varela additionally contends, also for the first time on appeal, that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) are unconstitutional in the light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). He concedes that his argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 239-47, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), but he seeks to preserve it for possible Supreme Court review.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-8\"><em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>AlmendarezTorres. See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348; <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000). Inasmuch as Varela argues that <em>Blakely </em>invalidates the Sentencing Guidelines, his argument is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Pineiro, </em>377 F.3d 464, 465-66 (5th Cir. 2004), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(July 14, 2004) (No. 04-5263).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-9\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b988-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
