Southwest Airlines Company (\u201cSouthwest\u201d) has moved to strike her appellate brief and to dismiss the appeal. Fields has in turn moved for permission to file an out of time reply to Southwest\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-22\">This court may authorize Fields to proceed IFP on appeal if she is unable to pay the costs of the appeal and the appeal is taken in good faith, <em>ie., </em>the appeal presents nonfrivolous issues. Fed. R.App. P. 24(a)(1); <em>see Holmes v. Hardy, </em>852 F.2d 151, 153 (5th Cir.1988). Fields has failed to demonstrate that her appeal would involve nonfrivolous issues. Her motion for IFP is therefore denied and her appeal dismissed. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2.
