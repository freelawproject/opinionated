Boboy also seeks the appointment of counsel. As Boboy has since obtained private counsel, his motion is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-24\">In rejecting Boboy\u2019s appeal, the BIA adopted the Immigration Judge\u2019s (IJ) findings that Boboy lacked credibility. We hold that the IJ\u2019s credibility findings were reasonable and supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 79 (5th Cir.1994). Accordingly, Boboy\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b409-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
