Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-14\">Byrd and Jones each challenge, as their sole claim on appeal, the district court\u2019s interrogation of witnesses at trial. A district court\u2019s participation in the interrogation of a witness pursuant to Fed. R.Evid. 614 is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Parodi, </em>703 F.2d 768 (4th Cir.1983). Assuming that this claim was preserved by Appellants, we find no abuse of discretion. A district court may call witnesses, interrogate them, or cross-examine them. Fed.R,Evid. 614(a), (b). Indeed, the court has an obligation to do so \u201cfor the ascertainment of the truth\u201d or to \u201cavoid needless consumption of time.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 611(a). The district court became involved in the interrogation of the witnesses at issue only after the witnesses\u2019 evasive answers and a series of frivolous objections by defense counsel had halted the progress of the proceedings. Under these circumstances we find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-16\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgments of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-17\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
