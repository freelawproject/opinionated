Because Collins properly preserved these objections in the district court, we review the denial of his motion to acquit <em>de novo </em>and consider whether \u201ca rational trier of fact could have found that the evidence established the essential elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In the instant case, testimony established that the firearm was manufactured in Switzerland and possessed in Texas. We have \u201crepeatedly held that evidence that a firearm has traveled interstate at some point in the past is sufficient to support a conviction under \u00a7 922(g), even if the defendant possessed the firearm entirely intrastate.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Therefore, Collins\u2019s arguments are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-17\">Collins also argues that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) is unconstitutional as applied. However, we have rejected such arguments and concluded that the \u201cconstitutionality of \u00a7 922(g) is not open to question.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This argument is also without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b354-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
