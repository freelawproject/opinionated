Ibrahim is the primary applicant for asylum; the claims of his wife and children are derivative of his application. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1158(b)(3) (West 1999 &amp; Supp. 2004); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.21(a) (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-25\">In his petition for review, Ibrahim disputes the immigration judge\u2019s finding that he was firmly resettled in the United Arab Emirates. We have reviewed the administrative record and find no error in the immigration judge\u2019s conclusion that Ibrahim was firmly resettled and is thus ineligible for asylum. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(2)(A)(vi) (2000); <em>Mussie v. INS, </em>172 F.3d 329, 331-32 (4th Cir.1999). Ibrahim also takes issue with the immigration judge\u2019s finding that his claims lacked credibility and contends that he suffered past persecution and faces future persecution in Sudan due to his political beliefs. As the firm resettlement bar to asylum applies here and Ibrahim is therefore ineligible for asylum, we need not address these additional claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-26\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>fore the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
