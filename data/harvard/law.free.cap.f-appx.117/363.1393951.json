Kayondo and his wife, Adah Nyamutoka, a beneficiary of Kayondo\u2019s asylum application, were also denied voluntary departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Kayondo takes issue with the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determinations. Because the record does not compel us to do so, we do not disturb the IJ\u2019s findings regarding the credibility of Kayondo\u2019s testimony. <em>See Lopez De Jesus v. INS, </em>312 F.3d 155, 161 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">Kayondo also contends that he established an entitlement to asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the CAT. The IJ determined, in view of his assessment of Kayondo\u2019s credibility, that Kayondo was not entitled to asylum. Because Kayondo has failed to show that the evidence was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could conclude against the IJ\u2019s determination that Kayondo was not entitled to asylum, we must affirm that finding. <em>See Carbajal-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>78 F.3d 194, 197 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">As Kayondo has not made the showing required to obtain asylum, he has not met the more demanding standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 903 (5th Cir.2002). Because Kayondo has not shown that it is more likely than not that he will be tortured upon his return to Uganda, he has not shown an entitlement to relief under the CAT. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(1); <em>see also Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>320 F.3d 130, 144 (2d Cir.2003) (\u201cImprisonment of military deserters does not inherently constitute torture.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-10\">Kayondo contends that by using a summary affirmance procedure the BIA failed to address the arguments made on appeal. His argument fails because, where the affirmance without opinion procedure is employed, the IJ\u2019s opinion becomes the opinion of the BIA. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4)(ii). Moreover, this court has held that the summary affirmance procedure does not deprive this court of a basis for judicial review. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 832 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-11\">Kayondo also contends that the BIA should not have affirmed without opinion because the IJ\u2019s opinion contained errors and because the case does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for use of the summary affirmance procedure. As discussed above, Kayondo has not shown any error in the IJ\u2019s decision on his various claims for relief. Kayondo is not entitled to further judicial review. <em>See Garciar-Melendez v. Ashcroft, </em>351 F.3d 657, 663 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-12\">Finally, Kayondo argues that the IJ erred in denying his request for voluntary departure. This court lacks jurisdiction to review the denial of voluntary departure. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(f); <em>Eyoum v. INS, </em>125 F.3d 889, 891 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-13\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b392-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
