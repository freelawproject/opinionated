The district court departed upward from the guideline range pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4A1.3, p.s. (2003), and sentenced Sloan to a term of 188 months imprisonment. Sloan appeals his sentence, arguing that <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), applies to the district court\u2019s decision to depart upward and that \u00a7 4A1.3 is unconstitutional under <em>Blakely. </em>He further contends that, if <em>Blakely </em>does not apply, the district court abused its discretion in departing upward and sentencing him as a <em>de facto </em>career offender. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-11\">Sloan\u2019s criminal history was replete with crimes of violence. Between July 9 and September 24, 1992, Sloan committed a total of nine robberies in Pennsylvania. He was convicted of four robberies, three of which were consolidated for sentencing.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Because all these offenses were treated by the probation officer as part of a common scheme or plan, <em>i.e., </em>as related cases, USSG \u00a7 4A1.2, comment, (n.3), Sloan fortuitously did not qualify for sentencing as a career offender under USSG \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>See </em>USSG 4B1.2(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-13\">Sloan received three criminal history points for his ten-year sentence for bank robbery under USSG \u00a7 4Al.l(a), and one point for each sentence imposed for the remaining three robberies. USSG \u00a7 4Al.l(f). Including the points awarded for other prior sentences, Sloan had a total of nine criminal history points, which placed him in category IV. The recommended guideline range was 77-96 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-14\">At the sentencing hearing, Sloan\u2019s attorney acknowledged that an upward departure was appropriate under \u00a7 4A1.3. He recommended a departure to category VI and a sentence of 125 months imprisonment. The district court decided to depart upward in part because it believed, mistakenly, that Sloan\u2019s three sentences for robberies that were consolidated for sentencing in July 1993 received <em>no </em>criminal history points because they were related cases, when in fact each was awarded one point under USSG \u00a7 4Al.l(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-15\">The court noted that Application 3 to \u00a7 4A1.2 recognizes that, in some cases, the definition of related cases may be overly broad and may \u201cresult in a criminal history score that underrepresents the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal history and the danger that he presents to the public.\u201d The court found that this was true of Sloan\u2019s three supposedly unscored crimes of violence. The court found that Sloan was a <em>de facto </em>career offender and therefore departed upward from category TV to category VI and from offense level 24 to offense level 32. The court imposed a sentence of 188 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-16\">On appeal, Sloan first argues that his sentence must be vacated under <em>Blakely </em>because the district court engaged in unconstitutional fact finding when it departed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>upward, and that \u00a7 4A1.3 is unconstitutional under <em>Blakely </em>because it permits judicial fact finding to increase the statutory maximum sentence. Because we recently held that <em>Blakely </em>\u201cdoes not affect the operation of the federal sentencing guidelines,\u201d <em>United States v. Hammond, </em>381 F.3d 316, 2004 WL 2005622, at *28 (4th Cir. Sept.8, 2004) (en banc), we conclude that neither of these contentions has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">Alternatively, Sloan argues that, if <em>Blakely </em>does not apply, the district court abused its discretion in departing by treating him as a <em>de facto </em>career offender. A sentencing court may depart from the guideline range only if the court finds an aggravating or mitigating factor of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately considered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(b) (West Supp.2004) (setting out general principles for departures and special considerations for child crimes and sexual offenses); <em>Koon v. United States, </em>518 U.S. 81, 98, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996). As of April 30, 2003, the Prosecutorial Remedies and Tools Against the Exploitation of Children Today Act of 2003 (\u201cPROTECT Act\u201d), Pub.L. No. 108-21, 117 Stat. 650, 670 (amending 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e), (e)(3)), requires a reviewing court to review certain departures de novo. The appeals court must review de novo whether the district court failed to provide a written statement of its reasons for departing, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3742(e)(3)(A) (West Supp.2004), and whether the departure was based on a factor that (1) does not advance the objectives set forth in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a)(2) (West Supp.2004), (2) is not authorized by \u00a7 3553(b), or (3) is not justified by the facts of the case. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3742(e)(3)(B)(i)-(iii) (West Supp.2004). If the departure is justified, the appeals court must review the extent of the departure deferentially. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>380 F.3d 183, 188 n. 3 (4th Cir.2004), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>Sept. 15, 2004 (No. 04^-6377); <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3742(e)(3)(C) (West Supp.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-7\">An upward departure pursuant to \u00a7 4A1.3 is encouraged if the court finds that the criminal history category does not adequately represent the defendant\u2019s past criminal conduct. The district court\u2019s determination that an encouraged factor is not already accounted for in the guideline is reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Rybicki, </em>96 F.3d 754, 757 (4th Cir.1996) (citing <em>Koon, </em>518 U.S. at 96, 116 S.Ct. 2035).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-8\">In this case, although the district court mistakenly stated that three of Sloan\u2019s pri- or crimes of violence received no criminal history points because they were related, when in fact each of the 1992 hotel and store robberies was awarded one criminal history point, the record amply supports the district court\u2019s decision to depart. As Sloan concedes in his opening brief, he would have been a career offender if there had been an intervening arrest in his series of robberies in 1992, or if his 1985 burglary conviction were not outside the applicable time period for sentences of less than a year and a month, <em>see </em>USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-9\">Moreover, Sloan would have been a career offender if he had been prosecuted separately for any of the five bank robberies he committed in 1992 for which charges were dismissed under his plea agreement relating to the sixth bank robbery. <em>United States v. Harrison, </em>58 F.3d 115, 118 (4th Cir.1995) (\u201cdistrict court may sentence a defendant as a <em>de facto </em>career offender when he has committed two crimes that would qualify as predicate crimes for career offender status, but for some reason cannot be counted.\u201d). Sloan\u2019s criminal history included more than the two crimes of violence necessary to qualify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>him for career offender status. Therefore, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in deciding to depart or in treating Sloan as a <em>de facto </em>career offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">We therefore affirm the sentence imposed by the district court. We deny as moot the government\u2019s motion to place this case in abeyance for <em>Hammoud, </em>and we dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b898-12\"> Five counts of bank robbery were dismissed under a plea agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
