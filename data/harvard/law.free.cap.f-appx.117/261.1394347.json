We dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291-96 (2000). To the extent that Miller seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order denying his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (2000) petition, we dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-10\">Parties are accorded thirty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Dir., Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (I960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-11\">The district court\u2019s order was entered on the docket on April 17, 2003. The notice of appeal was filed, at the earliest, on August 18, 2004. Because Miller failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-13\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
