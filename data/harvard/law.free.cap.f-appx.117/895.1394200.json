We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-10\">In her petition for review, Lim challenges the immigration judge\u2019s determination that she failed to establish her eligibility for asylum. To obtain reversal of a determination denying eligibility for relief, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Lim fails to show the evidence compels a contrary result. Accordingly, we cannot grant the relief she seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-12\">Additionally, we uphold the immigration judge\u2019s denial of Lim\u2019s request for withholding of removal. \u201cBecause the burden of proof for withholding of removal is higher than for asylum \u2014 even though the facts that must be proved are the same \u2014 an applicant who is ineligible for asylum is necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal under [8 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1231(b)(3).\u201d <em>Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004). Because Lim fails to show she is eligible for asylum, she cannot meet the higher standard for withholding of removal.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b924-13\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-14\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b924-11\"> Lim does not challenge the denial of relief under the Convention Against Torture.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
