Tshilembi challenges the IJ\u2019s finding that he failed to present credible testimony and thus did not meet his burden of proof to qualify for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-23\">To obtain reversal of a determination denying eligibility for relief, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that the IJ\u2019s negative credibility findings are supported by specific, cogent reasons. <em>Figeroa v. INS, </em>886 F.2d 76, 78 (4th Cir.1989). Accordingly, Tshilembi fails to show that the evidence compels a contrary result. Having failed to qualify for asylum on this ground, Tshilembi cannot meet the higher <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>standard to qualify for withholding of removal. <em>Chen v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 198, 205 (4th Cir.1999); <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">Finally, we lack jurisdiction over Tshilembi\u2019s challenge to the denial of protection under the Convention Against Torture because he failed to properly exhaust this claim in his appeal to the Board. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1) (2000); <em>Asika v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 264, 267 n. 3 (4th Cir.2004), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 861, \u2014 LEd.2d -, 73 U.S.L.W. 3135 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
