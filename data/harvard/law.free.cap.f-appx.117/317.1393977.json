(\u201cNaphcare\u201d), a healthcare services provider. She also appeals the district court\u2019s grant of a motion filed by her former supervisor at Naphcare, Defendant-Appellee Ronald D. Isaac, to dismiss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>for failure to state a claim under state law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Plaintiff-Appellant Jane Thompson worked for Napheare as an RN supervisor at the Harrison County Adult Detention facility in Gulfport, Mississippi, for a total of three months and two weeks, viz., from June 6 to September 21, 2000. Isaac went to work at Napheare about a month after Thompson, on July 3, 2000, in a supervisory role over Thompson. She contends that Isaac immediately began a pattern of harassment, consisting of unwelcome sexual comments and touching.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">Thompson specified five such incidents. First, she testified in her deposition that on July 3, 2000, while Isaac was introducing himself to the staff, he asked her about her age, then commented that she \u201ccertainly didn\u2019t look\u201d her age. Thompson also stated that, while discussing with Isaac her forthcoming vacation to the Caribbean, he commented that she had a figure that most college girls would envy and that she should leave her husband behind and take Isaac along instead. She further asserted that, without invitation, Isaac twice touched her in an intrusive manner, viz., rubbing her shoulders, once when she was standing in a doorway and again while she was sitting at a computer. Finally, . Thompson averred that Isaac informed her during a private conference in his office near the end of August that it was his responsibility to protect her from other personnel and that if she were \u201cnot so wrapped up with\u201d her husband, she could see what Isaac would do for her.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">Thompson also testified that, in late August and early September, Isaac\u2019s attitude toward her changed; that he began berating her in an unprofessional manner for negligible mistakes. She added that, on or about August 30, 2000, Isaac stated that Thompson was unprofessional and threatened to replace her unless she improved. She contends that, at this meeting, Isaac told Thompson that she, an RN supervisor, would thereafter be supervised by Geraldine Wells, a Licensed Practical Nurse (\u201cLPN\u201d). (Thompson concedes, however, that Isaac had appointed Wells as \u201cclinic supervisor\u201d on his first day in the office; and in his affidavit, Isaac averred that he expected Wells, who had experience working in correctional facilities, to provide coordination and guidance to other staff members, including RNs, on matters of security, clinic flow, documentation, and referral matters.) Thompson complained to Napheare about this arrangement on September 13, 2000 and thereafter called the Mississippi State Board of Nursing to report the situation. (The Board did not contact Napheare or investigate until after Thompson had resigned.)</p>\n<p id=\"b347-11\">Thompson also contended that, on September 1, 2000, Isaac reprimanded her for taking too much time on a visit to the Juvenile Detention Facility, screaming at her and accusing her of \u201cstealing company time.\u201d According to Thompson, Isaac followed up by issuing a written warning to her, which was later revised to remove Isaac\u2019s charge of \u201ctheft of company time.\u201d Thompson also stated that, on the same day, Isaac screamed at her for continuing to examine a patient after she had already clocked-out for the day. Isaac also contacted Napheare human resources on September 4, 2000 to discuss extending Thompson\u2019s probationary period because of \u201cperformance issues.\u201d He discussed this extension in a private meeting with Thompson and another co-worker on Sep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>tember 6, 2000, but neither he nor Thompson produced testimony from the co-worker who allegedly witnessed this exchange. At this same meeting, Isaac gave Thompson a set of guidelines delineating areas in which she had to improve, including establishing priorities, completing paperwork, and training on specified equipment. Thompson said that Isaac called her \u201cincompetent\u201d during this meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">Thompson consulted an attorney on August 30, 2000 concerning Isaac\u2019s allegedly discriminatory behavior. Naphcare first received notice of Thompson\u2019s accusations on September 5, 2000, when Isaac\u2019s supervisor, Bob Malone, received a letter from Thompson\u2019s attorney. Two days later, Naphcare dispatched Ashley Clark, its director of human resources, and Vance Alexander, its in-house counsel, to the Harrison County worksite to investigate the charges that Thompson\u2019s lawyer had leveled. Clark and Alexander interviewed individuals identified by Thompson as witnesses to the alleged events but were unable to substantiate the charges raised in the letter from her lawyer. In fact, the Naphcare employees who were interviewed by Clark and Alexander denied witnessing any inappropriate behavior on the part of Isaac. An employee who witnessed the conversation about Thompson\u2019s Caribbean vacation recalled that Isaac mentioned wanting to go on vacation, but did not find Isaac\u2019s comments to be inappropriate or offensive. LPN Wells was also present during some of the allegedly unseemly conversations: Wells denied witnessing anything inappropriate between Isaac and Thompson. The investigators also noted that the office was much like a \u201cfishbowl,\u201d in that glass walls enclosed three walls of Isaac\u2019s office, and only a half wall separated the nurses\u2019 station from the main administrative area.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Despite the absence of verification of the charges against Isaac, the investigators instructed him not to communicate with Thompson without other employees being present. After Naphcare\u2019s investigators left, Isaac approached Thompson to apologize and to try to explain his position. Thompson found this action inappropriate and complained to Clark, who told Isaac\u2019s supervisor, Malone, to instruct Isaac not to discuss the matter further with Thompson.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">On September 13, the day Isaac left on vacation and the day preceding her own final day of work at Naphcare, Thompson complained to Clark and Malone that her work had been too closely scrutinized by LPN Wells that day. Thompson also reported that Isaac had telephoned the office that day and, after speaking with Wells, had accused Thompson of refusing to do her work.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">Following the September 7 investigation, Thompson worked until September 14, took paid leave for health reasons September 18-20, and resigned on September 21. She thus worked a total of only seven days after the investigation. Other than Isaac\u2019s unwelcome apology and the September 13 phone conversation, Thompson did not claim to have had any contact with him from the time of Naphcare\u2019s September 7 investigation until her resignation on September 21. She did assert that it was at Isaac\u2019s direction that LPN Wells\u2019s supervision became onerous and overly critical following the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">On September 21, after Naphcare informed Thompson that it could not substantiate her allegations, she tendered her letter of resignation. In it she stated that she was resigning on instructions from her doctor. Thompson now insists, however, that she had no choice but to resign and that Naphcare is responsible for her constructive discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">Thompson filed this complaint in January 2002, advancing claims of sexual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>harassment, hostile work environment, and constructive discharge - all under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq. </em>(\u201cTitle VII\u201d)arising from advances allegedly made by Isaac while he was Thompson\u2019s supervisor at Naphcare. Thompson also claimed that Naphcare was liable under state law for intentional infliction of emotional distress, failure to enforce Title VII, and constructive wrongful termination. She later amended her complaint to add Title VII and state law wrongful termination claims against Isaac individually. The district court dismissed Thompson\u2019s claims against Isaac for Title VII violations and wrongful termination, holding under Rule 12(b)(6) that Thompson had failed to state claims for which relief could be granted. Following discovery, the district court granted Naphcare's summary judgment motion to dismiss all remaining claims, and this appeal ensued. On appeal, Thompson only complains of the dismissal of her Title VII sexual harassment and constructive discharge claims against Naphcare and her state law emotional distress claims against Isaac.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b349-10\">The district court dismissed Thompson\u2019s claims against Naphcare on its motion for summary judgment and against Isaac for failure to state a claim. We review both rulings <em>de novo.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-16\">B. <em>Sexual Harassment Claims Against Naphcare</em></p>\n<p id=\"b349-17\">In a Title VII sexual harassment suit, the plaintiff must establish a <em>prima facie </em>case by showing that (1) she belongs to a protected class; (2) she was subjected to unwelcome harassment; (3) the harassment was based on sex; (4) the harassment complained of affected a \u201cterm, condition or privilege of employment\u201d; and (5) the employer knew or should have known of the harassment but failed to remedy the situation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thompson advanced sexual harassment claims of both the <em>quid pro quo </em>and the hostile work environment varieties. The former requires a showing of a tangible employment action to satisfy the fourth prong of the foregoing test; the latter requires a showing, in the absence of a tangible employment action, that a supervisor\u2019s harassment was nevertheless sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter a term or condition of employment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This distinction makes a difference. An employer held vicariously hable for <em>quid pro quo </em>harassment on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>finding that it took a tangible employment action toward an employee who either accepted or rejected a supervisor\u2019s sexual harassment is conclusively presumed to have had notice of the offending supervisor\u2019s conduct and will not be permitted to advance the affirmative defense enunciated by the Supreme Court in <em>Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Faragher v. City of Boca </em>Raton,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In contrast, an employer that is found not to have taken a tangible employment action toward the harassed employee but is found to have maintained a hostile work environment by virtue of severe or pervasive supervisor sexual harassment may nevertheless advance the <em>Ellerth/Faragher </em>affirmative defense.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">Thus, when addressing a claim of supervisor sexual harassment, we must first determine whether an employee has suffered a tangible employment action.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> An affirmative answer would demonstrate the existence of <em>quid pro quo </em>harassment and thus automatic employer liability.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In contrast, a conclusion that the employee was not the object of a tangible employment action requires a determination whether the supervisor\u2019s sexual harassment was nevertheless so severe or pervasive that it created a \u201chostile environment.\u201d Even if we find such a condition to have been created, though, the employer may escape vicarious liability by successfully advancing the <em>Ellerth/Faragher </em>affirmative defense.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-11\">1. <em>Quid pro quo</em></p>\n<p id=\"b350-12\"><em>As </em>noted above, our initial inquiry is whether the employee experienced a tangible employment action <em>at all. A </em>tangible employment action usually causes economic harm to an employee, yet this is not always the case.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> A demotion or substantial diminution in job responsibilities may also produce a tangible employment action, even if the employee experiences no economic injury.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The purpose of Title VII is to remedy ultimate employment decisions, not to challenge every interim action taken by an employer that may have a tangential effect on an ultimate decision.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Thus, to have taken a tangible employment action, an employer must have made an employment decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-13\">We hold as a matter of law that Thompson failed to demonstrate that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>suffered a tangible employment action at Naphcare. She did not allege any diminution in her compensation or in her job responsibilities; neither did she allege that she was demoted. Thompson alleged only that (1) Isaac screamed at her for taking too long to go to the Juvenile Detention Center and gave her a written warning for the same conduct, (2) extended her probationary period an additional forty-five days, and (3) caused her work to be unduly scrutinized by Wells, an LPN. None of these actions rises to the level of an ultimate employment decision; indeed, we have specifically held that increased criticism of an employee\u2019s work does not constitute a tangible employment action.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Absent a tangible employment action, Thompson\u2019s <em>quid pro quo </em>claim fails. The absence of a tangible employment action does not, however, prevent an employee from establishing the existence of a hostile work environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">2. <em>Hostile work environment</em></p>\n<p id=\"Auf\">For supervisor sexual harassment to be actionable as a hostile work environment claim, it must be \u201csufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of employment and create an abusive working environment.\u201d <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> A sexually objectionable environment must be both objectively and subjectively offensive to give rise to a cause of action under Title VII.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Determination of whether an environment is offensive or abusive requires an <em>ad hoc </em>analysis, \u201cfocusing on factors such as the frequency of the conduct, the severity of the conduct, the degree to which the conduct is physically threatening or humiliating, and the degree to which the conduct unreasonably interferes with an employee\u2019s work performance.\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">Thompson contends that Isaac\u2019s behavior on the five specified occasions over the course of a month and a half created a hostile work environment: two when he touched or rubbed her shoulders; another when he told her that she did not look her age; again when he told her that she had the figure of a college girl and asked to accompany her on vacation in the place of her husband; and, finally, when, in a private conference in his office, he told her that if she were not so wrapped up in her husband, she would \u201csee what [Isaac] could do for her.\u201d If verified, Isaac\u2019s actions would be boorish, offensive, and uncouth, particularly with respect to the last remark.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">Regardless, even if we were to assume <em>arguendo </em>that Isaac\u2019s actions did create a hostile working environment, we would exonerate Naphcare on its affirmative defense that (1) it took reasonable care to prevent the harassment and (2) Thompson unreasonably failed to take advantage of the preventative or corrective opportuni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>ties provided by Naphcare.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Naphcare presented evidence that its Employee Handbook, which Thompson acknowledges receiving, included a complaint procedure by which employees should directly contact a Human Resources manager regarding employment discrimination claims if the employee did not feel comfortable addressing the issue with their immediate supervisor or other manager. Also, once Naphcare received Thompson\u2019s complaint, it immediately sent two high level executives to Thompson\u2019s worksite to investigate her claims. And, even though they could not substantiate Thompson\u2019s claims, these investigators forbade Isaac to have solo encounters with Thompson. Inasmuch as Thompson did not allege any further sexually harassing conduct on the part of Isaac after completion of the investigation by Naphcare, the employer\u2019s response to her complaints was not ineffectual. By taking these actions, Naphcare exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly this alleged sexual harassment in the workplace.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Conversely, by waiting almost two months to register her complaints and then resigning almost immediately after Naphcare\u2019s prompt investigation and remedial actions, Thompson can not be said to have acted reasonably.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">C. <em>Constructive Discharge Claim Against Naphcare</em></p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Thompson also asserted that Isaac\u2019s harassing conduct, followed by his increased criticism and supervision of her work, caused her to be constructively discharged. To demonstrate constructive discharge, a plaintiff must prove that working conditions were so intolerable that a reasonable person in the plaintiffs position would feel compelled to resign.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> An employee\u2019s obligation of reasonableness requires that she not jump to conclusions and not assume the worst.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Whether a reasonable employee would feel compelled to resign depends on the circumstances, with special consideration, <em>inter alia, </em>of seven non-exclusive factors: (1) demotion; (2) reduction in salary; (3) reduction in job responsibilities; (4) reassignment to menial or degrading work; (5) reassignment to work under a younger supervisor; (6) badgering, harassment, or humiliation by the employer calculated to encourage the employee\u2019s resignation; and (7) offers of continued employment on terms less favorable than the employee\u2019s former status.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Thompson did not prove the presence of any of these factors. Thompson also failed to present any other evidence sufficient to show that her working conditions were intolerable.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b352-10\">Taken together, Thompson\u2019s allegations amount to five instances of putative sexual harassment, a few occasions on which she was more harshly reprimanded by her supervisor than she believes was warranted, and overly strict supervision by an LPN <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>whom Thompson believed to be unqualified to supervise her work. As to the harassing conduct, Naphcare unquestionably took prompt remedial action, and Thompson does not allege that Isaac\u2019s discriminatory behavior continued after the investigation.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> As to the increased supervision and criticism, this took place over a period of no more than two weeks in early September 2000, after which Thompson took medical leave and then resigned. We are satisfied that the incidents alleged by Thompson to have created an intolerable working environment were not of a sufficient magnitude to do so. We are also satisfied that an employee who resigns without affording the employer a reasonable opportunity to address her concerns has not been constructively discharged.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Like her sexual harassment claims, Thompson\u2019s constructive discharge claim against Naphcare fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">D. <em>Claims Against Isaac</em></p>\n<p id=\"Aa4\">In granting Isaac\u2019s Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the district court dismissed all of Thompson\u2019s claims against him. Thompson argues on appeal that, even if the district court did not err as to her other claims against Isaac, it erred in failing to address her claim against him for intentional infliction of emotional distress. As Thompson did not raise such a claim against Isaac in her amended complaint, however, she may not raise it for the first time on appeal.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> We affirm the court\u2019s dismissal of all claims against Isaac.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b353-10\">For the foregoing reasons, all rulings of the district court appealed by Thompson are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b346-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b347-9\">. The district court also dismissed Thompson's state law claims against Napheare and her Title VII claims against Isaac, but she has not appealed these rulings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b349-11\">. Thompson contends that she brought a state law claim for emotional distress in addition to her wrongful termination and Title VII claims against Isaac at the trial court level, and argues that the district court erred in not addressing this claim in its order granting Isaac\u2019s motion for dismiss for failure to state a claim. As we conclude, <em>infra, </em>however, she did not state such a claim in her amended complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b349-12\">. <em>Gibson v.
