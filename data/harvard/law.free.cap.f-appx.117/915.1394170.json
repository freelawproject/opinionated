The district court\u2019s dismissal was based, in part, on Kelley\u2019s failure to comply with a 1997 sanction order issued by the Northern District of Texas, which prohibited Kelley from filing any new complaints without first obtaining permission from an Article III or magistrate judge (the \u201c1997 Order\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-13\">Kelley takes issue with the district court\u2019s treatment of his substantive claims. He also challenges, among other things, the district court\u2019s newly-imposed sanctions and denial of Kelley\u2019s motions for recusal and injunctive relief. Kelley does not address the district court\u2019s finding that he failed to comply with the 1997 Order. <em>See Balawajder v. Scott, </em>160 F.3d 1066, 1067 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-14\">By failing to address the issue concerning his compliance with the 1997 Order, Kelley has abandoned any argument regarding this basis for the dismissal of his complaint. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993). Because Kelley failed to comply with the 1997 Order, his request for injunctive relief was properly denied. Similarly, Kelley fails to explain how the district court\u2019s failure to conduct a show cause hearing with respect to its newly-imposed sanctions constituted an abuse of discretion. In any event, based on Kelley\u2019s history of filing frivolous 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claims, he was not entitled to a hearing prior to the imposition of sanctions. <em>See Moody v. Baker, </em>857 F.2d 256, 258 (5th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-15\">Kelley\u2019s appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. Kelley\u2019s argument that Judge Lake should recuse himself upon remand is therefore moot. Kelley\u2019s motion to expedite his appeal is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-16\">Kelley is warned that the filing of frivolous pleadings in this court or in the district court or the prosecution of frivolous actions or appeals will subject him to sanctions beyond those prescribed in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), including monetary penalties and restrictions on his ability to file actions and appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; MOTION TO EXPEDITE DENIED; SANCTIONS WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b944-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
