Vargas asserts that he has suffered past persecution and fears future persecution on account of his imputed political opinion as a result of his family having strong ties to the military.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">Although Vargas identifies the standard of review for withholding of removal applications, he fails to address the issue in the body of the brief. Accordingly, the withholding of removal claim is deemed abandoned. <em>See Calderon-Ontiveros v. INS, </em>809 F.2d 1050, 1052 (5th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">When, as here, the BIA adopts without opinion the IJ\u2019s decision, this court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Gomez-Mejia v. INS, </em>56 F.3d 700, 702 (5th Cir.1995). Here, the IJ\u2019s determination that Vargas has not shown past persecution or a well founded fear of future persecution if returned to El Salvador was supported by substantial evidence. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, Vargas\u2019 petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b398-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
