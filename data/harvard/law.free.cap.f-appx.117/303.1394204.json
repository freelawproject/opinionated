Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 366 (4th Cir.2004). We will reverse this decision only if the evidence \u201c \u2018was so compelling that no reasonable fact finder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 325 n. 14 (4th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992)). We have reviewed the administrative record and the immigration judge\u2019s decision and find substantial evidence supports the conclusion that the petitioners failed to establish the past persecution or well-founded fear of future persecution necessary to establish eligibility for asylum. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a) (2004) (stating that the burden of proof is on the alien to establish eligibility for asylum); <em>Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 483, 112 S.Ct. 812 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-17\">Next, we uphold the immigration judge\u2019s denial of Tjahjaningtyas\u2019s application for withholding of removal. The standard for withholding of removal is \u201cmore stringent than that for asylum eligibility.\u201d <em>Chen v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 198, 205 (4th Cir.1999). An applicant for withholding must demonstrate a clear probability of persecution. <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987). As the petitioners failed to establish refugee status, they cannot satisfy the higher standard necessary for withholding.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-18\">Furthermore, we conclude substantial evidence supports the determination that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>the petitioners did not establish it was more likely than not that they would be tortured if removed to Indonesia, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2004), and thus, that their petition for protection under the CAT was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
