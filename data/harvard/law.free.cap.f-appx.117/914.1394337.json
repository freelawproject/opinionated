Kaether contends that the \u201cnon-serious\u201d nature of her prior conviction for possession of stolen mail was insufficient to warrant an upward departure and that her commission of the same offense within a five-year period failed to render her criminal record \u201catypically egregious.\u201d Based on the Sentencing Guidelines\u2019 allowance for upward departures based upon prior similar adult conduct that did not result in a criminal conviction,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Kaether draws the negative inference that there is no basis for a departure if the prior similar adult conduct did result in a conviction. Kaether also argues that, because the guidelines assess additional criminal history points for defendants who commit offenses while on supervised release and/or within two years of their release from confinement, it necessarily follows that increased punishment is not intended for a defendant who, like Kaether, commits a new offense beyond two years from release from incarceration and after completion of a prior term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>With respect to the extent of the departure, Kaether argues that the district court failed to explain why intervening criminal history categories V and VI under-represented Kaether\u2019s risk of recidivism. Kaether also contends that the district court failed to distinguish her criminal record as more serious than those of defendants falling within the intervening criminal history categories.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">The district court\u2019s decision to depart upward was warranted since it was based on Kaether\u2019s likelihood to recidivate.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In addition, the district court\u2019s departure did not constitute an abuse of discretion, and was adequately explained and justified by the court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b943-6\">For the first time on appeal, Kaether cites to <em>Blakely v. </em>Washington<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and asserts that the district court\u2019s upward departure violated her Sixth Amendment rights since it was based upon findings that were neither charged in the indictment nor found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Kaether correctly concedes that this argument is foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. </em>Pineiro.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b943-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b942-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
