Zelada contends that the district court plainly erred by applying the 16-level adjustment in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) and that the felony and aggravated felony provisions in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) &amp; (b)(2) are unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-20\">Zelada received the sentence adjustment based on his prior conviction for selling or furnishing marijuana. Zelada did not object to the presentence investigation report\u2019s (PSR) characterization of his offense, and at sentencing, his counsel admitted that Zelada\u2019s prior conviction was for delivery of marijuana. The PSR stated that, based on court records, the conviction stemmed from Zelada\u2019s sale of marijuana to an undercover police officer. Zelada does not dispute this fact, but rather argues that his prior conviction was under Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7 11360(a) and that a conviction under this statute does not necessarily meet the definition of \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i). He asserts that the Government failed to sustain its burden to prove that his prior conviction qualified for the 16-level adjustment. In particular, he contends that no evidence outside of the statute of conviction and charging instru<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>ment should have been considered in applying the adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">We review only for plain <em>error </em>because this argument is raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See United States v. Diaz-Diaz, </em>327 F.3d 410, 412 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 889, 124 S.Ct. 271, 157 L.Ed.2d 161 (2003). It was not plain error for the district court to apply the adjustment given the information before it and the lack of any objections or rebuttal evidence. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-37, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993); <em>United States v. Ramirez, </em>367 F.3d 274, 277 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 145, 160 L.Ed.2d 137 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">As Zelada concedes, his assertion that the felony and aggravated felony provisions in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) &amp; (b)(2) are unconstitutional is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Likewise, Zelada\u2019s contention that under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), his sentence could not be enhanced based on any prior convictions unless he admitted to them or they were found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>377 F.3d 464, 465-66 (5th Cir.2004), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(July 14, 2004) (No. 04-5263).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b404-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
