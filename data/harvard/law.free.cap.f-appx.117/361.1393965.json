He argues that the district court used information protected by an immunity agreement to calculate his sentencing range under the Sentencing Guidelines in violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.8. In view of the evidence presented at the evidentiary hearing on remand, Taylor has not shown that the district court erred in finding that the Government established the evidence used to calculate Taylor\u2019s offense level was obtained from legitimate independent sources \u2014 his codefendants, Dale Anderson and Marcus Wemberly. <em>See United States v. Cantu, </em>185 F.3d 298, 301 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">Taylor also argues that his sentence should be vacated in view of <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). Taylor acknowledges that the issue is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>377 F.3d 464, 473 (5th Cir.2004), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. July 14, 2004) (No. 04-5263), but states that he is raising it to preserve it for further review.<footnotemark>**</footnotemark> \u201c[0]nly those discrete, particular issues identified by the appeals court for remand are properly before the resentencing court.\u201d <em>United States v. Marmolejo, </em>139 F.3d 528, 530 (5th Cir.1998) <em>(\u201cMarmolejo II\u2019). </em>In Taylor\u2019s first appeal, this court vacated his sentence because Taylor\u2019s plea agreement contained a use immunity agreement and remanded for an evidentiary hearing concerning whether the Government obtained the information in the Presentence Report concerning the drug quantity attributable to Taylor from an independent source. <em>Taylor, </em>277 F.3d at 725-27. Therefore, this was the only issue before the district court on remand. Because Taylor could not have challenged the sentencing enhancements in the district court on remand, he may not raise this issue on appeal after remand. <em>See Marmolejo II, </em>139 F.3d at 530. Therefore, we will not address Taylor\u2019s argument that the district court erred in calculating his sentence under the Guidelines in view of <em>Blakely.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b389-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
