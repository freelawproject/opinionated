Husain contends that his trial counsel was ineffective for not introducing the report of C.E. Anderson, a gun examiner who examined and test fired six of the guns involved in the instant case. Husain argues that the conclusions in Anderson\u2019s report differed from the conclusions of the ATF agent who testified at trial that all six guns were fully automatic.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-15\">Anderson\u2019s report concluded that two of the guns fired only semi-automatic, but that all six of the guns had been \u201caltered to discharge full automatic, or the intent to make them discharge full automatic.\u201d The definition of machine gun includes any weapon \u201cdesigned to shoot ... automatically.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5845(b). Although the attempt to alter some of the guns to fire in the full automatic mode failed, they were \u201cdesigned\u201d <em>by alteration </em>to shoot ... automatically.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, Husain has failed to demonstrate that he was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s failure to introduce the Anderson report. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b382-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
