Mayfield alleges that WCC\u2019s practices and policies, namely its inadequate library and lack of research facilities, violate his First Amendment right of access to the courts. Mayfield also complains that his due process rights were violated when his inmate account was debited for legal supplies and services and when various prison officials arbitrarily denied or ignored his administrative grievances. The district court dismissed Mayfield\u2019s complaint as frivolous and for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, pursuant to 28 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) and (ii). This Court reviews dismissals as frivolous for abuse of discretion and dismissals for failure to state a claim <em>de novo. Newsome v. E.E.O.C., </em>301 F.3d 227, 231 (5th Cir.2002). Because the district court properly dismissed Mayfield\u2019s claim, we AFFIRM its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-5\">A complaint is frivolous if it lacks an arguable basis in either law or fact, such as relying on an indisputably merit-less legal theory. <em>Taylor v. Johnson, </em>257 F.3d 470, 472 (5th Cir.2001). Even under a <em>de novo </em>standard of review, Mayfield fails to establish a constitutional violation with respect to his claims. A prisoner cannot prevail on an aceess-to-the-courts claim without proving an actual injury. <em>See Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 350-52, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996); <em>Christopher v. Harbury, </em>536 U.S. 403, 415-16, 122 S.Ct. 2179, 153 L.Ed.2d 413 (2002); <em>Brewer v. Wilkinson, </em>3 F.3d 816, 821 (5th Cir.1993). Even if it is assumed <em>arguendo </em>that the policies and practices described by Mayfield impinged upon his access to the courts, Mayfield does not establish that prejudice or an actual injury resulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-7\">In his complaint, Mayfield asserts that \u201chis motions for trial transcript and legal documents ha[ve] been denied, and his post-conviction relief has been denied, because the Court accepted] plaintiff[\u2019s] application for a writ of review and denied it for not showing ... factual allegations.\u201d This allegation fails to \u201cidentify a \u2018nonfrivolous,\u2019 \u2018arguable\u2019 underlying claim\u201d that Mayfield was unable to pursue. <em>Christopher, </em>536 U.S. at 415, 122 S.Ct. 2179 (quoting <em>Lewis, </em>518 U.S. at 353, 353 n. 3, 116 S.Ct. 2174). In fact, despite repeated opportunities from the district court to amend his pleadings, Mayfield never even described the underlying cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-8\">Mayfield also fails to state a cognizable due process claim. In <em>Bounds v. Smith, </em>the Supreme Court held that it is \u201cindisputable\u201d that an indigent inmate must be provided legal supplies and postage at state expense. 430 U.S. 817, 824-25, 97 S.Ct. 1491, 52 L.Ed.2d 72 (1977). However, prisons are permitted to recoup such expenses from funds deposited in the inmate\u2019s trust account. <em>Guajardo v. Estelle, </em>580 F.2d 748, 762-63 (5th Cir.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-9\">Mayfield has not established that he is constitutionally entitled to an administrative grievance procedure. No liberty interest exists because WCC\u2019s challenged policies do not pose a \u201csignificant hardship ... in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.\u201d <em>Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 484, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-10\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. The affirmance of the district court\u2019s dismissal of Mayfield\u2019s complaint as frivolous counts as a \u201cstrike\u201d pursuant to the \u201cthree strikes\u201d provision, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir. 1996). Accordingly, Mayfield is cautioned that, if he accumulates three strikes, he may not proceed <em>informa pauperis </em>in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-11\">AFFIRMED; THREE-STRIKES WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b967-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
