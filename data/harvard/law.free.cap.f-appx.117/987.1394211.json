Appellant argues that the recoupment should be waived because he was not at fault for the overpayment. Because appellant\u2019s argument does not meet the statutory prerequisites, we reject his appeal and affirm the decision of the retirement board.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-15\">Appellant Warren Clingenpeel was employed by the Federal Railroad Administration as a safety inspector for just over 6 years. Towards the end of his tenure with that agency, Clingenpeel had both knee replacement surgery and a pacemaker installed. As a result of problems that were connected to these ailments, Clingenpeel applied for, and received, workers compensation under the Federal Employee\u2019s Compensation Act. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 8101 <em>et seq. </em>Clingenpeel applied for those funds in 1988. In 1993, Clingenpeel requested a disability annuity under the Railroad Retirement Act (\u201cRRA\u201d or \u201cthe Act\u201d); those benefits were also approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-16\">In order to prevent duplication of benefits, the RRA provides that the amount of disability benefits paid under the Act shall be reduced for, among other things, any amount provided as workers compensation. <em>See </em>45 U.S.C. \u00a7 224(a)(2). At the initiation of Clingenpeel\u2019s disability annuity, he notified the Railroad Retirement Board (\u201cthe Board\u201d) that he was receiving workers compensation. The Board accordingly deducted from his disability annuity an amount to offset this extra benefit. On March 9, 1994, Clingenpeel sent a letter to the Board indicating that his status had been changed \u2014 although not discontinued \u2014 with respect to his workers compen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"989\">*989</page-number>sation. Due to a clerical error, the Board mistakenly concluded that Clingenpeel was no longer receiving those benefits, and increased Clingenpeel\u2019s monthly payments accordingly. As a result of the error, Clingenpeel was paid both the full amount of his disability annuity and workers compensation from April 1994 through May 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-5\">Ultimately, the Board caught the error, and determined that Clingenpeel was paid $37,158.06 in excess of what he was due. After numerous requests for reconsideration by Clingenpeel, and two withholdings by the Board totaling $6755.00, a hearings officer determined that the net overpayment was $30,408.06. The hearings officer separated that total into two amounts, one for $12,610.00 (\u201cAmount 1\u201d), and another for $17,798.06 (\u201cAmount 2\u201d). Clingenpeel conceded the extent of the overpayment, but argued that it should be subject to waiver, under which he would not have to repay the money if he was without fault in causing the overpayment and the waiver would not be contrary to the purposes of the Act. <em>See </em>45 U.S.C. 231i(c). The hearings officer found that Clingenpeel was not without fault as to Amount 1, and therefore no waiver could be granted. As to Amount 2, Clingenpeel was determined to be without fault. However, waiver was nevertheless denied because, after analysis of Clingenpeel\u2019s finances and everyday expenses \u2014 including his recent purchase of two new trucks \u2014 the hearings officer determined that the recoupment would not be an economic hardship and thus is not against the purposes of the Act. Clingenpeel appealed the hearings officer\u2019s decision to the Board, which affirmed the ruling. Clingenpeel timely appeals to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-7\">This Court will affirm the decision of the Board if its findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence and its legal conclusions are not based on an error of law. <em>See Kurka v. U.S. R.R. Ret. Bd., </em>615 F.2d 246, 249-50 (5th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-10\">Clingenpeel\u2019s sole substantive argument on appeal is that he was without fault with respect to Amount 1. Section 10(c) of the RRA states that: \u201cThere shall be no recovery ... [from someone] who, in the judgment of the Board, is without fault when ... recovery would be against equity or good conscience.\u201d 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 231i(c). The requirements are conjunctive; in order for recovery to be waived, (1) one must be without fault in causing the overpayment, and (2) recovery must be against equity or good conscience. Thus, even accepting, <em>arguendo, </em>Clingenpeel\u2019s argument that he was without fault, waiver may still not be required if the recoupment is not contrary to the purpose of the Act\u2014 <em>i.e., </em>\u201cagainst equity or good conscience.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1017-11\">The RRA has promulgated regulations that give content to that phrase. \u201cIt is contrary to the purpose of the Act for an overpayment to be recovered from income and resources which the individual requires to meet ordinary and necessary living expenses.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 255.12(a). After reviewing Clingenpeel\u2019s financial records, the hearings officer determined that his combined income exceeded expenses by more than $2,000. Given Clingenpeel\u2019s recent purchase of two new trucks, totaling over $37,000, the officer concluded that repayment would still leave Clingenpeel able to meet his \u201cordinary and necessary living expenses.\u201d Clingenpeel offers no arguments to the contrary. Because we find that this determination is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"990\">*990</page-number>supported by substantial evidence in the record, the decision of the Board is</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1016-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under die limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
