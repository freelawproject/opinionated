He appeals the sentence imposed following the revocation of his supervised release. Willis argues that the district court erred by sentencing him above the statutory maximum sentence for revocation. In particular, he contends that once the district court imposed a two-year term of imprisonment, it was not authorized to impose an additional one-year term of supervised release because this violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(h) (2002). The Government concedes error.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">We review the alleged imposition of a sentence above the statutory maximum de novo. <em>See United States v. Sias, </em>227 F.3d 244, 246 (5th Cir.2000). The penalties imposed on revocation of supervised release relate back to the original offense. <em>See Johnson v. United States, </em>529 U.S. 694, 701-02, 120 S.Ct. 1795, 146 L.Ed.2d 727 (2000). Accordingly, the statutes in effect at the time of Willis\u2019s offense conduct, which occurred in 1995, apply. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>869 F.2d 835, 836-37 (5th Cir.1989). Because Willis\u2019s offense was a class D felony, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1341 &amp; 3559(a)(4) (1995), the maximum term of imprisonment that he could receive upon revocation of supervised release was two years. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (1995). In light of the district court\u2019s decision to sentence Willis to the maximum term of imprisonment, the court erred by also imposing a one-year term of supervised release. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(h); <em>United States v. Ferguson, </em>369 F.3d 847, 850-52 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">In sentencing Willis, the district court clearly stated its intention to impose the maximum term of imprisonment in order to allow Willis to obtain treatment for the drug problems that led to the revocation of his supervised release. <em>See United States v. Mills, </em>9 F.3d 1132, 1139 (5th Cir.1993). Therefore, we MODIFY the district court\u2019s judgment by VACATING the one-year term of supervised release, and we AFFIRM the judgment AS MODIFIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b390-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
