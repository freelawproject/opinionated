Richardson appeals her sentence following her conviction by a jury for conspiracy, health care fraud, aiding and abetting, false statements relating to health care fraud, conspiracy to launder monetary instruments, money laundering promotion, and aiding and abetting health care fraud. Richardson contends that the district court erred in adjusting her sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Al.l(b)(l) based on its determination that Richardson knew that the victims, most of whom were over the age of 65 and physically disabled, were vulnerable.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-13\">Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Al.l(b)(l), a defendant\u2019s offense level is increased by two levels \u201c[i]f the defendant knew or should have known that a victim of the offense was a vulnerable victim.\u201d A \u201cvulnerable victim\u201d is defined as \u201ca person (A) who is a victim of the offense of conviction and any conduct for which the defendant is accountable under [U.S.S.G.] \u00a7 1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct); and (B) who is unusually vulnerable due to age, physical or mental condition, or who is otherwise particularly susceptible to the criminal conduct.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.1, comment, (n.2). The determination whether one is a victim for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Al.l(b) is a factual finding subject to dear-error review. <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>137 F.3d 841, 843-44 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b960-14\">The patients involved in the instant case \u201csuffered harm or at least potential harm\u201d due to Richardson\u2019s fraudulent scheme. <em>See United States v. Gieger, </em>190 F.3d 661, 664 (5th Cir.1999). The PSR and trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>testimony indicated, <em>inter alia, </em>that patients were promised things that were never delivered, did not receive items that they needed, and in some cases received substandard items. Also, victims were falsely diagnosed, and part of their benefits were exhausted. Despite Richardson\u2019s billing for diabetic supplies, beneficiaries could not get diabetic supplies when they needed them. Victims received used hospital beds with dirty and worn mattresses. Although Richardson objected to the application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Al.l(b), she did not offer evidence to refute the facts set forth in the PSR, which were supported by the trial testimony, and which established that the victims of Richardson\u2019s fraudulent scheme suffered harm or potential harm by her actions. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>76 F.3d 82, 84 (5th Cir.1996) (the defendant bears the burden of demonstrating that the information relied upon by the district court at sentencing is materially untrue). Accordingly, the district court did not clearly err in determining that the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Al.l(b) adjustment was warranted because Richardson knew that the victims, most of whom were over the age of 65 and physically disabled, were vulnerable. <em>See Burgos, </em>137 F.3d at 844.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">Richardson also argues that the district court erred when it applied U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.1(b)(2) and increased her sentence by two levels because the offense involved a large number of vulnerable victims. This argument misconstrues the district court\u2019s ruling. The district court did not make an adjustment pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Al.l(b)(2). To the extent that Richardson\u2019s argument challenges the district court\u2019s application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Al.l(b)(2), this argument is moot since the district court did not apply U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Al.l(b)(2). To the extent that Richardson\u2019s argument regarding the number of vulnerable victims could be construed as an appeal of the district court\u2019s decision to increase her offense level by four levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(2)(B), which provides for a four-level increase if the offense involved 50 or more victims, this argument is inadequately briefed because Richardson does not address this guideline nor does she discuss facts relevant to it in her brief. Richardson has therefore abandoned any argument she may have had regarding the district court\u2019s application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(2)(B) by failing to brief such an argument. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b961-7\">Richardson has filed a supplemental brief in which she contends that her sentence is illegal in light of <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), because the facts supporting the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Al.l(b) adjustment were not determined by a jury. This issue is foreclosed by the court\u2019s holding in <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>377 F.3d 464, 465-66 (5th Cir.), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(July 14, 2004) (No. 04-5263).</p>\n<p id=\"b961-9\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b960-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
