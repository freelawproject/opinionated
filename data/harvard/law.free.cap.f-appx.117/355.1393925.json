In his complaint, Malena asserted that A1 Richard (Richard) violated his due process rights by not providing him with a disciplinary hearing before violations, occurring at a halfway house, were reported to parole authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-26\">By moving for leave to proceed IFP, Malena is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal was not taken in good faith because it is frivolous. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3); Fed. R.App. P. 24(a)(5). However, Malena has not demonstrated any nonfrivolous ground for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-27\">In <em>Morrissey v. Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471, 485-89, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972) the Supreme Court established that in order to comply with due process, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>parolee must be afforded a preliminary probable cause hearing when he is arrested for a parole violation and a more through revocation hearing within a reasonable time after he is taken into custody. Malena does not contend that he was denied due process in the form of a preliminary hearing post-arrest for violating a condition of his parole. He cites no authority in support of his contention that he was entitled to a hearing prior to being arrested for the parole violation. Because the loss of liberty as a parole violator does not occur until the parolee is placed under arrest, Malena has failed to state a due process violation against Richard. <em>See Cook v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>488 F.2d 667, 669-71 (5th Cir.1974); <em>Deveny v. United States Bd. of Parole, </em>565 F.2d 875, 878 (5th Cir.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">Accordingly, Malena\u2019s IFP motion is DENIED, and the appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202; 5th Cir. R. 42.2. Both the district court\u2019s dismissal and this court\u2019s dismissal of the instant appeal count as strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Malena is CAUTIONED that if he accumulates three strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; THREE-STRIKES WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b383-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
