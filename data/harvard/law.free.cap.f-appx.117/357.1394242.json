Spooner was convicted by a jury of three counts of mail fraud and three counts of wire fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-26\">Spooner contends that the district court erred by denying relief on his motion, challenging the indictment and the grand jury proceedings. Spooner has not shown error in the district court\u2019s reason for dismissing his motion. <em>See United States v. Lee, </em>358 F.3d 315, 321, 323 (5th Cir.2004); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number><em>United States v. Cothran, </em>302 F.3d 279, 286 n. 7 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Spooner challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for a continuance of the resentencing hearing. He asserts that he would have presented evidence concerning the prior convictions that were used to determine his criminal history category.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Spooner\u2019s reasons for requesting a continuance concerned issues that exceeded the scope of this court\u2019s remand opinion. <em>See Lee, </em>358 F.3d at 321, 323; <em>United States v. Marmolejo, </em>139 F.3d 528, 531 (5th Cir.1998). Spooner has not shown that the denial of a continuance caused him prejudice. <em>United States v. Olaniyi-Oke, </em>199 F.3d 767, 771 (5th Cir.1999). The denial of Spooner\u2019s motion for a continuance was not an abuse of discretion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">Spooner contends for the first time on appeal that prior to his resentencing, the district court did not grant him the right of allocution. Spooner asserts that if he had been allowed to allocute, he would have asked the district court to reconsider the use of his prior convictions in determining his criminal history category, he would have challenged the restitution order, and he would have requested a downward departure based on his bi-polar disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">We review Spooner\u2019s argument for plain error. <em>United States v. Reyna, </em>358 F.3d 344, 351 (5th Cir.) <em>(en banc), cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 1626, 158 L.Ed.2d 243 (2004). Although the denial of the right to allocution in the instant case was plain error that is presumed to have affected substantial rights, we decline to exercise our discretion to correct the error because the error did not \u201c \u2018seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 352-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-11\">Spooner challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for release pending appeal of the judgment on resentencing. We rejected Spooner\u2019s motion for release pending appeal of the resentencing judgment initially and on reconsideration, and we will not reopen what we have already decided. <em>See United States v. Phipps, </em>368 F.3d 505, 511 n. 3 (5th Cir.2004); <em>United States v. Spooner, </em>No. 04-30255 (5th Cir. May 14, 2004 and June 8, 2004) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-12\">Spooner asserts that the district court did not comply with the remand opinion. He argues that the district court should have resentenced him \u201cas if [he] had not been sentenced (at all).\u201d He asserts that the district court should have addressed all of his arguments concerning the use of his prior convictions, the restitution award, and his reasons for mitigation of punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-13\">\u201c \u2018[O]nly those discrete, particular issues identified by the appeals court for remand are properly before the resentencing court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lee, </em>358 F.3d at 321 (citation omitted). The district court properly refused to consider the issues asserted by Spooner that were not related to the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 issue specified in the remand opinion. <em>See id. </em>at 321, 323.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-14\">Spooner does not challenge in his initial brief the district court\u2019s finding on resentencing that the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 increase applied for obstruction of justice increase was not clearly erroneous. Accordingly, Spooner has abandoned any challenge to the district court\u2019s findings at resentencing. <em>See United States v. Narviz-Guerra, </em>148 F.3d 530, 537 n. 3 (5th Cir.1998) (issue that is not briefed is abandoned). We do not consider Spooner\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 findings which are raised for the first time in Spooner\u2019s reply brief. <em>United States v. Hoster, </em>988 F.2d 1374, 1383 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>Finally, Spooner asserts that his sentence was imposed in violation of <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). Spooner\u2019s argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>377 F.3d 464, 466 (5th Cir.2004), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. July 14, 2004) (No. 04-5263).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b386-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
