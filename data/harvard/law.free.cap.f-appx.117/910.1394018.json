Relying on <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), Swiney argues that he was sentenced based on a drug quantity determination that was not based on his admitted conduct or determined by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Swiney has acknowledged that this court\u2019s recent decision in <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>377 F.3d 464, 465-66 (5th Cir.2004), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. July 14, 2004) (No. 04-5263), forecloses this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-22\">Swiney also argues that the district corut erred by attributing to him the amounts of cocaine base sold by his co-defendants. See U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3. He argues that the Government failed to establish that he agreed to a jointly undertaken criminal activity or that his co-defendants\u2019 drug sales were within the scope of any such agreement. We review a district court\u2019s drug-quantity finding for clear er<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>ror. <em>United States v. Schorovsky, </em>202 F.3d 727, 729 (5th Cir.2000). The district court did not clearly err in finding that Swiney was engaged in a jointly undertaken criminal activity and that the other gang members\u2019 drug sales were reasonably foreseeable acts in furtherance of this activity. <em>See </em>\u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">Swiney also challenges the Government\u2019s method of calculating the amount of drugs attributed to each defendant. The district court is not limited to the actual quantity of drugs seized but may estimate the quantity of drugs attributable to the defendant. <em>See United States v. Medina, </em>161 F.3d 867, 876 (5th Cir.1998). Facts contained in the PSR are considered reliable and may be adopted without further inquiry if they have an adequate evidentiary basis and the defendant fails to present rebuttal evidence. <em>See United States v. Huerta, </em>182 F.3d 361, 364 (5th Cir.1999). We conclude that the district court did not clearly err in adopting the facts contained in the PSR and presented at sentencing; these facts had an adequate evidentiary basis and, although he challenged the Government\u2019s version of the facts, Swiney failed to present any evidence in rebuttal.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-5\">Swiney also asserts that the district court erred by imposing a two-level enhancement for possession of a dangerous weapon. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l). The district court\u2019s decision to apply \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) is a factual determination subject to review for clear error. <em>United States v. Devine, </em>934 F.2d 1325, 1339 (5th Cir.1991). We conclude that the district court did not clearly err in determining that Swiney could reasonably foresee his co-conspirators\u2019 possession of firearms as tools of the drug-trafficking trade. <em>United States v. Aguileras-Zapata, </em>901 F.2d 1209, 1215 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-6\">Swiney also argues that the district court erred by finding him ineligible for a two-level reduction under the \u201csafety valve\u201d provisions of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(6). As part of his plea agreement, Swiney waived \u201cthe right to appeal his sentence on any ground,\u201d with certain exceptions that are inapplicable here. Swiney was properly advised of the terms of this waiver at rearraignment, and we conclude that he agreed to the waiver knowingly and voluntarily. <em>See United States v. Portillo, </em>18 F.3d 290, 292 (5th Cir.1994); Fed. R.CrimP. ll(b)(l)(N). Therefore, we will uphold the waiver provision and we not consider this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b939-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
