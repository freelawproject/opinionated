Citing <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), <em>Ring v. Arizona, </em>536 U.S. 584, 122 S.Ct. 2428, 153 L.Ed.2d 556 (2002), and <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Martinez-Esparza contends that his sentence was imposed under the United States Sentencing Guidelines in violation of his Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial and his Fifth Amendment right to a grand jury indictment. Martinez-Esparza also argues that his judgment of conviction must be vacated because the federal carjacking statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2119, is an unconstitutional extension of Congress\u2019s power to regulate interstate commerce under the Commerce Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-24\">As Martinez-Esparza acknowledges, his arguments are foreclosed by this court\u2019s decisions in <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>377 F.3d 464, 473 (5th Cir.2004) (holding that <em>Blakely </em>has no effect on the United States Sentencing Guidelines), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(U.S. July 14, 2004) (No. 04-5263), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number>and <em>United States v. Jimenez, </em>323 F.3d 320, 322 (5th Cir.) (upholding the constitutionality of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2119), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 847,124 S.Ct. 124,157 L.Ed.2d 86 (2003). Accordingly, Martinez-Esparza\u2019s conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1012-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
