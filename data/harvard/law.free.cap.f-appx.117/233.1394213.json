He was sentenced as an armed career criminal to 180 months in prison. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1) (2000), <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines </em>\u00a7 4B1.4 (2003). Allen now appeals. His attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising two claims but stating that, in his opinion, there are no meritorious issues for review. Allen was notified of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but did not file such a brief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">Allen and another man led the police on a traffic chase after they were observed stealing merchandise from a Home Depot in Shallotte, North Carolina. The men fled the vehicle, and Allen was apprehended moments later. He had on his person a loaded revolver and ten rounds of ammunition. It is undisputed that Allen had three prior convictions for violent felonies. Allen pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm. He was sentenced as an armed career criminal to fifteen years in prison \u2014 the lowest possible sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">Allen first contends that, because he was not committing a violent felony when he was arrested, he was not subject to the enhanced sentence. We reject this claim. First, neither \u00a7 922(g)(1) nor \u00a7 924(e)(1) states that enhancement is appropriate only when the possession occurs in connection with the commission of a violent crime. Second, courts routinely sentence defendants as armed career criminals when no violence surrounds the \u00a7 922(g) offense. <em>See United States v. Wardwick, </em>350 F.3d 446, 454 (4th Cir. 2003), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 1730, 158 L.Ed.2d 412 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">Allen also claims that, because the indictment did not allege the three predicate violent felonies, the \u00a7 924(e)(1) enhancement violates <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). We specifically rejected such a claim in <em>United States v. Lomax, </em>293 F.3d 701, 704 n. 1 (4th Cir. 2002); <em>see also United States v. Sterling, </em>283 F.3d 216, 219-20 (4th Cir.2002). The Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), does not impact our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-12\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b262-13\">We accordingly affirm. In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have examined the entire record and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm Allen\u2019s conviction and sentence. We deny counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw at this time. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, counsel may then move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. The motion for summary affirmance is denied as moot. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
