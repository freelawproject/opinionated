For the reasons discussed below, we deny the petition for review.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-13\">The decision to grant or deny asylum relief is conclusive \u201cunless manifestly contrary to the law and an abuse of discretion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(D) (2000). We have reviewed the immigration judge\u2019s decision and the administrative record and find the record supports the conclusion Khan failed to establish past persecution or a well founded fear of persecution. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a) (2004) (stating that the burden of proof is on the alien to establish his eligibility for asylum); <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). Because the decision in this case is not manifestly contrary to law, we cannot grant the relief Khan and his family seek.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-16\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-17\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b331-14\"> The Petitioners do not challenge the immigration judge\u2019s denial of the applications for withholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
