Laue challenges his continued incarceration in administrative segregation despite his renunciation of his gang membership. This court reviews dismissals under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A <em>de novo. Velasquez v. Woods, </em>329 F.3d 420, 421 (5th Cir.2003). A complaint may be dismissed as frivolous \u201cif it lacks any arguable basis in law or fact.\u201d <em>Harris v. Hegmann, </em>198 F.3d 153, 156 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">Because Laue has alleged that his placement in administrative segregation was not based on his initial classification, review is under the familiar test of <em>Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995). <em>See Wilkerson v. Stalder, </em>329 F.3d 431, 436 (5th Cir.2003), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 966, 124 S.Ct. 432, 157 L.Ed.2d 310 (2003). We will assume <em>arguendo </em>that Laue\u2019s eight years of confinement in administrative segregation constitutes an \u201catypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.\u201d <em>Sandin, </em>515 U.S. at 484.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">The ultimate question is whether a prisoner was afforded the process he was due under the Constitution. <em>See Sandin, </em>515 U.S. at 483-84. Laue\u2019s pleadings do not specifically allege how the prison\u2019s review procedures were insufficient. However, the grievances he submitted reflect that prison officials have investigated his renunciation of his gang membership, that officials have determined his renunciation to be valid, and that he is awaiting placement in a special program for former gang members. We conclude that Laue\u2019s corn-plaint does not reflect that he has been denied due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b393-40\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
