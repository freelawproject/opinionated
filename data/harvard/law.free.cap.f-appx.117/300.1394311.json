To obtain reversal of a determination denying eligibility for relief, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude Theo-Harding fails to show the evidence compels a contrary result. Accordingly, we cannot grant the relief TheoHarding seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-11\">In addition, we conclude Theo-Harding\u2019s claim that the Board\u2019s use of the summary affirmance procedure under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4) (2004) violated his rights under the Due Process Clause is foreclosed by our decision in <em>Blanco de Belbruno v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 272 (4th Cir.2004). In <em>Blanco de Belbruno, </em>we held that \u201cthe BIA\u2019s streamlining regulations do not violate an alien\u2019s rights to due process of law under the Fifth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 283.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-13\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-14\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
