The district court dismissed Thomas\u2019 complaint in an order entered on March 16, 2004. Thomas\u2019 notice of appeal was filed in the district court on June 22, 2004. In that notice of appeal, Thomas stated he did not receive notice of the district court\u2019s March 16, 2004 order until June 7, 2004, and he sought to appeal from that order. Because Thomas\u2019 notice of appeal asserted that he did not timely receive notice of the district court\u2019s order and also expressed his desire to preserve his appeal, his notice of appeal should be construed as a request to reopen the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). <em>See Myers v. Stephenson, </em>781 F.2d 1036, 1038-39 (4th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-25\">Pursuant to <em>Houston v. Lack, </em>487 U.S. 266, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988), a document is considered filed when delivered to prison officials for mailing to the court. Because Thomas\u2019 request to reopen the appeal period was filed in the district court shortly after the expiration of the seven-day period for filing such a request and the record does not reveal when Thomas gave the document to prison officials, we remand the case to the district court for the limited purpose of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>determining whether Thomas\u2019 request to reopen the appeal period was timely filed under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6)(A). If so, the district court should then consider whether to reopen the appeal period. The record, as supplemented, then will be returned to this court for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">\n<em>REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
