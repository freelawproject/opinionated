The district court denied the motion on its merits. Because Paige is not a party to or an intervenor in the proceeding filed by his relatives, he lacks standing to challenge that decision on appeal. <em>Davis v. Scott, </em>176 F.3d 805 (4th Cir.1999) (holding that federal prisoner did not have standing to appeal dismissal of habeas corpus petition filed by his wife \u201con behalf of\u2019 her husband). Accordingly, we dismiss Paige\u2019s appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
