Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992)). We have reviewed the administrative record, the immigration judge\u2019s decision, and the Board\u2019s order and find substantial evidence supports the conclusion that Hassen failed to establish the past persecution or well-founded fear of future persecution necessary to establish eligibility for asylum. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a) (2004) (stating that the burden of proof is on the alien to establish eligibility for asylum); Eli<em>as-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 483, 112 S.Ct. 812 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">Next, we uphold the Board\u2019s denial of Hassen\u2019s application for withholding of removal. The standard for withholding of removal is \u201cmore stringent than that for asylum eligibility.\u201d <em>Chen v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 198, 205 (4th Cir.1999). An applicant for withholding must demonstrate a clear probability of persecution. <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987). As Hassen failed to establish refugee status, she cannot satisfy the higher standard necessary for withholding.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Furthermore, we conclude substantial evidence supports the determination that Hassen did not establish it was more likely than not that she would be tortured if removed to Ethiopia, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2004), and thus, that Has-sen\u2019s petition for protection under the CAT was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">Accordingly, we deny Hassen\u2019s petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
