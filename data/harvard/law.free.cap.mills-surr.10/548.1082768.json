Negotiations were had for settlement, in the course of which a paper was signed by plaintiff and defendant\u2019s testator to the effect that decedent was of unsound mind at the time of the execution of her will, and that the estate should be distributed as if testatrix had died intestate. This was followed by a conversation between plaintiff and defendant\u2019s testator in which, plaintiff asserts, a guaranty was made to him of the interest he claimed in the estate. Plaintiff did not appear on the day to which the probate had been adjourned, and the surrogate, refusing to recognize the paper referred to, admitted the will to probate. Plaintiff brings action to recover for breach of the alleged agreement to guarantee to him his distributive share of the estate in controversy. <em>Held, </em>on examination of the facts, that the question whether or not the agreement was made on the assumption by the parties that the surrogate would refuse probate of the will on the writing which had been signed by them, was the issue in the case and it was for the jury to say which inference was justified by the evidence.</headnotes>\n<history data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b573-4\"><em>Schoonmaker </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>148 App. Div. 908, reversed.</history>\n<otherdate data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b573-5\">(Submitted April 2, 1913;</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Acq-\">decided April 22, 1913.)</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b573-6\">Appeal from a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the third judicial department, entered January 12, 1912, affirming a judgment in favor of defendants entered upon a dismissal of the complaint by the court at a Trial Term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b573-7\">The plaintiff and the defendants\u2019 testator were two of the heirs at law and next of kin of Lucena Briggs, deceased, and as such would each have been entitled to one-eighth of her estate if she had died intestate. She, however, left an alleged will under which the plaintiff was to receive nothing and the defendants\u2019 testator was to receive substantially one-fourth of the estate after deducting two small legacies of $500 and $300 respectively.- The said testator was named as one of the executors and offered the will for probate in Delaware county. The plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>tiff interposed objections to the probate in Delaware county on the ground that the decedent was a resident of Albany county at the time of her death, and also alleged that the decedent did not possess testamentary capacity at the time of the execution of the instrument offered for probate, and that its execution was procured by the exercise of undue influence. Thereupon, the defendants\u2019 testator undertook to effect a compromise and for that purpose called a family council, at which the plaintiff and all others interested were present except a sister of the decedent and the two legatees who were to receive under the will said sum of $800. It was proposed at that conference not to have the will probated and to distribute the estate as in case of intestacy. The plaintiff said that <em>\u201c </em>it made no difference what arrangement was made if only he got his share with the rest.\u201d The defendants\u2019 testator agreed to satisfy the sister who was not present, and two others agreed to pay the legacies of $800 to the two legatees not present. An agreement having been reached, those present went to a notary to have it put in writing. The defendants\u2019 testator outlined w'hat they, had arranged to do thus: \u201c to distribute the will,\u201d evidently meaning the estate, \u201c the same as if she had died intestate, and that the other heirs was <em>(sic) </em>to share equally.\u201d The notary drew up a writing which recited the death of the alleged testator, the petition for probate of the will, the filing of objections thereto by the plaintiff and concluded thus: \u201c Now it is hereby conceded by the parties interested in the said estate as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b574-5\">\u201c <em>First. </em>That at the time of the death of the said Lucena Rriggs, she was a resident of the County of Delaware, New York.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b574-6\">\u201c <em>Second. </em>That at the time of the execution of the said instrument, the said Lucena Rriggs was incompetent to execute the same and was of unsound mind.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b574-7\">All present signed and acknowledged the paper.

R., what Wlieaton wanted to know is, will you guarantee him his mother\u2019s share of the Lucena Briggs estate the same as if she had died without a will, if he don\u2019t appear in Delhi? \u2019 He says 'I will, if he will stop his lawing, discharge his lawyers, not commence any more actions, not appear at Delhi and let me settle the est\u00e1te in Delaware county.\u2019 Wheaton Schoonmaker says, 'I will do it if you do as you say.\u2019 <em>\u2018 </em>I will,\u2019 says he, \u2018I will, and we will shake hands on it.\u2019 And he stepped up and they shook hands. Then we started on towards Ilavena, and he says, 'I am glad that we have been able to settle this in a way that we can all be friends.\u2019 We got on about where the Wresterlo road strikes the other at the fork of the road, and WTieaton Schoonmaker says, \u2018 Uncle P.

The wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>nesses to the will were then sworn and examined, and a further adjournment taken. A proposed agreement was prepared for the legatees and next of kin to sign according to which the will was to be admitted to probate and the estate distributed as in case of intestacy, and the defendants\u2019 testator took it to have it signed, but upon reflection concluded that, as the surrogate had refused to recognize the paper previously signed, he would go on with the probate proceedings and decline to recognize the arrangement that had been made as binding. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel was thereupon notified of the conclusion that had been reached, and that on the adjourned day he might if he wished, cross-examine the subscribing witnesses and go on with the contest. This action is brought for breach of the alleged agreement to guarantee the plaintiff \u201chis mother\u2019s share of the Lucena Briggs estate the same as if she had died without a will.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b576-4\">George H.

Y. 40.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b577-4\">Miller, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AVX\">There can be no doubt that there was sufficient consideration to support the agreement. The defendants\u2019 testator was one of the proponents of the will, and as legatee was entitled to virtually one-fourth of the estate. As next of kin he would have received the same as the plaintiff, one-eighth. He wished to avoid the contest, and the plaintiff\u2019s agreement to stop the contest, not to bring any other actions, and to allow him to settle the estate in Delaware county was quite sufficient to support his agreement that the plaintiff should receive the share of the estate which he would have been entitled to in case of intestacy. The agreement was not one to answer for the debt or default of another, as is said by the respondent, but was an original promise. Language used by laymen is not to be interpreted according to its strict legal meaning. It is suggested that the agreement was void as against public policy, but we know of no rule of public policy which prevents those interested in an estate from agreeing upon the manner of its distribution so as to avoid the expense and trouble of litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">The real question in the case was whether the agreement was made on the assumption by the parties to it that the surrogate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>would refuse probate of the will on the writing which had been signed by them, and we are of the opinion that that was a question of fact for the jury. Standing alone, the conversation relied upon was sufficient to establish a valid agreement supported by a sufficient consideration. But, of course, it is to be construed not as an isolated transaction, but as a part of what had preceded it. Thus construed, we think that two possible inferences are permissible, 1, that the promise was exacted and given on the assumption that the surrogate would deny probate on the writing previously signed by the parties, and for the purpose of assuring the plaintiff that the defendants\u2019 testator would not, if the plaintiff did not appear on the adjourned day, undei\u2019take to prove the will regardless of the writing; 2, that the parties, being uncertain whether the writing would prove effectual, the plaintiff exacted, and the defendants\u2019 testator gave, the further promise as an assurance that in any event the plaintiff should receive his distributive share of the estate, the same as in case of intestacy. Of course, on the first inference, there was no breach of contract on the part of the defendants\u2019 testator, as performance was prevented by an act for which he was not responsible. But on the second inference he was answerable to the plaintiff for the latter\u2019s distributive share of the estate as in case of intestacy, whether the writing was approved and acted upon by the surrogate or not. It was for the jury to say which inference was justified by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">The judgment of the Appellate Division and of the trial court should be reversed and a new trial granted, with costs to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Cullen, Ch.
