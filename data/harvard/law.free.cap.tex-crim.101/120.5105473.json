They divided the money, Mr. Sheppard, the alleged owner of the stolen chickens, testified to their loss on the night of January 25, 1925, and that he found some chickens in the possession of Mr. Lucas, one of which he positively identified as being one of those stolen at the time, by means of peculiar markings. Mr. Lucas testified that on the 26th of January he bought a number of Rhode Island Red hens from the defendant and the accomplice above referred to, paying the money to the defendant.
