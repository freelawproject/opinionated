She testifies to the fact which if true are sufficient to show the appellant\u2019s guilt, and w\u00e9 also observe that the record shows that she is corroborated more or less cogently by other witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-14\">By appellant\u2019s first bill of exception he complains of the court\u2019s action in overruling his motion for a new trial, contending that same should have been granted because of newly discovered evidence. We have carefully examined this matter and have concluded that no error is shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-15\">By bill of exception No. 2, appellant complains at the court\u2019s action in refusing his application for a continuance. This application was made on account of the absence of appellant\u2019s leading counsel, and also on account of the absence of certain witnesses by whom appellant expected to prove that the reputation of prosecutrix for truth and veracity is bad. The court\u2019s explanation of this bill shows that appellant\u2019s leading counsel at the time of the trial was in a dying condition and has since the trial departed this life.- The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>record further discloses that capable counsel represented appellant. With reference to the question of the absent witnesses it is sufficient to say that a continuance sought to secure testimony which would be available to impeach a witness who is to testify should ordinarily be refused. See Sect. 324, Branch\u2019s P. C., for many authorities sustaining this proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Complaint is made by bill number four because the county attorney asked prosecutrix this question, 11 after he (meaning the defendant) had intercourse with you, did he carry you anywhere?\u201d The objection stated to this question is that it implies that the defendant had taken the prosecutrix somewhere else and committed a similar offense \"up on her. We do not care to carry the doctrine which prohibits proof of other offenses to any such extreme. The prosecutrix in this ease is shown by the undisputed testimony to be the niece of the appellant and the mere asking of the question of whether or not the defendant had taken her anywhere does not, to our minds imply that he had taken her somewhere for immoral purposes. Besides the court\u2019s qualification shows that the witness had answered before any objection was made to it, and when objection was made, the court sustained the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">Bill No. 5, complains that after the prosecutrix had testified on direct examination,' the defendant asked her the following question on cross-examination: \u201cwill ask you if you did not testify on a former trial of this ease that on or about August 15, 1921, Odom Rosamond came in and caught you and the defendant in the act of intercourse\u201d and the witness answered: \u201cYes, sir, but that was not the time ... It was not this time that I testified about before when I said Odom came in the house and caught us.\u201d It seems to be appellant\u2019s contention that this was a voluntary statement by the witness of other similar offenses committed by the appellant against prosecutrix. We cannot agree with him. This was a legitimate explanation of an answer which unexplained would have reflected on the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">By bill of exception No. 6, complaint Is made because the State asked Odom Rosamond about being at work on a well near the house where this offense is alleged to have happened in the summer of 1921 and about going to the house to get some water and a rag to tie up a wounded finger, and about seeing appellant and prosecutrix in a compromising position at that time. Appellant\u2019s objection to this testimony is first, that on examination in chief the prosecutrix did not mention the act alleged to have been witnessed by Odom Rosamond; second, that in view of the whole testimony of the prosecutrix the introduction of the witness Odom Rosamond touching a different alleged act of intercourse from the one set up by the prosecutrix could serve nb relevant or material purpose; third, that the said objectionable testimony of Odom Rosamond was irrelevant and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>immaterial to any issue in the case. There were various other objections urged to the introduction of this testimony. The court qualifies this bill by stating that the defendant did not object to this testimony of Odom Rosamond. Under this explanation there was of course no error shown by the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">By bill No. 8, complaint is made because the court permitted the State after it had rested to recall the prosecuting witness Thelma Rosamond. This is usually a matter of discretion with the trial court and there is no error shown in the court\u2019s action in connection with this matter, especially in view of his qualification of this bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">What has just been said also disposes of appellant\u2019s bills Nos. 9 and 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">Bill No.. 11, complains at the action of the court in .permitting the State\u2019s counsel to ask appellant\u2019s character witnesses on cross-examination if they had not heard that prior to the indictment in this case that defendant admitted that 'he carried prosecutrix to Terrell and there slept with her in a hotel. This bill of exception is explained by the court as follows: \u201cThe State asked the witness if 'defendant took her any place and she answered, \u201cYes, to Terrell. \u2019\u2019 The defendant objected and the Court sustained his objection, otherwise the bill is correct.\u201d We are not prepared to say that this was not a proper cross-examination of appellant\u2019s witness. The bill of exceptions does not show that defendant had not admitted that he had taken the girl to Terrell and there slept with'her at a hotel. In fact the testimony was not objected to on the ground that no proper predicate had been laid for the asking of this question but his objections went merely to the fact that the time of the Terrell trip was not fixed, that it was immaterial and that it was hearsay, and that it was inflammatory, etc. We cannot do otherwise under the circumstances than hold that no error is shown by this bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">By bill No. 12, complaint is made at the action of the court in permitting the State\u2019s counsel to ask appellant\u2019s character witnesses certain questions. The bill shows that in every instance, the court sustained the objection to the question and answer when it was made. Under this condition of the record no error is shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">The argument of the county attorney as shown by bill No. 13, was proper under the explanation the court makes of the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-10\">We have carefully considered each of appellant\u2019s asssignments in this case and have reached the conclusion that no error is shown in. either of them. It occurrs to us that he enjoyed a fair and impartial trial in this case, and the evidence being sufficient, it is our opinion that the judgment should in all things be affirmed'.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-11\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b337-12\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b338-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>ON MOTION FOR REHEARING</p>\n<author id=\"b338-5\">HAWKINS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"An5\">Appellant\u2019s motion for rehearing questions our former opinion in the disposition of the points raised by bills of exception four, five and eleven. The first bill referred to shows that the court refused to withdraw from the jury prosecutrix\u2019s statement that appellant took her to Terrell. We think appellant\u2019s contention that the statement carried an implication of another act of intercourse is not sound. At most it only showed association with prosecutrix subsequent to the act of carnal knowledge shown by the State in developing its ease in chief. We are not aware of any authority which precludes the State from proving other acts if showing familiarity and association between the parties but falling short of showing another act of intercourse. Battles v. State, 53 Tex, Crim. Rep., 202, 109 S. W. 195; Henard v. State, 47 Tex. Crim. Rep. 168, 82 S. W. 655. Other authorities illustrating the rule are collated under subdivision 4, Sec. 1788, Branch's Ann. P. C. The ruling of the court in this particular must be appraised by the condition existing at the time made and cannot be carried forward and connected with the matters complained of in bill eleven which occurred long subsequent in the development of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">As we understand the record the matter complained of in bill number five arose in this wise: \u2014 \u25a0 Prosecutrix had testified on direct examination to only one act of intercourse. On cross-examination she said when this act occurred no one was present but she and appellant, and that no one else was near at the time. She was then further asked on cross-examination if she had not testified on a former trial that her brother caught them in the act. In response to the latter question she admitted that she had so testified, but explained the apparent contradiction by stating that the time her brother caught them was not the time testified to by her on the present trial. This evidence was drawn out by the appellant, not the State. To have restricted prosecutrix merely to an admission that she had said on a former trial that her brother caught them,\u2014 (which appellant contends should have been done) \u2014 without permitting her to explain the apparent contradiction would have been manifestly unfair to the witness. It is not every reference to, or proof of, more than one act of intercourse which is denounced, the rule being that ordinarily the State should not in developing its case in the first instance make proof of but one such act. As the case develops conditions may arise which make it permissible and proper to show other acts. The present case in the particular mentioned furnishes such an instance. See Crosslin v. State, 90 Tex. Crim. Rep. 467, 235 S. W. 905; Rosamond v. State, 249 S. W. 468; Bradshaw v. State, 82 Tex. Crim. Rep. 351, 198 S. W. 942; Rosamond v. State, 97 Tex. Crim. Rep. 569, 263 S. W. 297.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>Bill of exception number eleven recites that a number of named witnesses were called by appellant and testified to his good reputation as a peaceful, law-abiding citizen and gentleman in the community where he resided. The complaint is that upon cross-examination of these character witnesses the State asked if they had not heard that appellant admitted' taking prosecutrix to Terrell and there sleeping with her at the hotel. The bill seems to be directed at what is supposed to have been the improper asking of the question. It does not set out the answer of any witness in reply thereto. In the charge we notice a paragraph which by name refers to certain of the same witnesses mentioned in the bill and instructs the jury that their evidence on cross-examination to the effect that they had heard that appellant admitted he had gone to Terrell and spent the night in a hotel with prosecutrix was admitted only for the purpose of aiding the jury in passing upon the credit to be given to the testimony of said witnesses and were instructed specifically that they could consider it for no other purpose whatsoever. We observe nothing in the present case which would make inapplicable the rule that when a defendant has put in issue his general reputation thit witnesses introduced by him to support it may not, for the purpose of throwing light upon the weight to be given their testimony, be asked if they had not heard of particular and specific acts upon the part of appellant which would be inconsistent with the character which the witnesses were called-to prove. Underhill on Crim. Evidence, Secs. 81 and 82; Johnson v. State, 92 Tex. Crim. Rep. 582, 241 S. W. 484; Wright v. State, 266 S. W., 783; Thomas v. State, 95 Tex. Crim. Rep. 133, 252 S. W. 1062. We are not prepared to say the court was- in error in permitting* the question complained of to be asked. In view of the fact that the court pertinently limited the effect of the testimony elicited thereby we are of he opinion bill number eleven shows no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">The motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
