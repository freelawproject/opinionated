The facts support the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-14\">Appellant asked for a continuance. There is no bill of exceptions complaining of its refusal. Appellant excepted to the charge of the court for submitting the issue of principals.' The exception is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-15\">Appellant asked a special charge presenting the theory that if the jury believed beyond a reasonable doubt that he transported whisky, or was guilty of acting together with one Tabor as a principal, that they must find and believe beyond a reasonable doubt that he so transported said whisky or acted with said Tabor as a principal, in Gregg County, Texas. This charge was given.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-16\">Our attention is called to the fact that in sentencing appellant his confinement was directed for a period of two years. This is not in conformity with our indeterminate sentence law. The sentence will be reformed so as to direct the confinement of appellant in the penitentiary for a period of not less than one nor more than two years, and as reformed the judgment in all things will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-17\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b664-18\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b664-19\">LATTIMORE, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"A6Dt\">As stated in our original opinion, the action of the trial court in refusing the. continuance was not excepted to. The refusal of such continuance is made the basis for</p>\n<p id=\"b665-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>this motion. Further inspection of the record makes it doubtful as to whether said motion was ever brought to the attention of the court below. There is no order or judgment of the court overruling same. Appellant is in no position to contest the correctness of the refusal of said continuance. .</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">The motion for rehearing will be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
