There was a quantity of manufactured whiskey at the still. A \u2022 small boy of appellant\u2019s was present at the time. The officers went . to the house of appellant and informed him that they had found his still, and he remarked that they did not catch him there. One of the officers said that they would go back and get appellant\u2019s boy \u2022 who was operating it, whereupon appellant said to them, \u201cLet the . boy alone, it is mine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">Appellant\u2019s first bill of exceptions complains of the overruling of his application for a continuance, but as qualified by the court we think no error shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">The next complaint is of the reception on the statement of appellant above set out. It is contended in the bill that appellant was under arrest at the time. The learned trial judge states in his qualification to the bill that he is of opinion that appellant was not under arrest, but he submitted the question to the jury in the charge. Substantially the same complaint appears in bill of .exceptions No. 3. In our opinion the testimony was admissible as a part of the res gestae of the transaction, and in such case it was immaterial whether the accused was under arrest or not. In Bell v. State, 92 Texas Crim. Rep. 342, a similar statement made under much the same circumstances, was held admissible. See also Coburn v. State, 96 Texas Crim. Rep. 25, where the accused made a statement, when whiskey was found in the back of a car, that it was his. See also Broz v. State, 93 Texas Crim. Rep. 137; Hill v. State, 96 Texas Crim. Rep. 364; Qualls v. State, 97 Texas Crim. Rep. 406; Calloway v. State, 244 S. W. Rep. 551.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">There are several exceptions to the charge of the court. We think the facts such as called for the submission of the case to the jury upon the law of principals. The still was on appellant\u2019s place, and about three hundred yards from his dwelling; track of a sled in which water had been hauled led from appellant\u2019s well down to the still. A little boy nine or ten years of age was at the still and attending to it at the time it was discovered.' He was the son of appellant. It would be so contrary to human experience to think that a mere child such as this could initiate and operate a still as to make it unbelievable. There is no suggestion that any one other than appellant was connected with the child. In the statement made to the officers, when they threatened to go and take the boy, appellant said, \u201cLet him alone, it is mine.\u201d This fully justified the submission of the law of principals.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>It is true that in the case of Bingham v. State, 262 S. W. Rep. 749, we discussed at length the rules applicable to the question of reception of statements made by the accused when under arrest and the submission of that issue to the jury. In our opinion this question passes out of the instant case because of our conclusion that the evidence was admissible as res gestae regardless of whether or not the accused was under arrest. These are the two issues briefed by The appellant, and are the only ones deemed necessary by us to discuss.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">Believing the appellant has had a fair trial, and that no error appears in the record, the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b29-7\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b29-8\">LATTIMORE, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AH\">Appellant makes an able and ingenious argument against the correctness of our conclusion that his statement to officer Griggs, \u201cLeave the boy alone, it is mine\u201d, was res gestae. We might observe in passing that our uniform holding is that if testimony be of a res gestae statement of the accused, the fact of his being under arrest would not suffice to reject it. Branch\u2019s Ann. P. C., p. 52 for authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-9\">\u2022 Mr. Underhill in the third edition of his valuable work on Criminal Evidence, p. 218, devotes Chap. 16 to a discussion of res gestae, and, among other things, after apparently drawing a distinction between the doctrine as applicable to a crime which consists of a single act, such as murder, rape, etc., and one which involves a continuity of acts, such as the crime before us, says: \u201cNo general rule can be enunciated as to what declarations do or do not constitute a part of the res gestae. The main question is, \u2014 are they relevant to and do they explain and illustrate the facts of the transaction in issue.\u201d Again, on page 221 of said work it is said: \u201cThe spontaneous unpremeditated character of the declarations, and the fact that they seem to be the natural and necessary concomitants of some relevant transaction in which their author was a participant, constitute the basis for their admission as evidence. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b29-10\">The case before us is one for making whiskey. The officers found a still in operation on appellant\u2019s premises a short distance from his house. His nine year old son was at the still and doing some things connected therewith. Sled tracks went from appellant\u2019s well to the still and a sled was found there. After finding these things the officers went to appellant\u2019s house and said, \u201cWell, we found your still.\u201d Appellant said, \u201cYou didn\u2019/t catch me down there.\u201d The officers then said they would go back and get the boy whom they had caught making it, and appellant said, \u201cLet the boy alone; it is mine.\u201d Under the facts of this case the statement of appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>seems natural, spontaneous, and instinctive. He was confronted with, the fact that a crime was being committed on his premises and in juxtaposition to his home and that his nine-year-old boy was connected with it. He made the statement complained of. No leading 'questions were put to him, and no suggestion or threats of any character appear. He made an evasive statement, and upon the officers appearing to accept it and as they were about to start back to where they had left the boy, etc., the facts and the truth of1 the situation spoke through appellant and he said \u201cLet him alone, it is mine.\u201d We see no reason to conclude our former holding in this regard in anywise erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">The motion for rehearing will be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
