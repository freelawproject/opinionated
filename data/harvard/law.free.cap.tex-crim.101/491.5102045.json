The bill shows that appellant was out on bond from the time the indictment was returned, and that his- request to be served with a certified copy was immediately complied with by the clerk. Where the appellant is under bond he is entitled to a copy of the indictment if-he makes request for the same, but he is not entitled to have granted him two full days after receiving same before he can be forced to trial. Art. 533, Vernon\u2019s C. C. P; Johnson v. State, 4 Tex. Crim. App. 268; Abrigo v. State, 29 Tex. Crim. App. 143.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-14\">Appellant sought to quash the jury panel under an allegation that the court had instructed the jury commissioners not to summon as jurors certain persons, and second because the -panel was not full and that it had been the custom in that county for the last several terms of the court to allow jurors drawn by the jury commissioners to fail to attend court. The court qualifies this bill by stating that the first paragraph is not true and by saying that there was no evidence introduced before the court to show that any of the facts alleged in paragraph two of this motion are true. Under these circumstances no error is shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>Appellant moved to quash the indictment because it did not contain any of the exceptions named in the statute, and did not allege the kind of intoxicating liquor manufactured and also because it did not allege how same was manufactured, or whether by fermentation or distillation. It is not necessary to negative the exceptions contained in the statute and has been so held many times by this court. Neither is it necessary to name the kind of intoxicating liquor, nor to allege how the same was manufactured. We have been cited to no authority, and know of none, placing any such burden on the State. Travinio v. State, 92 Tex. Crim. Rep. 140.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">By various bills of exception, appellant complains that the court permitted certain peace officers who appeared as witnesses for the State, to testify as to a barrel found oh the premises of the defendant containing mash. His objection being to the effect that they were not qualified to give an opinion as to the contents of this barrel. The court qualifies this biR by saying that the witnesses testified that they had seen mash prior to that time and that in their judgment it was mash. Appellant\u2019s objections go more to the weight that to the admissibility of the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Appellant complains that after the sheriff of Denton County testified that he was told that a jug of whiskey was buried on the premises of defendant, that thereupon defendant asked the witness to State the name of the party who gave him the information and that this question was objected to upon the ground that the sheriff did no have to disclose information which led to the arrest of bootleggers, and the court sustained the objection. The bill of exception fails to disclose what the sheriff\u2019s answer would have been if he had been permitted to testify, and in the absence of this information this court is without power to determine whether the exclusion of the testimony was harmful to the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">What we have said with reference to appellant\u2019s motion to quash the indictment disposes of his contention as raised by bill of exception No. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">The court gave a correct charge on circumstantial evidence and appellant\u2019s complaint with reference thereto is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">By bill of exception No. 8, appellant complains at the court's failure to charge the jury that if they believed beyond a reasonable doubt that whiskey was found on the premises of the defendant, but had a reasonable doubt as to who placed the same on the premises to acquit the appellant. This matter was presented in paragraph three of the court\u2019s main charge to the jury..</p>\n<p id=\"b511-10\">The court's qualification to bill number nine is entirely sufficient to show that no error was committed in the argument complained of.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-11\">Having carefully examined the entire record, it is our opinion that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>the appellant has had a fair trial in the case, and that the judgment of the lower court should be in all things affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b512-7\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b512-8\">LATTIMORE, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AsU\">Appellant was indicted on the 13th of June, and from the record we infer that he was arrested and gave bond the same day. His case was called for trial on July 1st, following. He had been out on bond for more than two weeks. In this condition of the record we do not think the learned trial judge erred, after having directed that a copy of the indictment be delivered to appellant or his attorney, in refusing to postpone the case two days in which to give appellant time to prepare for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">. The record so completely refutes appellant\u2019s contention in regard to his motion to quash the jury panel, that we think the matter sufficiently treated in our original opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-10\">Whiskey was found on appellant\u2019s premises and also paraphernalia useful in its manufacture; also a quantity of mash. Various witnesses who examined the mash said it was made of prunes, apricots, meal, corn chops and water. An analysis of same by a chemist showed the presence in it of a considerable percentage of alcohol. We do not deem it a reversible error to permit witnesses who had seen other mash to testify that this was mash.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-11\">Appellant complains of our disposition of his bill of exceptions No. 5. It is revealed thereby that he placed the sheriff of the county on the witness stand and asked him if it was not a fact that some one told him that a jug of whiskey was buried at the place or near same where the deputy sheriffs had testified that they found on appellant\u2019s premises a jug of whiskey, to which the sheriff answered \u201cYes\u201d, that he was told that a jug of whiskey was buried on appellant\u2019s premises where this jug of whiskey was found. The bill further discloses that appellant also asked the witness to state the name of the party who gave him this information, which question on objection of the State, was not answered. In the absence of some showing of a reason why an answer to the question would have been of benefit to the appellant, we felt justified in upholding the learned trial judge\u2019s disposition of this matter upon the ground that the bill failed to disclose what the answer of the witness would have been. We are not led to conclude our former opinion in error in this matter. 1</p>\n<p id=\"b512-12\">Believing the case correctly decided, the motion for rehearing will be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-13\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
