Motley, who was then and there under the age of twenty-five years, seduce and have carnal knowledge of such female,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">The Legislature, having in mind evidently that such a question might be raised as contended for by the appellant in this case, and in order to avoid any confusion over such .matters, took the precaution to define what was meant by \u201cseduction\u201d in passing Art. 1448, Vernon\u2019s P. C., which is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-6\">\u201cThe term \u2018seduction\u2019 is used in the sense in which it is commonly understood. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">In the case of Slaughter v. State, 86 Tex. C. Rep., 527, Presiding Judge Morrow, in a very extensive opinion, citing many authorities in and out of this State, in the writer\u2019s opinion covers the complaint made in the instant case, and in the case supra cites an Oklahoma case, in which the statute of that State is like ours, and quotes this language.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-8\">\u201cNow, there are but two things that he is charged with doing, namely, promising* to marry the prosecutrix, and having* illicit connection with her. The other two elements of the offense go to the character of the person protected by the law, namely, an unmarried female, and one of chaste character. * * * * Hence, we think the purpose of the statute is to require the prosecutrix to be corroborated on the promise of marriage and the illicit intercourse, and not upon the elements that go alone to her characteristics\u201d\u2014 citing 11 Okla. Rep. 156, and also-cites a Mississippi case as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AlIH\">\u201cWhen she is supported as to the promise of marriage and the act of sexual intercourse \u2014 the two great fundamental essentials \u2014 the corroboration, we think, will be sufficient.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-10\">We are of the opinion that the Slaughter case, supra, is an authority against the contention of the appellant in this instance and settles the contention against him with reference to the sufficiency of the corroboration of the evidence in the instant case,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-11\">Appellant complains of the action of the court in overruing his motion for continuance, which is in the usual form for a first application, seeking a continuance for the want of the testimony of Mrs. Cornell. The State controverted the diligence and contested said motion, and in said contest alleged that it was not the first application for continuance but was the second application; and the court, after hearing the motion and the contest on same, in overruling said application found against the defendant, and we are not prepared to say that same was error from the record before us. The contest shows that there was a period of about fifty-one days from the arrest of the defendant until the process for said' witness was obtained, in addition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>to other grounds showing a want of diligence. We hold that there was no error in the court\u2019s action in this particular.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-3\">Appellant complains of the court\u2019s action in permitting the prosecutrix to testify that she would not have permitted the defendant to hug and kiss her and in permitting her to testify that no man besides the defendant had carnal knowledge of her prior to the date of the offense and that she would not have submitted to such conduct had she not relied on his promise of marriage. We think there was no error in the court\u2019s action in this particular.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">There is also complaint upon his part to the court\u2019s admitting in evidence letters which the prosecutrix'testified she had received from the appellant, of a very endearing nature, and which one of the State\u2019s witnesses also testified to having read, upon the ground that there was no proof of the execution of said letters as a basis for said testimony. The court, in qualifying and explaining these bills, states that there was no such objection raised to this testimony until it was called to his attention by a special charge and in the motion for new trial. In-view of said explanation, there was no error in the admission of said testimony. The defendant did not testify in the case, and doubtless if this question had been raised at the time the evidence was admitted the court would have required proof as to the author of same before admitting them.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">We have not seen fit to discuss all of the bills in the record, but we have carefully considered same, and, after a careful consideration of the entire record, we fail to see any error in the trial of said case, and believe that the defendant has had a fair and impartial trial, and that the judgment of the lower court should be and is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b260-8\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b260-9\">HAWKINS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqhs\">In his motion for rehearing appellant with . much vigor renews his attack upon the indictment asserting its invalidity for failure to allege the \u201cprevious chaste character\u201d of the injured female.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-10\">An exhaustive review of the authorities from many states discloses some lack of harmony upon the point, at the same time revealing that in most instances the conflict is apparent rather than real.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-11\">Where by statute the offense of seduction is described as one against a female of \u2018 \u2018 previous - chaste character\u201d it is generally held that such element is descriptive of the offense and that the indictment must contain an averment of such fact. State v. Kelley, 245 Mo. 489, 43 L. R. A. 476. See People v. Roderigas, 49 Cal. 9; People v. Krusick, 93 Cal. 74, 28 Pac. 794; State v. Temmens, 4 Minn. 325; State v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>DeWitt, 186 Mo. 61, 84 S. W., 956; People v. Weinstock, 140 N. Y. Supp. 453. Where by statute the offense is defined to be against a female \u201cof good repute\u201d it is held essential that the indictment contain an averment of the female\u2019s good reputation. State v. Hill, 91 Mo. 423, 4 S. W., 121; Oliver v. Commonwealth, 101 Pa. 215; Zabriskie v. State, 43 J. J. L. 640, 39 Am. Rep. 610; Hay v. State, (Indiana) 98 N. E. 712.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">Our own statute, Art. 505 P. C. Revision 1925, formerly 1447, P. \u2022 C., provides that \u201cIf any person, by promise to marry, shall seduce an unmarried female under the age of tiventy-five years, and shall have carnal knowledge of such female, he shall be punished, etc.\u201d It will be observed that \u201cprevious chaste character\u201d nor \u201cformer good repute\u201d enter into the definition of the offense by statutory provision. Under statutes similar to ours in this respect it has been held unnecessary to allege in the indictment that the female was of previous chaste character. Caldwell v. State, 73 Ark. 139; 83 S. W. 929; Kerr v. U. S. 7 Ind. Ter. 486, 104 S. W., 809; People v. Bremer, 27 Mich., 134; Ferguson v. State, 71 Miss. 805; State v. Andre, 5 Iowa, 389; 68 Am. Dec. 708; State v. Hemns, 82 Iowa 609; Wilson v. State, 73 Ala. 527; State v. Turner, 82 S. C. 278, 64 S. E. 424.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">Under State v. Kelley reported in 43 L. R. A. 476, (New Series) will be found an exhaustive note covering many pages, dealing with the subject under consideration with voluminous reference to authorities. To review them would be tedious and unprofitable. Examination of them, we think, will reveal the conclusions stated by us to be correct as touching the state of the decisions in the various jurisdictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">We are confirmed in the opinion that under our own statute defining seduction the pleader is not called upon to allege in the indictment charging such offense that the female was of previous chaste character.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">The motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-10\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
