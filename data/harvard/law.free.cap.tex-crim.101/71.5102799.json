The appellant being convicted of a felony, and the verdict of guilty being on two separate counts, assessing more than double the minimum penalty, renders same uncertain as to whether the. jury intended to punish appellant upon each count in the indictment at sixty days in jail on each count or for sixty days only for both counts. If it was intended for the former the penalty would aggregate one hundred twenty days, and if the latter sixty days.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">This uncertainty we think requires a reversal of this case. Williams v. State, delivered May 14th, 1925, unreported. Venturi v. State, delivered May 14th, 1925, unreported. Nelson v. State, 261 S. W. 1046; Modica v. State, 251 S. W. 1049; Banks v. State, 257 S. W. 283; Rambo v. State, 258 S. W. 827. While we believe the statute in question embraces only one felony, describing two means of its violation yet we believe the authorities supra cover the questions herein discussed, and covers the principles herein announced. The court should not have instructed the jury to find a verdict in both counts nor have received such a verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">For the reasons above stated, the judgment of the trial court is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
