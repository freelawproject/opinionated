The third bill of exceptions sets out the fact that after leaving the witness stand appellant was recalled by the district attorney who asked him the question: \u201cYou 'didn\u2019t testify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>in the examining trial of this case, did you f \u201d to which the defendant answered, \u201cNo, sir\u201d. The bill shows that to this question and answer objection was made and exception taken as being violative of the law forbidding reference to the failure of the accused to testify.

Rep. 619, holding it improper to ask the accused whether he had testified at a hearing on habeas corpus at a former time, also Brown v. State, 57 Texas Crim. Rep. 269, holding it reversible error for the prosecuting attorney to ask the accused whether he had testified on a former trial, even though the court on request withdrew the matter from the consideration of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Por the error mentioned the judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
