Punishment is two years in the penitentiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">There appears in the record what purports to be objections to the charge given by the court. There is nothing to show when, if at all, they were ever presented to the court. They bear no authentication whatever of the trial judge. In such condition they cannot be com sidered. Salter v. State, 78 Tex. Crim. Rep. 325, 180 S. W. 691; Castleberry v. State, 88 Tex. Crim. Rep. 502, 228 S. W. 216, Rhodes v. State, 93 Tex. Crim. Rep. 574, 248 S. W. 679<em>.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">The sheriff and two of his deputies stopped a car being driven by appellant\u2019s companion. \u2022 Upon being asked by the sheriff what they had appellant replied, \u201cThese are my belongings; I will show them to you right now, \u2019 \u2019 whereupon he pulled from the back seat of the car a loaded shotgun. The sheriff seized hold of the gun and in the scuffle over it he fell to the ground. One of the deputies fired at appellant several times with a pistol. Appellant escaped and was not arrested until two or three days later. In the car was found one hundred and twenty-four quarts of tequila. The evidence is positive that it is intoxicating.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">In view of such proof we see. no occasion for giving the special charges requested defining \u201cintoxicating liquor\u201d and advising the jury what was meant by spirituous-, vinous and malt liquor. Tucker v. State, 94 Tex. Crim. Rep. 505, 251 S. W. 1090.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-11\">We observe in passing sentence upon appellant he was not given the benefit of the \u201cIndeterminate Sentence\u201d law but was sentenced to the penitentiary for two years. The sentence is reformed to read that he will serve not less than one nor more than two years in the penitentiary, and as thus reformed the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-12\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b406-13\">ON MOTION EOR REHEARING.-</p>\n<author id=\"b406-14\">HAWKINS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"Adr\">No brief for appellant was on file when our ' opinion was written, and' none was presented until upon motion for' rehearing. The point upon which reliance is had to reverse the judgment escaped us. The indictment charged- the transportation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>\u201cspirituous, vinous and malt liquors capable of producing intoxication.\u201d It is admitted by appellant\u2019s attorney that the proof is sufficient to show that the liquor being transported was intoxicating, but the contention is that the State having in the indictment specifically described the liquor as \u201cspirituous, vinous and malt, was required to prove, not only that it was intoxicating, but that it was one of the particular kinds of liquor described, and that the State had failed to do this. Hendley v. State, 94 Tex. Crim. Rep. 40, 250 S. W. 174. The evidence only refers to the liquor as \u201ctequila\u201d, one of the witnesses more than once called it \u201cspiritual\u201d liquor. Upon being asked what he meant by calling it \u201cspiritual\u201d, he^said he meant \u201cit would make you drunk\u201d. There is no evidence as to what \u201ctequila\u201d is nor how it is made, whether distilled, brewed or fermented, and' unless in the absence of such evidence this court can have judicial knowledge that \u201ctequila\u201d is either a spirituous, vinous or malt liquor, it appears that appellant\u2019s contention must be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">\u201cJudicial notice or knowledge may be defined as the cogizance of certain facts which judges and jurors may properly take and act upon without proof because they already know them. It is said that the term judicial notice\u2019 means no more than that the court will bring to its aid and' consider, without proof of the facts, its knowledge of those matters of public concern which are known by all well-informed people.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Corpus Juris, \u00a71807, Vol. 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">\u201cCourts may properly take judicial notice of facts that may be regarded as forming part of the common knowledge of every person of ordinary understanding and intelligence. Other common statements of the rule are that the courts will takes notice of whatever is, or ought to be, generally known within the limits of their jurisdiction; and that they \u00a1ought not to assume ignorance of, or exclude from their knowledge, matters which are known to all persons of intelligence. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">Corpus Juris, \u00a71810, Vol. 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">We have failed to find any mention of \u201ctequila\u201d in our dictionaries, encyclopedias, or in the standard works on Intoxicating Liquors, such as Black, Joyce or Wollen and Thornton, while the ordinary intoxicants known to us as whiskey, beer and wine are frequently mentioned and discussed. Neither are we advised that information of the source and method of manufacture of \u201ctequila\u201d is so generally known as that it may be said to form the common knowledge of persons of ordinary intelligence. Fjrom the name we might assume that \u201ctequila\u201d was a Mexican liquor, and we know from the evidence it is intoxicating, but applying the rule as to judicial knowledge heretofore stated we cannot assume to know what is its source, nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>how it is made, and therefore cannot know whether it is a spirituous, vinous or malt liquor.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-3\">It was not necessary to charge an offense under the statute for the State to allege that the liquor being transported by appellant was \u201cspirituous, vinous or malt;\u201d other methods of description could have been resorted to under the broad terms of the law (\u00a71, Chap. 22, p. 53, 2d C. S. 38th Leg.); but having chosen to describe it as set out in the indictment we must hold that the State was bound to sustain the description by proof that the liquor came within one Of the kinds designated.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">Having failed to do this it follows that appellant\u2019s motion for rehearing must be granted, the order of affirmance set aside, and the judgment now be reversed and remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b408-6\">on state\u2019s motion por rehearing.</p>\n<author id=\"b408-7\">MORROW, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"A81M\">Responding to the State\u2019s motion for rehearing, we have again reviewed' the legal question presented, namely, Was the averment that the appellant did unlawfully transport spirituous, vinous and malt liquors \u00a1capable of producing intoxication, supported by the evidence? Appellant\u2019s connection with the transportation of a number of bottles of tequila is well supported. It was introduced in evidence before the jury and indentified by a witness who said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-8\">\u201cAs to what is contained in that bottle, well, sir, it\u2019s tequila, spiritual. Yes, sir, it is an intoxicating liquor. Yes, sir, I have tasted' that liquor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">All the bottles identified and produced in the court room contained tequila. The witness was not a chemist. He said, however, that tequila is intoxicating. He also said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-10\">\u201cAs to whether or not it was my intention on direct examination to testify that this liquor was spirituous, I testified that it was tequila; that I tasted\u2019 it, and I said it was spiritual. As to how I know that it was spirituous, well, that\u2019s what it is called. Tequila is the Mexican name for it; it\u2019s a spiritual drink. Well, I don\u2019t know that I can tell this court and jury what is necessary to make that become spirituous liquor; I don\u2019t know whether I can answer that or not. As to whether or not I know that it is spirituous liquor, 'well, I have always been taught that it was, but I couldn\u2019t say whether it is or not. No, \u00a1sir, I do not know whether it is spirituous or not; I\u2019ve always been taught that it was, and that\u2019s the reason I called \"it spiritual, because that\u2019s what I\u2019ve known it to be all the time. * * * I have never seen any tequila manufactured. * * * I do not know of my own knowledge.whether it is spirituous or not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-12\">\u201cWhat is meant on my direct examination by saying that this liquor was spiritual was that it was intoxicating; that\u2019s what I meant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>by it. No, sir, I don\u2019t know whether or not tequila is a wine. Yes, sir, I know what wine iis. Well, yes, tequila might be a wine of some grade, I don\u2019t know, I couldn\u2019t answer that. At to whether or not I think that tequila might be a wine, it might be, I couldn\u2019t tell you. Whatever tequila is, whether spirituous, malt, vinous, or any other kind of liquor, you bet your boots it ,is intoxicating.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-3\">In Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary, p. 2129, in the foot notes, we find the word \u201ctequila\u201d and in brackets, \u201cProm the Tequila district, Mexico.\u201d \u201cThe drink mescal.\u201d On page 1355 of the same book we find \u201cmescal\u201d defined thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-4\">\u201cA colorless intoxicating drink distilled in Mexico from the leaves of various species of Agave, or maguey.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Prom the Hendley case, 94 Tex. Crim. Rep. 40, referred to in the motion for rehearing, reference is made to Black on Intoxicating Liquor, where the term \u201cspirituous liquor\u201d is used with this comment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-6\">\u201cExamination of previous sections of the same chapter shows that \u2018spirituous liquor\u2019 is that made by the process of distillation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">As viewed by the writer, it is not necessary to the decision of this case to make an authoritative declaration as \u00a1to whether, as a matter of judicial knowledge, tequila is a spirituous liquor.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">The evidence in the present case, in the \"opinion of the writer, is sufficient to support the finding that tequila was a spirituous liquor. Its intoxicating quality was not disputed, but on the contrary, was categorically admitted. The witness who was interrogated upon the subject was not an expert but from his knowledge of intoxicating liquor and from having tasted that in question, he gave evidence that it was spirituous liquor. In some of his testimony he called it \u201cspiritual.\u201d He was a peace officer and not skilled in language or chemistry, but had long known of tequila as a \u00a1spirituous liquor. It is true that on cross-examination he declared that by the use of the word \u201cspiritual\u201d, as applied to -tequila, he meant that it was intoxicating. His cross-examination, we think, was not to be taken as nullifying his entire testimony or his language as detailed before the jury. To the mind of the writer, the point is analogous to cases of homicide in which the familiar practice applied'to the testimony of the accused is that although on cross-examination he is led to tie himself to a given theory of defense, other theories arising from his testimony or/-from that of other witnesses are not excluded. Numerous applications of this rule are found in cases in which the accused has testified that his sole reason for slaying his antagonist was the fear of death. Upon appeal it has been held that, notwithstanding such testimony, the issue of manslaughter arose from his evidence. Instances are Steen v. State, 88 Tex. Crim. Rep. 257; Ward v. State, 96 Tex. Crim. Rep. 278; Lewis v. State, 265 S. W. Rep. 709.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>From what has been said it follows that in the opinion of the writer, the State\u2019s motion for rehearing should be granted, the reversal set aside and the judgment of the trial court affirmed. It is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">\n<em>Affirmed-.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<p id=\"b410-6\">CONCURRING OPINION.</p>\n<author id=\"b410-7\">LATTIMORE, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"ADV\">In \u00a1addition to what is said in our opinion in chief on the State\u2019s motion for rehearing, we again call earnest attention of State\u2019s attorneys to the fact that in describing liquor in prosecutions for violations of the law relative thereto, it is sufficient to say it is \u201cliquor capable of producing intoxication.\u2019\u2019 If State\u2019s attorneys would not attempt to go beyond this and add un-. necessary descriptive .words, the trouble in the case before us and others would be obviated and the work of this court lessened. Tucker v. State, 94 Tex. Crim. Rep. 507. The allegation in the instant indictment that the liquor transported was \u201cspirituous, vinous and malt liquor capable of producing intoxication,\u201d gives opportunity for strong contention on the part of appellant that the State, while proving without controversy that the liquor was intoxicating*, failed to prove that it was either spirituous, vinous or malt liquor.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">The sheriff swore in this ease that the tequila found in appellant\u2019s car was \u201cspiritual.\u201d In a liquor case this means the same is spirituous. State v. Clark, 3 Ind. 451. The word \u201cspiritual\u201d is given in the Century Dictionary as a synonym for \u201cspirituous\u201d. This witness further said that he had always been taught that tequila was a spirituous liquor; that he had shown it to be such all the time; that it was intoxicating. He used other expressions in his testimony which furnished the basis for the attack by appellant upon the proof that the liquor was not in fact spirituous. The learned trial judge pointedly told the jury that if they did not believe from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant transported spirituous, vinous or malt liquor, capable of producing intoxication, they should acquit. Upon the, trial appellant categorically admitted that the tequila found in his possession was intoxicating. We believe the jury justified in concluding that it wag a spirituous liquor. In cases in which this question is a controverted one, attention of the State\u2019s attorneys is called to the fact that the State maintains its State C.hemist at Austin, whose duty it is to analyze liquors, etc., sent to him by officers of the State, and whose analysis given in testimony would appear to entirely satisfy the demands of our practice in the matter of making full proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">This in addition to the opinion in chief and concurring therewith.</p>\n<author id=\"b410-10\">HAWKINS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AsG\">I regret that I am unable to concur with my. Brethren in the conclusion reached that the evidence sufficiently shows <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>the liquor in question to be \u201cspirituous.\" My views having been expressed at some length in the opinion granting appellant\u2019s motion for rehearing, it is not necessary to write further.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
