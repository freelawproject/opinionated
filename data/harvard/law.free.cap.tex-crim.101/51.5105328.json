The record further shows that appellant was arrested on the 5th day of October, 1924, and that on the 7th day of October, 1924, a subpoena was issued and placed in the hands of the sheriff of Cass County, who on the 7th day of October, served said subpoena on the appellant\u2019s wife, requiring- her to be in attendance at this court on the 16th day of October, the date the case was called for trial. When the case was called for trial, the appellant made a motion to continue the ease on account of the absence of his wife, and showed the diligence above stated and in addition thereto attached the affidavit of Dr. J. W. Glass, a reputable physician of Cass County, which affidavit showed that appellant\u2019s wife was sick in bed and unable to attend court and that she was suffering from after effects of child birth, and that her baby was suffering from dysentery and required the mother\u2019s attention. In the motion for a continuance appellant stated that he expected to prove facts by this witness which we think were entirely relevant and material'to his defense in this case. Among other things, appellant showed to the court that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>would prove by Ms wife that she was at home all during the month of August and that the prosecuting witnesses were not at his house during the month of August, and that witness would further testify that on or about the 12th day of August (or three days before the prosecuting witnesses testified that they bought the whiskey from appellant) the appellant with others went on a fishing trip away \u25a0 from home and did not return until about the 18th day of August, and that during the time he was away on the fishing trip neither of the prosecuting witnesses called at the home of defendant. Appellant alleged other facts in this motion showing how and in what manner the testimony of the absent witness would be material to his defense. And the testimony given by the State\u2019s witnesses on the trial of the case shows that the testimony of the absent witness would have been contradictory to that of the State\u2019s witnesses and would have aided appellant in his defense to the effect that prosecuting witnesses did not come to appellant\u2019s home at the time they testified they did, and it would have also been material as showing that appellant was not at home at the time the State witnesses testified they were there and purchased whiskey from him.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">This was appellant\u2019s first application for a continuance and it conformed to the requirements of the statute in every essential detail and should have been granted. Section 335, page 193, Branch\u2019s P. C., for full citation of authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">Because the court erred in overruling appellant\u2019s first application for continuance, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been \u2022 examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and \u2022 approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
