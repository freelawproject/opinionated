Allred, </em>District Attorney, <em>Tom Garrard, </em>State\u2019s Attorney, and <em>Grover C.

It charges that appellant in the County of Wichita and State of Texas, did then and there carnally know one Alva Meadows, the said Alva Meadows then and there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>being the daughter of W. R. Meadows, \u201chis half brother,\u201d against the peace and dignity of the State. It is urged the expression \u201chis half brother\u201d is indefinite and lacks that certainty which should characterize an indictment under the law of this State. Grammatically construing said indictment, it appears beyond question that after stating appellant\u2019s name and that <em>he </em>carnally knew a certain female, there follows the statement that <em>she </em>was the daughter of W. R. Meadows, <em>\u201chis </em>half brother.\u201d It would be impossible to relate the possessive pronoun \u201chis\u201d to any antecedent male person referred to in the indictment save appellant. The attack, is critical but not sound.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">The only other complaint in the record is of the argument of the State\u2019s attorney. The bill sets out that said attorney in his argument to the jury made the following statement: \u201cNone of the facts have been denied\u201d. It is further shown in the bill that appellant objected on the ground that this was a comment upon his failure to testify. Where the accused is not named and words are not used in the argument which particularize him, the bill must show such facts as to make it appear to use that the language used did in fact individualize him and must have, in the opinion of the jury, been understood to refer to him. While the statement is made that appellant did not testify, there nowhere appears in this bill anything to indicate that the language quoted must have been understood by the jury to refer to appellant\u2019s failure to testify. No such facts are stated therein as to make it appear that this was necessarily a reference to such failure. For aught we learn from the bill there may have been other witnesses who could have been used by appellant, and were not. We are controlled in determining the soundness of a complaint, by those things which appear in the bill of exceptions evidencing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">Being unable to agree with appellant\u2019s contention in this regard, and finding no error in the record, the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b45-8\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b45-9\">LATTIMORE, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AQ1\">The State introduced three witnesses and three testified for the defense. The State\u2019s attorney in his argument said to the jury, \u201cNone of the facts have been denied.\u201d This called the jury\u2019s attention to no act, no time, no place and no transaction, and while we admire the ability and earnestness with which the motion for rehearing argues that this called the attention of the jury to appellant\u2019s failure to testify, we find ourselves wholly unable to agree with the soundness of the contention. The remark of the State\u2019s attorney applied to the testimony of each and all of appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>lant\u2019s witnesses and we see no reason to believe otherwise than that it was so wholly applied. Certainly it was not a statement which would constitute a necessary reference to appellant\u2019s failure to testify as is the ease in each of the authorities cited in appellant\u2019s motion. This is the only point contended for, and being unable to agree with same, the motion will be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
