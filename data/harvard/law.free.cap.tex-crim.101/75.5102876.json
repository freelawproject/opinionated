It seems that the court proceeded upon the theory that possession of more than a quart of whiskey was conclusive proof of guilt under a charge of possession for the purpose of sale. It has been held that it is necessary that the. purpose for which liquor is possessed be submitted to the jury. Pettit v. State, 90 Texas Crim. Rep. 336. Veasey v. State, 260 S. W. 1055. We think in this case that the trial court misconceived the effect of Section 2e, Chapter 22, Acts 38th Legislature Second Called Session, in which it is declared that the possession of more than a quart of intoxicating liquor shall be prima facie evidence of guilt. If this principle is charged at all, certainly all of the statute ought to be charged and in the language of the statute. The validity of that statute has been upheld by this court upon the express ground that it did not reflect the purpose of the Legislature to declare that the possession of more than a quart of liquor was absolute or conclusive proof of guilt, but that it was prima facie evidence. Floeck v. State, 34 Texas Crim. Rep. 314. Stoneham v. State, 268 S. W. 156. Newton v. State, 267 S. W. 272.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-9\">We think it clear in the instant ease that the effect of the charge complained of was to instruct the jury to convict the defendant for possession for the purpose of sale if they believe that he had in his possession liquor in quantities of more than one quart; while it was ' proper for the court to tell the jury that prima facie the State discharged its burden of proof when it showed that he had in his possession more than one quart of intoxicating liquor, but the charge should have gone further upon the exceptions urged to it and have told the jury the meaning in substance of prima facie evidence, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>should have pertinently instructed them that the appellant had the right to overcome this presumption by proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Almost the identical question here discussed was before this court in the case of Walden v. State, No. 8776, not yet reported, and the opinion in that case sustains the views we have expressed herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">For the error above- noted, it is our opinion that the judgment should be reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges, of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
