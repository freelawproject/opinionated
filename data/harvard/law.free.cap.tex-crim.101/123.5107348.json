In fact, the only bill of exception contained in the record is one complaining at the court\u2019s action in overruling defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">The motion for a new trial contains twelve different alleged grounds of error, no one of which was preserved by a separate bill of exception at the time the alleged error occurred. Under these conditions, we hold that there is nothing in the record which we can consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">The facts being sufficient to support the verdict, and there being no error of record, it is our opinion that the judgment should be in all things affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b142-10\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined \u2022 by 'the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
