The bill does not make any showing of reasons why the charge fails, or how it is wrong. No part of the charge is copied in the bill or referred to therein. Manifestly it presents no error. The only other bill of exceptions set forth appellant\u2019s objection to the State asking him while on the witness' stand, \u201cWhere did you get that whiskey?\u201d The ground of objection appearing is that this question was not in rebuttal of anything that had been brought out upon the redirect examination. Under our practice we do not hold the parties strictly to the propositions of rebuttal, redirect, sur-rebuttal, etc., examinations. The object of every trial ought to be to arrive at the truth, and if the questions asked be material to issues arising in the case, this court would not reverse because they were asked in other than what might be considered their proper place in the trial. The facts seem sufficient to support the judgment. Appellant, his wife, another man and his wife were in a car .proceeding along a public road. They had a quantity of whiskey in the car. Appellant was intoxicated. When they discovered the officers appellant and the others began to throw the jugs of whiskey out. Appellant told the officers where they had obtained the liquor.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">Finding no error in the record, the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b449-9\">ON MOTION FOB REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b449-10\">LATTIMORE, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"ACG5\">In view of the fact that appellant pleaded ' guilty, and that, the charge of the court followed the charges customary in such case, we fail to agree with appellant in his renewed contention that in his charge the learned trial judge did not apply the law to the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-11\">The remark of the court in overruling an objection to a question by appellant\u2019s'counsel, which remark was that \u201cHe has filed an application for a suspended sentence\u201d, was not a statement by the \u25a0 court which expressed any opinion of any issue in the case, and we do not see how same could be susceptible of any injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-12\">The motion for rehearing will be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-13\">\n<em>Overruled</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
