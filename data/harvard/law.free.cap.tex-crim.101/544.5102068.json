No question of fact or complaint of procedure other than those which occurred during the trial of the case, is presented in the motion for new trial. Complaint is made of the misspelling of some words in the verdict of the jury, but this is not deemed ground for reversal where the words <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>used are of such sound and apparent sense as that the verdict is intelligible. The jury's statement that they find the defendant guilty and \u201cases\u201d his punishment at eighteen months in the \u201cpenatenure\u201d, is simply a case of misspelling words when from the context it is plain what the jury meant.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">The testimony seems sufficient to support the conclusion reached by the jury. In a search of appellant\u2019s premises there was- found near his house a fifty-gallon barrel full of mash, and not far away a half-gallon of whiskey, and in another part of the premises a still called by the witnesses \u201can old tub still\u201d. A lot of tracks led from appellant\u2019s house out to where these articles were found.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Finding no error in the record, the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b563-8\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b563-9\">LATTIMORE, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AFMW\">An indictment may properly charge in separate counts kindred offenses growing out of the same transaction, and be not subject to the charge that same is duplicitous. Collins v. State, 77 Tex. Crim. Rep. 166.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-10\">On the evidence \u2014 appellant\u2019s confession admits that the barrel of mash found -'on his premises was his, and that it had been \u201csetting\u201d for three days, and that he was figuring on getting a still \u201cto run off the mash .' . . if I could have located the Copeland still, called the company\u2019s outfit, I was going to use it.\u201d The conviction was for the unlawful possession of mash for the manufacture of intoxicating liquor. The facts support the jury\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-12\">The motion for rehearing will be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-13\">\u25a0 <em>Overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
