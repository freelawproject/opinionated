He appeals from the magistrate\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss the indictments for lack of the district court\u2019s jurisdiction to try this case as not arising under Title 18, U.S.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b1546-25\">The interlocutory ruling of the magistrate is not an appealable final order of the district court. We dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1546-26\">The appellate jurisdiction of this court is limited to \u201cappeals from all final decisions of the district courts.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. The denial of a motion to dismiss an indictment is not an appealable final order, <em>United States v. Hollywood Motor Car Company, </em>- U.S. -, 102 S.Ct. 3081, 73 L.Ed.2d 754 (1982), <em>United States v. Bird, </em>709 F.2d 388 (5th Cir.1983), whether (as here) based on an asserted \u201clack of jurisdiction\u201d of the court or instead upon other asserted invalidity of the indictment as entitling the accused to dismissal of the criminal charges. The present claim asserted does not fall within the \u201cvery narrow class of cases\u201d in which interlocutory appeal is permissible, <em>Bird, supra, </em>709 F.2d at 392, see also 390-91, as it does not \u201cmeet the test of being \u2018effectively unreviewable on appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1455\">*1455</page-number>from a final judgment,\u2019 \u201d <em>Hollywood Motor Car, supra, </em>458 U.S. at 270, 102 S.Ct. at 3085. Whatever the merits of the defendant\u2019s contention, it may be reviewed, if asserted, upon an appeal from a final order following conviction, if any.</p>\n<p id=\"b1547-5\">Accordingly, we DISMISS the defendant\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1547-6\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
