Giving full regard to: the fact that this issue involves a motion to suppress where the interests are of a lesser magnitude than those in the criminal trial itself, <em>United States v. Raddatz, </em>447 U.S. 667, 679,100 S.Ct. 2406, 2414, 65 L.Ed.2d 424 (1980); the <em>in camera </em>procedures followed by the district court which protected the interests here involved, <em>Suarez v. United States, </em>582 F.2d 1007, 1011-12 (5th Cir.1978); and the recent Supreme Court case which indicates a lessened chance of attacking a search warrant based on affidavits, <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>- U.S. -, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983), we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in applying the <em>Roviaro v. United States, </em>353 U.S. 53, 77 S.Ct. 623, 1 L.Ed.2d 639 (1957), balance to the issues here involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-15\">Second, we have repeatedly held that the district court has broad discretion in deciding whether to interrogate jurors regarding alleged misconduct. <em>United States v. Edwards, </em>696 F.2d 1277, 1282 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. </em>denied,-U.S.-, 103 S.Ct. 1884, 76 L.Ed.2d 813 (1983); <em>Grooms v. Wainwright, </em>610 F.2d 344, 347-48 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 953,100 S.Ct. 1605, 63 L.Ed.2d 789 (1980); <em>United States v. Chiantese, </em>582 F.2d 974, 978-80 (5th Cir.1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>441 U.S. 922, 99 S.Ct. 2030, 60 L.Ed.2d 395 (1979); <em>United States v. Robbins, </em>500 F.2d 650, 653 (5th Cir.1974). The district court was in the best, position to determine whether the facts reflected by counsel\u2019s statement as to the jury\u2019s discussion of the case prior to submission could be cured from error by instructions as given. The district court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
