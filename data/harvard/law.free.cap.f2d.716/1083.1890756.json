BROWN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1176-16\">The District Court dismissed plaintiff\u2019s individual and class action suit under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq., </em>as amended, and the Civil Rights Act of 1866, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1981, and denied his motion for certification of the class. Because, as will be shown, that Court\u2019s action was correct, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-17\">On January 2,1973, the plaintiff, William W. Avant, applied with South Central Bell Telephone Company (Bell) for the position of telephone lineman in the Jackson, Mississippi area.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-18\">At that time, Bell had a two-step employment process. After a preliminary interview and some questioning, an applicant would be required to take a general aptitude test, fill out a formal application, and go through an in-depth interview. If these were successfully completed, the applicant would then have a physical examination and, for certain positions requiring special insurance, Bell\u2019s Security Department would conduct a background investigation of the applicant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The lineman position required such a security check,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and Bell nev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1085\">*1085</page-number>er hired a lineman applicant who received an unfavorable security report.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Pursuant to a Consent Decree entered into with the United States Government, Bell hired a large number of black lineman applicants.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1177-5\">Avant, a black male, successfully negotiated the preliminary interview and questioning and passed the general aptitude test. However, in filling out his formal application for employment, he answered \u201cyes\u201d to whether he had \u201cever been convicted of any law violation including traffic citations (excluding parking tickets)?\u201d but detailed that only as a \u201cSpeeding Violation 68-71 Illinois\u201d and \u201cRunning Red Light 72 Miss.\u201d Avant saw and signed the statement on the application that stated \u201cI [the applicant] understand the Company [Bell] reserves the right to verify all information on this application and that any false statements or failures to disclose information may be sufficient to disqualify me for employment, or, if employed, may result in my dismissal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-6\">In fact, as the District Court found, Avant had been convicted of petty larceny the previous fall. On September 17, 1972, he had bought gasoline at a Rankin County, Mississippi service station and presented his paycheck to pay for the gas. He had been drinking and gambling. There was some confusion in cashing the paycheck, and Avant apparently took the check back with him along with his change. The Jackson police subsequently arrested him and turned him over to the Rankin County Sheriff\u2019s Department. The following day, September 18, 1972, Avant put up a $200 bond for his release. Later that day, he was tried for petty larceny and fined $60 (of which $50 was suspended due to the service station owner\u2019s plea for mercy). Avant knowingly omitted this conviction from his formal application for employment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1177-14\">Nonetheless, Avant took his physical examination and was certified as qualified for the position of lineman, subject to his background investigation. The security report, which as the then Mississippi Employment Manager for Bell testified only lists convictions in detailing an applicant\u2019s \u201ccriminal\u201d record, came back unfavorable. It showed that Avant had been arrested on September 17, 1972, been charged with petty larceny, put up a $200 cash bond, and been released September 18, 1972. The report concluded that \u201c[i]f this applicant is hired, please refer to Executive Instructions 3, Section 4, which covers Blanket Fidelity Bond requirements.\u201d Note 1, <em>supra. </em>Bell informed Avant by letter that his application had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1086\">*1086</page-number>been declined, and filled the lineman position with another black male applicant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-4\">Avant filed a charge of employment discrimination with the Jackson District Office of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) four months later. After EEOC conciliation efforts had failed, Avant filed suit in 1981 in federal district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-5\">Trial Judge Nixon, after a short non-jury trial, dismissed Avant\u2019s individual claims of discriminatory treatment and impact and declined to certify his class claims. Specifically, in a careful and detailed opinion delivered from the bench, the Court held that under <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), Avant had failed to prove a <em>prima facie </em>case of discriminatory treatment, because he was not \u201cqualified\u201d for the lineman position<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and because he had not shown that a non-minority applicant had filled the position he was seeking; Bell had articulated a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for refusing to hire Avant \u2014 the Fidelity Bond coverage requirements and his falsifying his employment application regarding the petty larceny conviction; and Avant failed to prove that Bell\u2019s business reason was a \u201cmere pretext\" for discrimination. As to discriminatory impact, the Court again found that Avant had failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case, because he offered no evidence that more black applicants than white were excluded by Bell\u2019s refusal to hire applicants who had a previous conviction of dishonesty or fraud for positions of trust, and Bell had shown and proved a legitimate business need behind its policy, specifically, the limited coverage of the Fidelity Bond. The Court also stated that Avant\u2019s \u00a7 1981 suit was barred by Miss.Code Ann. \u00a7 15-1-49 (1972), a six-year statute of limitations.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Finally, the Court denied Avant\u2019s motion for class certification because he had failed to bring the motion in a timely manner under the local rules of the Court, had failed to show \u201cnumerosity,\u201d and, in failing to make any motion for certification or seek or offer any evidence to support such certification, had not fairly and adequately protected the interests of the class.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-9\">The <em>Disparate Treatment Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1178-10\">Avant asserts that the Trial Judge misconstrued the nature of a plaintiff\u2019s burden of establishing a <em>prima facie </em>case of racial discrimination. We point out, though, that while the Court ultimately found that Avant had shown no <em>prima facie </em>discrimination, it declined to dismiss his claim on that ground at the close of his case and made Bell present all of its evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-11\">Thus, this case was \u201cfully tried on the merits,\u201d and this Court, like the Supreme Court, must stress that \u201cby framing this issue in these terms,\u201d Avant has \u201cunnecessarily evaded the ultimate question of discrimination vel non.\u201d <em>United States Postal Service Board of Governors v. </em>Aikens,U.S. -, 103 S.Ct. 1478, 75 L.Ed.2d 403 (1983) (footnote omitted). Logically, since both Avant and Bell had presented their case,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1178-15\">[t]he district court was ... in a position to decide the ultimate factual issue in the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1178-16\">The \u201cfactual inquiry\u201d in a Title VII case is \u201cwhether the defendant intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff.\u201d [citation omitted] In other words, is \u201cthe employer ... treating \u2018some people less favorably than others because of their race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\u2019 \u201d [citations omitted] .. . Where the defendant has done everything that would be required of him if the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1087\">*1087</page-number>had properly made out a prima facie case, whether the plaintiff really did so is no longer relevant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1179-5\"><em>Id. </em>at-, 103 S.Ct. at 1482, 75 L.Ed.2d at 411.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-7\">Here, there can be no doubt that the Trial Judge \u201cdecide[d] which party\u2019s explanation of the employer\u2019s [Bell\u2019s] motivation it believes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Further, this decision\u2014 that Bell had not treated Avant in a discriminatory manner by not hiring him \u2014 like any other factual finding of a district court, will stand unless clearly erroneous under F.R.Civ.P. 52(a). <em>Pullman-Standard v. Swint, </em>456 U.S. 273, 289-90, 102 S.Ct. 1781, 1790-91, 72 L.Ed.2d 66, 80-81 (1982). Our review must leave this Court with a \u201cdefinite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed,\u201d <em>United States v. United States Gypsum Co., </em>333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 542, 92 L.Ed.2d 746 (1948), before we will overturn the Trial Judge\u2019s decision. With these standards in mind and after reviewing a record which as shown broadly supports that decision, we find no such mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-8\">\n<em>The Disparate Impact Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-9\">At trial Avant sought to prove, through nation-wide statistics showing that blacks are arrested more frequently than whites, that Bell\u2019s policy of rejecting lineman applicants who had previously been arrested and had put up a bond for their release excluded, though unintentionally, more black applicants than whites.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> His argument misses the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-10\">Here, the Trial Court found that Bell had refused to hire Avant because of his past undisclosed conviction for petty larceny. It correctly pointed out that Avant could shoulder his burden of proof on circumstantial (i.e., statistical) evidence, <em>see Teamsters v. United States, </em>431 U.S. 324, 339, 97 S.Ct. 1843, 1856, 52 L.Ed.2d 396, 417 (1977), and that he need not show expressly an intent to discriminate. <em>Id. </em>at 335-36, n. 15, 97 S.Ct. at 1854-55 n. 15, 52 L.Ed.2d at 415-16. The Court simply could not find <em>any </em>proof that such \u201cfacially neutral standards ... select applicants for hire in a significantly discriminatory pattern,\u201d <em>Dothard v. Rawlinson, </em>433 U.S. 321, 329, 97 S.Ct. 2720, 2726, 53 L.Ed.2d 786, 797 (1977), from Avant\u2019s overly-broad <em>arrest </em>statistics.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-13\">We find no mistake in the Trial Court\u2019s factual finding that Bell had refused to hire Avant because of his petty larceny conviction. The Trial Judge could properly credit the Bell Employment Manager\u2019s testimony regarding the security reports. On that basis, we further find no error in the Court\u2019s ultimate finding of no discriminatory impact. <em>Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Kimbrough Investment Co., </em>703 F.2d 98, 100 (5th Cir.1983). The evidence adequately substantiates the District Court\u2019s finding that Bell\u2019s policy was responsive to a legitimate business need and that it did not result in a disparate impact on black lineman applicants in contravention of Title VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-14\">\n<em>The Class Claims, Etc.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-15\">Avant appeals to have his class claims reconsidered by the District Court should this Court find merit in his disparate impact claims. Because we do not find such merit, we decline to remand on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-16\">In sum, after a careful scrutiny of Avant\u2019s appeal we arrive at only one conclusion. Bell\u2019s refusal to hire Avant was untainted by intended or inadvertant discrimination on the basis of Avant\u2019s race. The District Court\u2019s opinion was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1176-9\">. Bell had blanket insurance coverage \u2014 an Employees\u2019 Fidelity Bond \u2014 \u201cagainst loss of money, securities, revenues and other property as a result of larceny, theft, embezzlement, forgery, misappropriation or other fraudulent or dishonest act or acts committed by employees.\u201d The coverage extended to all employees in jobs that dealt with the handling of money, Bell\u2019s material or property, or certain sensitive information, except where Bell had \u201cknowledge of a prior fraudulent or dishonest act on the part of an employee\u201d and such employee had not been individually covered.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1176-20\">. Linemen, who install and repair telephone lines, are responsible for thousands of dollars in Bell equipment and materials, including, as testified to at trial, \u201cindividual hand tools <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1085\">*1085</page-number>amounting to two or three hundred dollars, a truck that could amount to $75,000, group tools that the truck has associated with it that are ... maybe a thousand dollars, and material in the way of cable that could be four or five thousand dollars.\u201d They work under \u201cminimal supervision\u201d and on occasion are required \u201cto work, not only on the public streets, but to go on the customers\u2019 premises.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1177-8\">. Bell\u2019s policy was that \u201c[njormally the discovery that a candidate for employment ... has committed any fraudulent or dishonest act prior to employment is cause for eliminating the candidate from further consideration for employment\u201d (executive instructions concerning the Employee Fidelity Bond, note 1, <em>supra). </em>Bell could obtain special individual coverage for employees who had committed such an act, but, for the obvious reason that there were enough applicants who had not committed such acts, never did.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1177-11\">. Under the Consent Decree, Bell established a list of 15 Affirmative Action program job classifications for which it set numerical objectives for the hiring of blacks. In 1972 Bell hoped to fill 40.42% of the 47 expected linemen openings with black applicants but in fact filled 46.67% of the 30 jobs that did open with black males. In 1973 Bell hoped to fill 39.40% of the expected 33 linemen openings with black applicants, and in fact filled 57.14% of the 21 positions that did open with black males.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"Ahq\">. A part of Avant\u2019s deposition testimony reads:</p>\n<p id=\"Aqd\">Q. At the time you completed that application, did you in fact list all convictions?</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-17\">A. At that time I did not list all convictions I had.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-18\">Q. What other convictions did you have at that time that you did not list on this application?</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-19\">A. I think it was another speeding ticket, speeding violation, or running a red light or something. I don\u2019t remember specifically. And it was another petty larceny case involving a check.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1178-6\">. Under <em>McDonnell Douglas v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), a plaintiff may establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of racial discrimination by showing</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1178-7\">(i) that he belongs to a racial minority; (ii) that he applied and was qualified for a job for which the employer was seeking applicants; (iii) that, despite his qualifications, he was</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1178-17\">rejected; and (iv) that, after his rejection, the position remained open and the employer continued to seek applicants from persons of complainant\u2019s qualifications.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1178-18\"><em>Id. </em>at 802, 93 <em>S.Ct. at </em>1824 (footnote omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1178-19\">. Avant does not challenge this holding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1179-11\">. Avant alleges that Bell\u2019s security report showed nothing more than Avant\u2019s arrest and subsequent posting of bond. With only that information before it, Avant asserts that Bell thus refused to hire him because of his arrest and his posting bond. Because more blacks are arrested (and presumably more post bond for their release), he argues that such a hiring policy excludes more blacks than whites. Since the Trial Judge could properly find that Bell declined to hire Avant because of his prior conviction for petty larceny, we need not intimate any view on this disparate impact argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
