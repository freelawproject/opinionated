The question, said the court, was one addressed to the discretion of the court below. In Hatch <em>v. </em>Central National Bank, 78 IV. <em>Y. </em>487, the court of appeals held, that it is within the discretion of the court in which a judgment is entered to vacate the judgment at the request of the plaintiff, although the order to vacate the judgment was not made until more than a year after the judgment had been satisfied. The judgment was satisfied August 7, 1876, the order granting the motion to vacate the judgment was made February 5, 1879. \u2018 The power to amend,\u2019 said the court of appeals, \u2018 is an inherent power, and not limited in matters of substance by the sections of the Code\u2014\u00a7 174 of old Code, \u00a7 724 of new Code-while \u00a7 723 seems to authorize its exercise in the furtherance of justice.\u2019 In Farrish <em>v. </em>Austin, 25 <em>Hun, </em>430, the supreme court in the first department set aside a judgment sixteen years after its entry.

The action was brought to foreclose a certain mortgage made by the New York City Central Underground Railway Company. The city of New York was made party to that action, but it was alleged in the complaint that it was made a party,'1 because the plaintiff was informed that the city might have or claim an interest in the property covered and conveyed in the two mortgages mentioned and in the relief demanded in the complaint.\u2019 No claim or demand is made against the said mayor, aldermen and commonalty of the city of New York.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-6\">\u201c The relief demanded was that the plaintiff have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>judgment for a certain sum of money and the costs of the action ; that it be adjudged that the mortgage dated July 1, 1873, be foreclosed, and also that said company and all claiming under it be foreclosed of the right to perform any of the agreements in the instrument dated March 13, 1875; that the mortgaged franchises and property be sold and the proceeds applied to satisfy the indebtedness due plaintiff ; that a certain mortgage be cancelled; that the said company, its officers and agents, be enjoined and restrained from issuing bonds under said mortgages and from encumbering or interfering with its property, and that the court grant such other and farther relief as may be equitable and just in the premises.,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-4\">\u201c There is nothing in this demand for relief that in any way affects the city. The only parties who could be \u2018 foreclosed \u2019 are those who claimed under the company. There is no allegation in the complaint that affects in any way the city, except the allegation that it might have or claim an interest in the property conveyed in the mortgages mentioned in the complaint and in the relief demanded in the complaint\u2014and this allegation was joined to the statement that no claim or demand was made, and no relief was demanded against the city\u2014because there is nothing to show that the city claimed under the New York City Central Underground Railway Company. But the judgment that was entered did very materially affect the city. It was adjudged, among other things, that all the allegations contained in the complaint were true in manner, form and substance ; that the said New York ,City Central Underground Railway Company owned the right and occupancy, seizure and possession of the land, premises and grounds afterwards described in the judgment for the use and purpose of constructing, maintaining and operating a double track railway ; for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>the use and purpose of constructing, maintaining and operating a branch railway to the Central park, and railway connections with steam and horse railroads ; to make and maintain double or single tunnel or tunnels or subways for the same; to light, ventilate and drain such tunnels or subways ; to make, construct and maintain openings for ventilation or light extending from such tunnel, tunnels or subways to the outer edges of the sidewalks of the streets or avenues or to the surface of the squares under which the same shall be constructed; to construct, maintain and operate an elevated railway from Ninety-ninth street to and along the Harlem river on said lands and premises ; to. construct and maintain the proper platforms, stations and buildings thereon and therein; to make and maintain the necessary connections, turnouts, sidings, switches and other conveniences for the proper working and accommodation of said railways. The judgment then proceeded to lay out the route of the road.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-4\">\u201c It was also adjudged that the said Railway Company, prior to the 10th day of May, 1871, commenced the construction of the tunnel and railway which by statutes the \u25a0 said railway company was authorized to construct and operate; that the workmen of said railway company were employed for several weeks thereafter at the excavation and masonry for the tunnel wall of said railway, and that \u2018 said corporations defendants, their officers and servants, will respect the aforesaid orders, judgments and decrees herein.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-5\">\u201c This judgment as far as it affects the defendant, the mayor, aldermen, &amp;c., of the city of New York, was erroneous.

Under the authority of this case, the adjudications against the defendant (determining the route of the road and that the N\u00e9w York City Central Underground Railway had commenced operations in building the road as required by the statutes creating the company) were unauthorized and voidable, because there was no allegation in the complaint that warranted such a relief, and no such relief was demanded in the complaint.

The notices of no claim, contained in and served with the complaint, cannot avail the counsel to the corporation. <em>First, </em>the statute does not authorize a notice of \u201c no claim,\u201d but does authorize a notice of \u201c no personal claim.\u201d <em>Secondly, </em>the notice of \u201cno personal claim\u201d means only that a decree for money will not be taken against the defendant so notified. It does not and is not intended to affect the bar of the judgment against any interest of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>defendant so notified in the property sold. <em>Thirdly, </em>the notices of \u201c no claim\u201d on their face show that their effect was to notify the city, not of \u201c no claim,\u201d but of \u201c claim.\u201d In the <em>fourth </em>place, even if it could be contended that it was a fraud to take the judgment, in view of these notices, the city is at least seven years too late to make this objection. An action for relief on the ground of fraud was, at the time this judgment was rendered, barred in <em>six </em>years. It is barred in <em>six </em>years now. 2 <em>Revised Statutes, </em>301, \u00a7 51; Code of Civil Procedure, \u00a7 382. Both these provisions start the statute at the date of discovery of the fraud, which, in this case was at least twelve years before the present motion was made. Moreover, this is not an action to vacate on the ground of fraud. It is a motion. It cannot be said by the city, with safety, that this is a motion to vacate a decree for irregularity, for the right to prosecute such motion successfully was then and is now barred in one year. 2 <em>Rev.

The relief granted by the decree did not exceed that demanded in the complaint. It was upon the ground of such excess, forbidden by the 275th section of the Code of Procedure, in force January 11, 1876, when the judgment was rendered, that this motion was made and argued at special term. The word relief in that section refers only to the executive action to be taken by the court, in accordance with the justice of the cause, as required by the facts found. It had no reference whatever to the effect of the judgment by way of estoppel. The estoppels of a judgment are not measured by the relief prayed for. Said relief may be only the recovery of trifling damages, <em>e.g., </em>one cent, or one dollar, in an action of ejectment or replevin. Sheldon <em>v. </em>Edwards, 35 <em>N.

That the true meaning of the word \u201crelief\u201d has no reference to the findings contained in the judgment is shown by the definitions found in the standard dictionaries. <em>Abbott\u2019s Law Dictionary; Rapalje &amp; Lawrence\u2019s Law Dictionary; Wharton\u2019s Law Dictionary. </em>The term \u201c relief,\u201d as distinguished from \u201c discovery,\u201d has been in use by the court of chancery from the earliest ages, and refers exclusively to the methods or measures to be adopted by the chancellor for the enforcement of rights, required by the findings of the decree. At law the only relief was by judgment for money or possession of lands or chattels. In equity specific relief in the nature of the granting of injunctions, the compelling of specific performance, and otherwise, has been long customary. The <em>fortieth </em>section of <em>Story\u2019s Equity Pleadings </em>is in the following words:\u2014\u201c The <em>eighth </em>part of the bill is <em>the prayer for relief. </em>This of course must vary according to the circumstances of the particular case, and the nature of the relief sought. The usual course is for the plaintiff in this part of the bill to make a special prayer for the particular relief, to which he thinks himself entitled, and then to conclude with a prayer of general relief, at the discretion of the court. The latter can never be properly and safely omitted ; because if the plaintiff should mistake the relief, to which he is entitled in his special prayer, the court may yet afford him the relief, to which he has a right, under the prayer of general relief, provided it is such relief, as is agreeable to the case made by the bill. But if there is no prayer of general relief, then if the plaintiff should mistake the relief to which he is entitled, no other relief can be granted him, and his suit must fail, at least unless an amendment of the prayer is allowed.\u201d See also \u00a7\u00a7 26, 27, 21, 31, 34, 35.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b324-4\">The only relief demanded in this case, from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>effect of which the city now seeks to escape, is founded in the second paragraph of the complaint, in these words : \u201c That it be adjudged that the said mortgage * * * be foreclosed ; * * * that the aforesaid mortgaged franchises and property be sold, and the proceeds from such sale be applied to satisfy the aforesaid indebtedness due to the plaintiff,\u201d and the prayer for general relief contained in the fourth paragraph of the prayer : \u201c That the court will grant such other and further relief as may be equitable and just in the premises.\u201d Following the rule prescribed in the case of Simonson <em>v. </em>Blake, 12 <em>Abb. </em>331, which holds that \u201c Thereliefgranted to a plaintiff in a case in which there is no answer, cannot exceed that which is specifically demanded in the complaint. It is not enough for him to state facts entitling him to the relief; he must also ask it. A judgment entered when no answer is put in, giving the plaintiff relief which was not specifically asked by the complaint, <em>i. e., </em>a judgment in foreclosure, for deficiency, where the complaint merely asked for a sale, should be vacated on motion. Such a judgment is not merely irregular but is void or voidable as unauthorized, and the right to move to have it vacated is not limited to one year.\u201d We proceed to examine whether the plaintiff Vandenburgh did not specifically \u201c ask\u201d the relief granted. This brings us to a consideration of the changes made by the decree of i Judge Truax : First. From the sixth paragraph of the judgment he erased the following words: \u201c that all of the allegations contained in the complaint of the plaintiff in this action,\u201d the residue of the sentence being\u2014\u201c are true in manner, form and substance, as therein stated.\u201d The finding that the facts averred in the complaint are true is not \u201crelief.\u201d The second erasure is of the whole of the tenth paragraph of the judgment. This is fully justified, as it seems to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>us, by the following averment of the complaint: \u201c A further judgment was recently duly rendered by this court in favor of the plaintiff against said company that its property be sold by a receiver to satisfy the judgment first mentioned, and restraining the company, its officers and agents, from incumbering and dealing with its property.\u201d The third erasure is of the whole of the thirteenth paragraph of the judgment. This adjudication was justified by the averment of the complaint, that the company\u2014\u201c at the time of the transactions,\u201d mentioned in the complaint, had\u2014\u201c the franchises, rights, powers, privileges, property and properties granted by said acts.\u201d An adjudication as to the commencement of the work was proper and necessary, since by no other means could the company then \u201c have \u201d the franchises given by the acts. In order that the company should possess its franchises and rights at the date of these transactions, free from danger of forfeiture by the State, it was necessary that the work should have been begun, as thus found in the decree. Therefore, this finding in the decree was not only legitimate under the averments of the- complaint, but necessary to entitle the plaintiff to the relief he prayed, viz : \u201c that the aforesaid mortgaged franchises and property be sold,\u201d and the. proceeds applied in discharge of the indebtedness. This testimony and finding was also rendered necessary by the averment of the complaint that in July, 1873, there was \u201c conveyed and mortgaged by said mortgage,\u201d the property\u2014\u201c then possessed and so thereafter granted by said company as security for the said indebtedness due to the plaintiff.\u201d In the next place, under the prayer for relief, \u201c that the aforesaid mortgaged franchises and property be sold,\u201d it was proper, if not necessary, for the court to ascertain and specify what the mortgaged premises, franchises and property of the railway were. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>The description, contained in the complaint, of the mortgaged franchises and premises, did not prevent the court from taking testimony and specifying in the judgment, in detail, the nature and extent of the franchises and property to be sold. The defendant was absolutely concluded as to the finding that the work had been commenced, by failing to except to the report. The report had been filed, and the notice required by the court rule duly given and the defendant has never excepted. Somers <em>v. </em>Milliken, 1 <em>Crary Spec. Pro. </em>298-299, <em>(note). </em>This adjudication was also justified, if not required, by the further averment of the complaint, that the \u201c constructions for \u201d the railway and tunnels\u2014\u201c then made and commenced on said routes and locations, and all other structures then made or thereafter to be made,\u201d constituted part of the mortgaged premises. It is as futile to object to the finding based on this as it would be to claim that a decree could not find the number and order the sale of locomotives owned by a mortgagor, and mortgaged either specifically or under the general name of \u201c equipment.\u201d It certainly cannot be true, even although a judgment cannot be stayed, impaired, or affected by a \u201cmistake in the description of property,\u201d that where premises have been mortgaged .by a description, legally accurate, but practically not conveying sufficient information, and the relief prayed is for the sale of the mortgaged property thus described, the court is without power to take proofs, or, through the agency of a referee, to ascertain and state a sufficient or improved description, so that it may know what to sell, and bidders may know what to buy, and the purchaser what he has acquired. So far from being beyond the power of the court thus to act, it would seem to be its duty to protect itself and the public from the consequences of any doubt and uncertainty that might thereafter arise, as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>the nature and extent of the property sold. Especially is this true in cases of corporate rights, where the question which the intending purchaser puts to himself is: \u201c What are the franchises which I shall secure by my purchase ? \u201d The object of the suit is, as far as plaintiff is concerned, to secure a price sufficient to pay his claim; so far as the defendant is concerned, not only to secure the highest possible price so as to avoid any deficiency, but also to leave a surplus for payment into its treasury after discharge of the mortgage debt. As these are lawful and beneficial purposes, a court of equity is bound to lend its aid to promote them, and how could they be more usefully promoted than by an accurate and careful ascertainment and detailed description of the property and franchises, by a finding that the' conditions of the franchise\u2014those upon which its existence and value depend\u2014have been performed,\u2014not by way of estoppel against the State,\u2014which not being party to the proceeding is not bound thereby,\u2014but by way of advice and information to purchasers, and preservation of the evidence of compliance with the condition as between the parties ? It was customary in the English court of chancery, and is proper in this country, to insert in a decree a declaration of the rights of the parties, as well as a finding of the facts of the case, before proceeding to the ordering or mandatory directions of the decree. 2 <em>Darnell\u2019s Chancery Practice, </em>*1004. \u201c In our practice the final decree does not contain such a summary of the facts, which was examinable on a bill of review; but, to countervail this absence of statement in the decree, we have adopted the practice of looking back of the decree into the whole record of the pleadings and proceedings. The conclusions of fact deduced from the proofs are not spread upon the record <em>in extenso, </em>unless through the medium of areport made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>by a Master or Commissioner. The decree, it is true, may proceed to state conclusions of fact as well as of law, and often does so for the purpose of rendering the judgment of the court more clear and specific.\u201d Putman v. Day, 22 <em>Wall. </em>66-67. The practice adopted by the referee in this case is abundantly supported by authority. Wolcott <em>v. </em>Weaver, 3 <em>How. </em>159; Security Fire Insurance Company <em>v. </em>Martin, 15 <em>Abb. </em>479. The seventy-third rule of the supreme court, as numbered at the time the judgment of foreclosure was entered in this case (present rule 61), provides that \u201c In every judgment for the sale of mortgaged premises the description and particular boundaries of the property to be sold, so far, at least, as the same can be ascertained from the mortgage, shall be inserted.\u201d This rule requires the court to insert in its judgment for the sale of mortgaged premises a specific description, with particular boundaries, so far as the same can be ascertained from the mortgage, and permits the court to do what vvas done in this case, viz., to proceed to ascertain, through the agency of a referee, descriptions of the rights and boundaries of the land more precise than those furnished by the mortgage, and to insert the same in the judgment of foreclosure. This construction of the rule is required by the use of the words \u201c at least.\u201d That this is the necessary conclusion is also shown by other portions of the same rule, which, together with \u00a7 1626 and \u00a7 1636 of the Code of Civil Procedure (re-enacting 2 <em>Revised Statutes, </em>p. 191, \u00a7 151, and Code of Procedure, \u00a7\u00a7 163 and 164), provide for the sale of mortgaged property upon foreclosure in parcels. To ascertain the proper subdivision of land, so as to enable sales to be made in parcels, is the work of a referee, or of the court, upon testimony, and of a judgment at some stage of the proceedings, identifying and specifying much more particularly than in the mortgage, the parcels <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>intended thus to be sold. <em>Jones on Mortgages, </em>\u00a7 1574, In Gayle <em>v. </em>Singleton, 1 <em>Steward, </em>566, the supreme court of Alabama held that\u2014\u201c A decree ordering the sale of property in the hands of heirs must specify and identify it.\u201d In Railroad Company <em>v. </em>Swasey, 23 <em>Wall. </em>405, the supreme court of the United States held that \u201c A decree of foreclosure and sale is not 6 final,\u2019 in the sense which allows an appeal from it so long as the amount due upon the debt must be determined, and the property to be sold ascertained and defined.\u201d The objection has never before been made that the chancellor has no power to ascertain and describe with particularity what is to be sold. It has been claimed that this could not be done by mere reference to the mortgage, but, in Sims\u2019 Lessee <em>v. </em>Cross, 10 <em>Yerger, </em>459, the supreme court of Tennessee held it sufficient that the Master\u2019s report and decree furnished the means of identifying the lands sold by reference to the mortgage. In Hurtt <em>v. </em>Crane, 36 <em>Md. </em>29, it was held that \u201c a decree should determine the rights and liabilities of all the parties to the cause.\u201d The <em>fourth </em>erasure is of the following portion of the <em>sixteenth </em>paragraph: \u201cAnd that said corporations defendants, their officers and servants, will respect the aforesaid orders, judgments and decrees herein and the due legal proceedings to be had pursuant thereto.\u201d This is no more than a requirement of that obedience and respect which the law requires of all parties to a judgment independently of and without such requirement. On general principles, an order that a defendant \u201crespect\u201d the judgment or decree entered in a case to which he is a party, cannot be erroneous.\" It so happens, however, that we are not left to consider general principles in this case. By specific statutory provisions in force at the time, such was the law of the state of New York. 2 <em>Rev. Stat. </em>(p. 192), \u00a7\u00a7 157 and 158; \u00a7 1675 of the Code of Civil Procedure, \u00a7 131 of the Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>of Procedure. The <em>fifth </em>erasure is of the following important portion of the <em>second </em>paragraph of the judgment: \u201c And had the franchises, rights and powers, property, properties and rights of property granted by the said acts at the time of the transactions hereinafter mentioned.\u201d This paragraph of the judgment follows <em>literatim et verbatim </em>the averments of the complaint. Surely, if the plaintiff, in a foreclosure suit, avers that, at the time of the making of the mortgage, the defendant owned the premises in fee simple, and that he made the mortgage embracing them, and then pray that the said mortgaged premises be sold in fee simple, the Court\u2019s finding that the averment of the complaint as to the extent of the defendant\u2019s title is true, coupled with relief as demanded, and granting no more relief than that prayed for, cannot be objected to thirteen years afterward by a defendant who holds a collateral interest in the property because he failed to answer. The <em>sixth </em>portion of the judgment stricken out is the whole of the <em>fifth </em>paragraph. This <em>fifth </em>paragraph likewise follows the averment of the complaint, <em>literatim et verbatim, </em>the only difference between the two being that the complaint avers and the judgment finds. The relevancy of the averments and of the decree cannot now be disputed collaterally. This was matter to be objected to on appeal if at all, but it was impossible to object to it on appeal, for the reason that the averment was proper and necessary in order to bring the plaintiff within the security of the mortgage. The mortgage was to Brown and to Alexander. Brown resigned his position as trustee. Either Alexander, the remaining trustee, should have brought the suit with or without joining the plaintiff as a co-plaintiff, or the plaintiff, as <em>cestui que trust, </em>bringing the suit, must show that he is beneficiary of the mortgage. The <em>seventh </em>erasure is the whole of the <em>eleventh </em>paragraph of the decree. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>This was necessary and proper as an ascertainment and definition of the mortgaged property. If the defendant did not like this description, it could have excepted to the report of the referee, of which it had due notice. This was the specific property and no other, of which the prayer for relief contained in the complaint sought the sale, and to strike out these descriptions is equivalent to holding that, as against a non-answering defendant, a prayer for the sale of specific property, described as contained in maps, cannot be granted, by transferring the description from maps to words, even when the map itself is referred .to as correctly delineating the property, but that both the description in words and the reference to maps must be erased. The <em>eighth </em>erasure was the whole of the <em>twelfth </em>paragraph of the judgment. This clause of the judgment may be treated as relief, but is certainly not in excess of that demanded, and was fully warranted by the complaint, by the report of the referee and by the facts. If the purchaser acquired anything he necessarily acquired the right to hold \u201c the said mortgaged premises, franchises and property,\u201d with this right\u2014\u201c of occupancy, seizure and possession, and with and for the specific uses, rights and powers,\u201d as aforesaid. If he did not get this he got nothing. The last erasure is the excision from <em>thq fifteenth </em>paragraph of the decree the following: \u201c together with, as part thereof and appurtenant thereto, the aforesaid right of occupancy, seizure and possession, with the specific uses, rights and powers, as hereinbefore ordered, adjudged and decreed.\u201d This provision of the decree was also rendered necessary and proper by the averments of the complaint. \u2019 A complaint which alleges in unqualified terms that at the date of the mortgage the defendant was possessed of certain franchises, which describes these franchises, which is followed by testimony of their existence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>and a report finding the same, and finally by a decree sustaining the same, cannot, it seems to us, be stricken from the record as void upon collateral attack thirteen years afterwards, or at any time, when the object of the suit is remembered, viz., to sell, not the property and franchises of a corporation which had lost its rights, but of an existing and going corporation; when it is averred, in the very first sentence of the complaint, that, at the date of the mortgage, the corporation possessed its franchises, and when all the paragraphs of the judgment complained of consisted either in the description of the franchises, or in findings that they existed at the time of the mortgage. <em>Allegata, probata and judicata </em>are here in strict conformity. The averment is that, at the date of the mortgage, the corporation had \u201c the franchises, rights, powers, privileges, property and properties granted by said acts; \u201d also that they were mortgaged to Alexander as security for the indebtedness to the plaintiff. Their definition and description follows, and the prayer- is for -the sale of \u201c the aforesaid mortgage, franchises and property.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b333-4\">VI. This court had jurisdiction to render the decree now complained of. While the learned judge below maintained that a foreclosure action is not the proper mode to litigate rights claimed in priority or in hostility to the mortgage, to which proposition he cited the case of Merchants\u2019 Bank <em>v. </em>Thomson, 55 <em>N. Y. </em>7. yet, he does not claim that, under its authority, the adjudication determining the route of the railway and that the Mew York City Central Railway had commenced operations in building as required by the statutes creating the company, were unauthorized and voidable by motion, except on the ground that, \u201cthere was-no allegation in the complaint that warranted such a relief, and no such relief was demanded in the complaint.\u201d It is true <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>that, in a later sentence of his opinion he says : \u201c The court had no jurisdiction to make the judgment that was made, and this want of jurisdiction may be set up collaterally or otherwise.\u201d But neither in the case of Merchants\u2019 Bank <em>v. </em>Thomson, cited by Judge Truax, nor in Emigrant Industrial Savings Bank <em>v. </em>Goldman, 75 <em>N. Y. </em>125, is it held that, where there are proper allegations, disclosing the claim of the plaintiff, that the title sought to be foreclosed is prior to that of the non-answering defendant, the court is without jurisdiction, and its judgment is void. In the former case it was held that the interest of a mortgagor\u2019s wife is not cut off by judgment of foreclosure, although she be made a party defendant, \u201c without allegations in the complaint that the mortgage is prior, superior or hostile to her interest,\u201d and it is added (syllabus): \u201c Even with such allegations a judgment passing upon her 'rights is erroneous. A foreclosure action is not the proper mode to litigate rights claimed in priority or hostility to the mortgage.\u201d This language must be taken as meaning precisely what it says. The case was one in which the decree was attacked, not collaterally, but directly. It was an appeal from an order in a foreclosure action directing the purchaser to complete his purchase, and the court held (Judge Forger announcing the opinion), not that a judgment passing upon rights claimed in priority or hostility to the mortgage is void, but that it is \u201c erroneous,\u201d or, in other words, voidable by appeal only. This decision, therefore, establishes that the city\u2019s remedy was by appeal, and, so far as it bears upon the questions now pending, tends to prove that the city is in the wrong, not the right. In Emigrant Industrial Savings Bank <em>v. </em>Goldman the decision was, among other things, that: \u201c The plaintiff may make prior incumbrancers parties for the purpose of having the amount ascertained and paid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>out of the proceeds ; but where no such purpose is indicated in the complaint, and no such provision is incorporated in the judgment, the prior lien is not cut off.\u201d This, also, was an appeal, a direct attack, a controversy, in the case itself, as to the distribution of claims to a surplus. The question in the present case, therefore, is not of jurisdiction, but averment. What did the complaint contain ? If it contained averments claiming priority for the claim of the mortgagee over that of the city, the fact-that the court held, as it did, does not constitute a void, but, at the most, an \u201c erroneous \u201d judgment\u2014in our opinion, a correct judgment. Now, when, as against the city, made a defendant because, \u201c it might have or claim an interest in the property recovered and conveyed in the two mortgages mentioned and in the relief demanded in this complaint,\u201d we find the plaintiff averring ; that, at the date of the mortgage, the New York City Central Underground Railway Company was organized under chapter 280 of the Laws of 1868, and chapter 824 of the Laws of 1869, and had \u201c the franchises, rights, -powers, privileges, property and properties granted by said acts,\u201d and also when we find the plaintiff averring that the property conveyed by the mortgage bearing date at a time more than two years after the passage of the Act of 1869, and when, if the work had not been commenced, there were no franchises to mortgage, or, at least, none not forfeitable for breach of condition, embraced the franchises of the company and the right of way ' on, under and through certain streets accepted, defined and located by the company in the maps filed in 1870, 1872 and 1873, as herein-before stated, \u201cwith the right to enter upon, use and occupy the same as granted and authorized in said acts * * * and the railway and tunnels and the constructions for which then made and commenced on said routes and locations,\u201d how can we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>doubt that the city was notified, by proper averments, that the plaintiff did claim that, by the mortgage of the company, there was secured for his .benefit a valid incumbrance on the right of way described, and which right of way was a right to occupy and possess the streets granted by the state of New York, superiorto any right of the city therein ?</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b336-4\"><em>William H. Clark, </em>counsel to the corporation, and <em>Thomas P. Wickes </em>and <em>D. J. Dean, </em>of counsel, on the questions considered in the opinion, argued:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b336-5\">I. Under the complaint in this action and the demand for relief no judgment could be taken by default establishing any right as against the city of New York. The sole scope and object of the action is confined to a foreclosure of the mortgage, sale of the franchises of the mortgagor, the determination of the amount due to the mortgagee, and the application of the avails of the sale to the payment of the sum due him. The plaintiff in the complaint says that the city is made a defendant, because the plaintiff is informed that it might have or claim an interest in the mortgaged property. Having thus admitted an interest existing in the city, the complaint then disclaims any intention to litigate any issue in respect thereto in this action by saying \u201cno claim is made against the mayor, aldermen and commonalty of the city of New York.\u201d The plaintiff, therefore, admits that the city\u2019s interest is paramount and prior, and not subsequent or subordinate to the mortgage. The demand for relief asks: (1) Judgment against the railroad company for $16,800; (2) That the mortgage be foreclosed and the company and all claiming under it foreclosed of any right to issue bonds under the. mortgage, and that the franchise and property of the company be sold, and the proceeds applied to pay the indebtedness to the plaintiff. Under such a complaint, with such a de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>mand for relief, it was obviously improper to determine, as against the city, any fact which might be the subject of possible controversy between the plaintiff and the city. For instance, it was illegal to adjudge as against the city that the plaintiff had fulfilled the condition of its charter, which required the commencement of construction within two years after the passage of the act, or to determine that the route and branches devised by the plaintiff had been lawfully and sufficiently located. Such issues, as against the city, could be lawfully determined only in an action in which the relief sought should be the determination of such issues. The averment of the complaint herein, that no claim or demand was made against the mayor, aldermen and commonalty of the city of New York, precludes any judgment upon such issues. Upon the city\u2019s default to plead, no judgment could be taken more favorable to the plaintiff than the simple foreclosure and sale of the railroad companies\u2019 rights.

In this action to foreclose the mortgage made by the railway company upon its franchises, no question could be litigated which concerned the paramount right of the city to its streets. The action was a mere action of foreclosure; the right of the mayor, aldermen and commonalty in relation to the occupancy of its streets is in no sense subsequent to that of the mortgagor or mortgagee, and, therefore, is not the proper subject of litigation in the foreclosure action. The right of the city which is asserted by it when it controverts the right of the company to construct its' road in the streets, is in the nature of an adverse claim to the title of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>railway company. Such, a claim cannot be tried in the foreclosure of a mortgage made by the company.

Lapse of time more than one year is not sufficient to defeat the application. The error sought to be reviewed is not a mere technical irregularity, which is waived if not sought to be corrected within one year, but is of such a nature that the judgment is unauthorized and voidable, and the error may be corrected at any time. 2 <em>Rumsey Practice, </em>p. 576 (1888); Simonson <em>v. </em>Blake, 12 <em>Abb. </em>331; Park <em>v. </em>Park, 80 <em>N.

Under the circumstances revealed by the record, the public interest represented by the mayor, aldermen and commonalty of the city of New York, will not be prejudiced. by the neglect of the corporation counsel to discern the character of the judgment, nor by his delay make this motion. No <em>laches </em>is chargeable against the corporation counsel, the complaint failing to demand any relief against the mayor, aldermen and commonalty, and, on the other hand, averring that no claim or demand was made against them, justified the corporation counsel in assuming that no judgment would be entered in the action, which would in any degree affect the public interests which he represented. It was not <em>laches, </em>therefore, for him to assume that no issues were settled to the prejudice of the public by the judgment, and further to rely upon the prin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>ciple which precluded the entry of any judgment inconsistent with the complaint, He also had the right to rely upon the fact that if such authorized judgment should be rendered it would be vacated whenever brought to the notice of the court. And even if it could be truly said that the corporation counsel has been neglectful, in that this motion was not sooner made, yet the court will not allow public interests to be prejudiced thereby.

The mortgagor and certain other parties having or claiming liens upon the property, with the mayor, aider-men, &amp;c., of the city of New York, were made parties defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">The complaint alleges the making and execution of the mortgage, allegations as to the liens of the other defendants and the description of the property \u2022described in the mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">The only allegation affecting the respondent is as follows: \u201c The mayor, aldermen and commonalty of the city of New York is made defendant in this action, because the plaintiff was informed it might have a claim or interest in the property covered and conveyed in the two mortgages mentioned and in the relief demanded in this complaint. No claim or demand is made against the said mayor, aldermen and commonalty of the city of New York.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">The relief demanded is that the plaintiff have judgment against said company for the amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>claimed to be due to him; that it be adjudged that the mortgage be foreclosed; that said company and all claiming under it be foreclosed of the right to perform certain agreements set up in the complaint; that the mortgaged franchises and property be sold, and the proceeds of such sale be applied to satisfy the indebtedness due to this plaintiff; that a certain other mortgage described in the complaint be cancelled and discharged of record, the company be restrained from issuing bonds under such mortgage and from encumbering its property, and that the court grant such other and further relief as may be equitable and just in the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">The respondent appeared in the action and demanded service of a copy of the complaint which was duly served upon the counsel for the corporation, but it interposed no answer to the complaint. Subsequently an application was made for judgment, and notice thereof was served upon the counsel .to the corporation. In pursuance of this notice, and so far as appears in the absence of the counsel to the corporation, an order was entered whereby it was ordered and adjudged, that the plaintiff have judgment for the relief demanded in the complaint, and referring it to a referee to take proof of the allegations in the complaint, to ascertain the amount due to the plaintiff and report the facts found by him to the court, and that said referee also take evidence and report upon certain matters referred to in an affidavit of the plaintiff annexed to the notice of the application ; and on the referee\u2019s report, dated the 11th of January, 1876, without further notice to the respondent, judgment was entered directing a sale of the mortgaged premises by a referee.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">In March, 1889, the respondent applied to the court to strike from said judgment each and every other declaration, adjudication or decree contained therein which is in excess of the prayer for relief, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>specifically asked for by the complaint; and this is an appeal from an order of the special term granting such motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">This judgment certainly contains extraordinary provisions. In an action brought to foreclose a mortgage upon a franchise it assumes to adjudicate that the mortgagor had performed all the conditions required by the statute granting the franchise, had commenced the construction of its railway, and owned the right to appropriate a large portion of the streets and parks of the city of New York, which the judgment proceeds to particularly describe, without paying any compensation therefor, and that the purchaser under the sale therein authorized should hold the said mortgaged premises with the right of occupancy, seizure and possession, and with and for the specific uses, rights and powers, as in the order and report of the referee recited and declared, and this judgment was rendered on the default of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">There was no intimation in the complaint that any attempt would be made to obtain an adjudication as to the extent of these rights and franchises, or as to their existence at the time of the commencement of the action, or that any judgment would be asked for affecting in any manner the rights of the city of New York to claim that such rights and franchises had been lost or forfeited, and no such provision in the judgment was necessary to vest in the purchaser at the sale all rights that the railroad company (the mortgagor) had, either at the time of the execution of the mortgage or at the commencement of the action. So far as the city was concerned the only relief that could be given by the judgment was the relief asked for in the complaint. Code of Procedure, \u00a7 275. For it is a general principle necessary to the administration of justice that the complaint must advise the defendant clearly of what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>is claimed. It is not alone the case as made but also the judgment asked for that controls. Swart <em>v. </em>Boughton, 35 <em>Hun, </em>284; Kelly <em>v. </em>Downing, 42 N. <em>Y. </em>72.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">Appellant insists, however, that the adjudication of a fact is no part of the relief which the court grants. That the relief is \u201c the executive action to be taken by the court in accordance with the justice of the cause as required by the facts found. It had no reference whatever to the effect of the judgment by way of estoppel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">As to the facts which must exist to entitle plaintiff to the relief granted, it is clear that granting the relief is an adjudication that such facts exist. Thus, in an action upon a promissory note, a judgment for the plaintiff for the amount, is an adjudication that there was a valid note, a consideration given, and that the whole amount was due and the relief granted would be a judgment that plaintiff recover of defendant the amount. So in this action to grant the relief that was asked for, it was necessary to find, as a fact, that the mortgage was made by defendant, and that there was a certain sum due thereon; and as to those facts the estoppel of the judgment applied. But it was not necessary to entitle plaintiff to such relief to find that the defendant had built a part of the road, or that, in another action to which this defendant was not a party, it had been adjudged that the railroad company had located its road and commenced its construction and owned the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">The existence of those facts not being alleged in the complaint and not being necessary to entitle the plaintiff to the relief for which he had asked, an adjudication as to the existence of those facts had no . relation to the foreclosure of the mortgage, which is the relief demanded in the complaint; and if the court in the judgment made such an adjudication by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>decreeing that such facts did exist, such an adjudication could only be effectual to create an estoppel; and if such effect could be given to it, it would be of itself -relief in addition to that demanded in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">The plaintiff was, therefore, entitled to a judgment appropriating the interest of the mortgagor to the payment of the amount secured by his mortgage, and any interest the city had in the property subsequent to the mortgage, was cut off by the judgment. The city had no answer to a demand for such a judgment and could not have interposed a defence to the action, but any attempt of the court to adjudicate that such rights did exist was, so far as it affected this defendant, without jurisdiction in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">It is settled that, in an action for the foreclosure of a mortgage, the rights of parties'who claim in priority or in hostility to the mortgagor, cannot be litigated, and that a judgment of foreclosure granted by default only affects the interests of those subsequent to the mortgage ; that the decree does not affect rights paramount to those of the mortgagor and the mortgagee.

As was said by the court of appeals in Hatch <em>v. </em>Central Natl. Bank, 78 <em>N. Y. </em>487, \u201c These cases show the power of the court over its own judgments and its habit to exercise it in aid of justice ; and it is an inherent power and not limited in matter or substance by the Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">Nor do I think the application was made too late. The defendant is a municipal corporation and, so far as appears, the judgment was never served upon the law officer of the corporation, and the fact that other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>officers of the corporation had notice of the judgment, or that in any other proceedings the attention of the law officers of the corporation was called to this judgment, did not, under the circumstances, make it improper for the court, in the exercise of its discretion, to amend the judgment. Nor do the rights of third parties require that this application should have been denied. One of the purchasers at the sale by the referee was the plaintiff in the action ; he must be chargeable with knowledge of the irregular form of the judgment, and a purchaser from him can acquire no greater rights than he had. ' The voluminous briefs submitted by the appellants have been considered, but we are satisfied that it would be a gross injustice to the city and to the public to have allowed this judgment as originally entered to stand ; and the court below was right in the exercise of its discretion vested in it in granting the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Order appealed from should be affirmed with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">Sedgwick, Oh.
