This order was entered March 8, 1889. The costs in the action having been taxed, judgment was, on March 12, 1889, entered on said verdict in favor of defendant against plaintiff for such costs; and a copy of the judgment with a notice of its entry was that day served on plaintiff\u2019s attorney. On the 13th of March, 1889, a copy of the aforesaid order of reversal, with a demand for payment of the costs thereby awarded, was served on plaintiff\u2019s attorney. On the 15th day of March, 1889, the costs awarded by the aforesaid order of reversal were taxed at $47.52. On the 25th of March, 1889, defendant\u2019s attorney served on plaintiff\u2019s attorney a notice that the costs awarded by the aforesaid-order of reversal had been taxed at $47.52, and that defendant demanded payment thereof; also that more than ten days having elapsed since the service of said order, and said costs-not having been paid, defendant would at all times insist that all proceedings on the part of the plaintiff in the action were stayed until said costs were paid. On 'the 1st of April, 1889, defendant served a notice of appeal from the aforesaid judgment to the general term. On the next day the notice of appeal was returned, endorsed, \u201c Respectfully returned for the reason that all proceedings on the part of the plaint<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>iff are \"stayed under \u00a7-779 of the Code for non-payment of costs of order entered herein on the 8th of March, 1889.\u201d Plaintiff then moved for an order compelling defendant to receive said notice of appeal. After hearing counsel, the court, at special term, made an order, ordering defendant\u2019s attorney to receive and accept said notice of appeal as of the date of the service thereof on him, to wit: April 1st, 1889. From this order the present appeal is taken.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b244-5\"><em>Edward P.

Kendall, 47 <em>Superior Ct. R. </em>513, \u00a7 779, had been amended by chapter 181 of the laws of 1884, upon which fact the above decision rests.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b242-16\"> The appeal from the judgment was heard at the same term, and decided August 8,1889. <em>(See post.)</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b244-7\">By the Court.\u2014Freedman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYu\">This is an appeal from an order made at special term compelling defendant\u2019s attorney ^o accept a notice of appeal from the judgment in this action, which notice had been ' previously served by plaintiff and returned by defendant\u2019s attorney on the ground that plaintiff\u2019s proceedings were stayed for non-payment of costs of an order under \u00a7 779 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The order awarding such costs was a general term order, which reversed an order made at special term with $10 costs and disbursements of the appeal, and granted defendant\u2019s motion below with $10 costs. There is no claim that the stay, if it existed, has been waived by the defendant. The court below made the order appealed from in deference to the authority of Verplanck <em>v. </em>Kendall, 47 <em>Super. Ct. </em>513. That case was decided in 1880, and at that time section 779 of the Code read as follows: \u2018 Where! costs of a motion, directed by an order to be paid, are hot paid, &amp;c., &amp;m\u201d It was upon this language that it was held by this court that costs of a motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>did not include costs of an appeal from an order. In Phipps <em>v. </em>Carman 26 <em>Hun, </em>518, decided in 1882, the general term of the Supreme Court of the Second Department reached a different conclusion. The conflict between the two .decisions was settled by the passage of chapter 181 of the Laws of 1884, by which section 779 was amended so as to read as follows: \u201c Where costs of a motion, <em>or any other sum of money, </em>directed by an order to be paid, are not paid, &amp;c., &amp;c.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">Under the section, as thus amended, non-payment of any sum of money directed by an order to be paid, is made by law a ground for staying further proceedings in the action on the part of the party thus in default, and the section applies to all orders, irrespective of the question whether they have been made at special or general term. From this it follows that the order appealed from was erroneously made.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">The order must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements to be taxed, such reversal, however, to be without prejudice to the appeal from the judgment heard during this term, provided the plaintiff, within 20 days, pay the said costs and disbursements and the costs as taxed under the former general term order.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">Sedgwick, Ch. J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
